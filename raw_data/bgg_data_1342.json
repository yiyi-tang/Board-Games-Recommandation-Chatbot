    "Description": "When Federated Suns forces stormed into the Draconis Combine during the FedCom Civil War, proud samurai Chu-sa Harold Nakayama and the Forty-Sixth Dieron Regulars deployed to Ashio to repel the invaders. Disaster struck when an all-but-unknown mercenary command slaughtered Nakayama&rsquo;s troops, humiliating him. Nakayama swore an oath to exterminate mercenaries wherever they tainted Combine soil, and gathered around him an independent company whose BattleMechs were anointed by the blood of their MechWarriors in an oath to seek out and destroy mercenary scum. The Jihad provided Nakayama&rsquo;s Blood with rich hunting grounds and the opportunity to strike fear into the hearts of mercenaries operating anywhere near Combine territory.&#10;&#10;Spotlight On: Nakayama&rsquo;s Blood includes a Unit History, Personalities, Personnel Rosters, Mission Tracks, and data for use with all scales of BattleTech play.&#10;&#10;",

From the coastal regions of Virginia and the muddy rivers of the Mississippi Valley to the far flung freezing waters of Alaska&rsquo;s Bering Strait, Union and Confederate navies fought for dominance.&#10;&#10;Dawn of Iron puts you in command of a Civil War-era vessel, or a full squadron of them. Assemble your fleet, engage the enemy, and send them to the bottom!&#10;&#10;The 24-page Dawn of Iron rulebook includes all the rules you'll need to play in a concise 15-pages with diagrams and illustrations. There's also a few pages dedicated to open sea and coastal battlefields that you will fight on (riverine coming soon!) and four general play missions that should get you sailing in no time!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the deep woods of Timber Heights comes the silent big game hunter, Henry &quot;Grizzly&quot; Greenwood. With his sturdy long rifle, near limitless supply of bear traps and a loyal pack of wolfhounds by his side, Henry has collected many trophies in his career and has now set his iron sights on more challenging prey.&#10;&#10;The Grizzly Greenwood posse is one of corral and control. Greenwood's bear traps make his targets think twice about taking their next step, while his wolves can pounce and maul their prey, keeping them in one vulnerable location for Henry to pick off at a safe distance with his rifle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The bug city of Basin Quarter has been infested by pests from the &quot;Hive&quot; syndicate. Players are spider detectives moving through the city to capture these pests.&#10;&#10;Each round, dice are rolled to generate a small pool of movement options. Players simultaneously move their spiders on the board, drawing threads along their path. When an area is bounded by threads, it becomes a webbed area that can be used to catch pests.&#10;&#10;Each pest requires a specific condition to be caught, such as web size or spider position. Players must plan their paths carefully, and decide what targets to pursue or abandon.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained through the capture of these pests, as well as a varied number of side objectives. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Recreate the Air War over the European theater of World War II as part of the epic clash between the Allies and Germans in some of the most historic battles of World War II, during the years 1941-1945.&#10; Eagles Over Europe is a historical boardgame where players take the roles of US Army Airforce and the RAF (including the Polish pilots, of course!) to participate in WWII's most famous battles, including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra, and the Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge).  You'll also deal with the bombing campaign, as Mustangs and Thunderbolts try to protect the B-17s from hordes of Luftwaffe fighters. &#10;Eagles Over Europe includes over 15 battle scenarios, all fought out on a huge, 140 cm x 100 cm game board (55&quot; x 39&quot;). Each scenario recreates the historical objectives of the two sides, and includes special events that impacted the battle's outcome.&#10;Eagles Over Europe is designed to be easy-entry, but the game mechanics require strategic card play and finding skillful combinations between the dice, the symbols on the cards, and pilot abilities. In addition to the huge gameboard, Eagles over Europe includes detailed airplane miniatures, beautifully illustrated Combat cards, Scenario, Event and Pilot cards. Special Terrain tiles and Custom dice complete the &quot;wow&quot; people will feel when they open the box. &#10;Those familiar with the &quot;303 Squadron&quot; game will recognize the core game mechanics but enjoy additions like Flak, RADAR, ground attack, and many more. But you don't have to have 303 Squadron to play Eagles Over Europe-- it is a totally free-standing game. &#10;Eagles Over Europe is designed as a co-operative game for 1 - 4 players. The average game length is between 60 and 90 minutes. Each scenario includes innovative and clever mechanics, dynamic gameplay, and startling surprises...all &quot;normal&quot; for Eagles Over Europe!&#10;&#10;",

Many of these new cards are marked with a Challenge Icon, to be easily identified as extra dangerous.&#10;&#10;Challenge Packs reward players for having a robust collection of Enemies and Expansions; and contain several Threat cards that include a mix of various Enemies from across the game.

For two more years, the greatest army ever forged by humankind would wage a planetby-planet war for the heart of the League itself, ultimately landing on mankind's homeworld of Terra.

    "Description": "Inns &amp; Outcast is a 3-8 player card game set in a high fantasy setting. Players take on the role of adventurers who&rsquo;ve completed their quest, and now are undergoing the process of divvying up loot scored during their epic undertaking. Characters clash in constant combat for coinage each round. The game is set in the recently rebranded City of Destiny&trade;. A bustling boomtown transformed from the tiny hamlet of Po&rsquo;Dunk. Where there was once a village on the verge of collapse, now stands a thriving metropolis filled to the brim with hustlers and cons. It has become the go-to place for every Hero, Villain, and Mercenary looking to find their place in the world and is in fact the number one tourist trap. The city&rsquo;s ever-changing population leaves only its world-famous hospitality service in its wake. The only permanent fixture of the city being its Inns &amp; Outcasts.&#10;&#10;Players start each turn by simultaneously placing a card face down, then counting up initiatives from 1-6. Once a card&rsquo;s initiative is called, all cards of that initiative are revealed. Players make short decisions regarding the specifics of their abilities, then proceed until all cards are shown. When all cards are revealed, special abilities kick in which allows players to add coins to their personal hoard.&#10;&#10;Players can make income either through their starting gold (a fixed amount of gold determined by each character card) or through their special abilities. Special abilities can come in the form of reveal effects &ndash; which happen instantly, or through loot abilities which compound at the end of each turn. Loot abilities are high-risk, high reward as they can often be blocked by other cards. Once a card is played, it stays out until 5 turns have gone by, allowing all players to refresh their hands. It&rsquo;s a game about reading your opponents and the situation at hand to make big gains while slowing down your opponents.&#10;&#10;The player having the most money at the end of the game being the winner. The game ends once a player crosses a threshold of currency, which is determined by group size &ndash; but just because you&rsquo;re the first over the line doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a win.&#10;&#10;",
