The 36 double-sided tiles are divided among all the players. The tiles make up the octopus arms. There are two levels. In the beginners&rsquo; game, the players match up the colors. The purple ovals start a new arm. The arm is completed when a hand is placed down. The winner is the first player to lay down all of his or her tiles.  The advanced game is the same, only the players match up the number side of the tiles. An arm will start with a blank.&#10;&#10;",

During the night phase of the game, the Werewolves choose an innocent to kill.

Players are eliminated until either all Werewolves are killed or the Werewolves outnumber the Villagers.&#10;&#10;Werewolf In Town is partially derived from the original game called &quot;Mafia&quot; which was later given a Werewolf theme, and is being presented on The Game Crafter for the first time with all new, original 8-Bit style artwork and brand new rule variants for you and your group to enjoy. Also included on the cards is something missing from most productions of this game: explanations of the roles. No more running to the rulebook when you get a role you haven't had before or having to expose the fact that you have a unique role because you don't know how it works!&#10;&#10;Also included are some Blank Cards for you to experiment with your own new roles to liven up the game play after you have mastered what is in the box!&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of a King, three Knights, and the same playing field used in the game Nine Men's Morris.&#10;&#10;The Knights attempt to corner the King, and the King attempts to avoid capture until landing on one of the points originally occupied by a Knight, or, in a variant, for a set number of turns.&#10;&#10;NINE MAN MORRIS&#10;&#10;Each player has nine playing pieces. The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.&#10;&#10;In the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three. Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three. Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice. When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three. As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.&#10;&#10;",

What also adds to the fun is the deteriorating turn sequence. Play commences with the turns switching regularly between both sides, but as the battle develops and armies become fully engaged, the turn sequence becomes more and more fickle.&#10;&#10;As players would expect, the rules contain details of a large array of weapons, armour and equipment as well as extensive vehicle data and vehicle construction rules. Also included is wide-ranging background material that details the main warring factions and the cities and terrain that they fight over.&#10;&#10;OVERKILL&#10;also features a large section on campaign games which deal with army progression, promotion, recruitment, training and experience as well as details on trading, currency, intelligence gathering, propaganda, infiltrating, hiring mercenaries and executions! In addition to this OVERKILL also includes complete rules for solo gaming and seven scenarios for solo games.&#10;&#10;At heart, OVERKILL is a fast, simple and exciting rule system backed up by high levels of detail that allows players to expand the game in different and interesting directions. The rules require the clever use of weapons and tactics, command and strategy - and a bit of luck. Victory will go to the skilful player - not just the one with the biggest guns - although there are plenty of them in OVERKILL!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A dice and cards tennis 'simulation'. Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.&#10;&#10;The 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).&#10;&#10;The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a &quot;6&quot; (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the &quot;hit glorious and impossible winning shot&quot; (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;2 D6&#10;2 die shakers&#10;pack of 52 cards &#10;drawstring bag&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Panzer Grenadier: Workers &amp; Peasants&#10;&#10;Taken by surprise on the morning of 22 June 1941, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants reeled under Nazi attacks. By the end of the Great Patriotic War, 5.1 million Soviet soldiers would have been killed in action, and another 1.1 million died of wounds suffered in combat.&#10;&#10;Yet it was the Soviet soldier who raised the hammer and sickle over the ruins of the enemy capital. The Red Army remained in the field despite massive losses, refusing to admit defeat until Berlin lay at their feet and Adolf Hitler's murderous Thousand Year Reich had been destroyed.&#10;&#10;Workers &amp; Peasants is a 64-page book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series based on the battles of 1941 and 1942, when the Soviet Union appeared on the verge of defeat. There are 20 scenarios, or separate game situations, most of them much larger than those found in our Eastern Front or Road to Berlin boxed games.&#10;&#10;There are also the background articles you've come to expect from an Avalanche Press book, this time focused on the Red Army's troops, weapons and organization. It's the perfect companion piece to our most popular Panzer Grenadier game, the huge Eastern Front Deluxe Edition.&#10;&#10;This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of any Eastern Front Deluxe Edition is required to play some of the scenarios and Road to Berlin, Sinister Forces, Elsenborn Ridge and Battle of the Bulge to play all of them.&#10;&#10;(text from Manufacturer's homepage)&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Now, ten years later, these designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, as the Inner Sphere once more finds itself at war!&#10;&#10;Fully updated to circa 3070, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade - launches these designs into the current time frame, including notable MechWarriors/crews, as well as new variants. Additionally, a battle armor section has been included, providing full Classic BattleTech stats, and updating the histories for these twenty venerable designs.&quot;&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This upgrade volume is one of a series of Upgrade titles produced to provide new material for gamers and collectors, rather than replacing the original Technical Readout upon which they're based. The Technical Readout 3058 Upgrade is a companion volume to the Technical Readout: 3058, rather than a replacement. Although the two may seem similar the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material. Both volumes share a cover, although this volume has the word &quot;Upgrade&quot; marked in the lower-right hand corner of the front cover.&#10;&#10;",

Each Weapon Deck includes weapons and ammo of a particular type, while the Master Deck includes the game's armor, gear, and action cards.&#10;&#10;Players accumulate cards in their hand and in their Resource Pile.  Cards played from a player's hand have a resource cost (usually from 1-10) that indicates the number of cards the player's Resource Pile must contain in order to play that card.  Players may draw cards from their Resource Piles at any time, but may not put cards from their hands onto their Resource Piles.&#10;&#10;A player's turn has two phases: a Main Phase and a Combat Phase.  Each phase has different allowable effects.  The Main Phase is generally used by the player to play equipment cards and ready for combat, while the Combat Phase is when the player engages other player.&#10;&#10;May the greatest fragger win!&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to subdue your obsession by satisfying her every need in three different categories: romance, morality, and will.&#10;&#10;Your requirements in each category are represented by the numbers and symbols on the bottom of every card. You will use a stunning variety of objects, costumes, romantic locations, and humorous events to wear down her resistance until you achieve the goal of every Hard Furry Pet: the conquest! Because of their inherently different natures, Hard Furry Pets and Moralizers must use different numbers and abilities.&#10;&#10;The first player to fully satisfy the needs of his obsession and complete his conquest is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In not too distant future a graveyard filled with dinosaur bones is found. A scientific breakthrough allows researchers, to restore the full DNA map of 30 different dinosaurs. In Dino Business players are investors building a dinosaur theme park on an island.&#10;&#10;The island is divided by rivers into three parts, each part consists of nine or seven areas, that can hold one type of dinosaur. Only one part of the island is available at a time. The game has three phases, after each of which a scoring takes place. Each phase consists of a variable number of turns, until every area on the island part is occupied. Each turn begins by randomly setting up the market for the turn. On the market players take turns purchasing three different DNA that is coloured glass beads and dinosaur tiles, which show the type and amount of DNA needed to rescurrect the dinosaur. Anytime a player has everything he needs for resurrection he pays the DNA and places a dinosaur of his colour on an empty area.&#10;&#10;Players score points for not only the dinosaurs they rescurrected, but also by having their dinosaurs on adjacent areas. The player with most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
