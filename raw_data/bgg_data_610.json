Consequently the battle, for its scale, had more violence and finality than the typical WWII action, and more clearing of hexes than we are likely to see in a single turn of Europa. The battle thus serves to demonstrate the need for some special rules to address such a situation, and provides a small test case for &quot;designer's choice&quot; rules suggestions...&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But human nature has not changed at all and even new rich people live in colonies where populations continue a silent struggle for ultimate power. In Universo, players build galactic civilizations by exploiting the ways of politics, the strength of armies, the simplicity of religion and the inevitability of the economy. By using action cards of 4 powers each player can conquer the inhabited planets and interact with other players to gain the absolute control of the known systems.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the summer of 1918, Turkey created its &ldquo;Army of Islam&rdquo; con-sisting of the 5th, 15th Divisions, later the 10th also joined. Having been defeated in Palestine, the Turks looked for easier prey and this was the Trancaucasus-Caspian area of Azerbaijan. This newly formed country asked Turkey for protection from the Bolsheviks, which also wanted the area. The Reds were defeated in late June but they remained in control of Baku until mid July. Turkey, like the British, saw Baku&rsquo;s worth in its oil and ordered its army to march hundreds of miles to seize it despite Germany&rsquo;s strong protests (who wanted it also through political means). By the end of July, the Turks were fast approaching Baku. This prompted the British to send Dunsterforce, 1000 men, to Baku, all arrived in the nick of time. The situation for the British was dire from the start. In manpower, the odds were 10 to 1 in favor of the Turks!&#10;&#10;",

Valu - The Game of Survival is a abstract 2 to 4 player Game of Strategy based on Traditional Pacific island warrior culture.&#10;&#10;The object of Valu is to take all of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces or to create situation where your opponent/s pieces are unable to move and are forced to surrender.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of 96 light green and dark squares (= four islands), 36 light and dark blue squares (= ocean) and 28 light yellow and orange squares (= beach). Opposing pieces (= Clan), red, green, blue and/or yellow are initially lined up on the sides.&#10;&#10;The game has similarities to checkers. All pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture or develop their positions. Capturing occurs when a piece is able to jump over of an opposing piece into an empty space. Capturing is mandatory and jumping/capturing more than one piece on turn is possible. Time between moves is limited and has to be mutually agreed before start of play (1 - 5 minutes). Player must decide the move before touching any of the piece and complete the move immediately. If piece is touched but not moved, it is then sacrificed and removed from the board. Each player has four Chiefs and eight Warrior/Elder pieces. Each type of piece has a slight variation on its form of movement:&#10;&#10;- Chiefs are the most powerful pieces. They can move both backward and forward and move to any area on the board that is in play. Chiefs are allowed to jump over their own pieces, but only if the square adjacent to it is vacant. When jumping over your own piece the piece remains in play, however if playing in teams the team member&rsquo;s piece being jumped over is sacrificed and removed from board.&#10;&#10;- Warriors can only capture and move in a forward direction. They cannot move onto another island apart from the island it started on or the island directly opposite. Warrior reaching the opposite island is immediately made an Elder (by being turned upside down).&#10;&#10;- Elders can move forward or backwards and can move to all board areas that are in play. They cannot jump their own pieces or, if playing in a team, they cannot jump their team mate&rsquo;s piece&#10;&#10;Valu can be played as two, three of four with only a minor variation of the rules.&#10;&#10;",

Another player tries to kidnap one of the ladies. This is done by rolling six dice. Now both the guard and the potential kidnapper try to calculate a result of six from the die rolls by using multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. If the kidnapper manages this first, he gets a lady. If the guard is faster, the kidnapper has to say something in a ridiculous high eunuch's voice and it's the next kidnapper's turn. When all the ladies are gone, the player with most ladies is the winner.&#10;&#10;A memory variant and a &quot;Turbanspiel&quot; (turban game) are also described in the rule book.&#10;&#10;",

When a player is required to draw a card from their Supply (deck) but cannot because it is empty, the player immediately loses the game. For each damage a player takes through attacks or card effects, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (discard pile).&#10;&#10;The game features the tried and tested &quot;Clash Game System&quot; created by Andreas Propst, which features 3 major characteristics:&#10;&#10;a) Deck depletion as the primary win condition.&#10;b) A resource system in which you will be building stacks of resource cards to play your non-Resource cards onto&#10;c) Different Zones for different types of cards with specific implications on the cards, depending on which zone they are in&#10;&#10;Build up your industry, construct spaceships to attack your opponents or to defend against enemy attacks, train&#10;personnel like ship crews, researchers, diplomats and spies, research new technology or try to dominate through diplomacy &#10;or dodgy schemes and political intrigue.&#10;&#10;The possibilities in Space Clash are countless...&#10;&#10;Which race will you choose?&#10;&#10;The versatile and inventive Terrans, who are able to adapt well to any challenge they might face?&#10;&#10;The reptilian warrior race of the Skaargans, with their supreme ability to construct, mend and salvage?&#10;&#10;The dodgy and scheming Intrazi, who have perfected the art of telepathy, becoming the masters of secrets?&#10;&#10;Or the ancient and mysterious Attrayids who are rather passive but excell in gathering wisdom and knowledge?&#10;&#10;Choose your race and lead it to victory by carefully planning your strategy and making the best use of the their&#10;unique strenghtes and abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Apart from that you can also initiate an &quot;Outgrowth&quot; of one of your Corals onto an opponent's one. This way you can catch him unawares and while reducing his Coral a bit you can grow yours much larger.&#10;&#10;A player also has 4 Shrimps which he must use to &quot;occupy&quot; his Corals by to be able to &quot;feed&quot; them to his Parrotfish. Thse Shrimps also protect the Corals in a small way, adding to their strength.&#10;&#10;Last but not least, 30 Special cards can be bought and used throughout the game to give special bonuses or impose penalties upon players.

    "Description": "In the years before the Civil War, Ohio exploded with railroad fever. At the crossroads between the East Coast and the newly opened lands to the west, Ohio was a magnet for speculators and promoters. Between 1832, when the first railroad was chartered in Ohio, and the Civil War, hundreds of companies were chartered in the state. The 25 companies in the game represent but a small portion of those companies.&#10;&#10;While many giants imprinted their name on the period, the early railroad era was beset with recessions, panics, and bursting bubbles. 18OH puts players in the role of railroad entrepreneurs trying to amass fortunes during those heady times. As a budding mogul you open new companies, buy and sell stock in your own and other players&rsquo; companies, and operate your company for--hopefully!--immense profits. The winner is the player with the highest net worth (cash and stock) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;18OH is a member of the 18xx family of railroad-related economic games.&#10;&#10;During its development the game was named 18io.&#10;&#10;",
