    "Description": "Mafiosi: Bluffing Deckbuilder is a deckbuilding bluffing games. Players will start the game with weaker cards, but those cards can be used to accumulate coins that can be spent to add more powerful cards to their deck. The trick is that all of the cards are initially played face down: players declare what card they are playing. If no one challenges the declaration, the player gets the effect of the card they declared. But if there is a challenge, the player who is incorrect is punished.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most influence when all of the elite mafia cards are purchased. Influence is given by the number of elite mafia cards in your deck as well as the amount of power that you retain (power can be lost if you are caught lying or attacked by other players).&#10;&#10;The pool of cards in the shop varies game by game; 5 elite card roles are chosen (2 cards per role) and 4 mafia card roles are chosen (4 cards per role). Player decks start with two civilians and one thug, but they can use those cards to purchase more powerful mafiosi like soldato, capo, consigliere or criminals such as drug dealers, racketeers, or arson, or bribed officials such as police officers or politicians.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alfonso X, who was called the Wise or the Astrologer, ruled Castile and Leon in the XIII century. He was an extraordinary monarch: being engaged in the publication of laws and economy, poetry and writing, he was also obsessed with stars.&#10;At the very beginning of his reign, Alfonso X invited the best astronomers and asked them to compile detailed astronomical tables with coordinates of celestial objects. The Alfonsine tables laid the foundation for scientific works of Copernicus and revolution in astronomy.&#10;In 1283 under his leadership the translation of the Arabic composition &ldquo;Libro de los Juegos&rdquo; (&ldquo;Book of games&rdquo;) was completed into Spanish and this brought chess and many other board games from East to Europe. Among the translated rules were &ldquo;astronomical games&rdquo;. One of them is right in front of you.&#10;&#10;In the game Astrum you will become stargazers who make up the atlas of the starry sky commissioned by Alfonse X Astrologer.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to fill your personal playing board with figures of various constellations so as to satisfy the requirements of the enlightened king.&#10;Each board is divided into 4 colored sectors, which corresponds to one of the stacks of constellation figures. By placing a figure on one of colored sectors at your board, you determine the color for figure that the next player will take. However, he is also free to place this figure anywhere on his board.  &#10;Each figure combines several bright stars on the board and has 1 or 2 external connections, allowing you to continue the constellation. When you finish the constellation (it has no longer open external connections), you get victory points by the number of bright stars in it.&#10;&#10;When one of figures&rsquo; pile ends, all players lay out a new pack and complete the round. At the end of rounds 1, 3, and 5, King Alfonso pays a visit to astronomers and checks their work.  Before the start of the game, players open cards of King&rsquo;s vagaries, which determine the conditions for obtaining victory points in the rounds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card shows 5 fields with dice printed in them. Some fields offer chances to gain points, others are traps and have to be avoided. Players score by being fast in putting down a line of 10 dice in 10 different colurs by placing them cleverly under theeir two cards.&#10;To start the game, the 66 coloured dice are cast. Then the players play simultaneously. Each player grabs 10 dice one by one and forms his line of 10 dice in 10 different colours. As speed is a decisive factor players tend to make mistakes when arranging their dice and get trapped by the trap fields. This, of course, is part of the fun and motivates to do less mistakes in the next playthrough.&#10;There are 2 versions of the game: an easier one with two levels for players from age 8 ++, which is called &quot;Farbenspiel&quot;, and a version and an even more challenging version with 4 levels for players from age 12 ++ (called &quot;Etappenspiel&quot;).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "AND HUNGARY, 1945&hellip; The Red Army have invaded and pushed the Axis forces back west, driving them beyond the Danube river. Budapest is under siege, its garrison is trapped and fighting a desperate battle. To save them and secure the borders of the Reich, the Axis armies launch three relief operations. Unable to break through, a larger offensive is planned for the spring. Utilising the last of the panzer divisions, Operation Spring Awakening will try to drive the Red Army back over the Danube and secure Germany's remaining oil supply without it, the war will be over.&#10;&#10;BACKGROUND A general overview of the war in Hungary in 1945, viewed by the Germans as their priority front line. From the siege of Budapest, through relief Operations Konrad I, II and III, to Operation Spring Awakening and the large Russian counter-offensive that would drive Russian tanks all the way to Vienna.&#10;&#10;ARMY LIST Designed to be used with the Russian army lists already published in Battlegroup Fall of the Reich, this book contains two new army lists, for the last German panzer divisions and the Hungarian army, as well as alterations to the Russian Fall of the Reich army lists, to better recreate the battles in Hungary in the winter and spring of 1945.&#10;&#10;SPECIAL RULES New special rules to adapt the core Battlegroup game to the Hungarian battlefields of 1945. The special rules recreate the character of the armoured clash, with the last of Germany's panzer forces, SS and Heer, aided by their rather unreliable Hungarian allies, to face the powerful Russian Tank Corps. All take place in the winter snows and spring thaw mudbath, in the largest clash of late-war heavy armour. This book requires Battlegroup Fall of the Reich to use in full, including its Battle Rating counters.&#10;&#10;CAMPAIGN Six new historical scenarios in a detailed narrative campaign for 1st SS Panzer Division's hard-fought assault along the rviz canal during Operation Spring Awakening.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are four types of cards that players must get acquainted with in Magmell: Unit Cards, Magic Cards, Crystal Cards, and Other Cards. Creating a deck that has a balance of all four types is critical to success.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can draw cards, play resource Crystals, summon units, activate spells, and engage in battle. During combat, the attacked player has the ability to choose who their defenders are, giving them some control over how each combat round plays out. Opponents alternate back and forth, taking turns and engaging in the aforementioned turn options until one of their life pools reaches 0.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kaiserfahrt nach Palastina (&quot;Imperial Journey to Palestine&quot;) is a typical spin and move mechanism based board game about traveling, but unique for historical theme (travel to Holy Land) and valuable components.&#10;&#10;Before, during and after the second journey of the German Emperor Wilhelm II (ruled 1888-1918) in the Ottoman Empire in 1898 a wide variety of media and entertainment articles were produced and brought onto the market in order to publicize the trip, to benefit from it in any way or at least to make it understandable.&#10;&#10;1846-1931 testifies: &raquo;Our emperor's journey to the Orient, as the most significant event of the past year, was still lively for the minds. All serious patriots could not think of this great and, in some ways, dangerous undertaking by the beloved ruling couple and their happy ending without a deep movement. All kinds of details of the trip, such as the importance of the whole company at home and abroad, kept the heads busy.&#10;It is therefore not surprising that the publisher and &raquo;Royal Court Printing Company Adolph H. Engel, founded in 1848, took the opportunity to on the occasion of the imperial journey and the company's 50th anniversary, a board game under the name &raquo;Imperial Journey to Palestine. &#10;The publisher was thus in line with the times. The first travel board games were created around 1800 in England and the USA. As so-called running games with obstacles, the course of which was determined by dice, they were based on the classic board game, the type of didactic goose game that has been known for centuries and has existed in countless variations, which was thematically mostly historically or geographically oriented. Now, on a mostly foldable, but still stable game pad, views of cities, landscapes, monuments and other sights were graphically depicted more or less elaborately along an itinerary and designed into a course on which the players replay a corresponding trip with all its amenities and dangers and after could experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bashnya or Bust! is a collection of fictional scenarios for IABSM set on the late war Eastern Front as part of the Kaunas Offensive. Soviet forces are attempting to drive through German defences in the Chera valley in order to break through into Germany itself, the Germans are trying to stop them.&#10;&#10;The pack contains thirty-one individual scenarios set up in a five-step pyramid campaign i.e. scenario 1 leads to either scenario 2A or 2B; the result of this second game leads to one of scenarios 3A, 3B, 3C or 3D; and so on until scenarios 5A to 5P.&#10;&#10;Although written as a fictional campaign booklet, no two scenarios are the same: each is unique and is also designed to be played as an individual game. Each of the three briefings for each scenario (Umpire, Soviet player, German player) contains enough background to give the game the same sort of context as with the background to an historical scenario.&#10;&#10;Bashnya or Bust! is deliberately designed to give players who don't have enough time to write their own scenarios a huge number of games that they can play with little or no preparation at all. All you have to do is print out the three briefings, set up the table according to the map, make up the deck from the list of required cards, break out the figures and dice, and start the first turn. You don't even need to print the pack out in full: just the pages you need for the scenario you're going to play.&#10;&#10;The campaign is structured so that you&rsquo;ll get maximum use of the standard forces presented in Vpered Na Berlin, with well-designed and balanced scenarios for IABSM, or indeed any company level rule set you happen to game with. Anyone who has a company-sized force of Germans and Soviets for late war, eastern front should already have enough figures to play any or all of the games.&#10;&#10;Bashnya or Bust! follows on from the popular Vyazma or Bust! and Blenneville or Bust! campaign/scenario packs, also available from the TooFatLardies.&#10;&#10;Bashnya or Bust! contains an introduction, details of the campaign structure and forces involved, sixteen different maps (some games are played across the same terrain, albeit in a different direction), thirty-one different scenarios, and a collection of templates allowing you to print off Blind markers as appropriate.&#10;&#10;Please note, whilst this is a PDF product, you don&rsquo;t need to print this out like a book (although you can if you wish): Bashnya or Bust! is designed to allow you to just print the scenarios as you use them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players will roll dice, explore tiles, collect treasure and fight enemies.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a deck of 35 cards, players will shuffle the deck then place all cards face down, forming 5 rows with 7 cards each. Players start on the spacecraft card. Your objective is to collect the six star rings and return to the spacecraft.&#10;&#10;The first player will roll three action dice. These dice can be spent to move or attack. Flip over each card when moving to reveal any star rings or enemy encounter cards. If an encounter card is revealed, players end their movement on this card and must place the appropriate number of enemies. Roll enemy dice and place them on the furthest card in the direction of the arrows. The value rolled is the enemies health. Players can continue using any unspent action dice to move and attack as normal. At the end of either players turn, all enemy dice will move one card closer to the active player, if any enemy dice are adjacent to the player they will attack for one damage each, spin down the player die to track health. If either player&rsquo;s health is reduced to zero, game over.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fog on the Somme is a simulation of the first stage of the German Spring Offensive codenamed Operation Michael which took place in March 1918. The battle was the opening of a series of offensives by the German Army intended to force the Allies to sue for peace. The game is intended to simulate the interaction of ground and air elements during the offensive and the effect that aerial support exerted upon this battle.&#10;&#10;The German player must capture as much ground as possible while taking as few losses as possible. Meanwhile the British must allocate reserves and airpower resources to slow down the German advance as much as possible by forcing the German player to pay heavier costs for their territorial gains.&#10;&#10;The game uses a number of novel mechanisms to represent the attritional combat of the First World War and has been ran at several events including Connections UK Conference.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Under the reign of the wise and noble Sea-Kings, all the creatures of the sea lived in peace and serenity.&#10;But one day everything changed...the Cold Waters of the North Ocean rushed into the warm waters of Aquatica causing underwater volcanoes to erupt! Immediate and strong climate changes brought unexpected consequences. &#10;The citizens of Aquatica were surprised to learn that the polar seas were also full of life - unusual and unfamiliar. They had no idea that several Northern nations had also discovered the wealth and prosperity of Aquatica. And they are ready to fight for resources.&#10;The Royal City is reduced in ashes after the volcanic eruptions, and panic is everywhere. Unfortunately the four brave Sea-Kings who started the fight for the Crown of Aquatica didn&rsquo;t pay attention to reports about weird creatures in the outskirts of the Empire... And so The Polar Invasion begins!&#10;The Aquatica: Cold Waters expansion adds several modules including a new location type, new Ocean&rsquo;s creatures cards, and an alternative mechanic that replaces the goal track in the base game. It also includes all necessary components for a fifth player!&#10;&#10;",

The 72 picture cards contain a multitude of pointers to these. The purpose of the game is to recognize the visual stimuli and make sayings out of them.&#10;The box contains four very different games which are based on this simple principle. Depending on which game you choose, one of the following skills will be primarily required: imagination, wit, memory or speed. And if you can add a sense of humour to the game, then you will always be in amongst the winners, whatever your final score!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Sarge fights to keep his team alive, Lucky keeps an eye on his rabbit&rsquo;s foot, Sweep never loses a soldier to a minefield... and no soldier takes a shot until the spotlight is on him. 12 men, 2 squads, 6 minutes, and no mercy: these are ARMY DUDES.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be played with the classic green army figures, and puts players in control of action movie-like squads filled with characters like &ldquo;Brick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sarge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hotshot.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve been wanting to release a small-sides tactics game for a long time, said Army Dudes designer Drake Sherwood. The game is designed to be easy to learn and easy to play, but still offer a lot of tactical depth and decision-making. We wanted this to be a fun, playful experience with lots of replay value.&#10;&#10;Players will have to stop by a dollar store or toy store to pick up some green army figures, and make use of whatever they have for terrain, said Sherwood. He thinks the game will have a nostalgic aspect for many players. I think the experience will remind a lot of players of games they made up as children -- except your friend can&rsquo;t change the rules on you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In 1808, Sweden invaded Norway with the aim of capturing what was then a province in Denmark. In 1814, Sweden invaded again, this time encouraged by the Treaty of Kiel, which had given them control of Norway on account of Denmark being on the losing side of the war. Norway, in the meantime, had declared independence and written their own constitution. The result of the ensuing battles were a stalemate, but Norway, exhausted by warfare and starvation, had to accept a personal union with the King of Sweden as the Head of State.&#10;&#10;The game is a low-complexity wargame, with units representing companies of infantry, batteries of artillery and squadrons of dragoons and cavalry. The game map covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Halden to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo) and Trondheim, the Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

First published from October 1994 to October 1997 (issues #1 to #13 of the Naval SITREP), the twenty-plus year old articles have been updated the current edition of the rules. Some articles that covered then-new foreign platforms have also been updated to current statistics, so that the reader can compare what we knew at that time with our current intelligence.

The various tribes that make up your warband are all drawn from history and folklore, with special abilities and available gear that reflect this.

It deliberately moves away from competitive play, and instead is focused on an ongoing campaign where the cast of characters encounter new challenges each game.&#10;Character creation is completely open-ended and freeform, with each character tailored to match their miniature and concept. &#10;Likewise, scenarios are intended to have objectives that can change as the characters meet, fight, negotiate and explore. Rather than list-building and point-scoring, the game is instead meant to encourage creativity and picaresque storytelling.&#10;&#10;As well as using dice rolls to resolve actions, each character uses a deck of playing cards to track injuries suffered, blood loss, degradation of virtue and expenditure of willpower. Whilst using a simple framework, the mechanics have room to be customised so that a wide variety of characters can all play in different and interesting ways.&#10;&#10;Gameplay tends towards fairly low lethality; killing enemy characters is difficult, but combat is useful as it allows you to injure (and so weaken) enemies, and lets you control the tempo of the game. This control of the tempo of the game so you can react to your opponent's moves or preempt their strategy is key to success; by the time blows are exchanged there's probably been a great deal of maneuvering and negotiation.&#10;&#10;The book contains:&#10;&#10;     Basic rules for movement, shooting, fighting, magic, and other actions.&#10;     Special rules for duels, jousts, taking prisoners and so on.&#10;     Guidelines for character creation, including various character archetypes.&#10;     A medieval armoury to equip characters with, ranging from simple weapons and armour, legendary weapons, different mounts, and stranger equipment.&#10;     Various example special abilities for characters, such as fighting styles, the authority of noblewomen, and supernatural gifts. Likewise, a selection of example spells from schools such as enchantment, necromancy, vivimancy, shamanism, theurgy, infernalism and alchemy.&#10;     14 sample characters and 15 example monsters.&#10;     Guides to scenario design.&#10;     Various sidebars spotlighting different aspects of the setting, such as woodwoses, knightly orders, marquesses and hermits.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Half the Battle is a tactical game of positioning pieces and making difficult choices, with characters inspired by Dungeons and Dragons. All moves and actions are open, and each player has broadly the same opportunities and options, so you win or lose on the strength of your choices not the roll of the dice. The gameplay involves very little luck at all, using dice to track hitpoints and available actions but not for rolling outcomes. With the addition of some randomly chosen items from the bag of holding, there's just enough luck to keep things interesting without overpowering the satisfaction of a well-executed strategy.&#10;&#10;Players control a party of adventurers, each of which is unique and useful in different situations. Their three to five abilities are given on a card, and their position on a simple linear track is marked with a token. A die placed on this token marks the character's hitpoints, which also control which of those abilities is available for use. In each round of play, each player selects a character in turn and then gets to use that chosen character, again in turn. This means the first player gets freedom of action, but the second gets more information to work with.&#10;&#10;So players must constantly balance offensive and defensive tactics while thinking about positioning and counter-moves. Characters have devastating spells and weapons but can only use their most powerful when on full health, or in a spectacularly fatal and final move. But beware - each party is also allied with a monstrous beast with its own unique skills that ramp up as the battle escalates.&#10;&#10;After all, knowing the game is only Half the Battle...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Renegade Scout.&#10;&#10;What is Renegade Scout? Other than 179 pages jammed full of gaming goodness?&#10;&#10;Renegade Scout is very old:&#10;&#10;     It is a &ldquo;retro-clone&rdquo; of the venerable Rogue Trader game rules many of us grew up on, offering mechanics that are familiar and well-loved to fight fantastical battles between brave heroes, terrible monsters and strange space aliens.&#10;     You can even grab your original figures right off the shelf and battle it out, using the conversion rules presented in the back.&#10;&#10;&#10;Renegade Scout is very new:&#10;&#10;     This isn&rsquo;t a simple copy with a new lick of paint.&#10;     Everything has been updated and rewritten to play in a way that feels modern and elegant, removing the clumsy and awkward to keep the game moving and exciting. &#10;&#10;&#10;Renegade Scout is open to playing the game your way.&#10;&#10;     You can grab almost any figures you already own. We&rsquo;ve included profiles for 15 alien species, several human troop types and monsters. &#10;     You can customize your own heroes and roll up random equipment and skills.&#10;     If you like how they do, you can level them up across multiple games, at least as long as you can keep them alive.&#10;     If you like to play campaigns, we include tools for two different approaches.&#10;     If you like vehicles or psychic powers, we got those.&#10;     An army builder? Off map artillery? Calling in evac choppers? A beefy section on how to solve everything from breaching doors to building things mid-battle?&#10;&#10;&#10;We have all those.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Random tables? Strange terrain types? Space ghosts? Yes, yes and yes. &#10;     What if you have never written a scenario before? What if you want to be the GM? What if you don&rsquo;t know how to paint a miniature? What if you want to play solo?&#10;&#10;&#10;Included are advice sections for all of these situations and more.&#10;&#10;Whether you are a hardcore gaming veteran, someone just dipping your toes into the miniatures hobby or a role player looking for some tactical action, Renegade Scout offers everything you need to get started and keep going.&#10;&#10;The rules are aimed at roughly a platoon or so per side (2-4 units each) but options are included for both much bigger battles and &quot;Skirmish Mode&quot; game play where a handful of individual figures battle for survival.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
