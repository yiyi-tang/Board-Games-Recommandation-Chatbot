    "Description": "The game was developed in cooperation with professional firefighters and it includes realistic situations and educational content.&#10;&#10;Fire Brigade is a cooperative game. Players are members of the fire brigade. Their goal is to save citizens by rescuing and transporting them from endangered areas to the hospital. At the same time, they want to prevent buildings from burning down and keep the fire contained by preventing the spread of a raging inferno. This game can be played in two modes. In Normal Mode players try to save as many citizens as they can, while in Expert Mode they must save all of the citizens or they lose the game.&#10;&#10;The board consists of hexes with different areas (grass, forest, wetlands etc.) with drier areas having more chances to catch on fire. Buildings, Citizens and Fire Tokens are placed on the board according to the chosen scenario. There are nine scenarios for different number of players and difficulties.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a Squad Card along with the matching Fire Truck Miniature and Starting Hex and is assigned one random Firefighting Ability Card and one random Utility Ability Card. That gives each Squad unique abilities to achieve the given goals easier.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple rounds, each following the same procedure. Each round is divided into three phases: Fire-spreading Phase, Event Phase and Players&rsquo; Actions Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Fire-spreading Phase the first player rolls the two Fire Dice. The sum of both numbers determines which hexes will be additionally affected by fire this turn. The fire intensifies and spreads according to the dice roll. If the fire intensifies too much, the Fire Tokens are replaced with an Inferno Token. Buildings on those hexes have burned to the ground and the Citizens are lost.&#10;&#10;Then comes the Event Phase which changes the situation on the board. Events can be positive, negative or both.  There is an interesting fact about firemen and fire at the bottom of each event card.&#10;&#10;The last phase is the Players&rsquo; Actions Phase. When it is their turn, each player can perform any combination of three basic actions (i.e. has three action points) and any number of free actions. The basic actions are: move Fire truck, extinguish fire, use Firefighting ability, use Utility ability, repair the Fire Truck, and evacuate Citizens. The free actions are: drop off Citizens in the Hospital and get Motivation Card, use Motivation card, drop off Citizens temporarily and pick them up after being dropped off. Players can pass at any point of their turn.&#10;&#10;At the End of the game, players can check how well they did. Points are awarded based on how well the fire was contained and how many buildings were burned down. The score is then compared to the Score table which places players in categories from one to five stars, with stars being lost for every lost Citizen. By calculating their score, the players see how well they did and take a scenario with higher or lower difficulty, or try to beat their score in the same scenario next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Cricar&eacute; was one of the bloodiest massacres carried out by the Portuguese against Tupinamb&aacute; - Tupinik&iacute;n Indians. It happened on the S&atilde;o Mateus River, also known as Cricar&eacute;, in the until then Povoado do Cricar&eacute;, including on the Mariricu River (variation of the word Marerike, which means fortress of pau-a-pique), in the current state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo, at the beginning of the year 1558.&#10;&#10;Fern&atilde;o de S&aacute;, son of Mem de S&aacute; governor-general of Brazil at the time, when he arrived in Porto Seguro in Bahia, he received the information that there were many Indians in the region of the village of Cricar&eacute;. He set up a punitive expedition with about six caravels and 200 men. He disembarked on the banks of the Cricar&eacute; and began to slaughter the Gentiles, using their firearms against the ill-armed Indians.&#10;&#10;By underestimating the bravery of the Indians and the carelessness of the soldiers, the governor&rsquo;s son went a long way in the persecution and ran out of powder. The Indians realized and advanced on him that he was only with ten men. He was killed along with Manuel &Aacute;lvares and Diogo &Aacute;lvares, both son of Diogo &Aacute;lvares Correia, The Caramuru - The man of fire - and three other soldiers.&#10;&#10;Despite this victory by the Indians, a large number of Portuguese soldiers joined the Cricar&eacute; River region, killing thousands of Indians. However, two notable facts occurred: the first defeat of the Portuguese on the Brazilian coast and, in return, the greatest genocide committed against the Indians in Brazil.&#10;&#10;The Bellum Brasilis series was originally produced by the extinct Riachuelo Games and was directed to games at the tactical level, covering several episodes in the history of Brazil. &#10;This wargame is the second in the Voxelhouse Old School Wargames series.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Can you lead your country to an age of happiness and prosperity?&#10;&#10;REACTOR is a light, quick playing civilization building strategy game commissioned by NSquare and designed for use in the classroom to create teachable moments highlighting the dangers of nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each turn consists of 3 phases in this order: Infrastructure, Action, and Aftermath&#10;&#10;Infrastructure Phase&#10;Starting with the first player, everyone chooses one category to raise up 2 levels.&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;Each player secretly chooses which action they will take by playing the corresponding card face down in front of themselves. There are 5 possible actions. Economic Progress: Add resources to any category. Global Responsibility: Create an alliance and/or generate resources. Human Achievement: Add resources to your lowest category. Satisfaction: Convert military resources to any other category and get bonus resources. Military: Invade or Nuke another nation. All actions are explained in greater detail below.&#10;&#10;Once all players have locked in a choice, the cards are revealed, and the actions are resolved starting with the first player.&#10;&#10;Aftermath Phase&#10;Players with an active alliance automatically produce additional resources which can be placed anywhere. Allied players receive 1 resource per alliance at level 2, 2 resources per alliance at level 5, and 3 resources per alliance at level 10.&#10;&#10;Then the first player marker is moved clockwise from the current first player and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;End&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, any nations with a total score of 30 or more points from all categories, except Military, (or with a Satisfaction level of 8+ and total score of 25 or more points) are considered winners unless all remaining nations have winning totals in which case the player with the lowest Satisfaction score loses. If players have a tie for lowest Satisfaction score then break that tie with their point total from the other three categories.&#10;&#10;If all nations have been Nuked, then everyone loses.&#10;&#10;If only 1 Nation remains, that nation is technically &ldquo;the winner&rdquo; but they are now the sole survivors of a nuclear wasteland.&#10;&#10;Among younger demographics, the nuclear issue is abstract and distant&mdash;a problem of previous generations. There are more resonant issues like social injustice, global warming, or economy disparity that, while still daunting, are far more comprehensible and consequential.&#10;Reactor, engages high school students in the classroom about the nuclear weapons threat by connecting this issue to more visible social matters through an interactive and accessible medium. By breaking down the complexity of this problem with play, students cultivate a sense of understanding that drives engagement, helping foster new generations that feel empowered and responsible to take action.&#10;&#10;About NSquare: &#10;In 2014, five of the largest peace and security funders in the United States joined forces to develop a new, collective approach to incentivizing and rewarding innovation in the nuclear threat field. What emerged was N Square, a path-breaking initiative built on the idea that new forms of cross-sector collaboration&mdash;combined with the sheer ingenuity of an engaged public&shy;&mdash;will accelerate the achievement of internationally agreed goals to reduce nuclear dangers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the improvised arena that uses city streets, the champions of the two most feared urban gangs, the Wheels of Judgment and the Gods of Atomic Speed, face off. During the race, the two drivers try to put the opposing motorcycle at gunpoint using the light tracer. Who at the end of the race will have scored more tracers on the other bike will be the winner!&#10;&#10;To move his motorcycle, the player plays one of his numbered cards. At the end of the turn, a tracer can also play in the space provided. If a player plays a card to move, the value of which is equal to that of a tracer already played, this tracer is activated and the motorcycle behind (to understand who it is, you need to determine the shorter arc that separates the two motorcycles) can shoot, taking by the tracer card. On the tracer cards there are the symbols of the hits, whoever has collected the most hits at the end of the race wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Play begins when one player presses their endpoint Blink to release the Darkball. The ball moves along the pathway, making decisions randomly when it reaches forks. Clustered pathways are treated as forks, and can produce very chaotic behavior.&#10;&#10;When the Darkball reaches your endpoint, you must press the button to bounce it back into the pathway. If you click too early, your endpoint will go dark for a moment, and you cannot press again until it brightens. If you press too late, you will take damage, as indicated by red lights on your endpoint. You can then release the Darkball by pressing.&#10;&#10;Once a player has missed the Darkball 6 times, their endpoint will explode, and they are out. The last player remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

For each attack, you all place one card from your hand face down in front of you. If your revealed fighting total matches or exceeds the value of a face-up monster, you beat it; otherwise, the monster remains face up and keeps fighting.&#10;&#10;To win a level, you can discuss your strategy with your crew. You can never talk about your card values in hand, but can debate whether you want to &quot;strike fast&quot; or &quot;take it slow&quot;. You can also use available special actions to gain the most benefits from them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Casualties on both sides numbered in the hundreds of thousands and both sides had resorted to chemical weapons, missile attacks against their opponent&rsquo;s cities, and an escalating air and sea campaign in the Persian Gulf that threatened to bring Super power intervention. The Iranian government felt that an offensive to take the crucial city of Basra, Iraq&rsquo;s only port and primary gateway for shipping out its oil and receiving goods from abroad, could end the war with a victory. Dubbed &ldquo;Karbala 5&rdquo; the Iranians amassed much of their Revolutionary Guard formations supported by new weapons secretly purchased from the &ldquo;Great Satan&rdquo; USA (via the illegal Iran-Contra affair) as well as North Korea. A feint attack north of the battlefield, Karbala 6, by much of the Iranian armored force would tie up Iraq&rsquo;s reserves. The resulting battle for Basra was one of the largest and bloodiest battles fought in the war, with both sides fighting with all they had. In the end the battle for Basra would prove just as indecisive as the larger war, with neither side able to claim a clear victory.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

    "Description": "&ldquo;The surer of himself an admiral is, the finer the tactical development of his fleet, the better his captains, the more reluctant must he necessarily be to enter into a melee with equal forces, in which all these advantages will be thrown away, chance reign supreme, and his fleet be place on terms of equality with an assemblage of ships which have never before acted together.&rdquo;&mdash;Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence of Seapower Upon History, 1660-1783.&#10;&#10;To Rule The Waves is an introductory level wargame simulation on the British Navy&rsquo;s bombardment of the Egyptian Forts at Alexandria in 1882, as well as several &ldquo;what if&rdquo; naval battles that could have occurred amongst the European powers in the Mediterranean during the 1880s. This decade was marked by peace amongst the Imperialist nations, but there were events that &ldquo;rocked the boat&rdquo; and could very easily have led to conflict; especially in the Mediterranean Sea that for ages has been the nexus of commerce as well as conflict. This decade was also marked by tremendous innovation in warship design and tactics. The pace of change was such that no nation could rest assured that their fleet&rsquo;s composition was proven or superior to that of their opponent. This was not an easy time for Admirals and ships&rsquo; captains&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants.&#10;&#10;Learn and enjoy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The app is there to enable solo play, but the system itself doesn't rely on the app to work, any more than any other TTRPG combat system does.  For instance, you could write up your own adventures and share them with friends, and it would work perfectly fine.&#10;&#10;",

Being adventurous and ignoring her parents' warnings about the dangers in the forest, she decides one night to climb out her bedroom window and wander into the forest, hoping to discover hidden treasures to be found only under the moonlight. What she doesn't know is that she is fated to become best friends (the greatest of treasures) with a kind Troll... if she bumps into him before the sun rises. For when the sunlight hits a troll, they transform into a rock for the day. And if this was to happen, Violet would never again have the chance to meet this particular troll.&#10;&#10;The grumpy Nisse Torech though, will have no such thing! Aware of what fate has reserved for Violet, and opposing such nonsense as trolls befriending humans, he will do all in his power, to prevent Violet from meeting this troll.&#10;&#10;The Grumpy Nisse, is a 2-player card game where one player is Violet and the other is Torech. Torech tries to prevent Violet from reaching the end of the forest before sunrise, in which case he will win the game. Players will play out one card each and compare their strengths to determine who wins the round, if Violet, then she will progress, otherwise she'll have to try again. Some of the spots in the forest will trigger events that can make the game harder for either one or the other player, so players need to be careful in how they play out their cards.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players will draft cards to build the decks that they will play with for the duration of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reactor is an intense and competitive contest where each player must react to the alarms of the reactor core before their opponents. Played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system, Reactor is a high-speed battle that takes advantage of the distributed intelligence of Blinks pieces to create a constantly shifting gameboard and dynamic difficulty levels. Originally created at the Global Game Jam 2020, Reactor takes inspiration from competitive fighting games, and distills them down to an intense contest of reflexes and concentration.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Arrange your Blinks so that each player has a single-file pathway to the center Blink. If possible, each player&rsquo;s path should be the same length. When you are finished setting up, long-press the center Blink to start the Reactor.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;The center Reactor will continuously flash colors. If it flashes the same color twice in a row, players must press the Blink at the end of their path to &ldquo;buzz in.&rdquo; The order in which the players buzz in will be shown by the color of their path. The first player to buzz in becomes green, the last player becomes red, and all others become yellow. Any player that does not buzz in is considered &ldquo;last&rdquo; and also displays red.&#10;&#10;After results are shown, any player with a red path must remove the last piece on their branch and set it on the table in reach of all other players. This piece is now &ldquo;unstable,&rdquo; and displays a spinning yellow pattern.&#10;&#10;All players, in addition to watching the Reactor, must now keep their eyes on these unstable Blinks. When an unstable Blink erupts in a green display, any player can grab it off the table and add it to the end of their chain. If the Blink flashes red instead, it is permanently out of the game.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The game continues until all players but one have lost all the Blinks in their pathway.&#10;&#10;PAY UP VARIANT&#10;Reactor can also be played with a set of &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; rules. In this version, players who display red after buzzing in, either because they buzzed last or didn&rsquo;t buzz at all, must give their end pieces to the green player instead of setting them aside. Because players &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; after each round, there are no unstable Blinks on the table.&#10;&#10;This version of the game is more focused than the standard rules, and two evenly-matched players can battle it out for a very long time.&#10;&#10;",

Hide your past sins carefully and accuse others of being evil to send them straight down the fiery depths of hell!&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s character card is randomly placed in a vertical line formation, between heaven and hell, to create the play area.&#10;&#10;The goal: Be the first player to enter Heaven with the help of the only Heaven&rsquo;s Bell card, by being the last player in the line when all others have fallen into Hell or by confessing all your sins.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing different Action cards. Use these cards to scheme diabolical strategies, affecting the character line in various ways. Betray, steal and &ldquo;sin&rdquo; your way to victory!&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, players will accumulate Sin cards. Discuss amongst yourselves to flesh these players out! Hide your sins carefully, for any suspicious player might accuse you and mark you as an evil player. On the other hand, if you manage to go unnoticed and accumulate enough sin cards, you can confess all your sins and win the game!&#10;&#10;There are multiple Hell&rsquo;s Bell cards and one single Heaven&rsquo;s Bell card that players will draw as the game progresses. These cards stay in play and are activated at the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, either granting victory to the player closest to heaven or severely punishing the player in front of hell.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Battle 2275 AD is a free PNP solitaire hex-based space combat simulator wargame for 1 player. Use your fleet of fighters to attack and destroy the enemy fleet. But watch out for fighters, cruisers, battle stations and asteroids. Can also be played by 2 players, with one player replacing the AI.&#10;&#10;You will need:&#10;This rule set&#10;2 pages of Command Cards and counters (14 cards, 17 counters)&#10;4 hex map pages (or you can use any printed one-inch hex map)&#10;1 6d&#10;colored beads or cubes as markers&#10;&#10;In 2-player play, both fleets should be chosen so that their total number of Shield points, added together, is roughly equal. For solo play, give the AI side a 25-50% advantage. Solitaire players can play either fleet, and use the AI system to determine the opponent&rsquo;s movements.&#10;&#10;For small fleets with no more than 2 or 3 ships per side, two Hex Map boards should provide sufficient space. Larger fleets may require all four Hex Map boards for sufficient room.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the Players move the ships in their fleet. In solo play, an AI dice table determines the opponent's moves. Ships maneuver to get within firing range of their opponent's ships. Combat is resolved by dice throw.&#10;&#10;The difficulty level of Star Battle 2275 AD can be adjusted by varying the number and type of ships in each fleet. The game can also be made more difficult by adding navigational hazards such as Asteroids, which block line of sight and prevent travel within the hexes they cover.&#10;&#10;Players win by destroying the opponent fleet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players lead the entire fleets and the basic unit is the squadron of huge warships. The typical mid size fleet can consists of a few dozens destroyers, cruisers and battleships and big fleets can consist of more than a hundred spaceships!&#10;     The battles can be resolved quickly without bogging into the details, as from game point of view the squadron is considered as whole.&#10;     Fast, but flexible fleet and squadron composition, which favours experiments, variety and new combinations. In short: buy commanders, choose one of a few possible pre-set composition for them and fill it with ships from different classes.&#10;     Squadron commanders skills has crucial role! They are not determined only by the rank (which determines squadron size), but also commanders leading style.&#10;     Orders, which are divided into basic (performed automatically) and advanced (commander&rsquo;s test is required) add extra risk management aspect.&#10;     Formation system &ndash; the squadron can be in close or loose formation, both have bonuses and penalties.&#10;     Disorganisation &ndash; the squadrons which are under fire start to lose coherency and the breaking enemy formations are very important aspect of the game.&#10;     Modules &ndash; the game is designed as modular from the beginning. Modules add extra rules, scenarios, ships and other game aspects.&#10;     Miniatures, in Nanofleet scale (1:10000), perfect for 3D printing. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bide is a combinatorial, abstract strategy game for 2-6 players played on a hexagonal or square board which is initially empty (hex-hex base 5 is recommended). Bide was designed by Alek Erickson in May 2020.&#10;&#10;Players can skip turns to get extra turns later: &#10;Players take turns placing stones of their color in the hexagonal cells. At the beginning of your turn, you are given a new stone. You can either play it, or &quot;bide&quot; (meaning wait). If you bide, set the stone aside and your turn ends immediately. The stone remains in your hand. If you play the new stone while having at least one stone still in hand, you may &quot;release&quot; (meaning play every stone in your hand in succession). If a player releases, all opponents must immediately release next turn, including their stone for that turn.&#10;&#10;Stones create shock waves:&#10;When a stone is placed, it creates a &quot;shock wave&quot;: all adjacent stones move one space in the direction radially outward from the placement. If there are multiple connected stones adjacent to the placed stone, positioned directly in the line of the shock wave, they all move one space. If this movement causes a stone to bump into another stone directly in the line of the shock wave, that stone also gets pushed one space (becoming adjacent along a different grid line does not count). However, stones cannot be pushed past the edges of the board, and lines that are full between the edges and placed stone do not move.&#10;&#10;Players get points for owning the center:&#10;When the board is full, players score the position. Each stone is worth points equal to its distance from the nearest edge (starting at zero). Groups consist of connected, adjacent stones of a single color. Groups are worth the sum of their stones. The player with the highest scoring group wins. If tied, remove the outer-most ring of pieces and re-score, repeating this process until there is a winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But beware, when moving your pawn at the candy/point track sometimes reveals a trap stopping your movement&#10;The first to get to the Candy monsters cave (30 points) wins immediately.&#10;&#10;- Description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is designed so that novice players can get started with this game, but it develops a progressive difficulty that is challenging even for the most experienced ones.&#10;&#10;It is a very old-school flavour designed, intended to transport us to the classic adventure that we could enjoy in our favorite fantasy novels or the best role-playing games.&#10;&#10;Cooperation between players will always be key to succeed.&#10;&#10;The dungeon map will be generated randomly, changing in every game, which favors replayability. The game will have an important number of furniture elements that will help you to dive into the adventur. Dungeon monsters will play automatically according to a protocol, easy to apply and consistent.&#10;&#10;The exploration and combat mechanics are developed in a fluid and funny way. Our goal is that you will want to play Classic Quest over and over. No forgotten games on dusty shelves!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "David Coulthard's Kartzee is a fun fast racing game where players have to manage their dice and tactics to be the first player to get both of their teams cars ahead of DC.&#10;&#10;Designed by David J. Mortimer as a commission for Cooper Tires as a promotional item in the line of their Ambassador David Coulthard merchandise.&#10;&#10;A game is played over rounds until one player ends their turn with both their cards in front of DC. At the start of a round DC moves at his current speed, which will change during the game.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn order then performs their turn by rolling 3 dice, they must pick 1 dice for each car and then the third is used as a special tactic for one car to slip stream from a distance, overtake a car in front, nail the corners this move or to collect tactic cubes depending on what has been rolled. Tactic cubes let players manipulate the rolls on future turns. At the end of a turn the players cars will cruise up behind a car in front of them.&#10;&#10;Managing these rolls and the numbers used for cars verses tactics is critical to success because if you enter a corner too fast you'll skid to a halt and lose your momentum and if you can get ne of your cars to punch a hole in the air for their team mate you speed will increase.&#10;&#10;A game quick enough that you can learn to play and finish a game whilst your tires are fitted!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This is a new method that adds some goals to a standard mission.&#10;&#10;The three levels are Normal, Heroic and Master.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Normal Level:- Is the base mission. This has already been described above.&#10;     Heroic Level:- Has the same basic outline of the Normal Mission but now the players will need to harvest the Saplings before the harsh environment of the badlands kills the plants.&#10;     Master Level:- Taking Normal and Heroic levels. With the added bonus of getting the 'Harvest Saplings' of the game table in a certain amount of ACTIONS.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each 'Level' offers new and existing OUTLAND Players a different challenge. Of course the rewards for completing each 'Level' have been increased to match the mission type.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players, in addition to normal actions, may attempt to ally with, or vanquish, the alien races. Allied aliens give you an ongoing effect that modifies other actions in the game, while vanquishing the aliens prevents allied effects and gains you victory points.&#10;&#10;&#10;These alien homeworld cards are placed in the center of the table and represent the aliens that are currently in place on specific planets. If a player tried to inhabit one of those locations, they must either align with the alien and take a special power for the rest of the game -OR- vanquish the alien to gain additional stars.&#10;&#10;",
