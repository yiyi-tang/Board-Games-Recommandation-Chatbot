    "Description": "Neuch&acirc;tel is a French-speaking canton, located in French-speaking Switzerland. It can be represented in four major regions. Along Lake Neuch&acirc;tel is the region called Littoral. The city of Neuch&acirc;tel is established on the right bank of the lake. To the north, passing through the Chaumont, is the Val-de-Ruz.&#10;&#10;West of Neuch&acirc;tel, still in the Littoral, is the alluvial cone of the mouth of the Areuse. The valley narrows further to the west in a narrow gorge and then opens onto the Val-de-Travers. The Canton of Neuch&acirc;tel is also the cradle of the most prestigious watch brands.&#10;&#10;Don't forget, like in any other Monopoly, do not get bankrupted to win !&#10;&#10;",

Second - while the coin is still spinning, tap the coin one time toward the center. Third - the team with their coin closest to the center scores.&#10;&#10;After all 8 coins have been played, the &quot;end&quot; is over, and the team with the coin closest to the center scores. They get 1 point for every coin that is closer that the other team's closest coin, and the other team gets 0 points. A recreational game goes to 5 ends and can be played in as little as 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;If you can spin a coin, you can play Coin Curling. Coin Curling is great for adults, but it is also fun for the whole family ages 8 and up. You can play individual 1-on-1, and a full team game is 2-on-2.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On one level, mercenary life can seem romantic, an adventure, where often noble Soldiers of Fortune venture forth to save lives, right wrongs and vanquish the evil within our world. On another, mercenary life can appear fraught with danger, hardship and eventual death, with little or no support from uncaring employers. The truth is, the reality can be seen as a blend of these and many other factors. What is known is that mercenaries in one form or another have been instrumental in toppling governments, creating nations and preserving peace / ensuring war across the globe, especially during the post-1945 period and up until the modern day.&#10;&#10;The information and rules within this book are designed to reflect the life of a mercenary unit during this tumultuous period within many regions and countries. It blends fact and fiction to create a simple, workable framework within which tabletop units and battles can be created in a range of circumstances. &#10;It is designed to be a skirmish level game using suitable miniatures from 15 to 28mm size, plus buildings, vehicles and other items that are scaled to fit. &#10;Games can represent one-off encounters or be a part of a series of battles, perhaps even a narrative campaign where the units you and your fellow gamers come up with develop over time.&#10;&#10;Remember: Get in, get out, get paid -&#10;where the Wild Geese roam, lesser men fear to tread&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

To win in Chummy, a player must capture all of the opponent&rsquo;s kings, or use his/her king to control the center of the game board.&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of 9 levels, players will examine crime scenes, upgrade their skills, and try to thwart Mr X's evil plans.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player rolls two dice and uses them in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     To place polyominoes on a crime scene in order to search rooms or collect evidence.&#10;     To trigger insight abilities from the various pieces of collected evidence. Abilities might let the player take bonus moves, fill in more parts of the crime scene, score points, unlock permanent upgrades, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;After 15 turns, the player's skills are assessed and, depending on how they performed, they can pick from a variety of permanent upgrades to power-up Ada Lovelace's abilities. This might be new polyomino shapes, long-term abilities, or other rule-changing twists.&#10;&#10;Each level also provides it's own twists on the rules, with unique rules, evidence abilities, layouts, locked areas, folded sheets, overlapping areas, multiple floors, etc. Tacking Mr X will require the player to navigate all these twists and complexities!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

This is the program of the evening.&#10;&#10;But the adventurers will be wary of each other, will avoid spending all their money and make sure not to attract the wrath of Igor and Stan, the two bouncers of the Inn.

Each  purchase will allow them to also acquire &quot;Sympathy&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;Then they will spend a good time acquiring  &quot;Inn&quot; cards thanks to the various drinks and coins in their possession.

    "Description": "In Pretpark Tempo you build your own theme park and try to accommodate to the wishes of potential visitors as good as possible. Will you manage to attract more visitors than the other players?&#10;&#10;Pretpark Tempo is a card-drafting game with a unique twist. Cards can be played as an attraction or as a potential visitor.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two phases. The first phase lasts two rounds. Every turn each player chooses two cards form their hand and then pass the remaining cards to an adjacent player. All players simultaneously show which card they play as an attraction, place it in front of them and activate its special ability. All build attractions stay in play in front of each player to form their own theme park. Attractions all have a type and a theme which contribute to attracting visitors in the second phase of the game. The second card chosen is placed face-down in a shared pile which is called &quot;the visitors' row&quot;. All visitors in this pile will make their appearance in the second phase of the game to choose a theme park to visit.&#10;&#10;Whenever one or more players have no cards to pass to an adjacent player - the round ends. A new hand of cards is dealt to each player and a new round starts. After two rounds the first phase of the game comes to an end.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of the game the visitors in the visitor' row are revealed one by one. All visitors have a preference toward a certain theme and type of attraction. Players compare their theme parks to find out who has a majority in attractions that are preferred by the visitor to decide which player attracts the visitor. After all visitors are assigned you count how many visitors came to visit your park and add bonus points for your attractions with certain special abilities. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Pretpark Tempo is a contest for majorities. Therefore, it is essential to keep close track of what your opponents are building and make well-considered decisions during the drafts. It plays best with 3-5 players but also contains a solid ruleset for a 2-player game and a solo variant.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Between game-changing rules, cards disappearing, and other players out to get you, you&rsquo;ll never play the same way twice.&#10;&#10;Players compete in a steampunk-style game to get rid of their hand of cards. Cards available are number cards (used to increase or decrease the current count piles), direction cards (used to change the direction of the count), and jump cards (used to change the increase or decrease limit of the count).&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will play a card onto one of two count piles in play based on the current limitations of that pile. If a player cannot play a card from their hand, they must draw a card and either play the card drawn or remove a non-starter card in play.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players gain points based on the cards left in their hand. The game ends when a player reaches 500 points; the player with the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "UpTower is a block-based tower-building roll-and-write game for any number of players (minimum of two). Play is simultaneous and quick, so there's very little down-time. Because it's a free print-and-play roll-and-write, it's easy for distant players to print their own play sheets and play over video chat.&#10;&#10;If you're familiar with the classic Russian block-stacking video game or the board game Coppenhagen, you have a good grasp of how UpTower plays. the goal of the game is to build a tower with the highest, largest floor before the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, one player rolls a die. This die tells all players what piece they must &ldquo;drop&rdquo; onto their playfield.&#10;&#10;After the die roll, play is simultaneous - You place the rolled piece on your playfield at the same time as all other players. To do this, you&rsquo;ll mark off one of the four &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of that piece on the reference side of your play sheet, then you&rsquo;ll fill in the spaces where they piece &ldquo;landed&rdquo; after you &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; onto your playfield from the top edge.&#10;&#10;Every turn - before or ater you place the rolled piece - you may place one &ldquo;at will&ldquo; piece. If you do, mark off the &ldquo;at will&rdquo; dot for the piece you want to place, then drop it on your board like a rolled piece. You may do this once for each of the six pieces. Note that you get a score bonus (up to 21 points) for your unused &ldquo;at will&rdquo; pieces at the end of the game, so choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Once everyone&rsquo;s placed their rolled and at will pieces, roll the die and start a new turn. The game ends when a player reaches the top of the board (the 15th floor) or if you roll the die and that piece has already been used four times.&#10;&#10;Your score is your single highest-scoring floor. A floor scores points equal to its level, multiplied by the number of filled spaces on that level &ndash; if your 7th floor has 9 filled spaces, it scores (7*9) 63 points. You also score a small-to-moderate bonus for unused &quot;at-will&quot; pieces: 6=21; 5=15; 4=10; 3=6; 2=3; 1=1. High score wins; play another turn if tied.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Territory is set in a classical fantasy landscape where there are several tribes exploring the surrounding realms they find themselves in: magnificent and ancient landscapes from a past that is long forgotten. Champions will explore realms, seek out Relics, and cast Spells to combat other tribes in their quest to uncover the mysteries of the realm.&#10;&#10;Players play the game with a deck consisting of Champion cards, Relic Cards, and Spell cards. Players also have a small separate deck called a 'Territory Deck'. The object of the game is to be the first person to get 18 points. Players get points when they destroy an opponent&rsquo;s Territory, Relic, or Champion from play.&#10;&#10;Territory is a turn-based game where players place champions on their Territories and Relics in between their Territories during their turns. Players also may play Spell cards during their turns which help improve gameplay conditions. During a player&rsquo;s turn, in a distinct phase called the &lsquo;Combat Phase&rsquo;, Champions attack their opponents' Territories and Relics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Robble is a territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 5x5 and 9x9. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stones of its color. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square. Then,&#10;&#10;- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to an empty square 'B' in the opposite direction, move stone 'A' to empty square 'B';&#10;&#10;- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to the edge of the board in the opposite direction, remove stone 'A', and&#10;&#10;- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to another stone in the opposite direction, replace stone 'A' with a stone of the opposite color.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. If the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.&#10;&#10;If the same board position appears for the third time with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesRepeating a position is very hard on a 5x5 board, and it is believed to be impossible on bigger boards.&#10;&#10;Robble was inspired by Gekitai and Pathwayz.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Who can keep it going the longest and who blanks out completely?&#10;&#10;Game-play: Begin play by choosing one person to read the questions in the first round and one person to answer. The answerer should keep answering one question after another as long as they answer correctly (that is, incorrectly). Answers must come quickly, without hesitation. It's up to the reader to decide whether the answers are fast enough, but a few seconds is a good rule of thumb. Answers that take too long are considered a wrong answer and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The reader continues by asking the new answered questions from the same card, picking up with the next question. When all questions from a card have been asked, draw a new card from the pile. A new reader can take over at any time.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest number of correct questions in a row is considered the leader. If another player beats their record, they are now the person to beat. Play for a set number of rounds, and the person with the highest score at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

Following the US intervention in April, the unit was deployed to &#196;&#144;&#225;&#187;&#147;ng Nai Province to protect the Bien Hoa Airbase. The 173rd was a &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; unit that embodied what was to have been an international effort to combat the spread of Communism in South Vietnam. From the start the unit was engaged in battles with the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s 9th Division for control of the province.&#10;&#10;In November two battalions, one from the 503rd US Airborne Regiment and another from the Royal Australian Rifles, were deployed to once again &ldquo;search and destroy&rdquo; the elusive Viet Cong. The offensive was dubbed Operation Hump, as many of the participants optimistically felt that once this fight was over they would soon be going home. This time, however, the Communists elected to stand and fight as their brethren had done further north earlier at the A Shau Valley. What resulted was one of bloodiest and violent fights to that point in the war, sowing the first doubts among the US and Allied forces that perhaps victory for them was not &ldquo;just around the corner&rdquo;...

    "Description": "Classic literature/movies characters like the invisible man, the werewolf, the vampire, the phantom of the opera, Dr. Jekyll and others join forces in this cooperative game. Their objective is to take down Dr. Moreau, a brilliant but mad scientist who retired in a lost island to carry out atrocious experiments on humans and animals in an effort to create, in his lab, a super-being.&#10;The game offers an unprecedented approach to traditional board game-play where technology, in the form of a very intuitive Web-APP, is introduced. Besides performing many random game functions a new very exiting feature was created: the Map Maker. As the game progresses the A.I. will indicate which new Map-Tiles are to be added to the Map Puzzle. This way, players will have to re-adapt their strategies according to the configuration of the map. All maps will be different and the chances that you will play a map twice is highly unlikely. Besides this, the Web-APP allows players to play (each with their own board game) remotely and in real-time. &#10;Character and weapons upgrades, an underground labyrinth , over 50 weapons and inventory items, many actions to chose from, Attack / Defense tactics, the need to manage physical as well as internal resources and a compelling story-line are the main ingredients of this cyberpunk horror cooperative board game that is the first of an incredible trilogy where the line that separates humans from animals is blurred. Which side are you on?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
