Some method should then be used to determine which player goes first. It will be important at the end of the game to remember the starting player.&#10;&#10;There are three elements to a turn: placement, scoring, and mutation. Placement must happen first. The player then has the choice of mutating and then scoring, or vice-versa. After a player has placed, mutated, and scored, the turn moves to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of a turn in which no player has any pieces in a gene pool. Extra turns are played if the game does not end on the fourth player's turn to equalize the total number of turns per player. The value of the pieces (small = 1, medium = 2, large = 3) is totaled for each player's archive. The player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pirogue: The Trinidad and Tobago Tarpon Tournament is a trick-taking game inspired by big game Tarpon fishing in the warm, blue waters of Trinidad and Tobago.  The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.&#10;&#10;The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; &amp; Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.&#10;&#10;One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.&#10;&#10;Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.&#10;&#10;Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!&#10;&#10;",

Bishop was officially credited with 72 kills, despite having started the war in the infantry and flying in combat only between March and August 1917, and April to June 1918. He was the first Canadian promoted to Air Marshal in 1939 and was in charge of air force recruitment and training at the time this game was published in 1941. For more details on his life, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop.&#10;&#10;From the rules:  Starting at the Recruiting Depot, players move through the Manning Depot to the Initial Training School, where they are classified as Pilots, Observers or Airgunners.&#10;&#10;Each player then follows his course through its various stages till completed --- goes overseas --- serves with the Fighting force and finally returns home.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by exact die rolls (getting to key spots and ending the game requires an exact roll) as the player moves through the contiguous points on the board.   The cover is excellent and one of quite a few Canadian wargames created during WWII.&#10;&#10;",

There are 15 total units in a player's force, 6 Soldiers, 2 Tanks, 2 Cannon, 2 Bombers, 2 Pursuit Planes, 1 Dictator.  These units are all lead miniatures (flats).  Each unit type has a different movement, for example the soldier can move 1 space in any direction, the tank can move 1 or 2 squares in any direction.  A unit is captured by entering its square and in some cases (cannons) the unit capturing can jump over intervening friendly units.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture the opposing dictator or dictators at which time the captured dictator's entire army &quot;surrenders&quot; and is removed from the board.   When four people are playing then two sides ally and both players on one side must be defeated.&#10;&#10;",

This game, and a similar Jim Prentice-branded offering in 1948, added electricity to the outguess-your-opponent mechanism. In this case, the pitching player secretly pushes a metal arrow down onto one of four metal pitch option circles. The batter touches the lead on a wire to one of four hit circles. If a light goes on, he uses a spinner to determine the kind of hit.  If nothing lights up, the batter touches the ball and strike circles to determine the result of the pitch. Two more circles by the &quot;Smiling Umpire&quot; determine the results of attempted steals and bunts, foul pops, tagging up or double-play attempts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Website&#10;&#10;During the course of the First World War, the United States continued to build huge new battleships despite a pressing need for destroyers and merchant ships. In Britain, Royal Navy planners wondered just what their American allies were up to, because such a fleet could only have one potential adversary. Britain also made plans to construct new ships.&#10;&#10;Sea of Troubles is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on the war plans of both sides. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, using the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold, but some actions are also placed in European waters on the maps for Jutland or Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Red. The Americans get the huge 1919 program battleship mounting eight 18-inch guns as well as four examples of the South Dakota class with their dozen 16-inch guns apiece. There are also the Lexington class battle cruisers in their original configuration with 14-inch guns, and the 1914 design for a fast commerce-raiding armored cruiser armed with 10-inch guns.&#10;&#10;The Royal Navy adds the remainder of its R-class battleships not seen in Jutland, plus the huge battleships of the N3 design with nine 18-inch guns each, and the ungainly but powerful battle cruisers of the G3 design. Plus the Royal Canadian Navy makes an appearance with three dreadnought battleships and a flotilla of destroyers.&#10;&#10;There are over three dozen new scenarios featuring brawls between huge fleets of battleships, plus of course background articles on the ships, the fleets and the war plans of all potential participants.&#10;&#10;This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This product acts as a successor to the now out-of-print Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Red.  As a result, both countersheets that ship with this product are still labeled 'US Navy Plan Red', although the scenarios for that product, set along the United States Eastern seaboard, are now deprecated in favor of scenarios set in the Mediterranean and North Sea.  Additionally, while 'US Navy Plan Red' was a boxed-set and limited to a few scenarios that could work with the components included, as a module book 'Sea of Troubles' is not so constrained.  There are more than 2 dozen scenarios in this product that cover more than just 'Plan Red', along with articles on the ships and historical flavor for this period.&#10;&#10;Plan Red was released in a second edition in 2013. It has a completely revised scenario book with 14 battle and 20 operational scenarios, and updated special rules. Sea of Troubles is out of print.&#10;&#10;",

The 7 banners of the 7 warring states now replaces the 6 heroes.&#10;&#10;I've increased some of the unit numbers and decreased others to enable the additional 7th player, to take into account the new crossbowmen, as well as to rebalance the game towards a slightly higher emphasis on missile troops.&#10;&#10;Gorgon is now 7th Month Hungry Ghost Festival.&#10;&#10;Thanatos is now Zhan Shen.&#10;&#10;Helen is replaced by the Mandate of Heaven.&#10;&#10;City/Tireme replaced by the duality of Civil/Military City/Fortress.&#10;&#10;Agamemnon, Athena &amp; Poseidon have been replaced by Bian (Tablets),a Bamboo Bian, a Stone Bian (for Civil City) &amp; a Bronze Bian (for Martial Fortress) respectively.&#10;&#10;Chariots are now split into lower value Cavalry &amp; higher value Chariots.&#10;&#10;Trojan Horse is now a Yunti Che.&#10;&#10;Elephant is now Chao Che.&#10;&#10;Harrows are now Crossbow Traps.&#10;&#10;All other units remain basically the same except labeled in their Chinese equivalent.&#10;&#10;Go here for more info: http://www.act.com.sg/zhanguo/&#10;&#10;",

After collecting a set of clues, a player may accuse one of the suspects, and if enough of their clues match the suspect, the suspect can be arrested and brought to court.  If the player is able to present sufficient additional evidence, the suspect is convicted and the player wins.&#10;&#10;While this game has been compared to Clue, there aren't many similarities.  Instead of trying to gather evidence to identify  a specific suspect selected and hidden at the start of the game (i.e. Col. Mustard with a Cuisinart in the Rumpus Room), the goal of this game is to wander around collecting clue cards until a picture of one of the ten suspects comes into focus, and then try to gather enough clues to put them away.  It's actually kind of a perversion of justice if you think about it.&#10;&#10;Another odd element of the game is that landing on other players' pieces (i.e. &quot;bumping&quot;) can serious screw with the player, so there's an interesting screw-your-neighbor aspect to play.  Aside from that, the fact that repeated plays will almost certainly result in players memorizing the cards means that the replay value might be limited, but the bumping might actually keep the play interesting.&#10;&#10;",

In May 1943 the Americans invaded Attu Island, sending 15,000 troops against about 2,500 Japanese defenders. The Japanese fought with suicidal determination: 28 fell into American hands as prisoners with the remainder killed in action.&#10;&#10;Two months later the Americans launched an even larger invasion of nearby Kiska Island, only to find that the Japanese had evacuated three weeks before and the Americans captured an uninhabited island.&#10;&#10;Alaska's War is a supplement based on the Japan's lone invasion of the Western Hemisphere and the American response.  The supplement features 10 scenarios.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is played on a 8 sided hexagonal board, with groups of 7 stones, arranged in a hexagonal formation, at the center of each side, with opposing colors facing each other (a diagram is available on the game's website.)&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player: (a) selects a group of connected friendly stones, (b) name one as pivot, and (c) rotate the group any multiple of 60 degrees around the pivot, provided all the landing places are either empty, with opponent stones, or one of his own cells that the move is just vacating. Any opponent stones landed on are captured. Passing is legal, and compulsory if no moves are legal.&#10;&#10;The winner is whoever captures all his opponent's stones.&#10;&#10;Blockdance does not have great clarity, i.e., it is very hard to predict what is the exact outcome of a sequence of moves. However, part of this difficulty vanishes once a player gets used to these pivot moves, and even if there is not much strategy, the game is highly tactical and fun.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publishers homepage:&#10;&#10;Background&#10;It is almost a true story. The Mayor of Farum (city on the outskirts of Copenhagen) had ruled the city like a king for almost a decade. His party ruled the city board and no one dared to speak out against the Mayor. But as with Hamlet, something is rotten in the Kingdom. A Danish newspaper blew the story wide open. It turned out that the Mayor, among other things, had made some creative investments and given his friends loads of city business. To top that off, his expense account carried not only trips to Championship Football games, but also wine for more than 10,000 a bottle &ndash; Cheers&hellip;&#10;&#10;Sales and PR&#10;PBX was released in the beginning of November 2002, and were sold out before New Year &ndash; that made PBX: The fastest selling board game in Denmark ever. 12,000 copies sold from the shops in only 6 weeks &ndash; without a dime spent on marketing. Yet PBX was able to create heavy and very positive media coverage: The media also focused on the fact that PBX was the first of it's kind. Some articles even had politicians (the main characters in PBX) playing the game and reviewing it. National TV News gave it full coverage as Christmas Gift of the Year, including a review done by two Mayors. The second largest daily newspaper had &quot;business&quot; Cavling Winning (same as Pulitzer) journalists reviewing the game (BT).&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;As a Mayor of a Danish town, you are obsessed about making your city the best city in the country. To fulfil all the dreams you have for the city, the Game starts out with you taking an illegal loan of 250 million from the Government. Now your job as a Mayor is to drive around the game board in your Mayoral car and try to spend the money as fast as possible. On your way you pick cards with instructions on how much to spend on, for instance, &quot;gifts &quot; to business relations in return for favours, dinners you have to give to keep your fellow politicians on board and travels you need to make in order to do proper &quot;research &quot;. You have to be careful, because the people you mingle with can easily forget their obligations to you, even though the gifts you spent on them were expensive. Your political opponents (though still full from the &quot;friendly &quot; dinner you hosted) will try and expose you, or the Government might even call you in for a little chat that would force you on a leave of absence, where you have no chance at all of blowing your 250 million. The instruction cards, mixed with questions on luxury lifestyle, all evolve around issues that actually did take place, though blown totally out of proportion and with a humorous distance, making this the first Board Game ever to truly be appointed: A Satire Board Game.&#10;&#10;",

Three catch-triggered compartments sit behind a transparent plastic window with a small target located centrally beneath each. In each compartment there are one or more marbles.&#10;&#10;Players roll a single marble each turn at the three targets from a predetermined distance - six to eight feet is recommended in the rules. If any of these are hit, a catch is released and the marbles in the compartment above are released to the player. One marble must be replaced in the compartment once it is reset for the next player. A plastic ramp located behind the targets catches stray marbles which roll up the ramp and then enter one of the three compartments in the machine. Players must also place marbles from errant rolls (e.g. those which miss the machine completely or are not strong enough to reach it) in any compartment they choose (there is a small square hole above each for this purpose).&#10;&#10;Players are eliminated when they are out of marbles. The last player left with one or more marbles is the winner.&#10;&#10;N.B. This game should not be confused with the 1978 marble game called Pay Off (or Pay Off Machine - game ID# 9025) also released by IDEAL which looks like a canister with horizontal sections that rotate.&#10;&#10;",

Most of the rules are considered as guidelines, such as the &quot;hint&quot; to keep your answers fairly short, but the Rule of Silence during another player's answer must be observed.&#10;&#10;As with other games in the Ungame series, there is no winner or loser.

Players gain the resource by moving to the space or having a base on the space.&#10;&#10;When the right resources are collected, super powers can be purchased, but you must have training (tokens) to use them.&#10;&#10;If doubles are rolled on the resource phase, a villain appears that the heroes must defeat by either:&#10;giving up the proper power resources,or&#10;giving up a training token to activate a purchased power.&#10;&#10;If the player can't do either, the must give up a token to pass. &#10;Once a villain is defeated the spoils of victory are spread among the players.&#10;&#10;The winning hero is the first to reach 80 victory points.&#10;&#10;Super Powers has been updated to Second Edition in December 2009.  The second edition changes mostly include the main board where energy tokens are aquired.  They no longer are placed based on a die roll.  Also, players are able to perform actions based on the number of their own tokens placed on the main board.  The art has been upgraded. The changes increase the strategy options against opponents and the new art makes the game much nicer.&#10;&#10;",
