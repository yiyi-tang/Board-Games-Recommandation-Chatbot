    "Description": "For the 2013 Disney Eye Found It!&#10;&#10;Join Mickey Mouse and friends on an exciting race through 12 exquisitely illustrated Disney realms, from Radiator Springs and Alice&rsquo;s Wonderland to Peter Pan&rsquo;s Never Land and Winnie the Pooh&rsquo;s Hundred Acre Wood. Throughout the race, everyone searches for iconic Disney objects and gets a chance to say, &ldquo;I found it!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Set the clock to 1:00. Once the game starts the clock is ticking and players must work together to get to Cinderella&rsquo;s castle before the clock strikes midnight. On your turn, spin the spinner and either move, search, or tick the clock forward. If you spin the golden Mickey Mouse ear, it&rsquo;s time to search! Flip over a Search Card and everyone starts looking for the item on the card. For each item a player finds that is one step forward for all &#10;players. If all players arrive at the castle before the clock strikes midnight everyone wins!&#10;&#10;For the 2015 Dreamworks version Dreamworks Eye Found It! (English edition 2015): &#10;Celebrate your favorite DreamWorks characters and find hidden treasures throughout the six-foot game board!&#10;&#10;Explore eight exquisite lands inspired by your favorite DreamWorks films! Join beloved characters like Donkey from Shrek, the Penguins of Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, and many more in a thrilling adventure through the six-foot game board. It&rsquo;s collaborative fun where together everyone gets to shout, &ldquo;I found it!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Shuffle the search cards and put them in a pile face down. Spin the spinner, move the number of spaces indicated, if you get a search follow the card directions, if you get a movie snack take one from the snack pile. Get to the end of the game board to win.&#10;&#10;Changes from Richard Scarry's Busytown: Eye found it! Game:&#10;&#10;- Different board configurations. The movement track in the Disney game is noticeably longer and more complex (there are 2-3x more spaces on the board in the Disney version).&#10;&#10;- The spinner wheel for Busytown is numbered 1-4, so a player moves at most 4 spaces on his/her turn. For the Disney version, the spinner is numbered 1-8.&#10;&#10;- Different player count. Busytown is for 2-4 players; Disney is for 1-6 players.&#10;&#10;- Busytown has a built in timer. There are food pieces that the pigs are eating. The players must all get to the ferry, which leaves when they all arrive. Then, they go the the picnic island. The more food left, the higher the score. In the Disney version, all the players win or lose.&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of 10 types of rumors (each with its own symbol, such as a heart) with six cards each, for a total of 60 cards. To begin, one card is removed from play and all the remaining cards dealt out (distribution may be uneven). Players now seek to collect full sets of six rumor cards and deduce which rumor set is missing a card. Players ask another about their hand, e.g. &quot;Do you have three hearts?&quot; Players need only respond with an answer of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; if the&#10;number asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the&#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points &#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.&#10;&#10;",

Many other questions involve bodily functions and are just meant to be gross, and a few are adult in that they challenge religious ideas or moral gray areas. Some of the questions are tame, and could easily have been adapted into the normal game. The age of the game has been raised from 12 &amp; up to 16 &amp; up. Otherwise the game plays like the normal version of Would You Rather...?.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;&#10;In this sick, twisted, and wrong version you'll find questions that are nauseating, bizarre, and disturbing, but each is a field tested conversation starter that is guaranteed to provide ridiculous fun, break the ice at any party and--if played correctly--open a unique window into the twisted imaginations of friends and family!&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Zobmondo!! Would You Rather...? TSW comes in a square psychedelic (lava lamp patterned) box. It contains a game board and introduces Challenge Cards to make game play even more diverse and fun. This version has content that is more edgy than any of our other games. This is truly the new Twisted, Sick &amp; Wrong Version. As with the Original Zobmondo!! game, this game is not for the easily squeamish. It creates an outrageous, hilarious evening of fun by pushing the envelope.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

As well as in the original game, in War Cards each player commands an army and have objectives like conquer certain continents or a number of territories determined in the Objective Cards. Another new feature in War Cards are the special power cards, wich gives various abilities for the player to use. In the boardgame the combats are decided with dice rolls. In War Cards the combats are decided through the cards depicting dice in various combinations. War Cards plays faster than the boardgame (about 45 minutes), and unites strategy with a little luck.

The players are presidents of &quot;minor&quot; football teams and must try to survive to a championship among a lot of misfortunes (such as love affairs with soubrettes and striking players) and in the meantime gain a good placement in the League, major teams not withstanding. Each president buys one or more superstar players and then fields his team to play against other teams. The match is played via dice rolls and adding bonuses and penalties due to coaches, players, referees and event cards. The board is modular so that it may change for every game, and there are many cards, although some have no effect on the game (even though they give a very sharp view of the Italian football championship). A very nice and funny game that cost the developer some legal actions due to real names used in the game itself. In Italian language only.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the box and website:&#10;&#10;The King has died without an Heir!!&#10;&#10;Gather enough allies and power to claim the throne for yourself.&#10;&#10;Will your reign be one of chivalry and bravery? Or one of diplomacy and deception? Will it be of prosperity and fertility or will the endless struggle throw the country into a devastating rebellion?&#10;&#10;Time is against you as you join the chaotic era of the Rising Kings!&#10;&#10;&#10;Rising Kings is a fun and entertaining cardgame for adults and kids age 12 years and up.&#10;&#10;Each box contains 97 cards, a rulebook (English, Danish and German) and 15 overview cards (English, Danish and German).&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Players draw cards from a shared playdeck and play cards from their hands. Every card is put into play and has an effect when played. A few cards have an ongoing effect - like the Fortress and the Cityguard.&#10;&#10;There are three types of cards: characters, buildings and rebellions. Each player can play one character card, one building card and any number of rebellion cards on his turn.&#10;&#10;When the last card is drawn from the playdeck the game ends. Each player is awarded points for buldings and characters he controls, and the one with the most points becomes the King.&#10;It is possible to get bonus points for being the one with the most characters or buildings of each type.&#10;&#10;Examples of card effects:&#10;The thief allows you to steal two cards from an opponent's hand, while the saboteur allows you to destroy a building controlled by another player.&#10;The Inn allows you to play an extra character, while the University lets you retrain and replay one of your existing characters.&#10;The Rebellion disables the effect of a Fortress or Cityguard.&#10;&#10;",

The fiends battle until one is defeated. Different combinations of dice and ink color represent different breeds of fiends, and each fiend must contain at least one body part. The object of the game is to be the last player that is able to roll at least one body part die at the beginning of his or her turn -- if you fail to do so, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;The basic turn consists of the following actions: applying &quot;minuses&quot; that your foe rolled in the previous turn, rolling your dice that are still in play, setting aside &quot;minuses&quot; to apply against your foes next turn, select your defenses against your foes attacks, array your own attacks against your opponent, recovering from stuns and wounds, and finally, suffering stuns and wounds from your opponents attacks.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds breed abilities, &quot;counting coup&quot; (winning player selects a wounded die to keep as a trophy), and multi-player rules.&#10;&#10;Chaos Progenitus is expanded by Plague Beasts.&#10;Every Plague Beasts Booster Pack contains eight more six-sided dice to build your fiends. Six are randomly selected from the three new breed colors, and the other two from the five breeds already presented in the Starter Set.&#10;&#10;Each booster has 3 Fester fiend dice, 2 Rot fiend dice, 1 Stench fiend die, and 2 random dice from the starter races.&#10;&#10;",

Before starting, the winning cards are drawn from deck 2 and the paid jetons from phase 1 are put on these cards.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards are revealed card after card and the players having these cards must discard them. The more cards are revealed, the more the chance of having one of the winning cards increases. Players are allowed to trade among each other anytime during phase 2. Such trades are more likely towards the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most jetons.&#10;&#10;Mercante in fiera is a newer version with new graphics, contents and updated game flow.&#10;&#10;",

You learn that only one of you will be allowed to board. To board the Mother Ship, you must compete against the others in a game, and win.&#10;&#10;The game. During the game you and your opponents move between Devil's Tower and the Mother Ship. As you move, you try to avoid the hidden traps that your opponents have set for you. At the same time, you try to slow your opponents' progress by creating hidden traps of your own. It's a game of mystery, of concentration, of chance. To play, you'll need nerves of steel. To win, you'll need a few lucky breaks. It's exciting. It's fun. It's unusual. Best of all, it's a game designed to be shared by the entire family.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Quiet in the classroom!&quot; You crouch in your desk, maybe the teacher will not notice that you threw your rubber and that you're now reading your comic-book, or that Annicka is just whispering something to Hasse and just imagine getting caught cheating at your next exam...&#10;&#10;This is a game for ages 8 and up. The box contains a board, 1 teacher figurine, 6 pupil figurines, 1 die, 90 pupil cards, 20 teacher cards and 1 class book.&#10;&#10;Once more trouble in the class room, the pupils are busy with everything but their lessons. The teacher is doing his uttermost best to prevent disturbances. Unannounced tests are the most unpleasant means for that. But also tell-tales and careerists are on the side of the teacher. Only those who don't get caught can win the game.&#10;&#10;For starters, every pupil gets a figurine and places it on a school bank of his choice on the board. The teacher places his figurine on the desk on the board. Teacher cards and pupil cards are shuffled in separate stacks. Every pupil gets 4 cards from the their stack. The teacher gets 4 cards from his stack.&#10;&#10;The pupils get to play their cards before the teacher, they have to keep their card turned up side down. The teacher rolls the die after he has played his card. The die indicates how far the teacher can move in the class room. The pupil sitting next to the teacher has to show his card face up. Depending on the card this pupil gets minus point, a remark in the class book, or nothing at all.&#10;&#10;After this all pupils and the teacher place their played card on the discard stack and draw a new card from their stack..&#10;A round ends when the teacher has to play the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The next player (clockwise) becomes teacher for the next round. The game comes to an end when every player has played the teacher role and the last teacher has played the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The winner of the game is the player with the fewest minus points.&#10;&#10;Despite the shared name and the similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Vorsicht Lehrer!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. &#10;2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. &#10;3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. &#10;4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. &#10;5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. &#10;6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.&#10;&#10;7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!&#10;&#10;8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).&#10;&#10;9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!&#10;&#10;10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!&#10;&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;",

We come to know them through traditional tales, wherein they do this for many reasons: purely for fun, to devour mortals or steal their souls, and so on. But this card game is about kitsune who play tricks to punish mortal fools for their foolishness, sometimes teaching them a lesson in the process. By correcting mortal foolishness, the foxes earn their tails. Those who gain all nine tails of the mythical spirit fox earn their place among the kitsune elders.&#10;&#10;This is a game of luck and tactics, where each player takes the role of a fox trying to earn his or her tails. Some cards represent the foxes; others, the tricks they can play in their schemes, the fools they must teach lessons to, and the consequences that befall foxes who fail. Suitable for ages 13 and up, Kitsune: of Foxes &amp; Fools is relatively family friendly, but does include some themes suggestive of violence, sexuality, drug use, and a few cards have mild rude language. It's about teaching lessons to profoundly foolish individuals, after all.&#10;&#10;The box comes with 15 fox cards, 70 fool cards(35 uniques),100 tricks(40 uniques), 60 consequences(30 uniques), 70 double-sided fox-fire tokens, 70 tail tokens, 2 d10, and 1 rule booklet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zombie Fried is a card game where you are a survivor of the Zombie apocalypse.  My fellow Zombies and I now rule the world, and for some reason you humans are trying to prove to each other that you&rsquo;re the best Zombie killer.  You use the few resources that are at your disposal in an attempt to dispose of me and my kin, or to sabotage the other survivors&rsquo; attempts to take out the biggest and best of our kind.&#10;&#10;The object of Zombie Fried is to collect the most points in your Brain Pan, because obviously you can&rsquo;t win without the brains.  You do this by (unfairly to me and my friends) bagging Zombies.  For those of you who are not strong enough (or too lazy) to bag Zombies on your own, you can hire a Big Damn Hero, or BDH, to bag Zombies for you.  You and your BDH use whimsical Zombie killing weapons crafted from the meager resources left after the apocalypse, often modifying them with unusual items to make them inflict more damage on us (innocent) Zombies.&#10;&#10;As if weapons weren&rsquo;t enough, you use Action Plans to help you achieve your goal, often using those same Action Plans to place traps on us poor, unsuspecting Zombies.  I can&rsquo;t be too upset, however, if you&rsquo;re trapping us to prevent other survivors from killing us.  I also fully support your use of Reality Checks to mess with the other pesky survivors&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;So if you dare to challenge me, Lord Dead &lsquo;N Buried, go ahead and try.   Foil your fellow survivors&rsquo; plans with traps and Reality Checks, equip and enhance your weapons, hire a BDH, and try not to get eaten.

    "Description": "Battlecards are best decribed as a &quot;scratch-and-slay trading card game&quot; that preceded the popular Magic: The Gathering, and Pok&#195;&#169;mon Trading Card Game craze.&#10;&#10;There were a great variety of cards arranged into types which included artist profiles, quests, tactics, advanced game rules, checklists, spells, and shields, but the main cards were Fighters.&#10;&#10;Each Fighter card had a series of 25 silver scratch panels around its main central illustration to represent locations of the body. For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.&#10;&#10;Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.&#10;&#10;Two different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively &quot;winning&quot; the game). The #140 card was available in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs. There are also extra rules to cater for using shields in the UK version.&#10;&#10;Buy Microbadge&#10;&#10;&#10;",

While the game's core components offer an easy-to-learn and fast-pace co-op experience, the included &quot;Adventure Packs&quot; not only expand the game, but modify the rulebook itself.&#10;&#10;Each player takes control of a ridiculous hero setting off to explore the world of Awful Fantasy and defeat the threats that seek to ruin it. Gameplay is quick and engaging; each player will take their turn by drawing a new threat card and attempting to overcome an existing threat in play. Players will have to overcome specific threats to complete their quest. Once all players complete their quest, the players are victorious! However, if even one hero succumbs to the threats before them, all players are defeated.&#10;&#10;The &quot;self-expanding&quot; nature of Awful Fantasy Adventures lets players expand and customize their game at their own pace. Each &quot;Adventure Pack&quot; contains new cards and new rules stickers to apply to the pages of the rules, introducing new powers and new dangers to the game. Play until you've mastered the game, and then crack open an adventure pack for fresh challenges and enticing rewards!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World&quot; is a somewhat obscure wargame by Task Force Games based on (albeit without attribution) the SF-novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot; by the Jewish author Norman Spinrad. This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.&#10;&#10;A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.&#10;&#10;Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.&#10;&#10;The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.&#10;&#10;",

If all the possible choices for a roll have been filled, then you must score zero points on another line of your choice.&#10;&#10;If you score 18 or more points on the upper half of the score sheet, then you receive 10 bonus points. (Note that unlike Yahtzee, each symbol is worth only one point; note also that in the lower section, each line has a specific scoring combination, e.g. three elephants score only with two bears, not with a two of something else. Roll five identical items, and you get a 10-point bonus. Whoever has the highest score when all the score sheets are filled wins!&#10;&#10;",

The deck is made up of 135 cards in 7 different colored suits. Each suit is made up of 17 color cards and 2 colored Stop cards. The remaining 2 cards are Superstop cards.&#10;&#10;The basic flow of the game is that everyone grabs cards with one hand and puts it into their other hand until a stop card surfaces and someone yells &quot;Stop &lt;color&gt;&quot; for the color of the stop card. Any players in the process of picking up a card can add this card to their pile. Then, each player counts the number of cards of that color and the player with the fewest (or tied for the fewest) cards in that color receives a -1 card from the initial stock of 15 -1 cards. Additionally, if any player has cards out of order in their hand (not grouped by color), they receive an additional -1. The player who called the Stop then calls Go and the mayhem continues. Superstops cause the play to be stopped and the total number of cards to be compared, with the person with the fewest cards receiving a -1. The game ends immediately when the last -1 card is given out, and the winner is the player with the fewest -1 cards.&#10;&#10;",

You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.&#10;&#10;If you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.&#10;&#10;Wands is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.&#10;&#10;Wands is not a collectible card game.  You only need one set of cards; there's nothing to collect; no booster packs; no rarity; no drafts.  This is the full game.&#10;&#10;",

The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.&#10;&#10;Characters&#10;There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's &quot;Inner Force&quot; (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.&#10;&#10;Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.&#10;&#10;The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.&#10;&#10;The rules contain sections for &quot;How to play with 3 Players&quot; and &quot;How to play with 2 Players&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn. The game limit is set by the usage of the Patent Claim clips. When the last one is used, the game ends.  The player with the highest combined total of cash on hand invention value wins.&#10;&#10;",

Two speed settings on Jolly O &ndash; fast and really, really fast &ndash; give you two ways to challenge your crab-plucking skills.&#10;&#10;The first player to retrieve all of her crabs from the safety of Jolly O's squishy bosom wins!&#10;&#10;",

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.&#10;&#10;The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.&#10;&#10;Designed by William Nester and Eric R. Harvey&#10;Map design: Joe Youst&#10;Counters: Trevor Holman&#10;&#10;",

Beat down all those who stand in your way, while picking up such &quot;High-Falootinicious&quot; Advancements as a &quot;Scamway Distributorship&quot;, a &quot;Televangelist Ministry&quot; or that Mecca of the Maudlin &quot;Earl's Roadside Shrine and Gift Emporium&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Santa VS Jesus is a challenge based party game for two teams (min 4 &ndash; max 16 players). The aim is to win believers from each other and proof once and for all who really rules Christmas.. well until the next game that is.&#10;&#10;The game starts with dividing into two teams and choosing who will be on Team Santa and who will be on Team Jesus. At this point team members will decide which character will represent them in the game. They can choose from the following characters:&#10;&#10;Team Santa: Santa, Mrs. Claus, Rudolph, Prancer, Vixen or one of the elves: Sugarplum, Eggnog or Candy Cane.&#10;&#10;Team Jesus: Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Angel Gabriel, Donkey or one of the three Wisemen: Myrr, Frank or Gold.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has chosen their character they have to refer to each other by these names, if they don&rsquo;t and are called out by the opposing team they will lose a believer card.  Each team starts with 8 Believer cards. If less than 16 players are taking part all the remaining character cards will need to stay near as they will be used for certain challenges.&#10;&#10;From this point on the game explains it self. The teams compete in challenges to prove to their believers that they are more worthy of their adulation than the other team. If they loose a challenge their believers will lose faith and they cross over to the opposing team. There are TEAM and VERSUS challenges. The challenges involve puzzles, riddles, knowledge-based quizzes, orientation games and many more.  You never know how you&rsquo;ll be challenged next.&#10;&#10;",
