There are four symmetrically positioned large holes in the central area of the playing surface; the underlying platform prevents any more than one of these from being open at any particular time.  There are four similarly sized holes towards the perimeter of the rink.  In each quadrant around the perimeter of the board there is an area for scoring and a small hole to secure individual bumble slides.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to spin the platform.  When the platform is spun, players attempt to land their bumble in the hole.  Bumbles are introduced into the rink from player's slides.  If a bumble successfully finds a central hole that is open, that player scores a point for the round.  Any bumbles landing in the holes located near the perimeter of the rink lose a point for their player.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach ten points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the introduction:&#10;&#10;Drop Zone - Introduction&#10;&#10;As was indicated by our labeling our first publication, &quot;Great Battles of World War II - Volume 1&quot;, we always intended to publish more additions and make a series of the rules. The question quickly arose; which topic, era, theater etc. should our second volume cover? We wanted something limited in scope, but that would offer a good number of ping-pong table sized battles. We also prefer to do subjects that have not been yet covered in miniatures. Island War came immediately to mind. The battles of the Pacific islands would certainly provide the proper size actions and only a game of Great Battles scope could cover the forces and time scales needed. Finally, we could include a Canadian action (Hong Kong) - always a bonus in our view. There was also German operations in Poland, France and the Mediterranean. Finally, of course there was the whole Eastern Front to choose from. We felt, however, that we should experiment more with the system before we wrote the definitive scenario book for WWII miniatures gamers - the Steppes of Russia.&#10;&#10;I think it was Marcel Van der Sleen who first floated the idea that Great Battles was the perfect vehicle to present airborne actions. He had done a fair bit of work on Operation Market Garden and insisted that Great Battle's scope and time scale could be worked into three or four linked scenarios leading to a grand-campaign that would reflect the whole operation. In addition, Marcel claimed that very few adjustments would be needed. The movement, combat and morale would be left unchanged. We had already worked with the basic organizations in Canadians in Europe. He was correct. Great Battles remained unchanged, throughout the project. The only differences were the additions of landing rules and the use of activation cards instead of a set number of activation points.&#10;&#10;Once into the research, I found that not only did the airborne operations offer interesting scenarios, but there was &quot;a little bit for everyone&quot;. There are air-drops of course but also tank-to-tank confrontations, elite units, militia units, street fighting, battalion operations, division operation and even corps operations. In addition, the Operations Mercury (Crete) and Operation Market Garden (Holland) could be linked into a grand campaign using defined battlefields (ping-pong tables) but allowing for area-to-area movement between tables - a rarity in miniatures gaming.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, we feel that Drop Zone offers a different type of miniatures scenarios. Those that have played Canadians in Europe will immediately notice the difference, in texture, between the set-piece co-ordinated attack-defend actions and the tenuous, nail-biting to-and-fro of an airborne operation. For those who have not played the other scenarios in this series, be prepared for a new gaming experience. Your games will not simulate a 40 minute fight for the local farmhouse or crossroads. Instead, you will have to plan a multi-day operation - to land parachute brigades or even divisions behind enemy lines and then relieve them. Great Battles puts you in the general's chair where deployment and activation of forces, weather, supply, recovery and reinforcements artillery and air support are more important than the penetrating power of a shell or the armor thickness of a turret.&#10;&#10;We are quite proud of Drop Zone and very pleased that Great Battles has made the transition to this new topic with such ease. We look forward to exploring other eras and theaters with Great Battles of World War II.&#10;&#10;",

They all stood in a straight line before their sacred forest home, each having sworn an oath to protect it from these foul folk.&#10;&#10;Overhead the high elven king rode the winds upon the back of his dragon steed, but even with such a mighty beast on their side, Jarn did not think he and the other elves would hold the day. The mass of green orcs were to many he feared, and his folk far to few.&#10;&#10;Realms is the newest Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions.

No longer suffer the permanent scars of sorcery so that your own mothers won't know you, webbed feet, pointed ears (sorry Mr. Spock) and other aids to charm and elegance. See no more your followers disappear in a puff of smoke or vanish with the light of day - just put them away until next time, etc., etc., etc. This is for you, a representation of those days of long, long ago. Fight the Men of the West, defeat the powers of darkness in safety on a wargames table. By the wizardry of Miniature Manufacturers the forces of Dark and Light are reduced to 1/75th their full size. At least, manageable Treemen! Read on for further enlightenment.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Singaporean game is intended to be a 'fun way of learning total defence'. It is a simple roll-and-move game in which players move their counter around a track on the board and follow instructions based on the squares they land on. The objective of the game is to obtain one tag in each of the five components of total defence:&#10;Civil Defence&#10;Economic Defence&#10;Psychological Defence&#10;Social Defence&#10;Military Defence&#10;&#10;Points are used as currency in this game. Most of the squares give you more points or the option to buy a total defence tag at 15 points each. In addition there are bonus cards which give you goodies like more points or actions to take(e.g. moving your piece forward a certain number of steps). It's not all sweetness and light though - there are not enough total defence tags available for each player to have a full set and players can go on 'Power Hunts' which allow them to 'hunt' (steal being possibly too strong a word to feature in the game) a total defence tag from another player. Players might also have the misfortune to land on a 'Risk' square, which forces them to travel on an inner track where they might possibly land on squares that make them lose points.&#10;&#10;The game states it is for players aged 10 years to adult.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players sit side-by-side facing the bottom of the game board.  Each player has a dial on the board with 6 possible Batting options and 6 possible Pitching options. Cupping their hands over their dial to keep their selection hidden from the opponent until both players reveal their selection simultaneously, the player at bat sets their dial to one of the Batting options (A-Steal, B-Sacrifice, C-Hit or Steal, D-Hit and Run, E-Ready and Cautious (to hit if pitch looks good), F-To Hit (swing hard)) and the player on the mound selects one of the Pitching options (1-Fast Ball, 2-Curve In and Over, 3-Corner Clipper, 4-Bad Ball Break Away, 5-Pitch-Out, 6-Throw to Base). For every bases situation from No-One-On-Base to Bases Loaded there is a separate reference card conveniently held together in small notebook binder fashion. Also, there are three pitcher cards that need to be consulted for some play results, and which can be used for a little more realism about varying pitcher abilities.&#10;&#10;For the result of the play dice are rolled to see if the pitch is a ball or strike, or if a play action results.  For example, with No-One-On-Base, and the Batter sets their dial to F-To Hit Hard, and the Pitcher sets their dial to 2-Curve, and a 7 is rolled on the dice, the players would look at the No-One-on-Base card in the F-2 Column with dice roll 7 (F-2-7) and the result might be a ball, strike, hit batter, wild pitch, or one of 150 numbered plays (1-150) resulting, such as Ground Out, Fly Out, Single, Double, Triple Home Run, Error, Rain Delay (or rain out), or whatever.  There's even a Triple Play possibility -- with at least two runners on base -- but because that is a rare play it may rarely if ever happens.&#10;&#10;The game appears to be self published in 1962.  Similar to Cadaco's All-star baseball, but without cards for individual players.  Roll dice to determine play outcome.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;o Gameboard baseball field with Pitching/Batting Dial, and the field can be used to place markers to indicate runners on base (or baseball player miniatures not included).&#10;o Pitch Result Card for each runner situation (No one on base, Runner on 1st, Runner on 2nd, Runner on 3rd, Runners on 1st and 2nd, Runners on Second and 3rd, Bases Loaded).&#10;o Text of 150 play results printed on the inside of the game box top, and which is easily propped up behind the gameboard baseball field (like and outfield wall) where each of the 150 play results can easily be read.&#10;o Three pitcher cards (Rookie to Ace) for use with some hit-pitch results&#10;o Two dice&#10;&#10;All American Baseball is a fun head-to-head game with balls and strikes and 150 potential plays every pitch depending on Pitch/Hit selections made by players and a dice roll.  It does not include a lefty-righty factor, real or fictional players or abilities, speed, defense, or pitcher fatigue; the fun comes from trying to outwit your opponent with your hidden pitch and hit choices each pitch, and for the great number of potential play outcomes that are relevant to whether or not runners on on base(s).&#10;&#10;",

The hens only want to play with the other hens, the ducks with the other ducks and so on.  But Old Macdonald is busy working in the farmyard and keeps leaving his buckets in the way.&#10;&#10;Summary. The object of the game is to be the first player to gather his or her 4 animals to play together in a square formation.  Each animal starts on a separate side of the board and is moved across the farmyard (in the form of a grid) by rolling the dice.  When a six is rolled, Old Macdonald and his buckets can be placed in the way of the other players' animals.&#10;&#10;",

His foe was a conjurer of some skill and Markus knew this was just a ploy to get him to unleash his own battle magic on the conjured beast instead of the conjurer himself.&#10;&#10;Markus shifted instead to his left and drew his short sword. Years of battling goblins in the high mountain passes had taught him more then how to use his magic, but also how to use a sharp sword.&#10;&#10;As the wolf growled and made to come at his right flank, Markus began to cast his own spell. As he stood there chanting the magical words of the summoning, he began to burn, sheathing himself in magical fire.&#10;&#10;The wolf then leaped, but almost instantly howled as the fire that now surrounded Markus burned and caught the wolf's fur on fire. Racing about the cold stone, the conjured beast cried in panic and fled&#10;&#10;Meanwhile its master readied another spell as Markus turned to meet him.&#10;&#10;This was not going to be an easy fight Markus thought as he dived for cover, his foe's bolt of lighting nearly turning the young elementalist to ash.&#10;&#10;This is Arcanist, another Mini-game by Bad Baby.

Can your magic out fight your foe's own powerful spells, or will you die some horrible death.&#10;&#10;Not a full game by itself, Arcanist requires that you also have a copy of Bad Baby's other Mini-game, Warlords.&#10;&#10;Combined, these two games will continue to develop the Worlds of Wonder RPG.&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;Track&quot; has dark brown pegs (a.k.a. a &quot;Fence&quot;) that are located on vertical lines that link the outer rings to the inner rings. Each player has to roll enough to land on the fence to remove it, no more and no less, you have to roll the exact number to land on the fence. You can then slow your enemy down by placing the fence, that you have just removed, in front of your opponent. Also, if a player, lets say Player &quot;A&quot;, lands on the same space as another player, Player &quot;B&quot;, then player B would be moved back to their starting base.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Malefiz&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Be prepared to brainstorm anything from secret codes, analogies, or missing components, to puzzles, wacky wordles, and creative problems. Some challenges require creative, off-the-wall thinking. Some are logical, requiring a right answer. Others have several possible solutions. As you begin to associate each color/element with a particular type of challenge you may wish to avoid certain elements.&#10;&#10;",
