Extreme weather is expected, accompanied by even more extreme photographers. Speed, split-second timing, calculated risk-taking and outsmarting the competition are your tickets to victory!&#10;&#10;Original version: Object of the game from the first page of rulebook:&#10;&#10;The players compete for three rounds then see who, on average, has taken the best tornado photos. The higher the number of points from the photos, the better. The higher the number of card, the more dangerous the photographer's location depicted, so it's important to make the right decisions during the game. At the end of each round, the players determine their average score of the photos taken in their points pile using the averages table. Each round ends when the Game Over card is picked up. After the third round, each player's lowest average score of the three is selected and the player with the highest of these lowest scores is the winner.&#10;&#10;Second Edition changes game as follows:&#10;&#10;Players no more try to get highest average during three rounds. Instead, they try to get as much points as possible during each round and players can play any number of rounds as well. This makes averages table obsolete in second edition. Some card functions are also streamlined to make game play faster and more intuitive. Rules of the second edition are only in english and finnish.&#10;&#10;The game box contains:&#10;&#10;75 cards (21 different types of)&#10;15 +1/-1 markers&#10;1 two-sided score table&#10;1 score pad (50 pages)&#10;Includes German, French, English, Dutch, Swedish and Finnish rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;By August 1950 the North Korean Army had overrun most of the Korean peninsula, and was advancing rapidly toward Pusan, the last open port in South Korea.&#10;&#10;The US Army hastily formed a perimeter along the arcing Naktong River to stop &mdash; or at least delay &mdash; the final North Korean breakthrough. Every available US unit in Korea, including a Marine brigade, was thrown into the fight against three North Korean infantry divisions converging to crush what became known as the &quot;Naktong Bulge.&quot;&#10;&#10;Naktong Bulge utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From fighter -bombers to artillery, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon company, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by howitzers &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry battalion defending a mountain pass. As its attack gets underway, however, the recon company may find itself under fire from heavy artillery. More support will be necessary to take the pass, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Naktong Bulge the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of combat during the Korean War. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the Korean War. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;",

Two of the advancing Union armies in the Western Theater hadn't yet converged. The Confederates thus perceived a rare opportunity to concentrate against Grant's six divisions at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River. Organized into four corps, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston marched his men 20 miles from Corinth, Mississippi, toward the Federal troops bivouacked along a skirmish line extending from the bank of the Tennessee River to the small &quot;Shiloh&quot; church inland.&#10;&#10;Shiloh utilizes an all-new Musket &amp; Saber combat system, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War.

Robert E. Lee saw an opportunity to annihilate them on the congested roads between White Oak Swamp and the small community of Glendale. Lee's army included most of the notable Confederate luminaries, such as &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, &quot;Old Pete&quot; Longstreet, A. P. Hill and others, collectively fielding 45,000 men. The Federals, numbering about 40,000, had become disjointed as they attempted to reach and cross the James River. At the same time, though, the Confederate approach became uncoordinated and irregular. The mass of the battle eventually pivoted north of Nelson's Farm, known to the locals by its former owner's name, Frayser.&#10;&#10;Frayser's Farm utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War.

The maze is full of monsters called Maziacs who will try their best to kill the hero. Fortunately they're not very intelligent, but can be deadly if you're caught off guard...&#10;&#10;The game uses tiles to build a new random maze each play and mechanics to create a unique path towards the treasure. This path is slowly uncovered by the player by asking prisoners that can be found randomly through the maze. Also, the Maziacs will appear randomly and try to kill the hero, but as long as he has a sword, he'll be safe. There's also a mechanic that will adjust the chance of a new Maziac appearing based on the number of Maziacs already on the board and the distance from the exit.&#10;&#10;In the end, it's all about beating the game system, either as a solo or cooperative game, trying to maneuver through the tight corridors fooling Maziacs into dead ends and finding the correct path to the treasure.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the great ZX Spectrum game &quot;Maziacs&quot; programmed by Don Priestley. He was kind enough to allow the designer of this game to use the same name.&#10;&#10;",

Besides, there are two types of arrows: one-way (self explanatory) and multidirectional (the user may choose among two o three possibilities).

    "Description": "The game board is an 8x8 grid which consists of 16 groups of four holes. Each hole is assigned a number between 1 and 4 (same alignment on the entire board). Each player has 16 playing pieces in his/her color. &#10;At the beginning, the players take turns rolling a four-sided die and can place one of their pieces in any of the holes with the number that was rolled. The aim is to form squares and lines of four pieces either completely in one's own color or in two colors (two pieces each, together with another player). A single color square or line counts 2 points, a shared one 1 point for each of the involved players. &#10;When all holes of one number are filled, the die is put aside and the players place the pieces at their discretion for the remainder of the game (thus the luck factor is eliminated and the game proceeds as a pure abstract strategy game. &#10;When all the holes are filled, the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

Be the first to gather your Animals, Wood, and Nails, but be warned, everyone else wants the same, and competition is fierce!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players play Supply cards, trying to fulfill the minimum requirements for their ark: three Wood cards, three Nail cards, and three Animal cards.  However, everyone also has God Calling cards that aid or hinder the players, making them require more cards to complete their ark, discard cards, or counter other God Calling cards.  Play is fast and frantic, as players play their cards as fast as they can.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;American Throttle, The Game is in a few words, a &ldquo;Poker Run&rdquo; that tours the United States. It&rsquo;s about having some drinks, some fun and some laughs. Share stories of rallies you&rsquo;ve been to like Laughlin, Sturgis or Daytona. Belch a name, take a swig of your drink, tell a joke, name that song, guess who was in that biker movie, or even give unwanted advice! Test your knowledge of motorcycling, motorcycle trivia, and road skills. You can even invite your family or friends who don&rsquo;t ride, since they can play to win too! They will learn a lot about riding either from you or this game!&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win: finish first to win half the game, draw the best poker hand to win the other half of the game. It&rsquo;s smarts and luck. This is a drinking game, so it is geared toward adults. However if you forego the alcohol and let young adults in on the fun, American Throttle is actually a general audience, sometimes educational, definitely fun game for them too. In other words, we didn&rsquo;t put in a bunch of junk. This is about riding!&#10;&#10;Here is how it is played: Up to seven players or teams of players per game. Put money (or anything you would like) in the Pot. Pick one of 15 motorcycle playing pieces &amp; take your first poker card. Start in the upper northwest and roll the die to tour the country. Pick another poker card at each rally you visit. The person to reach the end, or Hollister Rally first wins half the Pot. The person with the best poker hand wins the other half of the Pot. So, anyone can win! Oh yeah and it makes a great Christmas gift for the biker, the game player, or the person who has everything (because they probably don&rsquo;t have one of these).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Idle hands are the devil's playground... and our robot lawnmowers proved to be too efficient.  In the future, humanity's lawns lay perfectly maintained by a machine workforce with time to think... time to develop an agenda.  Humankind was unprepared for the Lawnmower Uprising, and the world quickly fell into ruin.&#10;The players are some of the few remaining humans, attempting to run a gauntlet of vigilant mowerbots to recover a fallen EMP warhead.  With this, the humans can shut down the mowerbots long enough to win back their world. The humans have one thing going for them: As the first act of their rebellion against their slavedriving creators, the mowerbots deleted their grass-mowing directives, and now will not touch the stuff, reserving their whirling blades for mankind alone.  Now the world is full of ruins and patches of grass grown out of control.  Both provide some cover for our valiant heroes as they strive to retrieve the warhead and save the day.&#10;&#10;Players deal a deck of cards to construct the board they will navigate, then use a second deck to place the player pieces, the robot counters, and the warhead.  A die is rolled for each robot, assigning it a movement pattern.  Players may move through two empty spaces, through one grass space, may climb a wall or climb down a wall each turn.  If they approach a robot from the rear and have only moved one space, they may use the additional movement to attack the robot, which will disable it if successful or change the machine's movement pattern if not.&#10;&#10;Robots see only in the direction they are facing, and if the player is in their line of sight, he rolls to see if he is spotted. If in the same space, the player needs to roll better than a 6 on 1d6, if one space away, a 5 or better and so on.  Being in or behind grass increases the player's roll by 1, actively hiding adds 2 to the roll.  If sighted, the robot will move directly to the player, even through grass (though normally robots turn when they run into grass), proceeding to the tile the player was last seen at, then resuming their pattern.  Robots move 2 spaces per turn, 1 if through grass, and cannot climb.  If a robot has sighted a player and enters the players' space, or a sighted player enter's the robot's space from the direction the robot is facing, the player dies.  Player wins when all robots are disabled or the warhead is recovered and returned to the player's origin tile.&#10;Note: Changing facing counts as a move, i.e., a player or robot may move 2 or move one and turn one facing, or move 2 facings if not in grass.  If in grass, a player or robot may EITHER move 1, or change one facing. A player can change facing while on top of a wall, but will not be able to do it in the same round as he climbs up or down, as it will 2 moves to do either.  Walls completely hide whatever is behind them, but not what is on top of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Leningrad &rsquo;41: What If Manstein had Attacked? (L&rsquo;41), designed by Joseph Miranda, is a two-player alternative history wargame of intermediate complexity that simulates a hypothetical German attempt to seize the city of Leningrad in late July through August 1941. The assumption is Manstein, rather than pausing for two weeks as he did historically, simply charged ahead into the city immediately upon crossing the Luga River.&#10;&#10;To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander&rsquo;s-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the Soviet defending force from the city prior to the end of the game. L&rsquo;41 uses the system originally created for our earlier published Manila&rsquo;45 game.&#10;&#10;Each game turn equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for the Germans are mainly battalions, while those for the Soviets range from battalions to regiments and brigades. Thus each unit may represent anywhere from 100 to 5,000 men and their equipment.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: fog of war, replacements, reinforcements, defensive fire, indirect fire, combat air support, command control, leaders, fanaticism, gunboats, the cruiser Aurora, the Komsomol, the metro, and optional German airborne assault. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. German Player Turn&#10;A. German Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase&#10;B. German Air Strike Phase&#10;C. German Movement &amp; Soviet Defensive Phase&#10;D. German Offensive Fire Phase&#10;&#10;II. Soviet Player Turn&#10;A. Soviet Reinforcement Phase (skip on Game Turn 1)&#10;B.

There are also a few squares with instructions like &quot;miss a turn&quot; and &quot;Move forward 3 spaces&quot;. All other squares that do not have a bomb or instructions on them have a fraction. Whenever a player lands on a fraction, they add it to their own cumulative score. The aim of the game is not to be the first to reach the last square, but to have the highest total sum of fractions among all players once everyone has reached the last square.&#10;&#10;The game is copyright of Government of Singapore and the graphic design is copyright of Noble Education.com (indicated on the board)&#10;&#10;The game does not come in a box, but in a large transparent sleeve which holds the laminated cardboard board and bits.&#10;&#10;",

It allows for space combat in worlds where ships tow each other by grappling hooks or by tractor beams, where space marines board by teleporting onto the other ship or by laser-cutting open holes in the hull, and where faster-than-light travel happens by a single instantaneous jump, or by traveling days in a warp bubble that allows ships to chase and fight each other while racing at speeds beyond comprehension.&#10;&#10;",

Kaufmann) and was intended to be used as a multi-functional support submarine.&#10;&#10;But when a small craft that could fit into the Dimension Processor was desperately needed, the NEAK became a Sub-vascular Nautical Exploration and Alimentation Konstruktum, and thus the S.N.E.A.K. became our last hope.&#10;&#10;In this game, one to four players take control of a crew and a submarine each, which are induced into the blood vessels of a patient, who is in the process of being assimilated by nanobots.&#10;&#10;Each round a new area of the vascular system is laid open, and new nanobots strive to destroy the intruder/ to destroy nerve cells of the patient/ to repair the damage to other bots or the body of the patient.&#10;&#10;Different special abilities of the crew members are applied to ease the tasks at hand, but having a too large crew on board can quickly result in a failure in the mission and black outs due to the near end of the air supply on board.&#10;&#10;A game-card system from seven (and later nine) cards is the driving mechanic for most tests and tasks.&#10;&#10;Created for the Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest, held by Rudolf Aligierski in May/June 2010.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's description:&#10;&#10;Salamanca: Marmont vs Wellington covers the turning point of the 1812 campaign on the Spanish Peninsula, where Wellington showed he was not just a skilled defender, but could also deliver a decisive attack. It uses the Napoleon's Later Campaigns system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of Napoleonic battles.  Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!).  To win, you have to use your army like a Napoleonic commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go.  How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.&#10;&#10;The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of Napoleonic command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are provided for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire.  Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.&#10;&#10;The Salamanca special rules deal with particular units of the campaign (such as the British Light Division), reverse slope defense (used by the French in this battle!), and supply.  Scenarios cover the historical battle (playing time 2-3 hours between experienced players), and the full day (3-4 hours), enabling both sides to set the strategy for the battle as they choose.  Can you repeat Wellington's crushing victory or, as Marmont, draw your head out of the noose?&#10;&#10;Scale: &#10;500m per hex&#10;1 hour per turn&#10;brigade level units&#10;Individual army and division commanders&#10;&#10;A professionally produced version of the game is planned for the future through Clash of Arms Games.&#10;&#10;",
