Sadly, Tom Speed's award for Best Actor was accepted posthumously by his wife, Zara Vicars, as Tom was killed in a driving accident late last night.&#10;&#10;Despite this note of sadness, celebrations are in full swing at the The Vampire Detective post-award party. Deals are being cut for future productions and everyone is having a good time enjoying the atmosphere and mingling with Hollywood's movers and shakers.&#10;&#10;Is there anything suspicious about Tom Speed's death?

With a successful nine month tour behind them, the performers and staff of the Bonanza are making plans for a restful and rewarding off-season.&#10;&#10;As the curtain falls on the final Big Top performance, a select few gather in JoJo Bones' Exotic Emporium of Enigmatica (part of the Bonanza). To celebrate the successful tour, JoJo will host a night of revelry, food, drink and, this year, what JoJo has promised to be &quot;startling revelations.&quot; Tragically, however, JoJo was killed last night. His body was found early this morning in the lions' cage, mauled by lions Gladys and Mountjoy. Since JoJo's body reeked of alcohol, preliminary reports are that he wandered into the cage in a drunken stupor.&#10;&#10;But, the show must go on and the post-season party will continue - and so the selected performers and staff of Bo Bennett's Big Top Bonanza assemble to remember JoJo and celebrate the successful season. This may be their last chance to seal their fates for the future...&#10;&#10;Under the Big Top lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening.

    "Description": "This unpublished prototype board game was originally in Sid Sackson's game collection before it came into my possession.&#10;&#10;The game shows some similarities to Parker Brothers' Six Million Dollar Man game and may be a very early version of the game.  The mechanics are more complex than the average children's roll-and-move game.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of four cards at the start of the game and draw one card at the start of each turn.  There are several different types of cards in the deck:&#10;&#10;- Bionics Cards (Cards for Steve Austin's Bionic Eye, Bionic Arm, and Bionic Leg abilities)&#10;- &quot;Wild&quot; Bionics Cards (May be used as any type of Bionics)&#10;- Move Opponent&#10;- Set Obstacle&#10;- Remove Obstacle&#10;&#10;Some of the spaces on the board are marked with one or more bionics symbols that represent cards the player must use to get past that particular challenge.  For example, you may need to use a Bionic Eye card to spot an enemy airplane or use one Bionic Arm and two Bionic Leg cards in order to swim across a treacherous river.  A player landing on one of these spaces must discard the needed cards before being able to move again.&#10;&#10;The obstacles are balanced by the paths that the player can take across the board.  The shortest path from start to finish is densely populated with some heavy challenge spaces (requiring up to four cards to get past).  By contrast, the longer routes have a smaller density of challenge spaces, usually with one to two card challenges.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the players move by the difference of a roll of two dice.  Roll two dice and subtract the lower number from the higher to determine how far you move.  This means that rolling doubles means you get zero; you don't move.&#10;&#10;The rules I have are incomplete.  They do not explain how to use the Move Opponent, Set Obstacle, or Remove Obstacle cards.&#10;&#10;",

It shifts the focus from the individual to the squad.

Accompanying them will be various individual models that represent important officers and characters, and larger more powerful war machines and vehicles.&#10;&#10;Each faction has a different battle-force structure. Various basic squads form the foundation of their battle-forces, with the mix of support, assault, and elite squads, and the accompanying individuals and war machines, giving each their own unique flavour.&#10;&#10;",

These are used with the new tactical and operational rules provided; unlike the standard game rules that treat all airships the same, with the Zeppelins module, each airship class has its own range and endurance qualities.&#10;&#10;Every airship that played an important role in the First World War is present, both German Navy and German Army machines that scouted for the High Seas Fleet and attacked naval targets. The ultra-long-range &quot;Africa Ship&quot; L59 is present, along with the big, modern L100 class canceled by the war's end.&#10;&#10;The Royal Navy maintained a large fleet of airships, and the British get the Italian-built semi-rigid airship SR-1 along with the many rigid airships built at war's end. Italy built a large number of semi-rigid airships (with a solid keel rather than a complete frame as with a true zeppelin) and these are also included.&#10;&#10;The United States Navy gets its Shenandoah and Los Angeles, and the United States Army the big semi-rigid airship Roma. The French Dixmude, a former German zeppelin, is here as are Austria-Hungary's small contingent.&#10;&#10;New airship-centered scenarios, or modifications of current scenarios, are included for many of the Great War at Sea series games: Mediterranean, Jutland, U.S. Navy Plan Gold, U.S. Navy Plan Red and Dreadnoughts.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike chess, all 11 players move the same way.  However, the goal keeper must stay in his goal and the 2 defenders cannot leave their own half of the field.&#10;&#10;Movements can be done as far as wanted and movements with 2 players in one turn are also possible. There are some rules included, which preclude having the ball totally surrounded by players. The most unusual (and surprisingly simple) of these rules is the rule that the ball always moves 1 space further than a player.&#10;&#10;",

They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;",
