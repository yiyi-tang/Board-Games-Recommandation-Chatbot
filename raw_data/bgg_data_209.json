Players draft six weakness cards (five of which are their real weaknesses and a fake one), players pick three cards from their hands and tell stories about their weaknesses and others guess whether each stories are real or fake.&#10;&#10;2. Players take six weakness/strength cards (one side is weakness and the other side shows strength), open a situation card in the middle of the table, each player picks one card from hand and explain how the weakness or strength can help them overcome the situation they are facing, then they vote who told the most persuasive story.&#10;&#10;3. Open top five cards from the deck and lay them on the table weakness-side up, one player becomes a protagonist, everyone including the protagonist him or herself picks two weaknesses that are most likely the protagonist's personality and write the card numbers on their sheets. Each correct guess gives you a point.&#10;&#10;To achieve victory, you must try hard to understand other players&rsquo; characteristics and also make yourself appealing.&#10;&#10;&#10;     You can play FLIP with people you&rsquo;ve just met or people you&rsquo;ve known for a long time.&#10;&#10;&#10;A few examples of the weakness/strength cards:&#10;(I'm stubborn/I have strong will)&#10;(I act without thinking/I enjoy challenging myself)&#10;(I take too much time to make decisions/I think deeply first, and then act)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game L&rsquo;ATTAQUE is an early predecessor of the nowadays more widely known Stratego. It was designed by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, who filed a patent for a 'jeu de bataille avec pi&egrave;ces mobiles sur damier' (a battle game with mobile pieces on a gameboard) on 26 Nov 1908. The patent was released by the French Patent Office in 1909 (patent #396.795).&#10;&#10;Hermance Edan marketed her own invention from 1909 to early 1930. In 1910, she named her game &quot;L'Attaque&quot;. Gibsons obtained the publishing rights to sell L'Attaque in English-speaking countries from 1925, but kept the French name.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 36 pieces each on a 9x10 square board. Each piece has a numeric value, which is hidden from the opponent and only revealed when an attacking piece moves onto a square occupied by an opponent's piece. In most cases, the piece with the highest value wins and the losing piece is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player finds the opponent's flag piece and takes it.&#10;&#10;There have been some revised editions of this Game, including a very rare &lsquo;5-bridges&rsquo; 10x10 board, later used as the basis of Sharpe's Attack, and a 100th anniversary of Gibsons games edition. The basic gameplay has been used to implement various other Gibsons games; Dover Patrol, Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence, Battle of Britain (Gibsons English fifth edition) and Tri-Tactics. It forms the basis of the near identical Stratego produced by Jumbo. French publisher Au Jeu Retrouv&#195;&#169; produced a version of the game Jeu de la Quille in 1975, modifying the illustrations of the parts.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Stratego&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;    Jeu de la Quille&#10;&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Battle of Britain (Gibsons English fifth edition)&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Longships is a Viking-themed plunder/trading game. Players start in the North Sea with an empty Longship each, surrounded by four countries: Denmark, Norway, Scotland and England. Players have to start with plundering at least one country each in order to get some initial resources to trade with. Trading is driven by differences in the countries' resources; each country produces 2 out of the 4 resources Cloth, Furs, Thralls and Mushrooms. Nearby countries differ on one resource only, while countries on opposite sides of the North Sea have a totally different set of resources. Long-distance trading is thus more profitable, but also more dangerous as changing weather conditions can make open sea-traveling fatal.&#10;&#10;The countries themselves are weak in defense and easy to plunder. However, plundering a country weakens its trading potential, so that Vikings need to defend countries they build their trade on from Vikings plundering. Plundering a country also makes its population hostile to you, so that you can't build or repair Longships there, making you more vulnerable on expeditions to those countries. The key to success is thus to keep your hostilities at an optimal level.&#10;&#10;Resources gained from trading or plundering can be sacrificed to the gods in order to gain additional actions. Sacrificing Thralls to Odin gets you new fresh men to throw into the fights, sacrificing to Thor lets you change the weather conditions, get yourself a beneficial trade wind or sink your foes with mighty storms. Mushrooms make you go berserk and fight and plunder more efficiently, while Freya helps cities grow and prosper and give more trading opportunities.&#10;&#10;Resources can also be used to build new Longships, increasing the Viking's trading and military power. Just like in real life, the winner at the end of the game is the player with the most Longships.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Vici, players become military generals, leading their battle-hardened men on an ancient battlefield. Under each general&rsquo;s command are armies of varying strengths and abilities. Players take turns deploying pieces into their Camps and advancing them down the game board toward their opponent&rsquo;s Camp. There four different types of pieces that represent legions of soldiers: they are fierce Footmen, stoic Spearmen, heavily armored Horsemen, and battle-ready Bowmen.&#10;&#10;As a general, players are tasked with strategically matching their pieces against ones that they are strong against. At melee combat, Footmen slaughter Spearmen, Spearmen skewer charging Horsemen, and Horsemen trample Footmen. Bowmen are a deadly asset at a distance with the advantage of ranged combat but are utterly defenseless when attacked at close range.&#10;&#10;Even with an advantage, nothing is 100% certain with Vici&rsquo;s mechanic of rolling Battle Dice. While an advantage in combat gives you an extra Battle Die, fate may not be on your side once the defending and attacking strengths on the dice are revealed. Choose your moves wisely and conquer your opponent&rsquo;s army. Only with cunning strategy can you outmaneuver your enemies and achieve glory!&#10;&#10;",

As the captain of your small ship, you have one goal: to follow the rumors, make the discoveries, and bathe in the fortune and glory that comes with it! Will you have what it takes to become the world's most famous explorer?&#10;&#10;Salt and Sail is an exploration and discovery game, set during the great Age of Sail. 2 to 5 players take on the role of an intrepid captain, in search of fame and fortune. Along the way, you will hire Officers to assist you, purchase new ships and unique tools, and sell goods and treasure to fund your expeditions. But, be careful--possible encounters with pirates isn't your only concern: the other player captains are trying to make those rare discoveries first and steal the glory for themselves!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Core Game Mechanics:&#10;- Modular hex board that is constructed based on various maps included in the rulebook. These maps provide various ways to play the game and customize game length and depth based on player count and time allowances.&#10;- Bag draw. Players use a Skill Bag with tokens to dictate success instead of using dice. The bag can be modified to augment a player's success with a particular skill.&#10;- Variable player powers. Players can recruit Officers with unique abilities and skills, purchase new ships with different strengths and weaknesses, and even equip said ships with tools to further augment their power.&#10;- Emphasis on discovery. While there are elements of adventure (fighting pirates, navigating through storms) that will cause players to react in various ways to overcome, and even some economics to drive item acquisition, the core concept is to use Rumor cards and reach various tokens on the board, wherein players can attempt to make Discoveries. It is through these discoveries that players will generate the most Fame Points (Victory Points).&#10;&#10;",

You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.&#10;&#10;With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.&#10;&#10;You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.&#10;&#10;To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...&#10;&#10;From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success?

    "Description": "Winner of both the Judges' and People's Choice awards for 'Best Abstract Game' at the UK Games Expo 2018, and of Imagination Gaming's 'Family Gold Award'.&#10;&#10;In Thieves, two players compete to steal a hoard of gold from the heart of a dragon&rsquo;s lair. Through a labyrinth, with doorways that open and close with every roll of a pair of dice, they direct the moves and actions of their gangs of thieves. Players have three goals: to take the treasure, to keep it, and to escape with it.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game its dice deliver sudden reversals of fortune, challenging players&rsquo;strategic skills by compelling them to keep adapting their plans. Every game played will be different and, whilst luck may affect the outcome of individual games, superior use of strategy will determine the winner of a series.&#10;&#10;The rules only take a few minutes to learn. Games typically take 30 minutes, although fortune with the dice, the skill of the players, and the speed of play can result in shorter or longer times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game contains 86 numbered vegetable cards (6 sorts) and 24 action cards. Each player starts with 8 random vegetable cards and a identical set of 4 different action cards. The first player announces the current vegetable (for example &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;) and plays one of his cards face down (which doesn&rsquo;t need to be a carrot!). The next player has two options. He can play a face down card and announce the current vegetable (he says &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;, but also doesn&rsquo;t need to play one). Or he can doubt the card of the previous player. In the latter case he looks at the previous card. If the previous player has lied (he did not play a &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;), that player has to draw a number of cards. If the previous player did not lie, the doubting player has to draw the cards. It is possible to play an action card in stead of a vegetable card. With an action card you can change the direction of the game, change the current vegetable or force a player to draw extra cards. The game ends when a player has emptied his hand or when the draw pile is exhausted for the second time. Remaining hand cards are penalty points. The player with the fewest points wins the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Decision games website:)&#10;&#10;Pavia was the climactic clash of the Italian Wars, a decades-long struggle between Valois France and Habsburg Spain for control of Italy. Both sides have nascent pike-and-shot armies, the French still relying upon feudal knights, and the Spanish increasingly dependent on new individual firearms. Both sides also relied on mercenaries: Italian musketeers, Swiss pikemen, German Landsknechts. Tercios, too, are in their infancy; at Pavia, the battle is fought by smaller formations maneuvering in a broken, wooded area.&#10;&#10;Pavia uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map&#10;&bull;    100 die-cut counters&#10;&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;&quot;The opportunities following the swift Japanese subjugation of Burma in early January 1942 were not exploited. For their chastened opponents, Allied operations in this theater of the war were limited to raids and small-scale offensives as war efforts in North Africa and Europe, as well as the South Pacific, drew higher priorities for resources and personnel. For much of 1943 and early 1944 the fighting in Burma was relegated to WWII's backwater by both sides. With the end of the monsoon season in 1944 the strategic situation had changed. Not only were Japanese fortunes declining precipitously elsewhere, but the build-up in Allied forces along the Burma/India border did not go unnoticed. Determined to pre-empt any Allied attack, the Japanese launched an offensive of their own in May, the largest they ever launched outside of China, against the Allied positions in and around Imphal and Kohima. The battles that raged among the jungles and mountainous hillsides of the Indian and Burma frontier, and the subsequent Allied victory that followed in July, marked a fundamental and permanent shift in the war. The Allied offensive in March 1945 was one marked by extensive planning and preparation, as well bold and daring maneuvers that not only took the Commonwealth and Indian forces across the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon, but crushed the defending Imperial Japanese Burma Area Army.&#10;&#10;Defeat into Victory, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, covers this neglected aspect of WWII history using a very interactive and easy to play design. The game has one 22&quot; by 34&quot; hex map that stretches from Dimapur in the north to Rangoon in the south. A countersheet with 280 half-inch units (mostly brigade and regiments in size) and approximately 16 pages of rules and charts round out the package. The game uses a chit-pull activation system. Rules cover supply (a crucial aspect in terrain that was among the most inhospitable of the war), various types of combat (fire, maneuver and assault), as well as morale and leadership. Rules also include random events (that simulate the effects of battles and decisions by higher-ups elsewhere), weather, Japanese suicide tank attacks (human combat destruction squads) and changing war goals. The air campaign is also simulated (in much more detail than generic &quot;air points&quot;). Scenarios include the initial Japanese offensive against Imphal and Kohima, two on the Allied 1945 offensive, as well as the Campaign Game. Tough decisions will have to be made by both sides as they allocate precious resources among their formations, determine their enemy's intentions and balance their plans, as well as attack and defend. &quot;&#10;&#10;",

There are six tricks, with the winner gaining positive or negative points for each trick. However, you must play from the last (sixth) trick, followed by the fifth, fourth, etc. until the first trick. Then players resolve tricks from first to sixth according to normal non-trump trick-taking rules.&#10;&#10;To add more twist, everyone starts with one &quot;thinking&quot; card. You can play it instead of a regular card on any single trick, then replace it with the remaining card you have in your hand once cards are resolved.&#10;&#10;Your score is the absolute value of what you collected, so you want to collect either positives or negatives but not both. A player who didn't take any tricks also scores if they're the only one without a trick.&#10;&#10;This game has been called Origin of Falling Water in error.  Just as the word in the Japanese title Rakusuitei is slightly different from the usual Japanese Rakusuiso for &quot;Falling Water&quot;, the decision was made to have a similar pun in English and use &quot;Failing Water&quot; instead of &quot;Falling Water&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is quite simple and definitely family fare. Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.&#10;&#10;The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, players, by using cards, physically build their own castles upon a special basement mat. With regards to the building phase, there actually are no limits, as long as the castles can stand properly. During the game, players turn-by-turn draw siege cards that activate siege machines. In such cases, players will throw cards against their opponents castles, to make them fall.&#10;&#10;The last standing castle wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These items are either useful tools in order to help them survive or the altars which are needed to located the treasure. Once all four alters are built and have been lit, the location of the treasure is revealed. Players must do all of this while not only surviving the dangers of the island, but also avoiding the Thief.&#10;&#10;The Thief will hunt your players throughout the entire game; always trying to steal resources and deal damage to any player they cross paths with. Once the Treasure has been revealed, the Thief will only engage the player that is in possession of it. During this period of the game, the Thief will ignore other players in an attempt to get to the treasure. If the Thief manages to steal the treasure and get back to their ship the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

While Pathagon is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you on your toes. Players take turns placing their wooden game pieces on the board in an attempt to build a path from one side of the game board to the other. There is a &quot;trapping&quot; move that allows a player to &quot;trap&quot; and remove one of their opponents game pieces from the board. The first player to complete the path wins. Sounds simple, doesn't it? The catch is that the two paths cross. Every move has an offensive and defensive consideration. Pathagon is simple enough to be played by children, strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Pathagon is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&#10;&#10;",

Your score is how many treasures you manage to collect along the way &ndash; see if you can beat your high score by playing again!&#10;&#10;&#10;A solo micro-game designed by C.C. Chamberlin, based on Dungeon Hero. Create a hero using eight defining characteristics, like Archer of the Realm or Chainmail or Stealthy.  Assign them dice ranging from d12 to d6. Note your Health and Stamina levels, and then start the adventure.&#10;&#10;",

Each tiffin is carried by multiple dabbawallas (delivery people) along the way. Despite more than 250,000 lunch deliveries every day, mistakes are rare.&#10;&#10;In Tiffin, players represent dabbawallas working to deliver tiffins and earn rupees by starting tiffins on a route and contributing to successful delivery of their tiffins and those of other players. The more tiffins delivered on a single route, the higher the payout for each player participating in the deliveries.&#10;&#10;Shortcuts speed things up, flat tires slow things down, and an ever-present competitor might get there first. The game ends when all delivery routes are complete and the player with the most rupees is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Firefly: Out to the Black   is a quick cooperative card game for three to five players. Players take on roles of the crew of Serenity and play through a series of Events. Using their Fightin&rsquo;, Flyin&rsquo;, and Thinkin&rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose. If the players manage to complete enough Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game and live to fly another day!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Double sized Character Cards &ndash; Contains the Character&rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities&#10;&#10;Event Cards &ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.&#10;&#10;Serenity Cards &ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.&#10;&#10;Alliance Cards &ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.&#10;&#10;Gorramit Cards &ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.&#10;A Set of Rules &ndash; The rules to the game.&#10;Honor Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Honor.&#10;Credit Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Credits.&#10;&#10;The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.&#10;&#10;A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&rsquo;, one Flyin&rsquo;, and one Thinkin&rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed  to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.&#10;&#10;Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.&#10;    &#10;The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits.  Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Your fellow hunters may be tempted to steal from you, ending the hunt sooner than you might expect. At the end of the day, captured cards score points for you, but hunters who are caught during the closed season and cards that remain in your hand will reduce your score.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of one hunter, two wolves, three rabbits, three carrots and one closed season/carrot. On a turn, each player secretly chooses a card from his hand, then they reveal the cards simultaneously. If someone played a &quot;closed season&quot; card, than all hunters played are placed in the prey pile of those players. If not, hunters each capture a wolf (starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise), place that card in their prey pile, then return their hunter to their hand; any hunter that can't capture a wolf is placed under its owner's hunting lodge (a play area in front of each player).&#10;&#10;If any wolves remain, they each capture a rabbit (again starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise) and are then placed in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section of that player's hunting lodge; if a wolf doesn't catch a rabbit, return it to its owner's hand. Rabbits are handled the same as wolves, but they hunt carrots (and not themselves!), moving to &quot;easy prey&quot; if they eat and returning to their owner's hand otherwise. Cards in a player's &quot;easy prey&quot; section are captured before a similar card played by that same player during the current turn; if a card is not captured while in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section, it's moved to that player's prey pile at the end of the next turn.&#10;&#10;If everyone still has at least one card in hand, move the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card one space clockwise and play another turn. If at least one player has no cards in hand, each player scores their prey pile, with hunters worth -4 points and all other cards worth 1-4 points. Players then reclaim their cards and play another round. After four complete rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The unit is marching out of camp and joining battle. The unit comes out of camp and activates the unit in front. It displaces one of its comrades, that unit is activated and so on, until a unit comes into contact with the enemy.

Gain prestige and honor from your fellow citizens through victory.&#10;&#10;From the designer's website:&#10;&#10;GAME CONCEPT&#10;&#10;You are a Roman Aristocrat who uses your influence and power to hire an experienced Charioteer, to acquire an excellent chariot and to buy a strong horse to compete in a chariot race.  More importantly, however, you must offer sacrifices to the Gods to gain their favor as they help your team toward victory.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;The game consists of a cycle of &quot;Race Legs&quot; wherein players play Chariot, Rider, and Horse cards in an effort to win Victory Spaces on the race track.  In addition to these cards, there are also God Cards that provide special powers. Because players use up their cards (&quot;resources&quot;) to race, in each cycle there is an opportunity to acquire more resources by making sacrifices to the gods. The more you sacrifice, the better resources you receive. However, your sacrifice power is limited, so you must be careful to use it wisely.  Each cycle sets specific &quot;Racing Conditions&quot; that change from cycle to cycle, allowing for different strategies as the game progresses. The game contains a strong auction element, a fair amount of guesswork concerning what the other players will do, and a little bit of luck.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;83 Playing Cards&#10;&#10;1 Game Board&#10;&#10;15 Tokens&#10;&#10;1 Die&#10;&#10;1 Instruction Booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Final War is a 2- to 4-player tactical card game set on Gloren, a world ravaged by the forces of light and darkness.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a warlord &mdash; elf, werewolf, or guildmaster &mdash; and a fifty-card player deck of supporting heroes, units, items and fortifications from which you build your army. This army can be customized and enhanced with randomized booster packs.&#10;&#10;A Fate deck determines the course of play and also the length of the game, whether you use the full fifty-card deck or 25 or 12 cards for shorter games. The Fate deck contains instant event cards, such as wandering monsters, bandits, and player skirmishes, and &quot;add-to-hand&quot; events such as treasures, healing, etc. Players roll d12s for initiative and combat, which adds an additional element of randomness. The goal is to build and strengthen your army before the Final War card is turned over in the Fate deck and all-out battle commences between the players.&#10;&#10;Choose your champion and join the Final War!&#10;&#10;",
