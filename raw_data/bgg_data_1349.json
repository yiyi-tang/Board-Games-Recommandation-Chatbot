Through seven games that refer to the main milestones in the history of Peronism, an attempt will be made to obtain the seven &quot;Peronist emblems&quot; to become El Gran Descamisado.&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players will concentrate their Peronist pawns at the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; and will return there each time their game turn ends. In their corresponding turn, each partner must turn the historical clock. When the needle stops, it will indicate the game to be played, associated with a certain event in the history of Peronism. Each of these games may be individual, in pairs or in a group, as appropriate and will allow to win a Peronist emblem. This dynamic will be repeated until someone meets the ultimate goal of obtaining the 7 emblems.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pact of Loyalty&quot;: Game of pacts and agreements.

They draw a hand of five cards to begin the game. A deck of forty villagers is placed at the center of the table. Players flip up a villager, one at a time. The fastest player to capture that villager scores one point. However, the card used to capture the villager must meet one of three conditions:&#10;&#10;     Exceed the number&#10;     Match the number&#10;     Be the correct corresponding image&#10;&#10;&#10;Depending on which condition a player uses to capture a villager, they might return the dragon or ogre card used to their hand, discard it and draw a new card, or shuffle their discard pile back into their deck and draw back up to five cards.&#10;&#10;There are forty villagers and only twenty combined dragons and ogres. So each card must be used an average of two times in order to capture half the villagers. If one player runs out of cards, the other may keep playing until they are also out of cards. Players must be quick enough to beat their opponent to the villager but clever enough to make matches.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game based on the traditional Korean card game Go Stop, with some differences. The game uses a modernized, more colorful Hanafuda deck. Flower Battle differs from Go Stop in the following ways:&#10;1. Although 4 players may begin, only 3 players may play the main game; there is a pre-round elimination procedure in which player who &quot;dies&quot; may sell his/her Gold cards (called Bright cards in Go Stop) for points.&#10;2. Go Stop decks have 4 or 5 joker/wild cards; Flower Battle has 3 wild cards that are doublers and a blank card for you to customize.&#10;3. Flower Battle has options for scoring such as Wild Boar Hunt (players put their scoring sticks in a box; the player with the boar card wins the sticks) and Clear the Ground (if you collect the last 2 cards on the table, you also receive a plain card from each opponent's collection).&#10;4. Point values differ slightly; in Go Stop, collecting all 5 brights typically gives you 15 points. In Flower Battle, you receive 10 points.&#10;&#10;The original version comes with a deck of cards and a pouch of color counting sticks for keeping score.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to get rid of your hand as fast as possible but if someone goes out that won't necessarily end the game. Drawing cards is not a punishment. If another player plays a counter active card against the player that went out then that player won't win and that will give someone the opportunity to either stop that player or steal the win from that player.&#10;&#10;The unique factor of this game creates simple interaction during any player's turn where the game still flows forward without ever stalling or back tracking which brings an enjoyable experience for everyone.&#10;&#10;The possibilities can be endless and unpredictable. Every card was developed to never start out with a bricked hand, which will bring the quality to the game where no one ever feels as if they're at a disadvantage to win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Steal is a fast and furious new letter game of cunning, treachery and outright theft!  A hugely exciting game from New Zealand, with all letter tiles contained in a handy mask-shaped fabric bag, allowing it to be played almost anywhere. Steal is suitable for 2-8 players of all ages, easy to learn but more difficult to master.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds by flipping tiles (every 2-3 seconds), with players calling out and forming three+ letter words from the exposed letters. As the game proceeds, the aim then is to steal words from your opponents by adding one or more letters. So pin might be stolen as pain, and stolen again as inapt, then pliant, implant, platinum, manipulate, planetarium, perambulating etc....! All the while other words are of course being formed and stolen.&#10;&#10;The set contains ten coloured STEAL letters which double the score of the word, so the highest scores are always obtained by assembling/stealing long words containing a coloured letter.  Play is further enhanced by the mask (joker) tile which can be any letter you want (&amp; can change as the word is stolen).&#10;&#10;Flipping stops while words are being assembled (with the last assembler being next to flip) but stealing does not. So often a word is stolen whilst it is being formed with the addition of an already-exposed new letter! Frustrating and hilarious at the same time, bringing out the competitive streak of everyone who plays. Once all letters are flipped and no more words can be made or stolen...the scores are counted up to find the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Malaysian-made card game that incorporates strategy and competitive gameplay. Players accumulate trophy cards by winning battles. This addictive and fun game is guaranteed to light up your day. (description at back of box)&#10;&#10;The game consists of trophy cards which are worth point values, and duel cards, which have duel points and are used to compete for the trophy cards. At setup, a number of stacks of trophy cards are laid out to match the number of players. Players are dealt 6 duel cards.&#10;&#10;During play, players take turns to play duel cards next to the trophy stacks. Duel cards have different strengths and abilities. Once a third duel card is played next to a trophy stack, that stack is evaluated and the player with the highest duel card strength wins the stack. The stack is then replenished.&#10;&#10;Duel cards come in different suits, and each type of trophy stack only accepts specific suits.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the trophy deck runs out. For a shorter game, play to a fixed number of points instead.&#10;&#10;",

This is a firework trick which is made by arranging the sections.&#10;&#10;Starmine Rummy Pocket is part of a series of pocket games for 1-2 players, produced by the publisher JUGAME STUDIO (&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#170;). Currently, there is no plan to produce a larger game of Starmine Rummy.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;A lot of fireworks are shot off incessantly. The sound of the whistle and the smoke and the light and the roar which roars far above the expectation.&#10;&#10;A starmine is a firework display that features a series of fireworks that are connected together. As a pyrotechnist, you aim to create the most memorable starmine of all.&#10;&#10;The starmine consists of three columns (opening, main and finale). Place the firework card combinations in all three rows to complete the starmine. It is important to take your time to collect all the cards in order to create the best starmine, but the highlight of the starmine is the continuous firing! You can't just sit back and collect fireworks, because your rivals will be setting them off one after another.

During the game you will build a thriving economy to fuel the battle while expanding your area of control with fleets of ships.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;In Galaxis: Stellar Frontiers, you assume the role of one of four unique galactic factions fighting for resources and territory. At the beginning of every turn, you collect resources from fields you control which you can spend on constructing Buildings on Planets, buying Ships, and researching Ship Upgrades to improve them. By moving your Ships into new fields, you expand your reach to get more resources and trigger Events which help you grow even faster. By growing your economy, you&rsquo;re able to unlock new building tiers to bring the war the next level. Each faction follows their very own goals in the scenarios to gain Influence, and the one with the most influence points at the end wins the battle and one day, possibly the war.&#10;&#10;",

All the best things in life are there: good food, wine, beautiful servants, and interesting conversation. You are a guest, and after you get comfortable your host makes a request of you: make a speech in praise of love. Every guest gives a speech, the contents of which are directed by a different metaphysical perspective. If your speech is the best one, the host will award you the relevant card.&#10;&#10;After this initial round of play the role of host shifts, new perspectives are selected, and a new Question card is drawn by a new host; introducing the players to a variety of interesting questions. (What is is to be wise? What is courage? Why do I still love them?) Fresh speeches are given, and the card is awarded. Play continues in this manner until the You are drunk card is selected, at which point the game is over. The guest with the most cards at the end of the game not only wins, but is also the wisest.&#10;&#10;",

These three figures are plush representations of &ldquo;Teuber&rsquo;s Robbers&rdquo;: three characters named Chief, Lucky, and Bert, who together are the personifications of the robber in Catan. The robbers were originally envisioned to be hapless and ultimately harmless characters who are constantly being vilified by the people settling on Catan.&#10;&#10;As with the Catanimals, the rules of a scenario using these plush figures was made available, although in this case the rules were only made available in the German language from the Catan website.&#10;&#10;Rules: &#10;In a 3-4 player game, only two of the plush robbers are used.  In a 5-6 player game, all three of the plush robbers are used.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, none of the plush robbers are under the control of any player. A player may take control of one of the plush robbers if they have one of their hand cards stolen as a result of robber movement.&#10;&#10;Once all of the plush robbers have been claimed, whenever a player has one of their hand cards stolen as a result of robber movement, the player having their card stolen may take a plush robber from the player stealing the card. If the player stealing the card does not have a plush robber, they may take a plush robber from any other player.&#10;&#10;A player with control of one plush robber has their hand limit increased by three cards (they do not lose resources unless they have more than 10 cards, instead of the usual 7).&#10;&#10;The robber may not be moved to any hex where there is an adjacent settlement or city belonging to a player with control of two plush robbers, unless that player is in sole possession of the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of one of the 5 space agencies, and in his turn can perform two of the 9 possible actions, such as developing the agency on the technology tree, launching a rocket, conducting research, placing buildings, or sabotage.&#10;&#10;The game board is a model of the Solar System, consisting of 5 movable rings. On each ring there are successive objects of the Solar System, and the rings are divided into such numbers of squares, that rotating each of the rings by 1 square per round, the speed of planets and rockets on their orbits around the Sun is maintained according to Kepler's law!&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their move, we rotate each ring and the positions of the planets and rockets change. This means that players, in order to optimize their missions and not waste valuable time, must learn to predict the future position of planets and start planning rocket launches in advance, just like real space agencies.&#10;&#10;Development tree is divided into three branches: space tourism, base construction and sabotage. Players have to manage their budget on an ongoing basis, so they don't run out of funds at the crucial moment of the space race. In addition, each of the space agencies: USA, Russia, Europe, China and Japan, has its own unique bonus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The number of elemental insignias placed on any linear sides of the Boundary must be equal.&#10;3.    The elemental insignias on each tile must be matched by a placed Oink representing the same element.&#10;&#10;Ending Condition&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles are played and all unmatched Oinks on any tile on the Boundary are moved to the Outer Void. The player loses when the winning conditions are not achieved when the game ends.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;A player starts the game by drawing randomly from a stack of world tiles to be placed in a 3 x 3 grid manner as below.&#10;&#10;X        A    B    C        O&#10;        D    I    E        &#10;        F    G    H&#10;&#10;1.    Shuffle the 48 world tiles into a stack. World tiles are referred to as tiles.&#10;&#10;2.    Draw 3 tiles from the stack. From these 3 tiles, flip 1 over to the grid side to form the Outer Void (This is represented by the faced down tile O in the diagram), 1 to form the Inner Gate (This is represented by the faced down tile I in the diagram).&#10;&#10;3.    Gain the Oinks matched by the elemental insignias of the last remaining tile and discard it, an area such as X can be designated for discarded tiles in the diagram.&#10;&#10;All world tiles built are placed faced up with their elemental insignias visible. Tiles A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H surrounding tile I forms the Boundary. To fulfill winning condition 2,  the sum of the number of elemental insignias on the Tiles A, B, C; Tiles C,E, H; Tiles F,G, H and Tiles A, D, F are equal.&#10;&#10;On each turn&#10;&#10;Draw 3 tiles from the stack and the player must perform ONE of each of the following actions in the following order:&#10;&#10;1.    Gain - Play a tile, gain the Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias and discard it. Put the Oinks gained in the Inner Gate.&#10;&#10;2.    Build - Build a tile, if it is the first tile, place it adjacent to the Inner Gate, if it is not, it must be placed adjacent to another tile that has been built that bears at least one of its own elemental insignias. If the intended location is adjacent to two or more world tiles, then all adjacent world tiles must bear at least one matching elemental insignia between them.&#10;&#10;If you are unable to or do not wish to build for any reason, gain the Oinks indicated on any one of the remaining tiles that has not been played and put them into the Outer Void. You can also replace any tile built with any tile in your hand but all Oinks placed on the built tile will be placed in the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;3.    Move - Play a tile, you can move Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias of this tile from the Inner Gate to any built tile, or to move any Oink from a built tile to an adjacent built tile. If you are unable to or do not wish to move any of the Oinks indicated for any reason, gain the Oinks instead and put them into the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;The player cannot skip any action and each action must be fulfilled in totality. E.g.  During a Move action, a tile with 3 Fire Insignias has been chosen but the player has only 1 Fire Oink in the Inner Gate. You may NOT move the existing 1 Fire Oink to any other tile, gain 2 Fire Oinks and then placed them in the Outer Void. 3 Fire Oinks should be gained and placed in the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;For each Oink placed in a tile that bears the same insignia, gain 1 Victory Point. The player with the most Victory Points wins the final victory if multiple players are competing. Ties are broken by the difference in Oinks between their Outer Void and Inner Gate. The player with the greater difference wins. If the differences are the same, the players shared a joint victory.&#10;&#10;Variant&#10;&#10;The game can be scaled up with a BOUNDARY with sides featuring more tiles. (E.g 4 or 5). The rest of the rules remain unchanged. In this case, players can choose to leave the space representing the Inner Gate empty instead of a faced down tile I. Players can choose to use other appropriate counters to represent Oinks during play.&#10;&#10;",

Each demon presents a temptation card to the Ascet, and the Ascet chooses one of the presented temptations to overcome. They roll an 8 sided die for minor temptations and a 10 sided die for major temptations. If the result is equal or lower than the corresponding virtue, the Ascet overcomes the temptation and ascends one step in the Stairway to Enlightenment. Otherwise, the demon who proposed the temptation receives an additional card. Afterwards, all demons receive one card, regardless of success or failure.&#10;&#10;if the roll was a 9, regardless of success or failure, the Ascet gets a Revalation, which may allow them to increase one of the virtues by 1.&#10;&#10;The first player to ascend 5 steps on the Stairway to Enlightenment wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Challenge: The earth is our Planet A. It is worth the effort to protect it, because there is no Planet B. Rising CO2 emission and a plastic torrent overwhelm our sensitive ecosystem; climate change and species extinction arise with all consequent changes. Strive against that and save our blue planet. In the process, ecological calamities and forever outdated political parties get in your way. Do not give in. We save the earth step by step - as long as everyone contributes.&#10;&#10;Solution: By the use of 105 different cards about sustainability , the players face up with all kinds of environmentally friendly everyday items and ideas. With realistic tasks and practical ideas, the game throws a bridge into the real life and is thought-provoking. Playfully learning with a lot of fun plus making the world a bit better.&#10;&#10;Description of the game: All players have to fulfil a secret task: either to collect certain thematic cards in their hand or to help the team Planet A get a collection in the middle of the table. Whoever accomplishes three tasks at first wins. Ecological calamity cards, environmental hero cards and environmental activist cards whirl the game and encourage discussions on sustainability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A children's storytelling game, where players are presented with a basic narrative arc which informs them of what they need to accomplish. Each player has his own character with which he explores the map by opening new hexagon tiles and finding different items. These serve as inspiration and opportunity to tell a story and progress thorugh the game towards it narrative finale.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls a die which tells him how many action points he gets to use. As an action, he can open a new tile, move to an adjacent tile, or pick up an item from the tile he is on. There's also a possibility he gets to use his special power. All this should be narrated as well. The game ends when all the story cards are completed, that is, a set amount of items in requested colours are collected. The players win together, I noted the game is cooperative. But I guess, there is no winning as such, as the game is about telling a story, there is no mechanical challenge.&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to make his journey through Europe as quickly as possible by adding the city cards of your route in the correct sequence to your route.

You win the game by being the first player to finish your route and end up back in Amsterdam.&#10;&#10;The game starts with every player in Amsterdam, the other 96 cards of all four routes (16 city cards and 8 visa cards per route) are then shuffled and put into a grid formation on the table.&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player flips 2 cards of their choice and if they fit, extend their trip by adding the cards to their line.&#10;&#10;If one or both of the cards are part of your trip but not adjacent to the city you are in, you can safe the card(s) by switching it/them with another one (logically with a card in the grid close to you). At the end of your turn, you flip back all cards.&#10;&#10;Some advancements of the routes require visa cards which need to be placed before you are able to advance, and the visa cards are shared between North &amp; East and shared between South &amp; West. Visa cards cannot be saved. The end point of Amsterdam can also not be saved.&#10;&#10;This game can be summarized as a game of memory, where you can safe cards for later use and where their is a small competition for visa cards between players (South&amp;West and North&amp;East).&#10;&#10;",
