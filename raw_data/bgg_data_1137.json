The character is revealed, if the action was legitimate the power is triggered and the doubting player loose a backup Super-Hero.

    "Description": "The third and most terrifying game in the Shuffling Horror board game line, Innsmouth 32 is a cinematic card-and-dice game that plunges players into one of H. P. Lovecraft's weirdest tales. One player controls the cultists and deep ones, all other players are gangsters, students, and scholars trying to make it out of Innsmouth alive.&#10;&#10;Key to the Shuffling Horror experience is the movie deck: a sixty-card deck that hold all the characters, twists, turns, and terrors that await in Innsmouth. To start the movie, the deck is shuffled and a number of cards are dealt for the first reel (round) of the movie. Ten cards are dealt for the first reel, representing the first ten minutes of the film; as these cards are played, they confront players with terrible things.&#10;&#10;Two new features have been added to the Shuffling Horror system to bring Innsmouth 32 its terrifying Lovecraftian vibe: Mythos and Insanity. Mythos are obtained by characters via items or investigation and grant the power to banish monsters. Characters may also gain Insanity during encounters with powerful creatures (such as the shoggoth). The more Insanity a character gains, the more unstable they become.&#10;&#10;The game is playable with 3-13 players; if eliminated, players return to the game as cultists and deep ones (now playing on the Director's team against all other survivors).&#10;&#10;Terror mounts with each successive reel! Who will be standing when the film fades to black...&#10;&#10;",

Imperial and Rebel forces clash in the galaxy&rsquo;s most lawless regions, where the spark of rebellion has grown into a flame that threatens to destroy the Empire. These distant reaches are filled with vital allies and resources that may mean the difference between victory and defeat in the war for the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Rebellion in the Rim allows two to six players to participate in a campaign spanning multiple fleet battles in which you will create a custom commander to lead your task force. Victory depends on developing your commander&rsquo;s abilities and working closely with your team to determine which side will control the fate of the Rim!&#10;&#10;Each battle fought influences the control of a location on the campaign map, which in turn can provide critical resources to the winning side. Players must be careful about their strategy however, as the fate of each ship during a battle can carry over into later games, possibly resulting in permanent damage or the loss of heroic crew.&#10;&#10;The Campaign Expansion also features campaign-based objective cards that can alter the rules of the game during a battle or introduce unusual elements like exogorths and gravity rifts, and some scenarios will result in unbalanced fights between fleets at unequal power levels.  Rounding out the expansion is eight new squadron cards featuring characters like Sabine Wren, Iden Versio, Lando Calrissian, and IG-88B.&#10;&#10;This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Star Wars: Armada Core Set is required to play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Top Dog is a fun and competitive card game for social interactions with family members and friends of all ages. Be the first player to get rid of all your cards by outplaying your opponents. Use combinations of dogs and power dogs to empty your hand first. Copy Cats can complete a dog stack and clear the Dogpile on any turn while Dog Catchers can clear the Dogpile and send them running to dog pound on your turn. Use Copy Cats and Dog Catchers wisely to outwit and defeat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Players will have dog cards, which they may play in combinations, and Power Dogs, which they may also play in combinations. There are also Copy Cats, which are essentially wild cards and Dog Catchers, which immediately send all dogs to the Dog Pound, which is where all the cards that were completed from the Dogpile go. The cards in the Dog Pound will not be used until the round is over and a new round begins.&#10; The first player places a card or combinations of cards on the Dogpile, which is the pile of played cards in the middle of the table. Play then continues to the left. During your turn, you can play a card or a combination of cards that are of higher value than the last played. However, your turn can be taken away if a Completion occurs by another player before the player whose turn it is can play a card. A completion occurs when there are 4 of the same type of cards on the Dogpile. Completions can be played out of turn regardless of how many cards are being played on the Dogpile. The same type of cards can be stacked to increase the value of the Dogpile. For example, you can Stack a single card on a double if they are of the same type. If a player can not play on the Dogpile, that player has to draw from the Dog House (Draw Deck) until they can play.&#10;&#10;The first person to run out of cards in the round wins the round, and the first person to win 3 rounds is the Top Dog.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Player's keep their dice concealed from others and make 'wages' of how many dice there are of a certain numeric value in total amongst all players. &#10;e.g &quot;There are 6 dice with fives in total&quot; In a clockwise rotation, the next player must then increase the number of dice by at least one to continue the wager for the match. If a player believes the other player is bluffing, someone can always call &quot;BULLSHIP!&quot; on that active wager. When that happens, all players reveal their dice and the player who called &quot;BULLSHIP!&quot; either the wins the booty or loses their own booty. Once a player runs out of booty, they are eliminated and the player who defeated them steals their unique ability(s) permanently.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Ein Held der auf Feld 57 steht, kann das Pergament aktivieren. Wenn er den Wert des Pergaments an Willenspunkten besitzt, kann er damit den Erz&auml;hler 1 Feld auf der Legendenleiste zur&uuml;cksetzen. Das Pergament kommt dann aus dem Spiel. Er muss die Willenspunkte nicht abgeben, er muss diesen Wert nur besitzen. Sollte er den Wert nicht haben, bleibt das Pergament offen liegen. Er oder ein anderer Held kann sp&auml;ter zum Baum der Lieder zur&uuml;ckkehren. Wenn dieser Held dann den geforderten Wert hat, kann der Erz&auml;hler 1 Feld zur&uuml;ckgesetzt werden und das Pergament kommt aus dem Spiel. &#10;Wichtig: Wenn der Erz&auml;hler zur&uuml;ckgesetzt wird, werden Legendenkarten oder Kreaturenpl&auml;ttchen nicht erneut aktiviert.&#10;&#10;Wer es noch ein bisschen leichter haben m&ouml;chte legt zus&auml;tzlich ein zweites Pergament verdeckt auf die Taverne (Feld 72). Dieses Pergament funktioniert auf die gleiche Weise.&#10;&#10;&#10;Hello everyone&#10;&#10;The level of difficulty in &quot;The Legends of Andor&quot; increases steadily with each legend. That's why Legend 5 should be a real challenge.

A hero standing on space 57 can activate the parchment. If he has at least the value of the parchment of willpower points, he can use it to move the Narrator back 1 space on the legend track. The parchment is then removed from the game. He does not have to give up the willpower, he just has to have that value. If he does not have the value, the parchment remains on space 57. He or another hero may later return to the Tree of Songs. If this hero then has the required value, the Narrator can move back 1 space and the parchment is removed from the game. &#10;Important: If the narrator is reset, Legend Cards or creature tokens will not be reactivated.&#10;&#10;If you want to have it a bit easier, put a second parchment on the tavern (space 72). This parchment works in the same way.&#10;&#10;",

It is a territory occupation game for 2-4 players. Basically, this game is for two players, but there are several game modes which can be played with three or four players.&#10;&#10;During setup, tiles are placed to form an NxN square grid board. The board is divided into five sections which are painted in different colors. The board varies game by game depending on allocation of tiles.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has several stacks of their frogs outside of the board. Each turn, you may place one of your stacks from outside into any vacant space on the board, or move one of your stacks on the board orthogonally, leaving one frog on each square passed, until all frogs are unstacked or the stack cannot move any more.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no player can place or move stacks any more. For each section, check which player has the greater value of frogs. The player who has dominated more sections wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;5&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#164;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#143;&#140;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;5&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#190;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle for Zendikar is a Magic: The Gathering expansion block consisting of the sets Battle for Zendikar and Oath of the Gatewatch. It sees the return of full-art basic lands, last seen in the Zendikar block. It is also the first block in Magic (since the Shadowmoor block) to use the new Two-Block Paradigm, wherein each block has two sets instead of the three that were previously used (the last block having three sets being the Khans of Tarkir block).&#10;&#10;Battle for Zendikar revolves around the Eldrazi, ancient monstrosities that are bent on destroying the entire plane of Zendikar, within which they were once imprisoned, and their fight against the Allies defending their home plane. The creature cards are split along these lines, with most being either on the Eldrazi side or the Ally side. Eldrazi cards are generally very powerful or aid in playing them, while Ally cards give bonuses to each other whenever one comes into play.&#10;&#10;As the Eldrazi are decimating the plane, six Planeswalkers each have their own role in the resistance. Jace Beleren, a logical mage, and Ugin, an ancient dragon, are working together to find a way to defeat the Eldrazi; Gideon, a human who fights for justice and honor, is rounding up the survivors; Ob Nixilis, a demon who lost his powers as a Planeswalker, is trying to regain his abilities; Kiora, a merfolk native to Zendikar, is eager to use her new discoveries on other planes to help her home plane, and Nissa Revane, an elf from Zendikar, who lost her connection to the land and regains it in a surprisingly powerful manner. In the original Zendikar block, there were three chief Eldrazi, but most now are of Ulamog's lineage.&#10;&#10;As the block's story line proceeds, Jace disagrees with Ugin on how to handle the rampage of Ulamog and his brood: Ugin advises against destroying the titan, Ulamog, as the ineffable nature of the Eldrazi means it is unclear if killing their physical form will destroy them entirely, or merely free them to roam across the Blind Eternities, devouring planes unchecked. Jace, Gideon and Nissa settle on a plan with the survivors of the army that retook Sea Gate to channel the natural leylines on Zendikar in tandem with the Hedrons to encircle Ulamog, trapping the Eldrazi again. As the battle rages around the ruined city, the plan appears to initially succeed.&#10;&#10;However, the demon Ob Nixilis, having survived an apparently fatal encounter with Nissa earlier, returns to face the Planeswalkers again, interrupting the hedron alignment and subverting the power involved for his own purpose - regenerating his &quot;spark&quot;, the essential power that resides within all Planeswalkers. As the hedron circle crumbles, Ob Nixilis uses his newly refound powers to raise the second of the three Eldrazi Titans - Kozilek.&#10;&#10;",

It sees the return of full-art basic lands, last seen in the Zendikar block. It is also the first block in Magic (since the Shadowmoor block) to use the new Two-Block Paradigm, wherein each block has two sets instead of the three that were previously used (the last block having three sets being the Khans of Tarkir block).&#10;&#10;Whilst Kiora leads a one-woman sea assault on Kozilek, Gideon, Jace and Nissa find themselves outflanked by Ob Nixilis. The demon attempts to trap them on Zendikar to be destroyed by the Eldrazi, much as he himself was, but is stopped by the unexpected arrival of Chandra Nalaar, who frees them to continue the fight. Ob Nixilis decides to planeswalk away and leave his revenge for later. However, the battle on Zendikar is going poorly. Kiora, the only planeswalker left to represent the Zendikari, is defeated by Kozilek and almost loses her prized possession, the Bident of Thassa which she obtained on Theros. The Zendikari army has been devastated, and Tazri steps up to reorganize it in Gideon's absence.&#10;&#10;The four planeswalkers emerge from Ob Nixilis' erstwhile prison to discover the Sea Gate destroyed and the Zendikari in disarray. They will not be able to trap both Eldrazi using the Hedrons, and none of them are powerful enough to fight alone. Jace suggests simply planeswalking away, but Gideon suggests they swear an oath as they overlook the Sea Gate&mdash;the Oath of the Gatewatch, in which they promise to cooperate to defend the Multiverse against extraplanar threats. And since the Eldrazi are extraplanar threats and cannot be contained, the newly formed Gatewatch have only one option: kill them outright.&#10;&#10;Jace lays out their battle plan: the corporeal forms of the Eldrazi, monstrous though they are, are only part of their existence; the rest of them reside in the Blind Eternities, the whirling chaos between planes. This is why Ugin has always counseled against destroying the Eldrazi's corporeal forms. Jace's solution is to draw Ulamog and Kozilek entirely into Zendikar so that they can be fully slain. Whilst Gideon, Kiora, Chandra, Tazri and the Zendikari army distract the Eldrazi with battle, Jace and Nissa are to use the remaining Hedrons to anchor them in corporeal form. The plane of Zendikar itself, which has been trying to consume the titans ever since they were imprisoned there, will do the rest. Or, at least, that's the plan. Zendikar quickly begins to struggle over the mouthful it has bitten off, and Nissa and Kiora, both Zendikari natives, almost come to blows over the fate of their home. It's Chandra who has the answer: Nissa redirects the last of Zendikar's mana to her, and Chandra employs a purifying fire that annihilates both Ulamog and Kozilek.&#10;&#10;In the aftermath, Zendikar begins to rebuild. Gideon cedes his role as Commander-General to Tazri. Jace still has his own concerns: of the three Planeswalkers who originally imprisoned the Eldrazi here on Zendikar&mdash;Ugin, Sorin Markov, and Nahiri the Lithomancer&mdash;the latter two have failed to help; and when Ugin himself arrives, he has only criticism for Jace's impetuousness at destroying two lifeforms that are older than worlds, their purposes in the Multiverse unknown. Jace decides to hunt down Sorin Markov, who was last seen on the plane of Innistrad.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Khans of Tarkir is a Magic: The Gathering block consisting of Khans of Tarkir (September 26, 2014), Fate Reforged (January 23, 2015), and Dragons of Tarkir (March 27, 2015). The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.&#10;&#10;Sarkhan Vol is successful at preventing Ugin's death, though Ugin is forced to retreat into a hibernative state to recuperate. Satisfied, Sarkhan travels back into the &quot;present day.&quot; But the Tarkir he finds, as chronicled in Dragons of Tarkir, is drastically changed. The eponymous dragons, no longer extinct, have proliferated, and are now on the verge of wiping out all other life; in particular, the five god-dragons worshiped by the clans are now the leaders of those clans, with the human (or humanoid) characters who led them in the original timeline serving in other roles. In this new future, each of the clans focuses on allied pairs, with the enemy colors of the original wedges abandoned entirely; likewise, each clan retains the modified watermark of their dragonlords, first introduced in the previous set. Morph returns as &quot;Megamorph&quot;; the two mechanics are identical except that creatures with Megamorph gain a +1/+1 counter when flipped. Dragons also creates the peculiar structure of Tarkir Block drafts: Fate Reforged is designed to be drafted with either Dragons or Khans, but the two large sets, representing alternate timelines, are not intended to be drafted together. To that end, Dragons retains the two altered clan mechanics from FRF and replaces the three that remained.&#10;&#10;The Dromoka Brood (Green, White) is what the Abzan Houses have become. Dragonlord Dromoka leads and they retain the Bolster mechanic from Fate Reforged. Anafenza, no longer their leader, was martyred for apostatic religious beliefs, but lives on as a ghost associated with a spirit tree.&#10;The Ojutai Brood (Blue, White) is what the Jeskai Way have become. Dragonlord Ojutai leads and their mechanic, new to the Tarkir block but returning from Rise of the Eldrazi, is &quot;Rebound,&quot; which lets spells re-occur at the beginning of the player's next turn. Narset, their former leader, has ignited her planeswalker spark, and is one of the two planeswalkers in the set (the other being an alternate version of Sarkhan Vol).&#10;The Silumgar Brood (Blue, Black) is what the Sultai Brood have become. Dragonlord Silumgar leads and their mechanic is &quot;Exploit.&quot; When a creature with Exploit enters the battlefield, the player may sacrifice a pre-existing creature to gain extra benefits from the Exploiting creature. Their former leader, Sidisi, exists as an undead thrall to Silumgar.&#10;The Kolaghan Brood (Red, Black) is what the Mardu Horde have become. Dragonlord Kolaghan leads and they retain the Dash mechanic from Fate Reforged. Their former leader, Zurgo, has been reduced to a mere ceremonial bellringer, and is often bullied by his clan.&#10;The Atarka Brood (Green, Red) is what the Temur Frontier have become. Dragonlord Atarka leads and their mechanic is &quot;Formidable,&quot; which provides bonuses if the controlling player controls with total power 8 or higher. Surrak, their former leader, serves as the brood's Hunt Caller, in charge of feeding Atarka and renowned for punching a dragon.&#10;Sorin Markov, arriving at the altered version of Tarkir, awakens Ugin from his hibernation. Ugin agrees to help fend off the Eldrazi, though he insists that first he and Sorin seek out Nahiri, the Lithomancer, a planeswalker who helped him seal the Eldrazi away the first time. Sarkhan, meanwhile, learns that he is the only person who remembers the version of Tarkir where he himself was born, and consultation with both Ugin and Narset reveals that, in this continuity, no Sarkhan Vol ever was born. Though both he and Narset are capable of planeswalking anywhere else in the multiverse, both decide to remain on Tarkir.&#10;&#10;",

The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.&#10;&#10;Tarkir is the birthplace of the dragon-worshipping planeswalker Sarkhan Vol, first introduced in Shards of Alara. At the beginning of the Khans set, Sarkhan returns to Tarkir and learns that the extinction of Tarkir's dragons was linked to one specific event. Some thousand years ago, there was an epic battle between two dragon planeswalkers: Nicol Bolas, one of the greatest manipulators in the multiverse, and Ugin the Spirit Dragon, who helped trap the Eldrazi on Zendikar. Now that the Eldrazi have arisen again, both Sarkhan and Sorin Markov have arrived on Tarkir, the last known location of Ugin, in search of his help. Discovering that Ugin is dead, Sarkhan resolves to travel back in time and save him. His travels in the Tarkir of 1,280 years ago are chronicled in the set Fate Reforged. He finds a world where the five human clans do not fight each other, instead fending off constant attacks from Tarkir's many dragons; the clans still model themselves on a particular quality, which is epitomized by a Legendary Dragon creature whom each clan reveres and strives to emulate. The set focuses more on the color at the center of each wedge and its ally, with the enemy color given very little presence. The dragons who serve as the inspiration for each clan have their own watermarks, which are modified versions of the clan sigil. Additionally, Morph is missing; instead, a mechanic which is described as being Morph's precursor, &quot;Manifest,&quot; allows players to put any card face-down as a 2/2 creature, and flip them again only if their obverse was a creature to begin with.&#10;&#10;The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) are led by Daghatar the Adamant, an aloof and analytical leader. They revere Dromoka, the Eternal. In the past, their mechanic is &quot;Bolster,&quot; which lets players strengthen the weakest of their creatures.&#10;The Jeskai Way (Blue, White, Red) are led by Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest, who seeks to preserve knowledge. They revere Ojutai, Soul of Winter. They retain the Prowess mechanic.&#10;The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) are led by Tasigur, the Golden Fang, an indolent and spoiled prince. They revere Silumgar, the Drifting Death. They retain the Delve mechanic.&#10;The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) are led by Alesha, Who Smiles At Death, a transgender warrior who managed to negotiate a position as equals for her clan. They revere Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. In the past, their mechanic is &quot;Dash,&quot; which allows players to cast creatures at reduced mana cost, but with the added corollary that the creature must return to hand at the end of the turn.&#10;The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) are led by Yasova Dragonclaw (all Temur khans take the title &quot;Dragonclaw&quot;), Sarkhan Vol's first friend in the past, who dreams of a world where the humans of Tarkir are no longer prey to dragons. They revere Atarka, World Render. They retain the Ferocious mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.&#10;&#10;The plane of Tarkir was once dominated by dragons, but in a massive war over a thousand years ago, humans succeeded at wiping them out. Today Tarkir is a battle-torn realm where five clans feud for supremacy. As presented in Khans of Tarkir, the five clans focus on &quot;wedges&quot;, or sets of three colors that are rooted in two colors and one &quot;enemy&quot; color across from it. Each wedge is the colors of a clan of warriors that venerate a certain quality of the dragon, and an anatomical feature that represents it. The clans also make use of the &quot;Morph&quot; mechanic, returning from the Onslaught block, which allows creatures to be cast face-down as 2/2 creatures and turned right-side up for additional cost, and occasionally additional benefit; this magic is described as being an invention of the extinct dragons, now adapted to human needs. The clans, and their khans, are as follows:&#10;&#10;The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) see endurance as the most important quality of the dragon, and use the scale to show that. Their mechanic is &quot;Outlast,&quot; which allows them to permanently strengthen themselves by tapping. The clan is led by Anafenza, called &quot;The Foremost,&quot; known for leading from the front.&#10;The Jeskai Way (Blue, Red, White) prefer the cunning nature of the dragon, and represent themselves with the eye. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Narset, the Enlightened Master who speaks of other worlds than Tarkir alone. Their mechanic is &quot;Prowess,&quot; which gives creatures temporary bonuses every time the player casts a non-creature spell.&#10;The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) make themselves ruthless like the dragon, and see the fang as its most ruthless part. Their mechanic is &quot;Delve,&quot; which allows the player to lessen the mana costs of spells by exiling cards from the graveyard. They are led by Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, a powerful naga necromancer who considers herself queen of the clan.&#10;The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) views speed as the greatest aspect, and use the wings to represent that. Their mechanic is &quot;Raid,&quot; which provides bonuses if the player attacked this turn. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Zurgo Helmsmasher, a savage orc who has a vendetta against Sarkhan Vol.&#10;The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) believe in the dragon's savagery, and use the claw as their symbol. Their mechanic is &quot;Ferocious,&quot; which provides bonuses if the player controls at least one creature with 4 power or greater. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Surrak Dragonclaw, a mighty man renowned for punching a bear.&#10;&#10;",

The set completed the cycle of ten dual-colored &quot;demigod&quot; cards that debuted in Born of the Gods, as well as the cycle of ten &quot;scry lands&quot; that premiered in the first set of Theros.

To make room for it, Bestow and Devotion have both been scaled back, appearing on only five cards each; per Mark Rosewater, the dilution of those mechanics also represents the storyline's conflict between gods and mortals, and the latter's disillusionment with the former.[13]&#10;Strive: this ability only appears on Instant and Sorcery spells that have targeting effects. Strive cards can have &quot;any number&quot; of targets, but the caster must pay an additional specified cost for each target beyond the first.&#10;The Monstrous ability returns, last seen in the first set of Theros, replacing Born of the Gods' Tribute.&#10;&#10;",

The set contains five of the block's ten &quot;scry lands,&quot; a cycle of dual lands that come into play tapped and allow its controller to Scry 1 when it enters the battlefield. This set also contained a notable reprint in Thoughtseize, previously seen in Lorwyn.&#10;&#10;The block introduced several new mechanics and keywords, as well one returning keyword. The following mechanics appear in all sets of the Theros block:&#10;&#10;Enchantment Creature and Enchantment Artifact: Cards that are affected by anything that affects enchantments and anything that affects their other type. In addition to having the Enchantment type printed, they are also distinguished by a new starry background representing Nyx.&#10;Heroic: A keyword ability that appears only on creatures. Whenever a creature with Heroic becomes the target of a spell cast by its controller, the ability triggers, causing a one-time effect such as the addition of a specific number of +1/+1 counters or an action that interacts with the opponent's creatures.&#10;Bestow: Bestow is an alternate cost that appears only on Enchantment Creatures. A Bestow creature can be cast for its normal mana cost, or, if cast for its Bestow cost (always more expensive than the converted mana cost), it becomes an Enchantment - Aura spell with Enchant Creature. When attached to a creature, the Bestow card gives the enchanted creature a boost in power and toughness that is equal to the original power and toughness of the Bestow creature, as well as whatever additional abilities and keywords the original had (Flying, Deathtouch, etc.). Whenever the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Bestow card becomes unattached from it and becomes a creature itself.&#10;Devotion: An ability word that checks the number of colored mana symbols among all permanents you control (not including lands) that you have in play. For example, one of the most popular devotion cards of the set, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, has an enters-the-battlefield ability that causes your opponents to lose life, and you to gain life, equal to your devotion to black. Additionally, Theros's pantheon are all played as Enchantments, only becoming creatures if your devotion to their colors has passed a certain threshold.&#10;Scry: A popular keyword that appeared as recently as the Magic 2011 core set, Scry allows players to look at a specified number of cards on top of their library, and choose to put those cards on the top or bottom of their library in the order they choose.&#10;The set also has a unique mechanic that did not appear in Born of the Gods but appears in Journey into Nyx:&#10;&#10;Monstrous: an activated ability of creatures that can only be used once per game. When a creature's Monstrous ability is activated, it gains a specified number of +1/+1 counters. Additionally, becoming Monstrous may cause one-time effects on the game state, such as destroying lands or other creatures.&#10;&#10;",

Players control their robots to fight against hackers.&#10;&#10;Twenty-five server cards are placed in 5x5 grid on the table. Four corners are starting location for robots where they can recharge battery and clear CPU load. Other server cards are face-down.&#10;&#10;During your turn, your robot must move to another server. Once moved, it must move straight until it hits an obstacle (wall or another robot). The destination server is revealed if face-down. Then the server effect is applied. Depending on the server effect, your robot could be given a disinfectant, be infected, or be shut down immediately. Then the robot may create a wall between servers and/or disinfect a robot.&#10;&#10;If your robot is infected, its CPU load increases every round. It is shut down when its CPU load is full or its battery is empty. It takes one round to recover from shutdown.&#10;&#10;Robots win the game when they reveal Hackers' Hideout and disinfect it within seven rounds.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#146;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#146;&#178;&#230;&#187;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you forage or hunt for food, find a mate, and raise your young... without becoming someone else's lunch?&#10;&#10;Welcome to Wildlife Web, a game where you participate in the web of life.&#10;&#10;Wildlife Web is an exciting, dynamic game of strategy where adventure, luck, and cunning provide hours of fun for family and friends, recommended for ages 9 to 99.&#10;&#10;Do you want to be a mountain lion, deer, or elk? This surprisingly realistic game enables players to experience life as any of 50 different animals, and each animal has a mate.&#10;&#10;How do you strategize to eat, mate, stay alive, and pass your genes along to the next generation? Each animal has a special survival rating, plus unique abilities to help when hunting or defending against predators...&#10;&#10;Are you a carnivore, herbivore or insectivore?&#10;&#10;A fox has special abilities and strategic advantages, but so does the whitetail deer, robin, and squirrel. Which animal is better... the moose or the mouse? Select your starting Pack of animals carefully and the race is on to pass your genes along to the next generation.&#10;&#10;Wildlife Web is both competitive and cooperative. On the one hand, the game features classic predator-prey relationships where mountain lions hunt rabbits, deer, elk, or bison with the roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;On the other hand there is cooperation as robins warn the deer as a mountain lion approaches. Your deer gains 2 extra defense points for every robin on the table.&#10;&#10;Fifty random Event Cards introduce everything from hailstorms to bird alarms that can help or hinder your quest for survival.&#10;&#10;Just like in real life, a highway runs through the game, forming a deathtrap for some species and an opportunity to scavenge for others.&#10;&#10;A Day/Night card alternates play between diurnal and nocturnal animals so your bat is safe during the day while your hawk can go hunting.&#10;&#10;With thousands of potential interactions and many uncontrolled factors, the game is never the same... except that you will have fun every time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

These horrifying monsters were unlike anything that had ever been encountered, save perhaps the strange creatures that accompanied the RezX Aetherships. Unlike RezX&rsquo;s new companions though, the Rhommox did not show affinity towards the human consciousness. Instead, they were always immediately hostile towards anything or anyone unknown and they showed no desire or ability to communicate with humankind.&#10;&#10;Auxiliary Boxes contain 1 Avatar, 1 Function, and 1 Subroutine and are designed to supplement your favorite Collective with new and extraordinary strategic options. Each Box Set includes both PAD and Data cards for all programs.&#10;&#10;This box contains 7 models: Swarm Matron (Avatar-Omni 50mm base), Hullude (Omni 50mm base), Reductors (Subroutine 5), and the appropriate PAD and Data cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Urban Manhunt is a miniatures game based on a violent near-future blood sport. It is meant to be an inexpensive game that requires only one miniature per player and that can also be played solo. Best of all, the hunter creation system allows you to create stats for virtually any miniature you own.&#10;&#10;Matches in Urban Manhunt take place in zones, sectioned-off areas of partially destroyed cities that are used as prisons. Highly-trained, larger-than-life mercenaries known as hunters are set loose in the zone to compete with each other by &ldquo;eliminating&rdquo; crims (&ldquo;criminals&rdquo;, prisoners who volunteer to take their chances in return for full pardons if they survive).&#10;&#10;Each crime is assigned a base point value by the Urban Manhunt Rules Committee, based on their competency. When a hunter eliminates the crim, they receive that number of points. This amount can be modified by the live studio audience based on how flashy, interesting or gory the elimination is. The hunter with the most points when the time limit expires wins the match.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Put kroz Jugoslaviju game titel translation from both Slovak and Croatian languages - &quot;The way through Yugoslavia&quot;.&#10;&#10;A mid 1930s Yugoslavian pan-Slavic board-game published in Ljubljana, Slovenia, circa 1935 by a famous illustrator and painter Mirko &Scaron;ubic (1900-1976).&#10;&#10;Mirko &Scaron;ubic was born in a Slovenian family of artists and architects. He studied art in Munich under Franz von Stuck and Karl J. Becker &ndash; Gundhal, in Prague under Vlaho Bukovac, Jakub Obrovsk&yacute; and Vojtech Hynais, and in Dresden under Ferdinand Dorsch in Max Feldbauer. Before the WW II he was active as illustrator and painter. In his later life he became one of the most famous restorers and conservators of Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;The game shows the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the late 1935 and traveling through the most important stops of the country, should increase the pan-Slavic feeling. All the stops on the board are described in the inner side of the box. The instructions end with a rhyme of a Slovene, Croat and Serb always being brothers.&#10;&#10;The maps shows the most famous building of Yugoslavia. As most of them are older buildings, Ljubljana is shown with the modern Art Deco building &ldquo;Neboti&#196;&#141;nik&rdquo; (Skyscaper), the tallest building on the Balkans at the time, finished by 1933. Neboti&#196;&#141;nik was the first reinforced concrete building in Europa.&#10;&#10;The architect of Neboti&#196;&#141;nik, Vladimir &Scaron;ubic, was a brother of the illustrator of this game, Mirko &Scaron;ubic.&#10;&#10;The map can be dated after the opening of Neboti&#196;&#141;nik in 1933 and before 1939, when two regions (banovine) of 9 in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, merged into one. The 8 regions existed until 1941, at the beginning of the WW II.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The data within became the core of the ground-breaking design, Tobruk: Tank Battles in North Africa 1942.&#10;&#10;Years later, an MIT-grad and devotee saw the potential of reverse-engineering the 'programmed instruction' rules; the result is something that brings back the approach to tank vs. tank warfare, and keeps the approach true, creating a truly unique system of recreating the war in North Africa and beyond.&#10;&#10;BRL 1192: Tobruk Deprogrammed is an enhanced edition of the original Tobruk; the heart of the game remains the same, but now it can be enjoyed with a deprogrammed 24-page rulebook, revised play aids, a comprehensive selection of counters representing the men, weapons and machinery of WWII North Africa, plus a collection of geomorphic maps and new terrain overlays.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Retro Hero is the first of many games for the Retro Gamer Device. Players start by randomly selecting 5 level cards (this is your cartridge) and inserting them into their Retro Gamer Device. Each level has a predetermined number of turns so players must try and make the best with the options they're presented.&#10;&#10;The goal is to collect points while navigating across levels, moving with the help of shapes chosen from the options rolled on your adventure dice. Points are mainly collected by covering as many empty spaces as possible (venture points); defeating creatures scattered across the levels; and using a key to open the lock. There are also several other ways of accumulating points such as Treasure Cards and Side Quests.&#10;&#10;Items found in a level are collected when covered, adding to your player board or wallet. When covering creatures, players attack by drawing cubes from a bag. Successful attacks earn you points while taking hits will cost you health. Players can press their luck to earn maximum points but risk dying in the process.  If a player does run out of health during an attack, they lose a point as consequence but are revived on their next turn, continuing from where they left off.&#10;&#10;The Treasure Cards that are collected are added to the limited slots on your player board to help you along the way. Their content ranges between Spells, Companions, and Special Items.&#10;&#10;Bombs are a vital part of the game as they enable players to take shortcuts and sometimes access items that are otherwise unavailble. If a player wishes to cover a brick with their chosen shape, they will need to spend a bomb. Bombs (like all items) are either collected or purchased.&#10;&#10;Retro Hero is a truly unique dungeon crawling experience with up to 40 levels to choose from and 11 different shapes to dictate your every move. The player with the most points becomes the Ultimate Retro Hero!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
