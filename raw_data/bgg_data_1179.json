There is even a scenario in which all Dragons are dead, and you need to make the characters deal with one of the multiple corresponding consequences to tanarian society, the political atmosphere, and more.&#10;&#10;With hundreds of unique pieces of artwork and the background of locations and characters (possibilities for either PCs or NPCs), you will have everything you need to inspire an epic, unforgettable campaign with your friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle of the Somme is a solitaire, tactical (individual men) WW1 board wargame simulating some of the events of July 1st, 1916, the first day of the Somme campaign, and the bloodiest day in British army history.  In the game, you (the gamer) take charge of one 45-soldier platoon going over the top against the German trenches and machine guns opposite (played by the game system), in various historical scenarios.  Naturally, the object of the game is for your platoon to take the German trench with as few casualties as possible.&#10;&#10;But wait. There is a twist.  Each of your men in the game is represented by a named, individual counter.  Before play, you must choose one man that &quot;represents&quot; you.  To win the scenario, your platoon must take the enemy trench, AND your man must survive.  And your platoon is one from many historical units that attacked that first day.  For instance, the standard scenario (&quot;Red Hand at Thiepval Wood&quot;) represents one platoon from A Company, 14th Royal Irish Rifles (Belfast Young Citizens), which is part of the 109th Brigade, 36th (Ulster) Division, attacking northwest of Thiepval. Other historical scenarios are also provided (seventeen in all, plus campaign games).  Regular, Territorial, and New Army units--soldiers and officers--are represented in the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Essentially, Battle of the Somme has been designed to be an experience game, in some ways a mix be-tween a traditional wargame and an historical role-play game. Essentially, you will set up your plan of attack, and then watch the action &ldquo;unfold&rdquo; before your eyes, as your (mainly) Pals formations go over the top toward their destiny.&#10;&#10;This PDF version includes a 50-page illustrated, color rule book containing all the rules, tables, advanced game rules, and optional rules necessary for play, a 7&quot; x 10&quot; hexagon mapsheet, 540 individually names color soldier counters, game markers, and a Reference Card, 17 historical scenarios (see below), campaign games, historical commentary, and designer's notes.  After scanning and printing the game components, you will need to separate them before play.  You will also need a six-sided die, and a deck of standard playing cards to play.&#10;&#10;From the Designer's Notes:  &quot;Individually named counters remind us that individuals fought and died that summer morning, 60,000 British casualties all told (including 20,000 killed) by the end of the first day. Success was spotty.... To HQ it didn&rsquo;t matter if particular soldiers or units survived or not, as long as objectives were taken and the timetable met. But to each particular soldier involved it did matter, and the game&rsquo;s victory conditions reflect this. And shame on you if you decide to 'go to ground' and let your pals lead the advance on the enemy trench. There&rsquo;s no rule against this sort of behavior, but it says something about your character and courage if you resort to such a tactic, even in a game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battle of the Somme is a new edition of Poor Bloody Infantry: Somme thas was published by Minden Games in 2016.  The basic game is unchanged, but this edition adds 400 new soldiers and counters, triples the size of the rulebook to provide more detail and background information, adds more scenarios, and, importantly, provides advanced game rules for the first time that individually rate soldiers and uses rules that provide more complexity while retaining the high playability of the standard game. &#10;&#10;The game rates high in playability and historicity, with scenarios that can be completed in about half an hour.  The rules and scenarios will hold interest for miniature wargamers as well.  The game provides good, old-fashioned historical wargaming fun, as well as solid and sobering historical lessons about WWI trench warfare.&#10;&#10;Also provided in this PDF version is the Battle of the Somme Extra Counter Set, which includes two additional soldier counter sheets, two historical platoons (well over 300 new counters overall), and two additional scenarios involving these platoons.  With this module, you will have everything you need to create any number of unique platoons representing units going over the top during the first day of the Big Push.&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;1.

    "Description": "Mers-el-Kebir, 1940 is a solitaire game based on the Royal Navy's attack on part of the French fleet along the coast of North Africa, at Mers-el-Kebir, in 1940.  &#10;The game is among that rare lot of simulations that may be played equally well by two-players or solitaire, and if solitaire, by either side.  &#10;The game uses the Advanced Salvo! system to handle WW2 naval combat.&#10;&#10;It is the summer of 1940.  &#10;France has just signed an armistice with Germany.  &#10;What will happen to the French navy?  &#10;If Germany got its hands on the fleet, it would tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean.  &#10;The French have vowed never to surrender the fleet to the Germans... but what if?  &#10;Britain cannot risk this possibility, and so sailed a fleet down to the coast demanding that the French ships sail as a British ally (in violation of the armistice), intern their ships in a neutral port, or be scuttled.  &#10;The British said they would destroy the French ships at Mers-el-Kebir if these terms were rejected.  &#10;The French rejected the terms... which brings us to the battle, late afternoon, July 3, 1940.&#10;&#10;What will happen?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Another set of song cards tells the players what instruments and values are required to perform the song.&#10;&#10;Players can draft cards when they match their colour, and by trading with other players, they can get their orchestra together. Once a player can match a song card, they declare and the music begins.&#10;&#10;",

Well the rules allow for spying, assassination, stirring speeches and the rules of war as well as the usual mechanisms for playing a wargame!&#10;&#10;The sequence of play begins with any artillery shooting by either side, then one side moves and issues orders, then combat is resolved, and the next side then has a go (in other words, You-go;I-go).&#10;&#10;Armies begin in march columns, so scouting plays a part in the tabletop wargame to discover where enemy forces are. Each column is represented by an officer figure until it is spotted so you really don&rsquo;t know what the enemy&rsquo;s doing until your patrols see them!&#10;&#10;Orders are used, and the possibility of marching to the sound of guns included. Allowance is made for brigadiers disobeying orders as well!&#10;&#10;All in all a very different set of rules for grand tactical battles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Castilian fleet had been sent to attack the English at La Rochelle, which was being besieged by the French. Besides Boccanegra, other Castilian commanders were Cabeza de Vaca, Fernando de Pe&oacute;n and Ruy D&iacute;az de Rojas.&#10;&#10;Pembroke had been dispatched to the town with a small retinue of 160 soldiers, &pound;12,000 and instructions to use the money to recruit an army of 3,000 soldiers around Aquitaine for at least four months. The strength of the fleet is estimated as between the 12 galleys given by the Castilian chronicler and naval captain L&oacute;pez de Ayala and the 40 sailing ships, of which three ships were warships and 13 barges mentioned by the French chronicler Jean Froissart. Probably it consisted of 22 ships, mainly galleys and some naos (carracks) three- or four-masted ocean sailing ships. The English convoy probably consisted of 32 vessels and 17 small barges of about 50 tons.&#10;&#10;The Castilian victory was complete and the entire convoy was captured. On his return to the Iberian Peninsula, Boccanegra seized another four English ships. This defeat undermined English seaborne trade and supplies and threatened their Gascon possessions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher and wikipedia&#10;&#10;",

A Plantagenet English fleet commanded by Hubert de Burgh attacked a Capetian French armada led by Eustace the Monk and Robert of Courtenay off Sandwich, Kent. The English captured the French flagship and most of the supply vessels, forcing the rest of the French fleet to return to Calais.&#10;&#10;The French fleet was attempting to bring supplies to Prince Louis, later King Louis VIII of France, whose French forces held London at that time. The English vessels attacked from windward, seizing Eustace's ship, making Robert and the knights prisoner and killing the rest of the crew. Eustace, a notorious pirate, was executed after being taken prisoner. The battle convinced Prince Louis to abandon his effort to conquer England and the Treaty of Lambeth was signed a few weeks later.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher and wikipedia&#10;&#10;",

The English fleet, commanded by the King, the Black Prince and Sir John Chandos, sets sail to intercept the Spanish.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Winchelsea or the Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer (&quot;the Spaniards on the Sea&quot;), was a naval battle that took place on 29 August 1350 and was a victory for an English fleet of 50 ships commanded by King Edward III over a Castilian fleet of 47 larger vessels commanded by Charles de La Cerda. Between 14 and 26 Castilian ships were captured, and several were sunk. Only two English vessels were sunk but there was significant loss of life. The battle was part of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.&#10;&#10;English trade, war finance and ability to bring force to bear against France was heavily reliant on seaborne transportation, especially to its territory in Gascony. With its own ability to raise and support a fleet much reduced by English activities, the French hired Castilian ships to blockade English ports. Frustrated by their effectiveness, Edward III himself led the fleet which intercepted them and inflicted heavy losses. In spite of this success English trade and ports had little respite from French, and French-sponsored, naval activity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher and wikipedia&#10;&#10;",

You may use your own naval miniatures to play, or the ship counters provided.  Ships from Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey are included. Instructions are written with 1/3000 scale in mind, but provision is made for converting effortlessly to other popular scales.&#10;&#10;The game is based on Fletcher Pratt's classic system, but uses tables and dice rolls instead of range estimation for fire combat.  The system is further enhanced by new procedures for ranging fire, critical hits, shell splashes, weather, ammunition rules, and many other small additions which, when used together, increases authenticity with little affect on playability.&#10;&#10;To see sample pages of the book, click on the icon below left.  These pages will give you a good look at what is included in the book.  The design goal of NavTac is to provide a game high in playability, and high in authenticity covering the World War I era.&#10;&#10;NavTac: Coronel &amp; Falklands includes ships, standard, optional, and advanced rules, several scenarios, all in a handsome book format (full-bleed, black &amp; white, 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; size), including illustrations and ship counter facsimiles that you can scan and print on your own.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It contains 54 ship counters, full ratings, movement logs, and a complete ship data (damage) card for all the ships.  Simply scan and print what you need, it's that simple.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Golden Serpent is a deck building card battle game with a dark fantasy occult theme, where players take turns playing characters, relics, and spells to kill their opponent's leaders. Players take control of 1 or more of 3 dueling factions: the Pagan, the Chosen, or the Fallen, by constructing a deck prior to the start of the game. Each faction offers unique abilities and strategies to the game play. The game comes with a full playable set of all cards to choose from.&#10;&#10;Each player will have 2 draw piles that make up their deck, preventing players from being flooded with card types they don't need as they can choose which to draw from: a character draw pile made entirely of character cards, and an arcana draw pile made up of relic and spell cards. Additionally each player must start the game with 1-3 leader cards in play, which each offer unique abilities that are unlocked as they level up by killing opposing characters. Players may have a mix of factions within their deck as long as the have a leader for each faction. Lastly a shared draw pile of immortal cards are set aside at the start of the game, containing 1 of each immortal card. Players are able to summon these powerful cards only by taking enemy characters prisoner during combat, and then waiting until their next turn to sacrifice the prisoner to the immortals.&#10;&#10;Rather than using resource cards or counters, cards are played using a delayed purchase mechanic referred to as the cool down system. Cards are put into play expended (rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 0-3 times, representing the number of turns that must be waited for the card to be usable, as cards only cool down (rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise) once per turn automatically. Likewise, abilities and attacks require cards to expend 0-3 times when used. Players must manage when their cards are ready for use to make sure they aren't left open to attack. Each faction offers unique key abilities that let you cool down cards faster in different ways: the Pagan by drawing cards, the Chosen by attacking, and the Fallen by casting spells. Strategically utilizing these abilities is key to gaining advantage over opponents.&#10;&#10;Golden Serpent takes place centuries after the Chosen conquered and thought to have exterminated the Pagans, ancient people who ritually worshiped the god of balance and the god of chaos (the Golden Serpent). When a group of Chosen missionaries stumble upon a crumbling Pagan temple housing an evil book left on earth by the Golden Serpent, the spirit of chaos is unleashed into the world and the Fallen faction is created. Now the few Pagan people left come out of hiding to stop the Fallen from summoning the Golden Serpent to earth, and war erupts between the 3 factions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Disappointed by generic rules for the mid to late 19th century &quot;It's Getting a Bit Chile&quot; was written to cover the War of the Pacific 1879-1884, between Chile and an Alliance of Peru &amp; Bolivia. The War is also known as &quot;The 10 Cent War&quot; or &quot;The Saltpetre War&quot; as it was fought over taxation and mining rights in the Atacama Desert.  Although not well known in Europe the War had long term effects in South America and its peace treaties were only finally implemented at the end of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;The armies of both sides had learned a lot from the Franco Prussian War and were equipped with fairly modern weapons and European style equipment and uniforms. Their attempts to mirror European tactics were met with varying degrees of success as they came to terms with fighting with breech loading rifles and machine guns. The armies were small by the standards of European Wars or the American Civil War, making it a War that is reasonably easy to assemble forces for and refight on a tabletop.&#10;&#10;The War is well served by excellent quality, readily available books in English (including an Osprey), and figure ranges in 10mm, 15mm and 28mm. The armies are colourful with an interesting array of uniforms. The Bolivians even had a cuirassier regiment! If you can't wait and want to read more of the background, the Wikipedia pages are very good.&#10;&#10;The rules were written to be played on a squared grid, but also contain adaptations to play conventionally with measured distances. The mechanisms are original but simple to learn and make use of a Disorder mechanism rather than figure removal, so all of your figures stay on the table for longer. Because of the use of the grid the rules are suitable for figures in all scales and basing. Infantry regiments, for example, are made up of 4 bases. It is unimportant how many figures are on each base, - you could even represent units with 4 figures and play on a large chess board if you are short of space.&#10;&#10;The rules include a short history of the war, a uniform guide, sample orbats, Regimental flags you can scan and use and unique characteristics for many of the well known commanders of the War. There's also a Bibliography and a list of manufacturers with suitable figures from 6mm to 28mm.&#10;&#10;A bit obscure, perhaps? Well, it's the perfect opportunity to stand out in a crowd and do something truly different.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nickel is a perfect-information strategy game for two players designed to be played with Looney Pyramids. A 5&times;5 grid is randomly filled at the beginning of the game with 25 pyramids, each of which consists of a unique combination of color and orientation (N, E, W, S, standing-up). Players then alternate turns removing one of the pyramids on the board and replacing it with one of their tokens. Moves are restricted based on the pyramid that your opponent has just removed: you must play in a square that matches this just-removed pyramid in either orientation or color. The goal is to form an L shape or a straight line of your tokens. An alternate win condition is to leave your opponent without a legal play at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Buddha is a trick-taking game in which players bid the number of tricks they think they can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under. This is why a good balance of winning and losing the tricks is important.&#10;&#10;Buddha uses a 70-card deck that consists of:&#10;four suits Element cards (Air/Fire/Water/Earth) numbered 1-14, &#10;five Yin cards [a Yin card never beats a card], &#10;five Yang cards [a Yang card always any numbered card], &#10;two Yin-yang cards [can be played as either Yin or Yang cards],&#10;one Buddha card [beats all the other cards except the Black Hole card],&#10;one Black Hole card [nobody wins the current trick].&#10;&#10;The game lasts six, five, or four rounds depending on the number of players: &#10;&#10;    In a six-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 14, then deal each player 11 cards, you should have a 66-card deck to start with,&#10;    In a five-player game, deal each player 14 cards, &#10;    In a four-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 12-13-14, then one of the Yin cards and one of the Yang cards, then deal each player 14 cards, you should have a 56-card deck to start with,&#10;    In a three-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 11-12-13-14 , then keep one of each of the special cards, deal each player 15 cards, you should have a 45-card deck to start with.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after six (six-player or three-player game), five (five-player game) or four (four-player game) rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, all players take a look at their dealt hands, then simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out their fists and on the count of three, revealing a certain number of fingers.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads an Element card, then all other players must follow the same Element, if possible. If a player leads a Yin card, then the second player determines the Element led. If a player leads a Yang card, the Buddha, or the Black Hole card, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases, a player may always play an unnumbered card, even if they hold cards in the same Element led.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matches his/her bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, he/she scores 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player misses his/her bid, he/she loses 10 points for each trick that he/she was off, whether it's more or fewer than predicted. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he/she scores 20 points if successful, plus he/she wins points equal to the highest bid made times 20, if he/she misses their bid, he/she loses 20 points for each trick he/she takes.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after X rounds, wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cr&oacute;nicas del Estallido is a cooperative game about the social protests in Chile in late 2019. Gameplay resembles Anno Domini/Timeline, but the game is played cooperatively: &#10;Each player has a number of event cards in front of them. The cards show an event on the red side, and the same event plus the day it happened on the yellow side. Players keep the red side of their cards up, so they cannot see the date. One random event is placed in the middle of the table. Players now take turns placing one of their cards either on the left or the right of the initial card (and subsequent ones) to form a correct timeline of events. When each player has only two cards left, the placed cards are flipped to the yellow side. For each card that is at the correct place of the timeline, the players score a point. The more points, the better the result.&#10;Group discussion is encouraged, with the card holder having the final word about where to place a given card. &#10;The game is aimed at keeping memories about the series of events alive. &#10;No individual designer is named, as the game was a colloborative effort by many people, but there is a long list of credits. Each card was also illustrated by a different artist.&#10;&#10;[i]User summary[/i]&#10;&#10;",
