We are fully aware that those rules are anywhere near actual physics, but we think it is the best compromise between gaming experience and feel of in-universe reality. You will judge it on your own.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to disable and destroy opponent's Yager forces, but may vary with different missions. Game is played using miniatures, counters, cards and dice. Each craft has a specific maneuver and offensive capability. Turn is divided into &#10;1. Initiative, &#10;2. Maneuver Action, &#10;3.

The British player can build laboratories and barracks, move armies across different countries, ask for the help of politicians and military leaders and even call the mighty Thunderchild!&#10;&#10;The other player will control the cruel Martians. Their main resource is human blood. Therefore, the player will have at his disposal a sinister blood farm to supply his armies. He can also raise the Red Weed and build tripods, handling machines or flying machines in order to complete the conquest of Earth.&#10;&#10;When humans and aliens meet in a country, there is a battle. Battles are played in a fast and tactical way. Each troop has a different combat value, based on its speed and its fire power. When an army recieves damage, the general can distribute it between their men... but, beware! A destroyed unit can't retaliate!&#10;&#10;The British will rely in their courage and bigger numbers. If everything fails, they can retreat to a safer place. The Martians can use the heat-ray, the black smoke and raw fear in order to win the combat.&#10;&#10;The British have three ways of winning:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Unite all nations of the Earth via diplomatic action.&#10;     Destroy every single martian unit.&#10;     Resist until the bacteria kill the invaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Martians have also three ways of winning:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Scare all nations of the Earth.&#10;     Conquer seven regions of the world map.&#10;     Raze three regions of the world map.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Masada: Epic Last Stand in the Desert is a simple solitaire simulation covering the historic siege of Masada by the Romans in 73 A.D. Its purpose is to show the dynamics and characteristics of the original siege, allowing one to see events unfold in a realistic manner, and thus, understand them better. The game system replicates the siege with the gamer watching events unfold toward resolution as the giant Roman ramp grows ever closer to the fortress plateau...and destiny.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;Masada is a game on the epic siege of Masada in 73 A.D.  You as the Roman are trying to win as timely as possible. The game system replays the siege. The sequence of play is simple as it has an events phase and an action phase. Both these phases involve rolling dice to see what the Roman accomplished or how game events up to that point impact the turns die rolls.&#10;&#10;In the Action Phase, the Roman is hoping that they get to place a ramp. Placing a ramp means the X Legion is getting closer to the plateau where they can assault the redoubt. What can also happen is the result ends up with you rolling on the Defenders Response Table. It's a series of simple calculations - add together the current Supply Index and the sum of 2 dice, comparing it to the current number of ramps placed. If the Defenders total is higher the result is simply no effect. HOWEVER if it is lower - urk...roll another die and compare that to the current Defender's morale Index to get your results.Upon conclusion of the action phase, you end that turn.&#10;&#10;It is interesting to note there is no turn limit in the game as historically the Romans were committed to destroying this last resistance.  Upon placing the 16th Ramp, the siege ramp is now completed and combat now happens.&#10;&#10;First though you roll to see if the defenders commit mass suicide (the historic result) or if there is a fight to the death. The combat phase can last up to 19 combat rounds. Each Roman roll of 6 eliminates a defender, and Romans roll first. There is no simultaneous combat where each side gets a chance to roll before results are implemented.&#10;&#10;The system neatly handles the increasing Roman legionnaire presence on the plateau as each turn the Roman combat value increases by one to a maximum of 19. This means the Roman would roll 19 combat rolls for the final combat round. The surviving defenders roll with each die roll of 6 moves the Combat rounds forward. Each 6 combat rounds the defenders survive results in the Roman Victory Points being lowered by 1.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Combat Leader is Minden's game series that simulates tactical level infantry combat during the Second World War.  Counters (5/8th inch) represent individual soldiers that are individually named and rated for marksmanship, morale, melee ability, leadership rank, and weapon.  The map scale is 17 yards per hex, and time scale is between 45 and 60 seconds per turn.  A variety of scenarios enables gamers to conduct firefights between individual squads.  The game was designed for two-players.&#10;&#10;Like all Minden releases, this game series emphasizes historicity and playability.  Games and modules may be freely combined.  The first two releases cover the titanic struggle on the east front, at the smallest scale possible... individual German and Russian soldiers.  The counters reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each army.  Note that players must supply a six-sided die and deck of standard playing cards to play, and the two-sided counters must be cut apart prior to play.&#10;&#10;Tanks?  No tanks!  The Combat Leader system is a two-player game designed to simulate tactical infantry firefights between individual soldiers and leaders in an historically faithful yet highly playable manner.  And yes... more games and nationalities for the Combat Leader system are planned.&#10;&#10;While the Combat Leader game system was designed for two players, many solitaire enthusiasts would consider it &quot;solo friendly&quot; since it is low complexity, there are not many units on the map at any time, and there is some &quot;chaos&quot; and variability built into the system (similar to other two-player games published by Minden).&#10;&#10;Combat Leader: Core Rules is Minden's rulebook for the entire Combat Leader game system. It includes all standard, advanced, and optional rules to play the game. The book also contains portions of game maps and soldier counters to allow you to play sample scenarios. To fully employ these rules, it is assumed that players have access to at least one Combat Leader game, module, or game component set.&#10;&#10;COMBAT LEADER: CORE RULES is a 52-page book containing all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, covering German and Russian soldiers (including rules for Green, SS, Assault Engineer, and Volkssturm squads, and commissars)&#10;&#10;",

Shout out saucy answers to any Statement Cards to win more Nasty Woman cards.&#10;&#10;This game includes:&#10;-20 Nasty Woman Cards&#10;-55 fill-in-the-blank Statement Cards&#10;-25 Action Cards (including Girl Gang, Attack of the Mansplainer, and Visionary Cards)&#10;-10 You're Trumped Cards&#10;-Instructions with Nasty Woman Bios and Feminist Field Notes&#10;&#10;Celebrate your favorite feminists.&#10;&#10;Notes give definitions and context for feminist terms and phrases.&#10;&#10;In more detail...&#10;To start the game, each player is dealt one prized Nasty Feminist card, featuring 1 of 20 women who have changed American history, and you&rsquo;ll earn more as you play. And just like in real life, the more amazing women you have on your side, your chances to win are greater. This card keeps you in the game if you get the dreaded&hellip;&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;re Trumped card! This is the death card which means you&rsquo;re out, loser! It&rsquo;s really the worst card you can get. Getting trumped is truly, truly terrible. But, you can trade in a Nasty Feminist card to stay in the game.&#10;&#10;To earn Nasty Feminist cards you&rsquo;ll need to win Statement cards, which are unfinished statements about politics, celebrities, and current events. Each player will finish the fill-in-the-blank statement with their best improvised verbal answer and the judge (the person who drew the card) will pick their favorite one. The winner gets to keep the statement card. You can trade in 3 of your earned statement cards for a Nasty Feminist card during the game.&#10;&#10;The game can end in two ways: the last person standing or the person who has the most Nasty Feminist cards once you&rsquo;ve gone through the entire deck wins.&#10;&#10;",

Incantations summon forth new conjurations of unprecedented power and frightful sentience, but beware &ndash; such endless spells can be treacherous, as likely to turn upon their caster as they are to devastate the enemy. From unleashing disembodied gnashing jaws to devour your foes, to raising prismatic barricades to protect your flanks, doing battle in the time of the Arcanum Optimar is unlike anything that has come before.&#10;&#10;The Malign Sorcery boxed set is an expansion for Warhammer Age of Sigmar containing new rules and spells for magic, along with 17 imposing miniatures used to represent Endless Spells, powerful pieces of sorcery that can be unleashed by any wizard. These rules and miniatures can be used alongside the core rules to introduce wildly different and incredibly powerful spells brought about by the Arcanum Optimar &ndash; an age of rampant magic. When combined with the Realm of Battle rules found in the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, this set becomes a gaming toolbox you can use to fight narrative-driven battles in the Mortal Realms.&#10;&#10;Contained within the box:&#10;&#10;The Book&#10;&#10;Malign Sorcery features an 88-page hardback book packed with rules and background:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Magic in the Mortal Realms: a history of magic in the Mortal Realms, tracing the origins of sorcery back to the Age of Myth and presenting detailed information on the differing specialisations of various races, and the magics of the Eight Realms.&#10;     The Learning of Magic: all sorcerers face the same dangers when bending wild powers to their will &ndash; the forces Order, Death, Destruction and Chaos deal with these dangers in their own manners, detailed here;&#10;     Concerning Realmstone: this mysterious substance contains enough power to annihilate cities &ndash; here is detailed the different realmstones which can be found across the Eight Realms;&#10;     Descriptions of 13 manifestations that herald a new era of magic, which will soon be seen of every battlefield in the Mortal Realms;&#10;     A showcase of the miniatures found in the box, including step-by-step guides and descriptions of effective painting techniques.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Rules expanding the use of magic in games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar make up the second section of the book:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Endless Spells: these are the rules for using the miniatures included with Malign Sorcery, magical constructs which remain in play until dispelled or out of bounds. This includes 5 Narrative Battleplans designed for use with this set;&#10;     Skirmish on the Realm&rsquo;s Edge: the wild magics unleashed by the necroquake grow wilder the closer to the borders between realms an army finds itself &ndash; these are rules for fighting skirmishes right where the sorcery is at its strongest.

This is because the AI difficulty has been designed around the &quot;core&quot; product.  This is mainly because the Trade Agreements with Colonies will give the player a fairly large advantage with the Planetary Expansion.&#10;&#10;This expansion is comprised of a total of 18 cards for the one (1) player experience. It features a 12 card initial deck and an 6 card development deck which makes the solo experience harder as the game progresses.

There are seven purple Cabooses (numbered 8 &ndash; they match any train) and two orange Broken Cabooses (letter B - a blocking card which cannot be matched), plus a rule book which doubles as game board (if desired).&#10;&#10;During setup, the players are each dealt seven cards, then four cards are laid faceup in a cross shape (N, E, S, W) creating railway piles, with the remaining deck of cards placed in the middle of the cross.&#10;On your turn you must draw a card first, then you may do any of the following if you can: Play the next lower card of the same color on any railway pile, play a Caboose or Broken Caboose in an empty corner (the space between the railway piles), move any sequence of cards onto another pile that continues the sequence (such as blue 5-4-3 moved to a blue 6), play any train card (numbers 1-7) on a vacated railway pile, or remove any complete train (sequence 8-1) from the play area.&#10;&#10;Sharpen your color recognition and your number counting skills in this quick and fun train game. Again, the players play cards and build trains until one player runs out of cards. The play time per game is about 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Dragons will have to strategically create a plan to inflict the most damage to their opponents through the combination of statistics on their cards and abilities of cards played.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Dragon who is able to deal a total of 100 damage to their opponent over the course of multiple rounds of play.  Each Dragon begins with 100 Health Points, and once their total reaches 0 due to damage they lose the game.&#10;&#10;A Solo variant can be played as well, with a simple AI system and variable handicaps that can be set for difficulty.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Free game published in the January 2018 (GTM #215) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Muses Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;The Nine Muses of the Old World were crafted as courtly educators and advisors, always on hand to help the young princes and princesses reach their full potential. &ldquo;Nine Virtues&rdquo; is&#10;a card game about excelling in all the best aspects of life.&#10;In the game of Nine Virtues, players try to collect hands of&#10;the most valuable virtues, and to take pride in owning them.&#10;But the greatest risk is to claim a virtue you do not possess!&#10;The game is played in rounds, with each player dealing once.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Each Round: &#10;Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Then deal two cards per player face up into the center of the table. For example, if there are five players, deal ten cards face up in the center.&#10;&#10;Turns:&#10;Play starts on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must do one of the following:&#10;&#10;Bid: Take a card from the middle of the table and keep it&#10;face up in front of you. This is called &ldquo;taking a bid.&rdquo;&#10;Exception: The 1 is wild, and can&rsquo;t be taken as a bid.&#10;&#10;Swap: Exchange a card in your hand with a card in the&#10;middle. The card you take goes into your hand.&#10;&#10;Kill: Choose any card in the center and discard it. You&#10;cannot do this until each player has had one turn.&#10;&#10;The round ends when there are no cards left in the center.&#10;&#10;Scoring: &#10;The player who holds the most cards in each rank scores points equal to that rank. For example, you will score four points if you hold the most fours. (Bid cards are not in your hand.) If there is a tie, all tied players score the full value.&#10;&#10;Calling the 1: &#10;Before scoring begins, the player who holds the 1 must declare what rank it will become. It is important to do this before players reveal their hands.&#10;&#10;After this, go up through the ranks and determine who has&#10;the most of each. You can set cards aside to tally your score.&#10;&#10;Bids: Each bid you make is a claim that you will hold the&#10;most cards of that suit. If you have the most (or are tied for&#10;the most), then each bid card is worth its face value. If you&#10;were wrong, then each bid is worth negative points. If no one holds any cards of the bid rank, then all players are tied at zero. They score zero points for cards in their hands, but bids in that rank are worth their face value.&#10;&#10;Final Score: A full game is one round for each player. The&#10;player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Free game published in the March 2018 (GTM #217) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Trolls Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&#10;&#10;Summary: &#10;You are Internet Trolls, struggling to justify your place in this modern world. You will write scathing reviews of entertainment properties, spreading vitriol while also refining your unique identity. In other words,score points with cards and win if you have the most.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Setup: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Players will then draft a hand of five cards, because all good games start with a draft.&#10;&#10;The Draft: &#10;From your starting hand of six, choose one card to keep, and pass the rest to the player on your left. Keep your selected cards on the table in front of you. You will do this five more times, but rather than passing the last card, you discard it.&#10;Each player should now have a five-card hand. With this hand you will now play five rounds.&#10;&#10;Each Round:&#10;You will play cards trying to score points. The highest unique card wins each round.&#10;&#10;First, deal one card from the deck face-up into the center of the table. This card represents a new entertainment property that some group of misguided fools have poured their hard work and time into, but which is an insult to all true fans of the genre.&#10;&#10;Players will then &ldquo;review&rdquo; the property by playing a card from their hand. This play is simultaneous. The number on the card represents (roughly) the amount of spite and vitriol in your review.&#10;&#10;Next, the reviews are scored. First, discard any cards that match the center card or that match each other. These reviews are unoriginal and worthless.&#10;&#10;Next, look for the highest card among the reviews that remain. The highest number wins the round,but the lower numbers also score points.&#10;&#10;If your review was unique, whether it is the highest or not, you keep it aside for points. In addition, the player whose review was highest (not counting the discards) scores the card from the center.&#10;&#10;If all reviews were duplicated and were therefore discarded, the center card is also discarded.&#10;&#10;Winning: &#10;The highest total score wins the hand. If there is a tie, count it as a win for all tied players.&#10;&#10;The first player to win three hands wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

A new story is told each time as every expansion creates a specific goal and new actions for the bandit played by the game. That bandit may win, and if that happens, all the players lose. Thus you need to work together against this &quot;bot&quot;, while keeping in mind that in the end, there is only one winner &mdash; the richest bandit, of course.&#10;&#10;In the Tuco expansion, Tuco does not want to meet the Marshal, his former friend, against whom he bears a grudge.&#10;&#10;Tuco's Fire and Punch hit all the possible targets, included Belle. The Swap action swaps Tuco and the Marshal's places, while Tuco's Marshal action takes the Marshal away from Tuco. If a player plays an action that brings the Marshal to the same location as Tuco, he receives a Wanted token (worth $500). At the end of the game, Tuco's loot is worth $250 per bullet he has shot.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Road Trip USA, each player is a traveler, represented by a pawn, on a mission to see various sites across the USA. When the game starts, depending on the number of players, a number of landmarks are drawn from the landmark deck and placed on the board as places for the players to travel to and collect. Once a landmark is collected by a player, however, the other players cannot collect that same landmark and a new landmark is drawn from the deck and placed on the map.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players must choose to collect resources, travel, or use a free ride card. When collecting resources, they may choose any one of the available tickets (bus, rail, high-speed rail, or airline) or all of the cash currently face up in the resource pool, called the panhandle. New cards from the resource deck replace those that were taken. To travel, a player spends the required resource cards from their hand to move from one city to another city, matching resource cards to the method of travel required. Some cities are connected to one another by rail or road, others by high-speed rail, etc. Cash allows a player to buy any of the various means of travel. On a free ride turn, the player gets to utilize a rail or bus connection for free (without spending any resource cards from hand) by using a free ride card that is available in the panhandle.&#10;&#10;Landmarks have three traits: Type (entertainment, natural, historical), region (Alaska, Hawaii, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, Southeast) and alignment (represented by a number: 1-100). In order to win, a player must be the first to collect any one of the following sets: Any 8 landmarks; 2 of each type of landmark; 5 landmarks from different regions; or any 3 landmarks that have a matching alignment number (only the last digit of the number is used to determine).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
