    "Description": "'With the birth of the Kirs, shape, space, and time have been moved. The universe was determined by &quot;Kir of Run&quot; &mdash; the direction of movement &mdash; and the gods settled in their Tums on the edges of the world.&#10;&#10;Slavic mythology is a little-known theme for games, one that can hide many secrets. &#197;&#187;ercy is both a card game and a first attempt to create a complete representation of the Slavic gods and disclose this mythology full of mysteries.&#10;&#10;Who are the &#197;&#187;ercy? They are priests of ancient gods who attempt to manipulate reality in subtle ways. They are mercenaries in the hands of tribal chieftains, who attempt to divine success or disaster in coming wars. &#197;&#187;ercy, by making proper sacrifices, want to obtain a favor of Kir, the one they serve, while striving at the same time to change the natural balance of power.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player impersonates a &#197;&#187;erca, a priest of one of four Kirs, gods who represent both the seasons and the directions of the world:&#10;&#10;    Jaruna (spring, east)&#10;    Rujewit (summer, south)&#10;    Jesz (autumn, west)&#10;    Kostroma (winter, north)&#10;&#10;&#10;You must read signs in the continuous changes around you. Choose a direction for your actions and for the Kir that you want to serve. All gods who appear in the game belong to one of four Tums created by Kirs; the inspiration for the graphic representation of the gods comes from images of nature, in which the attentive observer can notice much more than just a chaos of random configurations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The battle of the Washita River in 1868 is one of the most confusing and misunderstood engagements in the history of the United States military.&#10;&#10;George Armstrong Custer led the 7th Cavalry in a dawn attack on what he thought was a single tribal village. It was discovered that Custer had struck one of several Native American camps along the river; now the Gallant Seventh faced hundreds of Arapaho, Kiowa, and Cheyenne warriors. Custer barely avoided encirclement as the Indians moved forward in an attempt to defeat the soldiers and complete the disaster by seizing the regiment's supply column.&#10;&#10;One-Minute Washita River is a microgame attempting to portray the battle with a small map and a limited number of counters. This game is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle can be completed in a minute or two.&#10;&#10;The player represents the tribal leaders. Groups of Native American fighting men pour out of their villages to block the advance of the cavalry. Rules cover historical elements like the protection (or possible rescue) of tribal noncombatants, the importance of &quot;counting coup&quot; within the tribal military structure, and the danger of reckless action in the face of an unpredictable enemy. Victory is determined by the safety of the noncombatants, the losses suffered by the Indians, and the damage inflicted on Custer's regiment. The playing pieces for the 7th Cavalry represent units the size of a battalion or a company. The supply column is also depicted. The maneuvers of these army formations are controlled by the game system.&#10;&#10;This is a companion title in the previously released One-Minute game series that included Waterloo, the Little Bighorn, and the 1967 campaign of Che Guevara in Bolivia. It is a free Print &amp; Play game with a single 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map, charts, rules, and about two dozen playing pieces or markers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game can be crudely described as Monopoly meets Scrabble. The premise is based on property development, but tile placement and scoring is similar to Scrabble.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of tiles, set up on a tile stand. Each player in turn has the opportunity of placing tiles on the board alongside and tiles already on the board. Each tile placed on the board automatically makes a row (or &quot;street&quot;) longer. At the very least a new street consisting of two tiles is formed when a new tile is laid.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player so manages to lengthen a street by placing a new tile on the board, he scores the new total arithmetical value of the street, for as far as it extends in a straight unbroken line. Each successive tile added on to a given street will score more and more as the street increases in length and value.&#10;&#10;Tiles must be matched to the board by color and number as a general rule, but there are a number of &quot;joker&quot; tiles that do not conform to this.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player achieves 1000 (2 player), 800 (3 player) or 650 points (4 player).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subtitled &quot;Mit Spa&szlig; und Fantasie durchs Moor&quot;, this is a game published as part of the Expo 2000 campaign &quot;Das Tote Moor soll leben&quot; (&quot;The Dead Moor Is To Live Again&quot;) to promote restoration of the Dead Moor area near Hannover, a historic peat stripping site. In addition to the rules of the game, the rulebook contains information on the biotopes, wildlife, history, archaeology and folklore of the moor, although the game itself is not of an overtly educational nature. Max Moorfrosch, the project mascot, also makes an appearance as a joker tile in the game.&#10;&#10;The game is set in medieval times and is played on a board of hexagonal spaces representing the moor. Village tiles are placed on the perimeter, and a peat-mining tile is placed in the middle. By placing log road tiles, players race to connect their two villages with a causeway passing through the peat-mining site, and the first player or team to complete this connection wins the game.&#10;&#10;Before each turn, a card is turned over to reveal the advice of the village elders, which may involve missing a turn due to bad weather, being restricted to playing a certain type of tile that turn due to a mishap, getting a double placement due to good weather, or some such. Obstacle tiles are also encountered on the board face down, and mostly have to simply be built around, although some when approached and turned up may also offer an opportunity to place a bridge directly across, or require expenditure of special resources (like an offering for the sacrificial site and using torch-lit roads to keep away the ghosts), or even provide the magical power of the Golden Helm to ward off hazards.&#10;&#10;The game contains rules for one, two or four players; in the latter case, two players make up a team with partially shared resources, each joining up their village with the peat tile instead of working from one village to the other. There are also suggestions for any number of players to cooperate as one team or compete as two.&#10;&#10;",

The traveler determines whether to continue his trip by placing the contact tip on the station. If the light signal goes on, he continues traveling, otherwise he places his Disney character on the station as a marker and remains there and waits for his next turn&#10;&#10;The opponent can confuse and obstruct the traveler by operating the rotary switch occasionally, to change the circuit so that the signal light will not light up and delay the traveler's progress.&#10;&#10;If a traveler is not careful and picks the trail up wrong and heads back towards the starting point, he loses all previous plays and starts his travel all over again.  The winner of the game is the first traveler reaching the goal&#10;&#10;Game consists of 4 playing boards in full color (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Frontierland, &amp; Adventureland), 4 character players, spinner, electric circuit complete with flashlight-type battery (Requires 1 D battery for the light).&#10;&#10;Produced sometime in the 1950s&#10;&#10;",

The most important phase is Promote, which symbolized your conquering of the trials and earn yourself knight virtues to elevate in the knight rank. Whenever a knight being promoted, there will be extra bonus for him to manifest the nobility. The game ends when any player collects the designated number of knight virtues, and the one with most virtues wins this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Professor Ravenwood's Time Machine is a semi co-op mystery/investigation game for 2-6 players. It features elements of hand/resource management, take-that, variable player powers plus randomization which ensures it cannot be played the same way twice.&#10;&#10;Players must work by shipping goods and trading with each other to earn enough money to buy the supplies they need to reach each location.&#10;&#10;Once a player has the necessary supplies and holds one of the 28 map locations, they can move to the investigate phase.&#10;&#10;Each location is always a mystery. There could be someone in hiding, holding a set of blueprints, or a shady character you will have to deal with. It may also contain a mystery crate with unknown contents..&#10;&#10;Mystery crates however are padlocked, and can only be opened with a skeleton key. They may contain missing components of the Time Machine or unusual artifacts which will convey positive or negative effects onto the player, or everyone else.&#10;&#10;At one of the locations, Professor Ravenwood has been locked away. When he is found, the identity of the mole can be revealed, which is one of the players chosen secretly at random at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;With their cover blown, that player now becomes a Saboteur, receiving a unique deck of instruction cards, and whose mission is to subvert the search and recover as many of the missing blueprints and components before the others.&#10;&#10;Players share the win or loss against the Saboteur, however each is also out for their share of the reward, so the person who contributes the most to the search will gain the victory points and be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;If the Saboteur wins, all is lost. Professor Ravenwood's Time Machine must not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MystiQuest tells of epic clashes between ancient gods, fought on the banks of the Styx, the infernal river. Gods, heroes, monsters and mythological creatures battle with all their power, fighting during the day and spending the night celebrating.&#10;&#10;Is a trading card game, but very close to the Living Card Games, thanks to the use of Planks, tokens and the possibility to implement long-term strategies.&#10;&#10;Each player has a board representing the fortress, on which he places the card of his Supreme Nume (or Prime) and the three heralds chosen to defend it. The heralds also represent Defence Points: if they are eliminated or used, the Prime is forced to take the field and expose himself in person. The winner first eliminates the Prime opponent.&#10;&#10;It is interesting to note that the heralds can be chosen before starting the game and this allows you to plan very specific and different strategies according to the opponent you will have to face.&#10;&#10;Mystic energy is represented by plastic gems. After playing a card you must take the gems from your well and place them on it. The gems on the card indicate the attack value, the defense value and the card&rsquo;s hit points. As a result, a card with three gems, deals three damage and can take three damage before it dies out, if it takes a damage it loses a gem and then inflicts only two damage from that moment.&#10;&#10;During the confrontation phase the player on duty plays his own cards, sends them to the attack and uses his own prodigies to try to defeat the enemy ranks and force the Prime opponent to take the field.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn there is the breath phase. Temples, Prime and some other specific cards &quot;breathe&quot; and give mystical energy back to their well, so you can add new gems. Then it is up to the opponent to repeat the same sequence until one of the two Prime is defeated.&#10;&#10;Another interesting feature is the possibility of playing in teams, even with &quot;asymmetric&quot; solutions: one against two, two against three, two against four, etc. thanks to the gaming system that automatically self-balances.&#10;&#10;For the setting the mythological theme was chosen as an alternative to the now too widespread Fantasy. Currently it is possible to play with three Pantheon:&#10;- Ancient Greeks&#10;- Ancient Egyptians&#10;- Vikings&#10;The Japanese pantheon is already being prepared.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;MystiQuest racconta di epici scontri fra antiche divinit&agrave;, combattuti sulle rive dello Stige, il fiume infernale. Dei, eroi, mostri e creature mitologiche si danno battaglia con tutta la loro potenza, combattendo di giorno e passando la notte a festeggiare.E&rsquo;  un gioco di carte collezionabili, ma molto vicino ai Living Card Games grazie all&rsquo;utilizzo di Plance, gettoni e la possibilit&agrave; di attuare strategie a lungo termine.&#10; Ogni giocatore ha una plancia che rappresenta la fortezza, su cui posiziona la carta del proprio Nume Supremo (o Prime) e i tre araldi scelti per difenderlo. Gli araldi rappresentano anche Punti Ferita del Prime, infatti se vengono eliminati o utilizzati, il Prime &egrave; costretto a scendere in campo ed esporsi in prima persona. Vince chi per primo elimina il Prime avversario.&#10;&#10;E&rsquo; interessante notare che gli araldi possono essere scelti prima di iniziare la partita e questo ti permette di pianificare strategie molto precise e diverse a seconda dell&rsquo;avversario che dovrai affrontare.&#10;&#10;L&rsquo;energia mistica &egrave; rappresentata da gemme di plastica. Dopo aver giocato una carta devi prelevare dal tuo pozzo le gemme indicate e posarle su di essa. Le gemme sulla carta indicano il valore di attacco, il valore di difesa e i punti ferita della carta. Di conseguenza una carta con tre gemme, infligge tre danni e  pu&ograve; subire tre danni prima di estinguersi, se subisce un danno perde una gemma e quindi da quel momento infligge solo due danni.&#10;&#10;Durante la fase del confronto il giocatore di turno gioca le proprie carte, le manda all&rsquo;attacco e usa i propri prodigi per cercare di sconfiggere le schiere nemiche e costringere il Prime avversario a scendere in campo.&#10; Alla fine del turno c&rsquo;&egrave; la fase del respiro. I templi, i Prime e alcune altre carte specifiche &ldquo;respirano&rdquo; e ridanno energia mistica al proprio pozzo e quindi puoi aggiungere nuove gemme.  Poi tocca all&rsquo;avversario che ripete la stessa sequenza finch&eacute; uno dei due Prime non viene sconfitto.&#10;&#10;Un'altra interessante caratteristica &egrave; la possibilit&agrave; di giocare in squadre, anche con soluzioni &ldquo;asimmetriche&rdquo;:  uno contro due, due contro tre, due contro 4, ecc. grazie al sistema di gioco che automaticamente si auto bilancia.&#10;&#10;Per l&rsquo;ambientazione &egrave; stato scelto il tema mitologico in alternativa all&rsquo;ormai fin troppo diffuso Fantasy. Attualmente &egrave; possibile giocare con tre Pantheon : &#10;- Antichi Greci&#10;- Antichi Egizi&#10;- Vichinghi &#10;E&rsquo; gi&agrave; in preparazione il panteon giapponese.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, using the resources available, you will pay the cost of your cards, activate abilities, move your team across the timeline and work towards defeating your opponent.&#10;&#10;Our universe is a stream of time. There are many streams, and the tech which allows to travel in and between them has fallen into the wrong hands. It is being used for drug trade, enslavement, human experimentation, and other atrocities. You will be playing a gang of dark and twisted outlaws, manipulating history to eradicate the competition.&#10;&#10;Like rocks in a stream, major events in history have the power to redirect the flow of time. Those events are called turnpoints, and their outcome can strengthen or weaken each player&rsquo;s operators.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of outcomes, each advances a type of agenda : military, political or scientific. In short: Want to make a soldier stronger? Undermine peace talks and start a war. At your disposal are six operators and a hideout. Your goal is to either eliminate all rival operators or destroy their hideout.&#10;&#10;",

These are then customized by rating each unit for skill, discipline, stamina, and any approprate special rules.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns activating the divisions of their army, with any or all units of an activated division able to shoot, move, charge etc. Any that do not do so are available to react to enemy activations later in the turn.&#10;&#10;The game is meant to be played by special attack and defense dice, but these can trivially be replaced with ordinary D6's. Any genre or period miniatures can be used, although the author recommends that both sides use the same scale!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Castle Strife Games is a collection of 4 chess variants that also includes traditional chess (on the back of the quad-fold board). The Castle Strife Games website, CastleStrife.com, includes a full description and rules for all 4 variants:  (traditional chess is Level 1), Castle Siege Chess (Level 2), Castle Action Chess (Level 3), Castle Attack Chess (Level 4), and the team game Castle Challenge Chess (Level 5). The games are for sale on Etsy.com. More information, including how to play, is on CastleStrife.com. Pictures of VCU students playing the games at the Chess Club at VCU can be seen at the Castle Chess Club meetup site.&#10;&#10;Castle Siege Chess has been programmed in Zillions of Games and can be played on a registered copy of Zillions of Games 2.0 or higher (maybe even 1.0). The latest version of the electronic game can be downloaded from my website CastleStrife.com. Click Castle Siege Chess on the home page and then click the Computer Games button in the header menu. The download links are in the middle of the page. You can then play the game either against the computer or another person by simply double-clicking the .zrf file for either the 590 pixel version for laptops or the 800 pixel one for larger monitors. It can even be played online through Zillions of Games.&#10;&#10;The circular chess board is actually a circular board merged with a square board in its center. Byzantine Chess (aka Circular Chess) is played on a 4 track circular board with a hole in the center. It has 2 directions of attack on the opponent's starting position. I (Rich VanDeventer, inventor, designer, developer, and publisher of Castle Strife Games) decided to merge a 6x6 square chess board into the hole and morph it into the inner ring of the circular board so that all chess paths progressed smoothly from the square area into the circular area. I ended up with 3 circular paths, 1 transition circular path, and a 4x4 square center and I named the board CirSquare 96 (it has 96 spaces). In merging a square with a circle, I could not avoid having 4 triangular spaces in the transition circle. Those 4 triangular spaces have turned out to be one of the main advantages of the board. Not only does the CirSquare 96 chess board have 3 directions (front and two sides) of attack (versus a traditional chess board's 1 direction of attack--frontal only) on the opponent's castle (starting area), but the 4 triangles provide a way for the Queen, Rook, and Bishop to gain a 5th direction of coverage when their paths pass through a triangular space, because they can exit either of the other two corners or sides (depending on how they entered the triangular space).&#10;&#10;The CirSquare 96 is exactly 50% larger than an 8x8 chess board. If all 24 spaces in each castle are used for pieces, it has exactly 50% more pieces than traditional chess. So the ratio of starting pieces to open spaces in the battlefield (the 4 rows of spaces between the castles) is 1:1, which is the same as traditional chess, so the board has the same feeling of openness at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;All the traditional chess pieces move the same as they do in traditional chess. You can also castle, if you use the standard setup for the traditional chess pieces. Since the board is 12 squares wide across the battlefield, there are 12 Pawns, which of course is 4 more than traditional chess. If you use only the standard 8 pieces of a traditional chess set that are not Pawns, there will be 4 spaces in the back of the castle that are open. That is how I initially played the game. It played very well, but felt too much like traditional chess. So I decided to come up with pieces to fill those 4 spaces. First, I used 2 more Knights and 2 more Bishops. That provided very strong armies, but it was not different enough for me. So started a search for medieval warriors that the traditional chess set was missing.&#10;&#10;I began looking at medieval war paintings and soon realized that the main things missing were Archers and Catapults. So I put 2 Archers and 2 Catapults in the back of the castles. I made their moves compliment the Knights, Bishops, and Rooks. The Archer became a short-range Bishop that can jump and the Catapult became a short-range Rook that can jump. They have worked out to be outstanding additions to the traditional chess set. Almost everyone who has played Castle Siege Chess at least 3 times has ended up either liking it or loving it. I started a chess club at VCU in Richmond, VA almost 3 years ago and introduced my games to the members. Some of the traditional chess purists did not want to play them, but many of the very good chess players and a lot of the average players played Castle Siege Chess fairly often. Several of the club members switched to playing only Castle Siege Chess, although that was not my intention because I love both traditional chess and my games. Much like Bobby Fischer liked both traditional chess and chess variants.&#10;&#10;A few years later, I decided to try to make Castle Siege Chess more like conducting a real medieval war on a chess board. I added Action cards to Castle Siege Chess to get Castle Action Chess. The Action cards are mainly used to give special moves to pieces that they normally could not perform. That eventually worked out quite well, but there was still a lot of aspects of medieval war action were missing.&#10;&#10;So I began thinking about what else was missing. What about weapons? So I added weapons to Castle Action Chess and got Castle Attack Chess. Weapons allow your pieces to capture opponent's pieces without having to move your piece--the weapon makes the move. That soon began working very well, and was quite popular among several of the chess club members. But there was still a lot of medieval war activity that was missing.&#10;&#10;Then I started really thinking hard about what else was missing. I came up with:  money to buy weapons and captured pieces; reinforcements; a dungeon and oubliette for captured pieces; challenges between pieces; and, a team of players (General, Commander, and Finance Officer) for each side. To make it all work, I added aspects of other board games:  dice, action cards, power cards, and time cards. I also came up with Catastrophe cards. I added more weapons--both offensive weapons for the pieces and defensive &amp; offensive weapons for the board. It took several years of play testing to work out the kinks, but the game is now quite perfected. And it is a blast to play once all the players have played it at least 3 times so they know it quite well.&#10;&#10;Besides CastleStrife.com, you can also go to my meetup site--Castle Chess Club meetup--to see hundreds of pictures of the Chess Club at VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University) in action playing both traditional chess and my Castle Strife Games (mainly Castle Siege Chess). We even had several Castle Siege Chess tournaments. My games are for sale on Etsy.com, just use the Etsy search field to find Castle Siege Chess. Links to all my games are on each listing. I hope that you will check them out.&#10;&#10;Sorry for the long description.&#10;&#10;",

A biome is a community of plants and animals unique to a habitat. In this game you have 4 different habitats in which you start building a biome: the Amazon Rainforest, the Sahara Desert, the Pacific Ocean, and the American Prairie. Each player creates food chains (biomes) in four different environments and banks their biomes for points.&#10;&#10;Cards come in four suits (biomes). Each suit has multiple cards numbered one through five. The players manage hands of five cards and have access to a central market of five face-up cards. Players may build two biomes at one time in their play area by playing cards of each biome on top of one another, with each succeeding card greater in value than the prior one, as in Lost Cities. Players also may trade with the market and discard action cards, taking as many actions on their turns as they have cards for. Hands are replenished at turn&rsquo;s end. A biome of at least three cards may be &ldquo;banked&rdquo; at any time, making room in the player&rsquo;s play area for a new biome to begin. Play continues until the deck runs out. Players then add up the values of the cards in their banked biomes and collect a 10-point bonus for each biome that used all numbers 1 through 5.&#10;&#10;After going through the entire deck the player with the highest set of banked biomes wins.&#10;&#10;Winner of Gold Medal from International Serious Play 2018&#10;2018 Seal of Approval from the National Parenting Center&#10;Best Family Game at 2017 Boston Festival of Independent Games&#10;&#10;",

Then, players take turns guessing one another&rsquo;s babels. Both the babeler and the first correct guesser receive the same score, which is the number of letters in the babel&rsquo;s meaning. For example, GDR, meaning German Democratic Republic, is worth 24 points. 3 GD LYR, meaning &ldquo;three good liars,&rdquo; is worth 14 points. Play an agreed-upon number of rounds.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to collect the most triplets. Each player begins with a hand of five cards. In turn order, a player asks for a food. Every player who has a card or cards of that food in her hand must offer all of those cards  and no others to the questioner. Players who do not have that food in their hands may either sit out or bluff by offering the questioner one or more cards of any type. The questioner chooses one offer, sight unseen, and adds those cards to her hand. Players meld their triplets when they create them. Play continues until only the cheese cards remain in players&rsquo; hands. Players score one point for each melded triplet and minus one for each cheese card in their hands.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Price of Honor details the battle of Callao fought on May 2nd, 1866. The South American countries of Peru, Bolivia and Chile united in defying the Spanish government access to the nitrate rich Chincha Islands, and over other trade issues. Anti-Spanish riots and atrocities against Spanish citizens in these nations led to Spain ordering a powerful squadron of warships, led by the ironclad battleship Numancia, to seize the Chincha Islands and blockade their coasts. This was a flagrant violation of the Monroe Doctine, and the US and British governments also sent squadrons of warships to the area to monitor the situation, and possibly intervene against the Spanish fleet.&#10;&#10;After taking the islands and announcing a blockade the Spanish Admiral Casto Mendez Nu&ntilde;ez announced that unless reparations were paid and apologies given by the South American Allied nations to Spain, the Spanish ships would begin attacking their shipping and ports. This threat was made reality on March 31st when the Spanish warships bombarded Valparaiso, Chile. The port was largely defenseless and unable to effectively resist. Emboldened, the Spanish fleet moved onto Callao where the bulk of the Allied warships and commercial shipping had concentrated. The port defenses here were more substantial and armed with modern guns, including five massive 22 ton Blakely guns in armored turrets, as well as bolstered by two ironclads, the Loa and Victoria. Learning that two new Peruvian ironclads, the Huascar and Independencia, were also about to arrive, Admiral Nu&ntilde;ez ordered an attack on May 2nd, despite the looming presence of the American and British warships whose leaders threatened to intervene.&#10;&#10;The Spanish fleet&rsquo;s attack at Callao was violent and damaging. Nearly 6,000 shells were fired by the Spanish ships alone, causing many casualties and much damage to the port&rsquo;s defensive works and Allied warships. The Spanish fleet, however, also suffered with several of their warships severely damaged, crippled, or nearly sinking by the end of the afternoon when Admiral Nu&ntilde;ez ordered the Spanish fleet to break off and retire. Although inconclusive both sides claimed victory. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?&#10;&#10;Each copy of The Price of Honor is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&#10;Two sheets of 242 (total) single-sided, unmounted counters&#10;One Players' Aid Sheet&#10;Seven pages of rules&#10;&#10;Price of Honor is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Bruce Yearian. The game uses the same card draw design as in A Bold Fight: The Battle of Mobile Bay, Duel of Iron: The Battle of Hampton Roads (already published) and the forthcoming games in Albemarle Sound (Thunder Upon the Water), Head of Passes/Forts Jackson and St. Philip (No Time For Prayer).&#10;&#10;An optional card set for the game is also available. It replaces the standard deck of playing cards, features graphics by Bruce Yearian, and has rules reminders on pertinent cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If Dragons Fight: China vs. Taiwan in the Near Future (IDF), is a &quot;what if&quot; simulation of the fighting that could occur across that island, within the timeframe of the next five or so years, if the mainlanders decide political or geostrategic conditions have evolved to where they must resolve the issue finally and by force. Such a situation would most likely occur if either or both the following two developments took place: 1) the Taiwanese officially declared their independence; and/or 2) the mainland Chinese learned the islanders had gotten, or were about to get, nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player wargame of low-intermediate complexity that posits the critical ground-phase of this might-be war as lasting no longer than about two weeks. Such a campaign would most likely have to be preceded by a roughly equal period during which the mainlanders would use aero-naval bombardment to neutralize the ships and planes of the defenders--a long established prerequisite for oceanic invasions of this type.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game that preliminary step is presumed to have been completed. The follow-on ground war would likely be supremely violent in regard to how wars have recently been judged, but would have to be limited as to its duration. After a total crisis--aero-naval and ground--of about a month, it's most likely some kind of negotiated settlement would have to be put in place (barring the complete conquest of Taiwan) due to the inescapable economic, political and social disarray both sides would be put through by such a supreme effort.&#10;&#10;In sum, then, the Chinese player is attempting to seize as much of the urban area of Taiwan as he can, while his opponent is seeking to contain the invaders' beachhead in as small an area as possible. The operational goal of the Chinese is to seize enough territory to render Taiwan inoperable as an independent polity or, failing that, at least create a lodgment large enough to force the islanders to grant major concessions in order to get them to leave.&#10;&#10;Though designed for two-player use, the game is easily adapted for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Both sides orders of battle are drawn from the most recent and complete unclassified sources available. Of course, the overall Chinese ground force goes way beyond the units included in the game. For this invasion, however, about the most that could be supplied would be their airborne divisions, their special forces groups, their marine brigades, their purpose-organized amphibious regular army units, and the line units of the Nanjing Military District. (Due to its proximate geographic location in relation to Taiwan, the NMD would be the higher-level headquarters most likely to be directing this operation.) The entire Taiwanese ground force order of battle--when represented at this scale within these system parameters--is included.&#10;&#10;Players will quickly notice there's no possibility for non-Chinese intervention into the air or ground war in the game. That's because it's not reasonable to believe the PRC would risk a wider war by launching this operation unless they'd first managed to diplomatically isolate Taiwan, at least temporarily, while the rest of the world judged whether any aid effort was worthwhile or even viable.&#10;&#10;The exception to that is in the cyberwarfare rules. In that arena of &quot;war in the cloud,&quot; it seems likely the Taiwanese would have major (though certainly still clandestine) support of many of the world's democratic governments as well as hordes of politically unaffiliated techies. Whether such efforts can prove decisive remains one of the great unanswered questions of 21st century warfare.&#10;&#10;Another overarching characteristic of the game is its unforgiving combat resolution subsystem. That is, there's no possibility of retreat from battle: all combat results are sustained as strength losses. That's to reflect the fact we have here two well armed forces, both highly motivated to achieve their objectives, and both armed to the teeth with the most lethal modern weaponry available. At the same time, both militaries would be new to warfare of this intensity.&#10;&#10;We're also assuming the invasion isn't being made during the monsoon season, so there are no rules for severe weather.&#10;&#10;Projected Contents:&#10;One 22x34&quot; map/playing surface&#10;One sheet of 5/8&quot; mounted, die-cut playing pieces&#10;One rules book&#10;Charts and tables&#10;Dice&#10;Game Box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Galaxy Wrestling Federation, you need to overcome opponents so that you can win championship belts and win the entire event, but you have only a small hand of moves that you can make, so manage them well!&#10;&#10;Each player receives a hand of ten wrestling cards and one victory card; each wrestling card has a strength value on it as well as an opposing value that it overcomes. On a player's turn, they choose an opponent who doesn't have the most cards on the table in front of them and challenges them to a bout of either strength or speed. Each player chooses a card in hand, then reveals them simultaneously. If your card overcomes the value that your opponent played, then you win the bout automatically &mdash; unless you each overcame the other's number, in which case the bout is a tie.&#10;&#10;If no one overcame the other, then you compare the values of the cards themselves. In a strength bout, whoever played the higher value wins; in a speed bout, the lower value wins; in a tie, the bout is a tie. If a single player played their victory card, then they automatically win &mdash; unless the other player did the same, in which case you tie.&#10;&#10;The winner of the bout returns their victorious card to hand (except for the victory card, which is a one-shot effect), while the loser places their card face up on the table in front of them. The winner receives a championship belt token, then the next player in clockwise order chooses an opponent.&#10;&#10;In a bout, before both players reveal their cards, they count to three, and while they're doing this, a third player can interrupt by playing one card against one of the cards in the bout. If the interrupting player overcomes that player's card, they win the bout and receive a championship belt token, returning that card to hand. If they don't overcome the card, they place their card face up on the table, then the bout resumes.&#10;&#10;When one player has three pairs of card values face up in front of themselves (e.g., 1/1/2/2/3/3), then the game ends. This player loses, and whoever has the most championship belt tokens wins!&#10;&#10;",

Two karma cards start face up in play next to the deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either reveal a card from the deck and place it next to any other face-up cards or take a face-up card into your hand. When you flip a card, if this type of card isn't already in play, then carry out the effect on the card; if another copy of this card is face up, take both cards into your hand. Karma explosion! If you have six or more cards in hand, you're eliminated from the game!&#10;&#10;When you draw and reveal a Mahe&#197;&#155;vara's Judgment card, choose the player to your left or right, then draw a card from their hand and place it on the table. If that card is already visible, then both cards are discarded from play and that player is eliminated from the game! If that card isn't present, then the player now has a smaller hand size and has escaped judgment.&#10;&#10;One of the effects on the karma cards is to grant a player Mahe&#197;&#155;vara's blessing. If a player collects three of these tokens, they win the game instantly! Otherwise the last player still in the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragon Stories is a story telling euro style game that utilizes modified worker placement and area control set in the fantasy world of the Arcturian nations.  The mighty Dragon Weyr has withdrawn their protection from the peoples of the land due to corruption and mistrust between the various races.  The leaders of the nations no longer believe that an outside threat exists which could harm their realm and have begun to manipulate the dragons into attacking their new found local enemies.  The Dragon Weyr viewed these actions as a violation of the ancient code set forth at the beginning of time and have thusly withdrawn their support from the land.  However, not all people are corrupt in the land.  The sacred religious council set up by Arcturias himself still holds hope that the hearts of the corrupted can be turned virtuous again in time.  The council has therefore laid the burden of traveling throughout the land to sway the ancient protectors, upon you.  If you accomplish the task of reinstating the ancient code, the evil that lurks in the shadows will be too weak to overthrow the local kingdoms.  &#10;In Dragon Stories, 1-6 players will manage stats on their individual player boards similar to an engine building game.  The stats on the board also act as currency in the game.  Stat labels are ranged / melee weapons, defensive armor, magical talents and various skills depending on the player board making Dragon Stories uniquely asymmetrical.  Players will interact with the game itself through stories written on cards.  Tough decisions will have to be made to convince the ancient dragons to help protect the realm.  Players will manipulate a modified worker placement system.  Player board stats will have the ability to be improved and players will have to defend the land from invading forces and possibly other players.  Ultimately though, if players do not figure out how to work together, the impending evil will take over the land.  Additionally, the invading evil is also seeking to persuade the dragons to destroy the people of the land.  Enemy forces will accomplish this through a game driven worker placement mechanic which ultimately ends up limiting players worker placement choices as the game progresses.  The only way to stop the enemy is through area control and persuading the dragons to honor the old code.  &#10;Dragon Stories also features different ways to play to suit differing play styles.  Players can play full coop mode which is an all win or all lose style game.  Players can also choose to either play semi cooperatively or strictly competitively.  In the end, you will tell your own Dragon Stories.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to end the game with the most stones or markers of the player's color. The uncertainty principle demonstrated by game play is that a player may choose the location of their next move but not the type of piece played.  To play, players take turns designating a square they wish to occupy and rolling a die to determine if their color or that of their opponent is placed.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players may place their marker on a square that is surrounded by enough of their color to &quot;convert&quot; spaces without rolling. An empty square adjacent both diagonally and orthogonally to three spaces of one color is in a &quot;critical state&quot; and if a fourth piece is placed adjacent, automatically converts to that color.&#10;&#10;Successfully placing a piece may allow a series of neighboring spaces to be claimed. Strategy and risk are combined as players attempt to shape the board in their favor, while at risk of seeing their opponent benefit instead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What&rsquo;s the Dirty Squad? &#10;The Dirty Squad is a bunch of dirty cops within the precinct, recruited by the Mafia.&#10;&#10;What is the purpose of their recruitment? &#10;A number of killers have been brought to the station for questioning, whom they must covertly help escape.&#10;&#10;How do they do this?&#10;The victim&rsquo;s friends and family members, innocent bystanders, witnesses, and accomplices have been summoned to the station as well. Using them as cover, the cops must bluff the killers out. They&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if it means using every dirty move in the book to do so.&#10;&#10;What do they get for this work they're doing?&#10;The dirtiest cop &mdash; the one who lets the most number of killers escape, wins the game by becoming the Squad&rsquo;s undisputed leader and the Mafia&rsquo;s highest-paid Inside Man. A reputed spot that can only be won by playing dirty!&#10;&#10;Test your skills in this underhanded bluffing card game and find out if you've got what it takes to out-bluff and outsmart the others and become the undisputed leader of your Squad!&#10;&#10;What's in the box:&#10;There are 122 cards &mdash; a mix of Character Cards and Power Cards:&#10;25 Killers, 12 Accomplices, 12 Family Members, 12 Witnesses, 12 Victim&rsquo;s Friends, 12 Innocent Bystanders, 2 Character Impersonators + 35 Power Cards + 70 medal tokens.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The aim of the game: &#10;To release the most number of killers from your hand.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;How to Play: &#10;You start by shuffling the deck of cards thoroughly and dealing 7 cards to each player, along with 3 medal tokens.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;You have to bluff the killers out of your hand, so when you want to let go of killers, they must be disguised as any of the other characters. You must never announce the fact that you are releasing a killer.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Hand Example: you have 2 killers, 2 family members, 1 innocent bystander and 2 power cards in your hand, and in your first turn you want to release killers:&#10;Place one or both of the Killer Cards face down and announce ANY OTHER character. (Say: 2 Family Members)&#10;Only you know that the two cards are NOT Family Members but the others have to gauge whether you are bluffing or telling the truth&#10;The player to your immediate left gets to decide whether he would like to open the cards and check them, or trust you and let them pass. If he passes it goes to the next player and the decision falls upon him. If no one checks your cards they go face down in your Released Pile. No one knows what cards have gone except you&#10;&#10;If a player decides to check your cards: in this case, since you did bluff, you have to give 3 medal tokens to that player. That player &lsquo;catches&rsquo; the killers you were trying to help escape and keeps them in his custody.&#10;&#10;Custody: is when a player catches another player&rsquo;s killers and keeps them face UP in front of them. This does not bode well for you, since, all the dirty cops are looking to help escape the most number of players. And when you get caught, it costs you more than just your pride&#10;&#10;But: if you haven&rsquo;t bluffed and a player checks your cards, then, they must give you 3 medal tokens for wrongful doubt, and those cards go face down in your Released Pile. Draw back to 7 cards in hand at the end of your turn.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Securing Killers: Coming back to caught killers. These killers can be stolen by any of the players, so they must be secured. You can do so by placing up to 4 medal tokens on them. To steal a killer is harder now because the player will have to match the number of tokens on the killer to be able to steal it unless he has a Power Card that allows him to steal without having to give to give tokens.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;To release killers from your custody, you can do 1 of 2 things:&nbsp;&#10;Give 5 medal tokens and close the killer, or, use the Power Card that allows you to release the killer without having to give any tokens at all&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The Power Cards play an important role in the game too. Each Power Card has its description on the card itself. Please read through the cards to understand them better. But, with those in play, the game keeps changing until the very end.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;So, on your turn, you do one of the following:&#10;Take 3 medal tokens (caps at 8. If you have 8 in hand you cannot take more)&#10;Play character cards&nbsp;&#10;Play action cards&nbsp;&#10;Release killers&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends when:&nbsp;&#10;When there are no playable cards in any player&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;The player to have the most number of killers in their released pile is the winner.&nbsp;&#10;But know this, any killers left in hand cancel out 1 killer from the closed pile. So make sure you let go of all the killer from your hand.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;If there&rsquo;s a tie, then if any player has open killers in their custody wins&nbsp;&#10;&#10;",

The other 32 tiles have chess pieces printed on one side and checkers printed on the other.&#10;&#10;The namesake custom variant Kamikaze Chess introduces two changes, custom placement of pieces and action spaces:&#10;&#10;After setting up the checkerboard, players shuffle their tiles keeping the chess symbol face down (showing the checkers side), then take turns placing their pieces on the white squares (gaps) until the board is full.  Then players flip over all of the chess pieces to reveal the layout and play chess with the usual rules from that position.  It is additionally suggested that one bishop on each side is moved to an adjacent black square at this point.&#10;&#10;When players move a piece onto any black square, they flip over the tile and perform the action listed on that other side, which may be helpful or harmful.  Players leave the space with the action side up and do not reactivate the actions.&#10;&#10;",

An unknown member of the team has been mutated by an alien entity and will sabotage and mutate the researchers as they try and repair the satellite array to contact mission control. Will you survive? Are your friends mutated by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before it&rsquo;s too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia!&#10;&#10;Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built, they escape on the escape pod or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out mutation cards to all of the humans. After each game ends players may be eligible to open up legacy style expansion packs depending on the outcome of each game.&#10;&#10;Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one action and one battery card per turn. You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass mutation cards to other players to get them on your side.&#10;&#10;Games usually last between ten to twenty minutes. Once certain requirements are met new card packs are opened and introduced into the game altering the game play. The new cards give players alternate weapons and equipment to make every play through unique.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Devil's Run: Reapers Revenge is a fast-moving and hard-hitting vehicular combat board game (for 2-6 players) set in a post-apocalyptic America.&#10;&#10;This is a standalone expansion to Devil's Run: Route 666 and each can be played on their own or can be mashed together for more extreme carnage!&#10;&#10;The Devil's Run system uses a rolling board mechanic, to ensure all players feel like they are on the edge of their seat; fall too far behind and you are out of the race, get too far in front and you could open yourself to an airstrike or an unexpected obstacle in the road. Live fast and die hard on Hell's Highway. Can you survive the Devil's Run?&#10;&#10;There are four main types of vehicles: Bikes, Trikes, Buggies and Cars. Each of these vehicle types play differently due to how they drive, their weapons and their arcs of fire. The game has story driven missions which are a mix of full throttle racing and maximum carnage vehicular battle, with an immersive ruleset to make you feel like you're a part of the post-apoc action. You use three, six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.&#10;A battle between the Hunters and the Questing Knights...who will win...who will even survive?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For example, a player might request the third card from the &eacute;clairs family (the &eacute;clairs with three symbols on it). If the opponent has that card, they must give it to the player.&#10;&#10;As long as the player gets the cards they asks for, they can continue. For each new card, they request a card from the opponent of their choice.&#10;&#10;However, if the player does not get the requested card, their turn is over.&#10;&#10;The opponent who did not have the requested card becomes the new active player. Play continues until all families have been assembled.&#10;&#10;For a two player game:&#10;Distribute 10 cards to each player. The remaining cards constitute a stack on the table. If your opponent does not have the card you want, you draw a card from the stack.&#10;&#10;",

Players each have a hand of five river cards and one bear card. At the start of the round, players take turns laying down cards face down one at a time in a pyramid shape until each player has placed three cards. Then players take turns placing their salmon on a card in the first row.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns in an action phase in which they optionally swim their salmon to a new location, jumping occupied spaces and revealing the card where they land, if it were hidden. Land on a bear and you're out for the round unless you can counter with a bear from your hand. After moving, you can either place a card from your hand face down to add to the river or pass. Once all players pass in turn, the round ends and players then collect ikura tokens equal to their rank in the pyramid.&#10;&#10;In the third round, players score an ikura bonus depending on their final rank, then whoever has collected (a.k.a. spawned) the most ikura wins!&#10;&#10;",
