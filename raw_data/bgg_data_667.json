    "Description": "A Miniatures Game of Massive Robotic Mayhem&#10;&#10;Iron Tyrants is a tabletop miniatures game of massive robotic combat. Each player will field a squad of tyrants, giant walking robots armed to the teeth with cannons, rockets, and lasers in an attempt to dominate the battlefield and crush his opponent under his metal heel. Sometimes, victory may mean simply being the last player with tyrants left standing, but a variety of scenarios are provided featuring a range of victory conditions so that every game is a completely different experience.&#10;&#10;A full campaign is also included. The campaign will have players fighting for one of three factions over control of Gateworld Atropos and the future of the Allyrian Sector.  Rules are included for the variety of environs on the gateworld such that the gateworld's weather and conditons bring the battlefield to life.&#10;&#10;The system is d10-based and features several areas of resource management leading players to balance risks versus rewards with nearly every decision on the table. The key behind this is the Overload mechanic in which a tyrant may be pushed well beyond its normal capabilities but at great risk to both the machine and the pilot. Players also have a limited supply of Tactics Dice which are used both in determining initiative and in activating special abilities provided by unique commanders. Gameplay is filled with difficult decisions in which every choice has a consequence.&#10;&#10;The game was intended to be played on a tabletop filled with terrain but hexmaps may also be used without issue. All game measurements are made from a 1-inch round base so units may be represented by any appropriate miniature. In the very near future we will be releasing printable miniatures for each tyrant in the game.&#10;&#10;It's a game about tough choices. It's a game about resource management. Most importantly, it's a game about giant robots blasting the hell out of each other across the torn landscape of the future.&#10;&#10;",

Building on the momentum of their victory over the Jade Falcons on Coventry, the Great House leaders create a Star League Constitution, resurrecting with a pen what they had failed to accomplish through the force of arms - a new Star League. With the might of all the Houses apparently united after hundreds of years of warfare, the members of this fragile union hatch a desperate plan to end the Clan threat once and for all - the complete destruction of a Clan.&#10;&#10;The Dragon Roars is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the brutal conflict between forces of the newly constituted Star League Defense Force - made up of a coalition army from every Great House - and the savage Smoke Jaguars. Detailed descriptions and maps follow each wave of this titanic struggle as the Inner Sphere sweeps into the Smoke Jaguar Occupation Zone. Twelve BattleTech scenarios and one BattleForce 2 scenario allows players to actively participate one of the largest conflicts in human history.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This scenario pack is effectively the first in a two-volume series, the concluding volume being BattleTech: Twilight of the Clans. The rules specific to this campaign are also useful for self-generated campaigns as they provide detail on such things as installing Clan Tech in Inner Sphere 'Mechs as field upgrades.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Carrier based starfighter combat.&#10;&#10;Fighter-Tac is a deeply strategic card game for two players. Each player is in command of a massive warship called a Battle-Carrier, and each uses a customized deck of cards called the Flight-Deck. The goal of the game is to use your Fighters and other cards in your Flight-Deck to destroy your opponent's Battle-Carrier, before he or she destroys yours.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of drawing cards from your Flight-Deck on your turn, then spending Resource Cards (Fuel, Energy and Ammo) to launch Fighters and shoot their weapons in an attemp to destroy the opponents Battle-Carrier. The Flight-Deck also contains other cards to aid in the fight, such as Skill Patches for your pilots, Refits for your Fighters, Modules that upgrade your Carrier, and even Support ships to increase your firepower or defense. Resources must spent to play these other cards as well.&#10;&#10;There are various kinds of Fighters at your disposal: Interceptors, Assault Fighters and Bombers are just a few. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing when to attack with which Fighter is vital to winning the game.&#10;&#10;Using your Resources, dice rolls, and other cards in your deck, your goal is to get your Fighters across the Combat Zone to the opponent's Battle-Carrier so they can make attack runs in an attempt to destroy it. Your opponent will send out Fighters to try to intercept and destroy yours as well. Any of your Fighters that make it through will be able to attempt an attack run on the enemy Battle-Carrier. Each Battle-Carrier has a limited amount of Armor Points. Once the enemy Battle-Carrier's Armor Points are depleted, it is destroyed and you win!&#10;&#10;A combination of deck construction, Fighter tactics, and using your Resource Cards wisely is the key to victory. Resources can give a Fighter or a Pilot strengths and abilities that can win the day over the enemy. They can also be used to make your Battle-Carrier more efficient and deadly as well, thus increasing its chances for survival, and increasing your chances to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;In the year 3028, the leaders of the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere gathered on the planet Terra as First Prince Hanse Davion of the Federated Suns and Heir-designate Melissa Steiner of the Lyran Commonwealth were joined in marriage. Historians prophesied that t heir union -- and the union of their two Houses -- would usher in an age of peace and prosperity not seen since the fall of the Star League. But they were wrong -- because even as the marriage ceremony took place, thousands of BattleMechs stood poised to launch one of the largest military campaigns in centuries!&#10;&#10;The BattlePack is a new and innovative game supplement that requires only the contents of the BattleTech 4th Edition boxed set to play, making it ideal for the beginning player while offering seasoned players the opportunity to experience the BattleTech universe as it began. BattlePack: Fourth Succession War is based on events in Michael Stackpole's classic Warrior Trilogy novel series. From the opening salvos until the final shots ring out, this supplement takes you step-by-step through the titanic struggle known as the Fourth Succession War.&#10;&#10;This expansion features:&#10;&#10;Ten new, ready-to-play scenarios.&#10;The new, never-before-seen Woodland BattleTech map.&#10;Eight additional BattleMech record sheets, four of which are new variants:BJ-3 Blackjack, HOP-4B Hoplite, CTF-2X Cataphract and CGR-1A5 Charger.&#10;20 full-color stand-up playing pieces.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This BattlePack is out of print, and it's increasingly difficult to find a complete pack that includes the playing pieces and map. Although it's described by FASA as their first BattlePack, it was also the last.&#10;&#10;The main sourcebook itself is still useable without the pieces although just over half of the scenarios in the pack use the Woodlands Map when setting up the map.  It's unclear if the map will be re-released at any point by the current licence holder, although other heavily wooded maps with hills such as the two Rolling Hills maps re-released in the Classic BattleTech Map Compilation 1 are reasonable substitutes.

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;Nearly three hundred years ago, the Star League was torn apart when the lies and deceits of the petty House Lords launched the Inner Sphere into endless war. The Great Father Aleksandr Kerensky led our forefathers, the remnants of the righteous Star League army, away from that chaotic despotism.

We grew stronger with each generation, awaiting the day when we would return to the Inner Sphere to save it from itself.&#10;&#10;Now is the time of the Return. Some among the Clans oppose the Crusaders' campaign of conquest, but we know that true enlightenment can only come to the misguided rabble of the Successor States through total subjugation. We will crush their honorless armies with our OmniMechs and plant the flag of the Clans on sacred Terra. Only then will the true Star League have returned to the Inner Sphere.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;The companion volume to the Field Manual: Warden Clans, this volume follows up on earlier books dedicated to the Clans and gives more detail on the seven Clans identified as being Crusader clans at the time of printing.  More detail is given on the five Clans that hadn't been covered in earlier sourcebook at the time, and with those Clans comes detail on more new equipment, 'Mechs and Battle Armour not seen before in the Inner Sphere.&#10;&#10;This sourcebook is out of print, and hasn't been released in electronic format by the current license holder.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Nearly three hundred years ago, the Star League was torn apart when the ambitious House Lords launched the Inner Sphere into endless war. The Great Father Aleksandr Kerensky led our forefathers, the remnants of the noble Star League army, away from that empty conflict. In turn, his son Nicholas forged us into the Clans: a society founded on unity, strength and skill. With each generation we evolved, awaiting the day when we would return to the Inner Sphere to save it from itself.&#10;&#10;Now is the time of the Return. Some among the Clans insist that conquest of the Inner Sphere is the only Way, but we know that this path will only lead us into the chaos of the past. Our true mission is far more noble: we must act as the Wardens of the Inner Sphere until the time is right and humanity is truly reunited. Only then will the true Star League have returned to the Inner Sphere.&#10;&#10;-- Ulric Kerensky, ilKhan of the Clans&#10;&#10;The second of two volumes on the Clans, Field Manual: Warden Clans describes the Defenders of Kerensky's Vision: Clans Cloud Cobra, Coyote, Diamond Shark, Ghost Bear, Goliath Scorpion, Snow Raven and Steel Viper. This book describes the tactics, military doctrines and battle histories of each Clan, plus special rules that reflect the unique capabilities of each Galaxy, new weapons, equipment, exclusive Warden BattleMechs and more.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;Following up on earlier sourcebooks devoted to the Clans, this gives detail on all of those Clans identified as Warden Clans at the time of printing. Some of the Clans receive more attention than others, depending on how much detail was already in print via previous books. Along with the background detail on the Clans, the expansion also details new Battle Armour variants, a new OmniMech, a new weapon system and new Warships are all introduced in this expansion, although these items have largely been reprinted in later sourcebooks.&#10;&#10;This book is a companion volume to the BattleTech Field Manual: Crusader Clans, and is currently out of print.

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;THE FUTURE OF WARFARE IS HERE!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the 31st century, a time of endless wars that rage across the known universe. These epic conflicts are won and lost by BattleMechs, 30-foot-tall, humanoid titans of metal bristling with high-intensity lasers, rapid-fire autocannon and dozens of other lethal weapons; enough firepower to level entire city blocks. Your elite force of MechWarriors drive these juggernauts into battle, blasting at your opponent's 'Mechs in a deadly game of kill or be killed. Will they become instant legends, or forgotten casualties? Only your skill and luck will determine their fate.&#10;&#10;Drawing on years of experience, this book combines the best of the BattleTech board game into a unified whole. BattleTech Master Rules is entirely restructured and streamlined; it is the same game, but like you've never seen it before. This book includes the complete game rules, a quick-and-easy scenario creation system, the Battle Value point system for evaluating 'Mechs and balancing forces, and revised and expanded miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This was the default, complete ruleset for BattleTech at the time of printing, superceding the earlier BattleTech Compendium: Rules of Warfare.  Again, no rules were included for AeroTech or BattleSpace units; this ruleset was dedicated to ground-based combat.&#10;&#10;These rules were revised and re-issued several times.  The original FASA edition was published in 1998, and was then substantially updated and re-issued as the FASA Revised edition in 2001, one of the last BattleTech sourcebooks produced by FASA.&#10;&#10;In 2002, the BattleTech license was taken over by FanPro, and in 2003 they revised the Master Rules and reossued them as the Classic BattleTech Master Rules, Revised in a softback format, followed by a hardback edition in 2004.&#10;&#10;The BattleTech: Master Rules were finally superceded when Fanpro released the first edition of Classic BattleTech: Total Warfare in 2006.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  Scenarios in this pack include:&#10;&#10;FE 50 Hungarian Action: Hungarian paratroopers drop into action! Yes, I said Hungarian Paratroopers!! This battle is the one fight where the Hungarian paratroopers actually did a combat drop. Ok this is not 100% historically accurate, the landing was unopposed and the Hungarians marched into battle but still somewhat captures the action of a bridge capture. Uses boards 23 and 49 and is medium sized.&#10;&#10;FE 51 Wolf Pack in the Hills: Many of you have been clamoring for a good ambush scenario. Ok maybe one of you, but here is a cool situation. An Italian convoy moves across the board 50 hill and runs into a Partisan ambush. Partisans basically have to annihilate the convoy, while the Italians basically have to survive.&#10;&#10;FE 52 With Friends Like These: Set on boards 32 and 50 this scenario features the Italians (actually Albanians serving for Italy) fighting the Bulgarians. A nice tourney sized scenario the Italians have to capture some buildings from the defending Bulgarians.&#10;&#10;FE 53 Operation Braun: This is the meatiest of the bunch with a large Partisan force defending against Croatian troops backed up by some armor. Set on boards 41 and 50, the Croatians have to capture some buildings. Tough to accomplish against stone buildings.&#10;&#10;FE 54 Dubrovnik 2: This is an interesting one set on board 48. Attacking Croatian troops have to kick out a small Partisan force from the village. Then they have defend against a counterattacking force. The victory conditions are tied around holding buildings, with fortified buildings (which can be made during play) counting for more VP. A smaller sized scenario that should allow for some good replay.&#10;&#10;FE 55 Friends No More: Here is cool scenario set on boards 4, 8 and FE1 (free for download from my website, for use with VASL). Germans and Rumanians try to control a bridge with the Germans having to get some VP over the bridge. Again, another smaller tourney sized scenario.&#10;&#10;FE 56 Covering the Retreat: This is a medium sized scenario set on boards w and 18. Defending Germans get some armor including French tanks and have to defend against a tidal wave, well a small wave of Russian combined arms. Germans try to hold onto a building or 3.&#10;&#10;FE 57 War Without End: Defending Germans with some Italian tanks and assault guns defend the board 12 village from very powerful British armored troops crossing the board 50 hill mass. The Germans who are very brittle try to keep a hold of a building or two while the Brits race against time.&#10;&#10;FE 58 The End is in Sight: A medium sized scenario featuring Croatian infantry and armor trying to break through a Partisan blocking force. Set on boards 10 and 44. This is another one of those scenarios featuring vehicles from Armies of Oblivion; another example of the vast amount of scenarios that can now be played with ASL.&#10;&#10;FE 59 But We&rsquo;re Not Quite There!: Once again a tired Croatian armor and infantry force, this time smaller due to previous battles tries to blast through a Partisan blocking force. This is another tourney-sized scenario set on board 45.&#10;&#10;",

Duelers miniatures stand two to three inches tall and represent a vast variety of genres and archetypes. Duelers are meant to be easy to pickup and play. Players can choose to play with two duelers or twenty; there is no minimum or maximum army counnt.  Like other miniatures games systems, Duelers is based on 6-sided dice to randomize combat. However, in addition to dice, Duelers utilizes &quot;combat cards&quot; to add an extra level of strategy to the game. Attack Cards can give you an extra edge in battle, and Defense Cards will cause your opponent's carefully laid plans of men (and mice) to go awry.&#10;&#10;In addition to total enemy annihilation, players are vying for special game objectives in the form of Treasure Chests. Successfully defending your own chests is good, but capturing your opponent's chests is what separates the winners and the losers.  Gameplay proceeds as players alternate turns until one of three things happens. Either all of the Treasure Chests are captured, or all of a player&rsquo;s Duelers are slain, or there&rsquo;s an earthquake that shakes the pieces onto the floor.&#10;&#10;",

Each deck represents a die, and each card within the deck represents a side of the die. Thus a six sided die is represented by a six cards deck with the same back.&#10;At the beginning of the game, decks and tokens are distributed. Your goal is to get rid of all your tokens.&#10;It's a risk-taking game.&#10;&#10;When you choose a deck on your turn, you get rid of tokens, depending on the color of the deck. You can then draw a number or an effect on the game. If you draw a number, it has to be lower than the last number played, or you take all of the pot.&#10;&#10;",

All three components are by themselves a game system, so having any one component allows you to play several different  games, having all three allows you to play even more games.&#10;&#10;The Alpha Word Game System is based on the original deck of Alpha Playing Cards which was released in 1997. There has been a two minor changes made to the Alpha Playing Cards in creating the Alpha Word Game System. The first is the addition of the marked vowels on the semi-wild vowels cards and the second is the addition of the board grid on the backs of the Alpha Playing Cards allowing the cards to be made into game boards for the tiles and dice.&#10;&#10;The Alpha Word Game System and its components are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License; so anyone can make their own components for the Alpha Word Game System. There are free PDF files that you can use to make your own set. If you are feeling really creative, you can design your own graphics too. You can make as many copies as you like, and if you are in a entrepreneurial mood, you can sell them. If you have question about the  Creative Commons License or would like more information please refer go to creativecommons.org.

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;In early 3061, Prince Victor Steiner-Davion returned from the Clan homeworlds triumphant&mdash;but to an Inner Sphere that was radically different. The entire Ghost Bear population had relocated to the Inner Sphere; the St. Ives Compact was under siege; Katrina Steiner-Davion was sitting on the throne of New Avalon. Even with the overwhelming threat of the Clan invasion defeated, the Inner Sphere is still poised precariously between peace and war. Who will light the spark that will set BattleMechs marching and worlds aflame once more?&#10;&#10;Drawing on information from five scenario packs, seven sourcebooks and more than a dozen novels, Shattered Sphere represents the ultimate guide to the people and places of BattleTech, as seen through the eyes of the characters who live there. Offering a brief, comprehensive history of the universe and an in-depth look at events from the Truce of Tukayyid through early 3062, this update is a must for any BattleTech fan. Shattered Sphere also includes detailed maps showing the current state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans.&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;Although Shattered Sphere was released at something of an odd time as it fell halfway through the release schedule of the BattleTech Field Manual series. It provides a general update on the major changes and events affecting the various Houses, Clans and major Periphery powers from the 3050s through to around 3061; the detailed state and border maps are very useful for BattleTech and BattleForce 2 campaigns, and this sourcebook is one of the few to touch on two of the up and coming Periphery powers, the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation.&#10;&#10;",

This allowed FASA to fold in the general updates for the Free Rasalhague Republic along with a couple of famous units associated with the old and new Star League as well as Clan Novacat, which had joined the new Star League. That makes this Field Manual more wide-ranging than the others that had published at the time.&#10;&#10;This sourcebook is out of print, and unlike the older BattleTech: ComStar sourcebook, it hasn't been released in an electronic form by the current license holder.&#10;&#10;",

Some tiles are considered &quot;scoring&quot; and the majority of the game revolves around capturing and recapturing them.&#10;&#10;There are only 15 spaces on the grid to lay tiles so games are typically fairly short (10-15 minutes).

There are 4 in total and through these, your dice can enter and move on the board.&#10;&#10;Strike Dice is a clever, short in time  and easy to learn game carrying a new innovative way to use Pyramid Dice.

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;House Steiner has always been the unchallenged economic power of the Inner Sphere. Transformed from merchant-princes to a military juggernaut by years of war, the alliance with House Davion gave them the most powerful 'Mechs money can buy and a streamlined chain of command. Now, the Steiner-Davion alliance has fractured from within, threatening to engulf both nations in civil war.&#10;&#10;BattleTech Field Manual: Lyran Alliance reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the new Alliance forces. This manual describes each Lyran regiment and its loyalties, profiles and special rules, plus cutting-edge equipment and the latest 'Mechs from the famed Steiner factories.&#10;&#10;User comment&#10;&#10;This sequel to the earlier House Steiner (The Lyran Commonwealth) is the penultimate volume in the FIeld Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA. It follows much the same format as the other Field Manuals in that it focuses largely on the military structure of the Capellan Confederation before introducing a scattering of new equipment and units. Suiting the original Steiner theme in the fluff, all of the new discoveries are biased towards the heavy end of the spectrum, and consist of such things as Heavy Gauss Rifles, a new Assault 'Mech, and the largest Warship ever constructed in the Inner Sphere.&#10;&#10;This sourcebook is out of print, and hasn't been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, That makes this one of the harder to find Field Manuals.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's web site:&#10; This scenario pack contains 12 well-tested, balanced, fun and different scenarios.&#10; FE 13 Defeat at Seroczyn, September 1939: The desperate Poles are scraping the bottom of the barrel throwing everything they can at the Germans to stem the tide. In this action the Poles attempt a combined arms assault across the board 40 river into the Board 12 village against German light tanks, armored cars and infantry.&#10;&#10;FE 14 Stab in the Back, September 1939: Poland is collapsing. The Poles are racing for the Rumanian border to salvage what they can. This action, set on boards 50, 48 and 44 is a race for the board edge as a fleeing Polish column including tanks, tankettes, cavalry and infantry try to fight their way past a blocking force of Russian tanks with reinforcing infantry.&#10;&#10;FE 15 Contested Landing, May 1940: The German invasion of the west is on. The elite German paratroopers attack using a novel approach to war, the vertical envelopment. But not all goes well at the Waalhaven Airfield. This close-run action features both gliders and paratroopers trying to capture the board 14 airfield against Belgian Infantry and AA Guns. Also uses board 13.&#10;&#10;FE 16 Where the Bullet Meets the Bone, November 1941: The former Yugoslavia was a dangerous place for the Axis. Partisans were everywhere. In this action set in November 1941, Tito's Partisans, using captured tankettes try to kick the Italian Garrison out of the board 48 village.&#10;&#10;FE 17 Philippine Scouts at Mabatang, January 1942: The battle of Bataan would prove two things; that the Japanese soldier was much better than the propaganda said and the Philippine Scouts were a tough breed. In this night action, the Japanese assault a fortified line of Scouts protected by wire, mortars &amp; SP on boards 16 and 17.&#10;&#10;FE 18 The Bear Battalion Attacks, September, 1942: Guadalcanal with all its horror is featured in this night action between the dug in marines and the best the Japanese army has to offer. The Japanese must break through the Marine line and capture Henderson Field on board 38.&#10;&#10;FE 19 Lemon Bridge, July 1943: Summer 1943 was a hot time in the Mediterranean. This all-infantry scenario pits the British attacking across boards 16 and 44 to capture some key buildings against the infantry of the Hermann Goering Division.&#10;&#10;FE 20 Collision Course, September 1943: This action occurs in the Salerno Bridgehead. Two strong forces smash into each other on board 46 and 11. Both American and German combined arms square off in a fight to the finish.&#10;&#10;FE 21 Tiger of Vitebsk, December 1943: The Tiger of Vitebsk, Albert Ernst is featured in this battle from which he earned his sobriquet. In this action three Hornets ambush an attacking force of Russian infantry and tanks. Can the Germans repeat their success where the Tiger killed 14 tanks with 21 shots? The deadly 88's will help! This scenario uses boards 18, 19, 44 and 46.&#10;&#10;FE 22 Rampage at Ritpong, May 1944: Despite frequent complaints from the Americans about the slow pace of the Chinese army this battle showed what an aggressive Chinese force could achieve. This action features the Chinese conducting a successful assault against a fortified Japanese village on the road to Mytchinka. This scenario uses boards 32, 36, 38 and 39.&#10;&#10;FE 23 Operation Spring, July 1944: Operation Goodwood was a bloody failure for the Allies. The SS troops atop Bourguebus Ridge had stopped the British attack. Operation Spring followed up Goodwood and threw the Canadians at the same ridge adding more bodies and burning wrecks to the battlefield. Can the Canadians break through the board 2 hills across boards 19 and 44?&#10;&#10;FE 24 An Unconventional Attack, March 8-9, 1945: It wasnt often that the armor was called upon to attack at night but such was the desperate measures of the German army late in 1945. In this action a lot of heavy metal is called upon to clear dug in Russian defenders from the board 2 hill.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game developed for the Quick Print and Play Design Challenge.  Players take on the role of colonizers seeking to establish plantation empires in the new world.  Adroit placement of sugar, tobacco, gain, indigo, and coffee plantations will yield rich harvests of gold and victory points.  But watch out:  native empires and geographic barriers such as mountain ranges may confound your efforts.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a deck of game cards and several kinds of tokens (all of which can be substituted with generic game components such as poker chips).  Each card represents a colony, complete with several plantations.  Players take turns &quot;discovering&quot; colonies (collecting cards), &quot;settling&quot; them (playing cards into their play area), &quot;harvesting&quot; from them (collecting VPs), and taking other actions intended to construct the most effective plantation society.  The key to the game is to place cards in such a fashion that plantations of the same time are adjacent to each other.  Harvesting from these chains of like plantations yields enormous bonuses in victory points.&#10;&#10;But watch out, for there are obstacles to overcome.  Harvesting is not cheap, and players must generate the income necessary to produce.  Additionally, geographic barriers cost gold to overcome, while native empires diminish harvest chains.  And pirates lurk nearby, waiting to disrupt the plans of even the cleverest colonial planner.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who most effectively builds and harvests will win the day.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;Beyond the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere lies the untamed Periphery. Filled with young souls seeking adventure and freedom, the Periphery is a watershed for every stripe of humanity. This diversity has spawned powerful Inner Sphere-like political coalitions, roving pirates, one-world lesser powers and bandit kingdoms striving for legitimacy. Wild, uncivilized and deadly, the Periphery is a turbulent frontier where any warrior who dares can be king. &#10;BattleTech Field Manual: Periphery describes the various factions that make up the Periphery: Magistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat, Marian Hegemony, Outworlds Alliance, Circinus Federation, the Lesser Periphery States, Bandit Kingdoms and the Deep Periphery. This sourcebook describes the history, military doctrine, traditions and tactics of each Periphery faction, plus special rules that reflect the exclusive capabilities of each Periphery regiment, as well as new weapons and 'Mechs unique to the Periphery.&#10;&#10;User report:&#10;&#10;This sequel to the earlier BattleTech: The Periphery (second edition)  is the final volume in the Field Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA. It was also the last expansion to be published by FASA, before the company ceased trading.&#10;&#10;This Field Manual is closer to the ComStar Field Manual than the House-specific Field Manuals, in that it covers a variety of different nations and areas of interest.  It was the first sourcebook to effectively treat the Marian Hegemony and Circinus Federation as states equal to the three long-established major Periphery states.&#10;&#10;Whereas the other Field Manuals add new high-tech options to BattleTech, the Periphery Field Manual adds a low-tech option instead - the Rocket Launcher - a fairly primitive but dangerous set of one-shot weapons, and adds a fair number of assorted variants to existing 'Mechs that have been adjusted to carry Rocket Launchers as a part of their weapon arsenal.&#10;&#10;This sourcebook was originally published by FASA in 2001, but was re-released with a new cover and new product code by FanPro in 2003. Both versions of this sourcebook are out of print, and it hasn't been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, That makes this one of the harder to find Field Manuals.&#10;&#10;",

The expansion's 110 cards are all new.&#10;&#10;In loose terms, Innovation is a Civilization-style game in which players first have access to low-powered cards in age 1, then build up to more powerful cards in later ages, stacking new acquisitions on old to build the strength of their holdings. Players meld cards, score points and take special actions (called &quot;dogma actions&quot;) unique to their cards in play in order to claim achievements. The first player to claim 4-6 achievements, depending on the number of players, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Innovation: Echoes of the Past changes game play from the base game in a number of ways. First, there are now two draw decks to get cards from in each age -- players draw Echoes cards or Base cards depending on the contents of their hand. Second, the maximum player count is increased to five.&#10;&#10;Third, and most interestingly, Innovation: Echoes of the Past introduces new game mechanisms. With foreshadow, a player can stash a card under his player board, then bring it into play (and use it) on a later turn when he melds a card that's from the same age or a higher one. With echo, when a player takes the dogma action of a card in play, he can receive additional actions showing on that card and any other cards visible in the same stack.&#10;&#10;",

In Merchants of the Federation, players take control of the businesses on the frontier who work to develop their enterprise and profit margins. They must decide where to build and invest, and how to profit from their ventures. Rewards come with great risks as fortunes are made and lost along the Federation border.&#10;&#10;Each player manages a Federation company in the Star Fleet Universe in Y102 immediately following the border declaration by the Federation Council. The map represents the region between the Federation Starbase and the Klingon border. At the start of the game the locations and resources of the map are unknown and must be surveyed before they can be exploited and colonized.&#10;&#10;The goal is to grow these companies by selling newly found resources, establishing colonies, and managing production on distant worlds. During the course of the game tension with the Klingon Empire increases, and players must learn to manage risk for their companies under the cloud of looming conflict between the two juggernauts. As war produces danger, it also presents opportunity.&#10;&#10;Companies have starships which are used to explore and reveal the resources of the board, and players need to determine where the money from the frontier is best made. As the board develops players will build facilities to produce additional resources for sale in the constantly fluctuating market, to fulfill contracts available from the Federation, or plant new Federation colonies.&#10;&#10;In the current playtest format the game contains a map, resource market, tension track, a variety of starships (Standard Freighter, Large Freighter, Heavy Freighter, Prime Trader, Priority Transport), an encounter deck (for ships exploring the furthest reaches of the border), a Federation Contract Deck (which controls market changes and available Federation work), and a number of resource cubes.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to visit various cities and famous attractions all over America to increase your family&rsquo;s happiness and collect bonus points. The player with the highest score at the end wins.&#10;&#10;In Family Vacation players each have four family members and a car. A turn consists of moving your car one space. Each family member has two random interests (such as Golf, History or going to the Beach). When your family visits a space corresponding to an interest they have, your family gets happier. :) Every time you travel on the road, it's boring and your family loses happiness. :( While trying to make your family happy, you might also want to visit bonus attractions (such as the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate Bridge). Once a space has been visited, it is no longer available to other players. Some spaces require the drawing of a card, which can be good or bad. Maybe your family will stop for a snack, or perhaps someone will have to visit the bathroom &ndash; right now!&#10;&#10;In addition to your car, each family has one Plane Ticket which allows quick travel between any two airports. Just make sure you plan for the long drive home!&#10;&#10;Once your family has had a good vacation and you are satisfied with their level of happiness, you can head home and lock in your score. Players may head home at any time as long as they have visited at least one of their target destinations. Once one player has gone home, a countdown begins; all other players have seven turns to make it home. Players who are home score bonus points while they wait for the last few turns to wind down. In the end, you'll compare notes &ndash; that is, scores &ndash; and see how your vacation stacks up against everyone else's. Who has bragging rights for this year?&#10;&#10;",

Easy to understand Dueling rules are included on the backside of 3 the Attribute Cards and on both sides of the Reference card.&#10;&#10;The Demo Deck contains the following 3 unique cards and 27 reprints from other sets:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Unique Body Attribute Card (strength 8)with instructions on reverse&#10;     Unique Mind Attribute Card (strength 8) with instructions on reverse&#10;     Unique Attribute X card (strength 4) with instructions on reverse&#10;     Standard double-sided reference card&#10;     26 Action Cards reprinted from 24 different decks, games and expansions.&#10;&#10;&#10;A Herocard Duel is the main conflict resolution mechanic of any Herocard game.&#10;&#10;The players have 3 cards in place as reference, Body, Mind and Attribute X. Each card lists the amount of that attribute that is allowed to be played during a given turn. Each character within the various Herocard games contains a unique combination of attributes.&#10;&#10;The attacking player lays a basic attack up to the ammount allowed by the corresponding attribute (most basic attacks use points in Body). The defending player may then play a basic defense card.&#10;&#10;The attacking player may continue taking turns adding modifiers to that attack which the defending player may opt to modify his block to defend against.&#10;&#10;If the total amount of the attack is greater than the total amount of the block, then the attack goes through. If the block is greater it is not successful.&#10;&#10;The attacker's turn is now over and he may not recover any spent points until the beginning of his next turn.&#10;&#10;The following turn begins with the next player clearing no more than 3 cards (always chosen from the top of the played stacks) and regaining those attribute points to spend. If the defender played more than 3 cards, he will have to leave one of the cards  uncleared and will not regain the full points in whatever attribute the card was left in.&#10;&#10;In a Herocard game such as Orcwars or Rise of the Shogun, a player may move his pieces on the board which dictate who is eligible to be attacked. The purpose of the demo deck however is to familiarize the player with the deck dueling mechanics and has no board game associated with it. Player two is free to attack the other player or save points to counter the next attack. Either way, the duel is over at the first strike.&#10;&#10;Action cards from the demo deck can be used in conjunction with any other action cards to create customized decks to expand any of the HeroCard titles. Each of the four characters from Tablestar's current Herocard games comes with a unique set of action cards thematically oriented to that game. The demo deck makes customized characters easy without disrupting currently existing decks.&#10;&#10;",
