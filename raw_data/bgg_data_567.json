Aircraft may be in flights or squadrons, Logistics and engineers are fully covered.&#10;&#10;A Corps level assault can easily be played on an 8' x 6' table, whilst the rules are ideal for campaign games where the action is spread across a number of tables.&#10;&#10;",

In most of the games, black is considered wild, belonging to any color.  There four games described.&#10;&#10;Al Pha Bet: All are dealt 7 cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down a word or passes, and discards down to 7 if needed.  Each word scores 5 per black vowel (there must be at least 1 per word), plus 1 per colored letter if there are at least 2 of them and they're all the same color; all doubled if the word is a palindrome (spelling another word backwards).  Game ends after the draw pile's gone and all pass; highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Alpha: Deal 7 face up to each player.  In a turn, a player draws 1 and makes a word or passes and discards down to 7.  If a word is played, each other player in turn gets a chance to add cards from their hand to the played word to make a different word, without changing the order.  The last to add to the word wins it.  Words score 1 per letter, doubled if monochrome, doubled if a palindrome.&#10;&#10;Beta: A solitaire game.  Deal 6 cards out in a line, starting 6 columns.  You may move individual cards to the top of bottom of another column, removing words as completed.  When done moving, deal another card to the bottom of each column (or empty slot if a column is empty).  Continue until the deck is gone, trying to eliminate the whole deck.&#10;&#10;Capa: A bridge-like partnership trick-taking game.  Players first bid the number of words to make, along with a color (not black).  Highest bid gets his color as trump, and his partner is dummy.  Player to his left leads first.  All plays must follow suit if possible, unless black is led.  If a word is made in the color led, the leader wins the trick; if a word is made in a different color or multiple colors, the one who added the last card to it wins; if no word is made the leader wins.  If the contractors get as many words as bid, they score for all words won, else the opponents score for all the words they won; words are scored as in Alpha.&#10;&#10;",

Rules for several games are included:&#10;&#10;Poker-WhizORD: Like draw poker with 7 cards and one draw per hand.  The player with the highest-scoring words adds it to his total.  Alternate rules add chips and betting typical to poker, with up to 3 rounds of betting.&#10;&#10;Soli-WhizORD: A solitaire game.  Player deals himself 10 hands as if in Poker-WhizORD -- including one draw -- and scores their best word.  The goal is 300 points.&#10;&#10;Rummy-WhizORD: Players have 7-card hands, and in each turn they play and score a word or pass and discard any number of cards; then they draw back up to 7.  Winner is the first to an agreed total.&#10;&#10;Thirty-WhizORD: Players start with 7-card hands, and in their turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first player with a 30-point word in hand calls &quot;Thirty!&quot;, lays it down and wins the hand.  Play to an agreed number of hands or wins.&#10;&#10;Hangman-WhizORD: Players each think of a word with the same number of letters, and pick their letters out of the deck, laying them out face down in the opponent's reading order.  Take turns guessing letters, correct guesses being revealed, incorrect guesses being noted to avoid repeats.  You may guess the word but if guessed wrong you lose; otherwise the first one to expose all the opponent's letters wins.&#10;&#10;Match'Em-WhizORD: 12 or more matching pairs of letters are pulled from the deck, suffled and laid out on the table.  Players reveal 2 cards in their turn, keeping matches, as in Concentration/Pelmanism.&#10;&#10;Precitd-WhizORD: One card is revealed.  Each player reveals another card in turn, but first predicts whether their card will precede or follow the first card.  The player who predicted correctly, and has the letter closest to the first letter, captures all the cards; no one wins if a tie or a card matches the first one.  At the end of the deck, the most cards captured wins.&#10;&#10;",

(There is an elephant on the back of each card, and a donkey on the front of the jokers.)  An extra deck is recommended if more than 3 play.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 10 cards, and the top of the draw is turned over to start the discard pile.  In a turn a player draw one from either pile and discards one.  If they think they have a winning hand they &quot;call a vote&quot;, and everyone lays down their hands to score.  The player with the highest-scoring hand adds its points, plus a 10-point bonus, to their total.  Play to 150 points for the win.&#10;&#10;One or more words can be formed from the hand when scoring, but the points favor longer words.  Each word scores the &quot;triangle number&quot; of the number of letters it contains: &#10;1 - 1&#10;2 - 3&#10;3 - 6&#10;4 - 10&#10;5 - 15&#10;6 - 21&#10;7 - 28&#10;8 - 36&#10;9 - 45&#10;10 - 55&#10;&#10;There are several possible bonuses: a player who can use all his hand to spell words may &quot;vote his hand&quot; (similar to going Gin), automatically winning the hand and getting a 20-point bonus.

    "Description": "Echelon is a three-dimensional abstract strategy game in which two players build a structure while attempting to get five cubes of their own color in a row.&#10;&#10;Starting with a black &quot;starting cube&quot;, players alternate placing in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;1) Playing three cubes in a row (as viewed from above), with at least one cube on top of a preexisting one, or;&#10;&#10;2) Playing two cubes as above, but also removing an edge-adjacent cube from the structure.&#10;&#10;The game also includes two &quot;anchor cubes&quot; of each color, which may not be removed from play by either player, as well as one &quot;shift cube&quot; for each, which may only be removed by the owning player.&#10;&#10;Note: the front of the package claims the game is suitable for 2-4 players, but the interior of the rulebook reveals that doing so entails purchasing another set of cubes (they were apparently sold in two sets; one with red and blue cubes, and the other with green and purple).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Published by and using 28mm miniatures by Eureka Miniatures in Australia, this abstract boardgame is set in their Pax Limpopo universe. The British lancers can only move diagonally forward. The clockwork Russian pigs can only move orthogonally like a rook (again, never backward). The abandoned, unhappy horses are terrain pieces but can be moved like a pawn (but into any of the eight squares around it) if the dice are right. Movement is blocked by the horses, your opponent's pieces and your own pieces. However, if you can end a move on an opponent's piece, it is removed from the game. The first player to get three of his pieces to his opponent's start line (or prevents his opponent from winning) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, two six-sided dice are rolled and the results, like in backgammon, can move one or two of your pieces. On a result of doubles, a player can move one horse and then take his regular move, or on any result of one, can move a horse instead of moving one of his pieces.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a full colour 11&quot; x 17&quot; board (not mounted), 6 British Lancers on unicycles, 6 Russian clockwork pigs, and 6 forlorn-looking horses sitting on their rumps. All figures come unpainted. The pigs must be assembled. There is a one-page instruction sheet with a &quot;history&quot; of the battle on the back.&#10;&#10;",

The jigsaw puzzle has sixty four letter words on it in a crossword puzzle grid.  Some of the words are repeats.  The same sixty words are on each side of the puzzle and the puzzle is cut so that the words are divided in half.  Many of the edge pieces may be interchanged and all of the interior pieces are interchangeable. The corner pieces are unique.  As players take turns reassembling the puzzle with pieces chosen at random, some embarrassing words may be formed.  The winner is the player who makes the fewest &quot;naughty&quot; words.&#10;&#10;",

You are one of them, a leader of a large group of anthropoids. A mysterious force of evolution makes you grow, multi-play and evolve at surprisingly high speed. For a quick evolution you need a lot of meat so you focus on hunting mammoths. The more mammoths you hunt down, the more quickly your brain grows.&#10;With a bigger brain you can do more things&hellip; You can improve your hunting skills and face your enemies more successfully. The best hunters will achieve the desired goal of evolution, becoming a modern human &ndash; and thus securing immortality of their species. Those less successful, whose development froze at a lower level of evolution, can at least go to have a chat with their relatives in a zoo.&#10;&#10;Brief summary of the game, the goal and the end of the game:&#10;The player determines by means of the cards of commands, where his pack should go. Packs go across the landscapes and they try to hunt down as many mammoths as possible (by going across cards with pictures of mammoths on them), so that they have proteins to grow their brains more quickly and to rise on the evolutionary meter. By doing this the skills of the pack will grow and evolutionary advantages can be acquired. The winner of the game is the person who will be the first to complete his evolution by reaching the level of a human homo-sapiens. At this moment the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A very early word card game.  Its deck has 36 cards, all with letters except for two Blockade Cards, which just take up space in the hand without being usable.  It also includes cardboard chits labeled &quot;5 Points&quot; or &quot;10 Points&quot;; some editions include a pocket dictionary.  The rules describe five games:&#10;&#10;Original Bild-A-Word: 5 cards each are dealt.  In the first round, each player in turn lays 1-2 words of 2+ letters on the table, or adds letters to an existing word (rearranging if needed) to make a new word, or passes.  From then on, a turn starts by drawing 1 card and ends with discarding 1 card; if the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discards to restock it.  The hand ends when a player empties his hand, and he scores 5 points per cards held in others' hands -- the point chits are used to keep score.  250 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Bild-A-Word Triplets: Like the Original game, except that after the deal, 3 cards are placed in separate rows on the table.  Players may not start new words, but only try to add to the existing rows to make new words.  Letters may be rearranged within a row but not moved between rows.&#10;&#10;Bild-A-Word Marathon:  8 cards are dealt to the table.  In each turn, a player makes a word out of any 2 or more letters on the table.  They may not repeat previous words, and have only 1 minute per turn.  When a player is stumped they are out; the winner is the last player to come up with a word.&#10;&#10;Bild-A-Word Wits: Like 5 card draw poker with words.  Players start with 100 points worth of Point chits, and win on getting 300 points worth.  Hands are ranked by the length of the words in them: 5 letters; 4; 3&amp;2; 3; 2&amp;2; 2.  Ties are broken by the letters earliest in the alphabet.&#10;&#10;Bild-A-Word Quinto: Like gin rummy.  Players start with 5 cards, and in a turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first to make a 5-letter word from his hand calls &quot;Quinto&quot; and lays his hand down.  All other players lay down their hands and make the longest word they can; the winner gets 5 point for each unused card.  Game is 250.&#10;&#10;",

Each has 45 letters and 15 blocks -- which show a checkerboard but stand for the filled-in squares between the words in an actual crossword puzzle.&#10;&#10;Each side shuffles their letter cards and draws a hand of 10 cards.  The first player lays out a word from their hand horizontally, places a block card at either end of the word, and draws back up to 10.  The opponent then places a word vertically, using one of the existing letters as part of it, also capping its end with block cards.  Play continues in this manner, one side doing horizontal words, the other vertical, forming a typical crossword.  Only one word can be done per turn.  A word may be lengthened instead, the block being removed and replaced at the end of the longer word.  If a player cannot play he passes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a side runs out of cards, or neither side can make a new word.  The winner is the one with the most cards played.&#10;&#10;",

Example: with PAT, you could name sPAT, PArT, sePAraTe, etc.  Then the score is the sum of the cards' values time the number of words stated.  There is a maximum of 5 words, and a time limit is recommended for the turns.  If the player thinks no word is possible he declares a Stymie, and if no one else can think of a word he gets 100 points; if someone can, she gets 50 points while the declarer loses 50.  After the deck runs out, highest total wins.&#10;&#10;There are several variations:&#10;&#10;1. Juniors - For younger players, use 2 cards instead.&#10;&#10;2. Sliders - use 2 cards, and only 5-letter words with both letters adjacent are allowed, one each of XXxxx, xXXxx, xxXXx, and xxxXX.&#10;&#10;3. Twos - Use 2 cards, and think of any number of words (up to ten), of any length, with both letters adjacent.&#10;&#10;4. Famous Names - Use 2 cards, and try to think of a famous name with those initials.&#10;&#10;5. Initials - Use 2 cards, and think of a phrase, or two related words, the begin with those two letters.  (E.g., with MD, Medical Doctor.)&#10;&#10;6. Solitaire - use 3 cards, and find only 1 word per triple; try to find one for each triple dealt.&#10;&#10;7. Charades - Use 2 cards, and act out a phrase starting with those two letters.&#10;&#10;",

This is done by moving around the streets of a city while buying up and developing property. Money can also be made by buying and selling stocks that go up and down in value.&#10;&#10;While the game involves some chance from drawing cards and rolling dice, without a good strategy you will quickly find yourself well on your way to financial ruin. The game is very easy to learn and during play testing has been a lot of fun! To win the game, simply keep making money while trying to stay ahead of everyone else. The game is played for a set number of rounds and the player with the most money at the end wins.&#10;&#10;I welcome everyone and anyone to jump in, give feedback, and play test if you can. Play testing takes place in New York City, upcoming dates and locations can be found on our website, link is below in this listing.&#10;&#10;",

The 52nd card, though, is a Substitute card which can stand for any vowel.&#10;&#10;Seven cards are dealt to each player.  On his turn a player declares and spells a personal name, and then everyone must discard the vowels in that name.  For example, if he says &quot;Andrew&quot;, everyone in turn must discard an A card, then each must discard an E, then each must discard a W.  Any player who cannot discard the current letter must draw from the draw pile, and discard it if it's the right letter, or keep it if not.  The discard pile is reshuffled to replenish the draw pile, if needed.&#10;&#10;A player goes out on playing his last card in hand, except that the caller cannot go out until the name he called is finished.  When a hand is over, each player scores the sum of the cards still in hand.  Play until someone reaches an agreed total, at which point the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;",
