    "Description": "The Birthday Party has not been going well. The soup was lumpy and the main course was stodgy and overcooked. Now dessert is served&mdash;the table is laden with Chocolate Mousse, Rice Pudding, Cherry Pie, Fruit Salad and so much more. The guests start to grin wickedly&hellip;&#10;&#10;The object of Splat! is to furiously flinging food at other players while dodging food they are throwing back at you. The more food that hits you, the messier you get. At the end of the game, the cleanest players are allowed to think that they&rsquo;ve won.&#10;&#10;The game uses three types of cards:&#10;&#10;Food Cards : Each food card has a special power which takes effect when the food is either eaten, or is thrown at another player and hits.  Some of these powers are long lasting while others are instant (e.g. the banana split is vitamin fortified and so increases a players hand size, while the revolutionary cupcakes contain added additives which force you to throw all your food at other players). Food cards are either green (generally beneficial powers) and red (generally not beneficial).&#10;&#10;And Then Cards : Event cards which can be played during the food throwing process to impact the course of the game.  These cards act as interrupts which provide much of the interactive story telling character of the game (e.g. Amy throws Birthday Cake at Clare but Bob catches it and throws it back at Amy on his next turn). These cards can also be played as dodges to avoid food that is thrown at you.&#10;&#10;Object Cards : Throughout the game players may also stand in front of objects (e.g. The Children, The Gnu, Uncle Harry or The Mirror).  If a player standing in front of an object dodges then the food hits the object instead and the thrower gets yelled at by either the Host or the Hostess--forcing them to discard all their And Then cards and eat a food (if they have one).&#10;&#10;Each player has a 'You' card with 5 hit locations--when food hits someone the thrower rolls to see where (Head, 2 x Arms, 2 x Legs, 1's miss).  Food which hits a location that is already messy replaces the previous food.&#10;&#10;The Butler (Jeeves) also has a hit location card--players may choose to throw food at him through the game and in addition any food that is thrown which does not hit a player or an object may hit Jeeves instead.  Once Jeeves is completely covered with food he chases the players out of the house, ending the game.&#10;&#10;Splat! is a reworking of Ed Carter's 1992 food-fight card game, Kersplatt!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first player to find, or steal all three treasure maps and reach Kelly's Island gets to dig up the treasure--at which point the game switches to a treasure run with every other player attempting to steal the treasure off them.&#10;&#10;Most of the bay cards contain icebergs, which block your movement if they come up in the wrong places, and three shipwrecked mariners who will join your crew if you find them and rescue them--increasing your fighting strength.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Arcane Warfare Project encompasses a series of miniature games for the Ancient and Medieval periods.&#10;&#10;Arcane Warfare (AWr) versions 1 to 3, from 2004, used conventional opposing dice rolls with d6. The engine was similar to other games, yet it featured a significantly different historical interpretation of the units' behaviour, therefore completely different outcomes.  Out of print.&#10;Renamed&#10;AWR the 4 and 5th editions, also using mainly dice, on a 120 com x 90 cm table. Out of print.&#10;&#10;ABC Arcane Battle Composer, is a very fast game using dice and a resolution grid, on a small 90 cm x 60 cm table. No longer supported.&#10;&#10;AWE Arcane Warfare Excel, versions 1 and 1.1 are the project's top evolution.&#10;AWE is an original gaming system dialog based, using hidden tiles under the miniature's bases. No dice, cards or markers are necessary to play.&#10;A pure diceless miniature wargame. The play area is a 120 cm x 90 cm table.&#10;First published in 2016, it is currently (2023) the only available title, in it's 1.1 implementation: &#10;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209756/arcane-warfare-excel-awe10-field-battle-rules-300b&#10;It can be obtained from Wargame Vault.&#10;&#10;Current Work:&#10;On the bench is AWE mini, a game played on a 10 cm square grid using the revolutionary Combat Tiles. All AWE games will require bases preparation with magnetic sheets and steel paper. It is driven by a unike engine, directed for the few wargaming people that seek to play miniatures games not centered in dice rolling /card drawing.&#10;The mini game will require just 90 cm x 90 cm and the big novelty is that it will include built in mechanisms for solo playing. This will require some randomization, but the two players version will still be diceless.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses a deck of cards, comprising: 75 bird cards (3 of each species), 6 Hazards, 6 Protection cards and 1 Appeal card.&#10;&#10;6 cards are dealt to each player at the start of the game. The players then pick a card from the deck (or discard pile) and then play. Sets of species are built (Male, then Female, then Young) and a completed set forms a trick and is put to one side. Sets are built up in the spaces along the edge of the board facing the player; the species has to go in the appropriate habitat (as indicated on the card).&#10;&#10;Partial sets can be protected by Protection cards and destroyed by Hazard cards. The Appeal card allows you to take one card from another player, in return for the Appeal card, which can then be used again by its new owner. Some of the species are &quot;Rare Species&quot;. Completing these sets gains the player the appropriate counter.&#10;&#10;To end the game you have to get a certain number of sets of species, with the rare ones counting for 2 or 3, depending on the value on the counter. Points are then totaled, with each species set being worth 50 points, with the appropriate multiplier (x2 or x3) for the &quot;Rare&quot; species, and cards in front of each player (but not yet in completed sets) being worth 10 points each.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Totalfootball is a Football (soccer) strategy game. It consists of a hard plastic carrying case which is, when opened, the football field. Each player has a team of 11 players, including the keeper, just as in the real game. The rules are an abstract version of the real rules, and in order to execute the actions, dice are used for details.&#10;&#10;The game is published by a company from Kazachstan (Mind Game inc.) and several other Kazachstan companies have aided with this production. Besides a rulebook in a lot of languages also a CD-Rom with the game rules is included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two teams attempt to reach the end of the board by acting out. When a team lands on a space, the actor on that team (it changes every turn) must act out what's on the card in 30 seconds or less. The catch is, they *must* use sound - the rules include a provision where if the other team catches them not using sound, they lose credit for a right answer. Only sound effects - no speaking - are allowed however.&#10;&#10;The board spaces are as follows: Action Reaction, which is a long form charade such as &quot;passing gas and blaming it on the dog.&quot; Famous Expressions is usually a cliche or popular phrase. People, Places &amp; Things is self explanatory.&#10;&#10;The fourth category is &quot;Hot Spot.&quot; Five items are on this card, and the team gets 60 seconds. If the actor can convey three out of the five, they get credit and continue to roll and move. Getting all five earns a &quot;Safe &amp; Sound&quot; card. This can also be earned via its own space on the board. Safe &amp; Sound allows an actor to pass a charade - but only once on a given turn, regardless of the amount of S&amp;S cards they have.&#10;&#10;Some spaces are designated all play by an arrow. The finish space of the game is an All-Play Hot Spot. Whichever team gets the majority of the five items in 60 seconds gets credit - and if you're on the team on the final Hot Spot space, that means you're the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The first player places one large object on Milton &amp; their turn ends.  The next person to play places the relevant accessory object and then also another large object on Milton &amp; their turn ends.  Play continues in this manner until Milton topples out of his hammock; the player who causes this event to occur is eliminated from the game.   All objects are removed from Milton, who is replaced in his hammock &amp; play commences again until only one player, the winner, remains.&#10;&#10;",

On the eve of the first Opium War, the players sail their junks through the China Sea and buy silk, spices, porcelain or tea from the various harbors. These wares are sold for a heavy profit in the canton where the English freighters are. But the freighters also bring a trading good with them, one out of India that is worth much gold in the harbors along the sea: Opium! The only catch &ndash; dealing in Opium is punishable by death. Each player can choose in this game: a long life, or get rich quick. After war breaks out, the needs of the dealers change on a daily basis, forcing flexibility: A harbor that might have been shut yesterday is now open again, where Opium trafficking might be punished heavily today, tomorrow the English might allow it again. The historic events of the time are also included and have an affect on the way the game goes. And yet, there&rsquo;s still enough variety in the game to make it play out differently each time and allow the players to influence the game in many ways!&#10;&#10;",

A technology deck describes the various technological advances players can get.  Older races begin with more tech, younger races can acquire more.&#10;&#10;The beginning of the game is primarily exploration and colonization using the star-fleet, dealing with random anomalies in space such as black holes, or space-pirates.  Once players make 1st contact, then military force and star fleets, and the political deck, come into play.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most colonies on the board when the last planet in the galaxy is colonized.  Planets are also drawn from a random deck, each with different difficulty ratings, mineral wealth and population maxima.&#10;&#10;Splittin Infinitives is suitable for an afternoon's or evening's gaming.  The various decks give variety, and keep it light-hearted, while the base allows for strategic serious play.  The rules are simple enough to fit on one page, and it can be played right out of the box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Long Winding Road provides the chance to run a full season's Marathon Championship with the 141 men and 78 women each running 6 races during the year. You can choose from over 40 courses together with their Weather Modifiers. A Championship season of 12 races for men and 10 for women is suggested, so with each race taking about 2 1/2 hours playing time such a season would take around 60 hours to complete - well within the realms of possibility for many replay gamers if feedback from you is anything to go by.&#10;&#10;The aim has been to try to recreate the way in which actual Marathon events develop, with small groups of runners breaking away off the front of the main pack, and others losing ground off the back.&#10;&#10;We recommend 40 to 70 starters, although the system can cope with larger numbers if necessary, and we deal with the race in 1 kilometer stages, so it would not be sensible or enjoyable to require a dice roll for every competitor each kilometer. With a field of 70 that would entail around 3000 dice rolls!&#10;&#10;So we only concern ourselves with identifying those runners within each Group (in game terms a Group consists of any number of runners from one upwards occupying a single 10-second space of our Endless Track) who need their Rating checked for that particular kilometer of the race to see whether they stay with their present Group, or make a forward or backward movement - that is gain or lose around 10 seconds on their Group over this kilometer.&#10;&#10;National, European, Commonwealth, and Asian Championships can be run within the context of the main season's Championship, plus a Team Championship on a race-by-race or full season basis.&#10;&#10;",
