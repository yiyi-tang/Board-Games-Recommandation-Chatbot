Whilst overcoming challenging route sections, players need to deal with unforeseen events, manage their energy level and gear placement to avoid hitting the ground in case of a likely fall. If you top out first, you win. If you hit the ground when you fall you lose.&#10;&#10;First each player decides how much energy they will have and how much gear they want to take on the climb: you can be more risky and have more energy to allow you to climb longer stretches, but the falls also become longer and more serious, whereas having more gear allows for steady progress but you will need more breaks to recover some energy.&#10;&#10;Then players take turns deciding how to move along the route, spending energy as they go. For example, it costs no energy to climb across a ledge, but it will take a lot to surmount an overhang or a roof section. Once all energy is spent the player takes a fall. Thus one needs to place gear for protection to prevent falling to the ground (different coloured gear fit only into places with suitable colour, unless it is a bomber placement). When a player places gear, a Place card is taken and the corresponding event is resolved. Every time a player enters a new route tile a Move card is taken and a corresponding event is resolved, which may result in a fall or may replenish some of the player's energy reserves.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Recently Brett Simpson pointed me at a simple set of rules for the English Civil War called Rupert's Very Bad Day: Battle of Marston Moor (1644 AD): Fast Play Rules for Students by Matt Fritz.  Rupert's Very Bad Day relies on lots of bases and base removal so isn't very friendly with my big bases and Thirty Years War units with both pike and shot on the same base.  But I liked the simplicity, saw considerable potential, and really liked the name. So I immediately began writing a version that would suit my pike and shot for the Thirty Years War which are based on big bases (80mm x 40mm). My initial draft started very close to Matt Fritz's work, and I remain heavily indebted to him, howeverthe rules have evolved quite far from the original. The biggest similarity to the original rules is probably the name although even there &quot;Rupert&quot; became &quot;Tilly&quot;.  I have introduced more types of stand (light horse, pike+shot, rabble), single stand units (hence pike+shot), a new concept called &quot;resolve&quot; to replace stand removal, morale rules based on resolve, terrain including the option to allow infantry to &quot;defend the hill&quot;, distances based on base width, a more complex interplay of shooting and charging to reflect different national and unit attitudes to these combat options, increase purpose for commanders, optional troop quality (superior, ordinary, inferior, rabble) and hence an optional point system, and probably other things. Despite these additions, and the complexity they bring, I think the rules still allow &quot;fast play&quot;. Although I've got the Thirty Years War in mind &quot;Tilly's Very Bad Day&quot; should be applicable to the Eighty Years War and English Civil War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are galactic colonists who have crash landed on your destined planet. You must work together to survive, rebuild and defend against the aggressive aliens hellbent on your demise.&#10;&#10;Thrive is a 1-6 player cooperative game that is a 1 to 2 hour immersive experience. Each player takes on the roll of a crew member venturing out to the planet to complete tactical missions, and rebuild the colony. You will feel the tension as you race against time to keep your colony safe and provide your crew food and resources&#10;&#10;The game is broken into various Seasons. Each Season is comprised of a Mission Phase and a Colony Phase&#10;&#10;Thrive really feels like a race against time. Threats increase as moral erodes. Food runs low as the number of alien activity increases. You really feel like you're working to protect and build up your fledgling colony, on the verge of a breakthrough or total defeat.&#10;&#10;During Mission Phases players choose a mission together. Every mission will provide different opportunities to gather resources and complete objectives to score victory points. Victory points represent your ability to eliminate the aliens, and secure your territory. They can also represent your ability to study and understand them enabling you to live alongside them or even communicate with them!&#10;&#10;The goal of winning the game is to earn 15 victory points. Simple. But, in order to do this you must survive the threats and perils of this new world, while maintaining the healthy morale of the crew.&#10;&#10;Morale is one of the three tracks that affect gameplay. The game will be lost, if morale drops to zero.&#10;&#10;The second track is the Threat track. As Threat goes up, more morale is lost every Season. Players can improve these two tracks.&#10;&#10;The final track is the spawn track. The Spawn track increases every Season. It shows players how many aliens spawn from spawning points during the battle for each Mission Phase.&#10;&#10;After each Mission Phase, crew members must return to the colony to complete the Colony Phase. A random event card is drawn that either adds more challenge, or provides a small benefit. Each player then places their crew tokens onto one of the 7 colony stations to perform its action.&#10;&#10;All 7 stations can be accessed by any two crew members, or by one of the four specialists linked to that location, either a Commander, an Engineer, an Agritect or a Medic. The Perimeter lowers Threat level. The Training Grounds improves morale. The Med Bay creates medicine and regains lost health. Stasis Pods awake new crew members that can help in the colony next Season. The Bio-Dome is used to grow food. The Command Center earns valuable victory points. The Workshop is used to make new weapons and equipment. Every station can be improved to be more efficient.&#10;&#10;Thrive has a fast-pace single die combat and skill system. It just takes one roll to determine if a hit is successful and how much damage is done. Damage and success are inversely represented on the dice, giving great balance to every roll.&#10;&#10;Aliens are controlled by a clever and easy to use AI algorithm. The AI is predictable, but adapts automatically to the combined tactical choices of the players, creating a challenging puzzle of movement.&#10;&#10;All player actions in are taken simultaneously, allowing for minimal downtime between turns.&#10;&#10;Characters are all unique and balanced with 3 basic attributes, 3 pools of trait cubes used for actions, focusing and health. An expansive selection of skill tokens also improve each character after each of the first 3 missions.&#10;&#10;The variable event deck, the randomly selected skill tokens, and the randomly drawn missions ensure that no two games will ever be the same.&#10;&#10;The spawn track is a natural gameplay timer. It increases difficulty and provides thematic tension, making every game fun, fresh and exciting.&#10;&#10;The most satisfying element you will find in Thrive is the interconnected puzzles between every Mission Phase and Colony Phase. They are challenging and rewarding. It is a great balance between tactics and strategy. Every choice is meaningful to the team&rsquo;s end results&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An asymmetric, dynamic, strategic and combat game themed in a sci-fi and horror world where different realities, technologies and dimensions gather fantasy beings into a unique and deadly 3D scenario.&#10;&#10;FGF (False Gods' Fall) is turn based game (first a Hero then a God, then a Hero, then a God and so on) where you can play as one of the Heroes.   At the beginning of the game you will get a random objective, to achieve it,you will be able to equip your self with weapons, armors and other interesting tools that will help you reach your goal.   Your character is also able to evolve into whatever you chose from a set of new abilities and improvements to your actual skills, for example, you can make grow another limb to your body or wings to fly.   Once you get your goal, a portal will open for you to escape and win the game.&#10;&#10;You can also chose to play as the GODS and the goal will be to eliminate the Heroes and stop them to escape through a portal.   As the Gods, you do not need trivial items to be better, instead, as the rounds pass by, you will be able to summon random Gods that will arrive with a random Aberration, powerful minions under your control that if are compatible with your God, special skills will be unlocked (for the God and the Aberration) creating new and more interesting strategies to fight against the Heroes.   You win the game if you kill heroes or if you are able to evolve up to the maximum power (11 rounds) before any Hero can escape through a portal.   If nobody chooses to play as the Gods, the cards of the Gods have their own A.I. with a set of simple instructions that players will have to execute during each Gods turn to give them autonomy.&#10;&#10;All these happens in a unique and innovative 3D tile system which round by round will be dynamically changing by rotating tiles, adding or removing barriers that blocks the access to adjacent tiles, increase terrain highness and, change of weather!&#10;&#10;A fantastic feature from FGF's Dynamic 3D Tile System is that you can use it for other existing combat board games and RPGs and add them its unique features and benefits (rotation, dynamic, block access, space elevations, art customization), that way you will refresh and boost their game experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionKeil is a Go-like territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of triangles. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.&#10;&#10;Apart from the board, Keil differs from Go in the idea of linking points, which preserves crosscuts and ko by reducing the natural connectivity of the triangular grid.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTwo adjacent points, and any stones on them, are linked if there is another point adjacent to both that is the same type as at least one of them. Two points are the same type if they are either both empty or both occupied by stones of the same color.&#10;&#10;A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked stones of that color.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty point linked to at least one stone in that group.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a territory is an empty point along with all other empty points one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked empty points. You own a territory if all stones linked to points in that territory are of your color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must pass or place a stone of your color on an empty point. After a placement, remove all enemy stones in groups without liberties. After all removals, the stone you placed must be part of a group with at least one liberty, and the current board position must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns. Otherwise, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. A player's score is the number of stones of their color on the board, plus the number of points in their territories, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your gloves are on, seconds are out, the bell has rung, the crowd is screaming. Engage your rival, make your best moves, and hit first. Now you are on your own.0&#10;&#10;Into the Box is a simulation of a boxing fight for 2 players, focused on the strategy involved. Your goal is to have more points than your rival after 9 or 12 rounds or, alternatively, knock him out before he does it to you.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards representing their boxer's skills, including punches, guards, and special moves. Players take turns to play their cards from a limited hand. In general, punching does damage, and guarding prevents that damage. Boxers may kiss the canvas as a result of a strong unguarded punch and may be knocked out after sustaining too much damage. You will have to manage your hand wisely, knowing when to attack and when to defend and try to take your adversary by surprise.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every round, each boxer is granted 10 points from ring judges and must subtract one point for each time they kiss the canvas. At the end of the round, the most damaged boxer must subtract one additional point from his/her score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You may choose two out of six abilities at the start: lightning, heat, emotion, fate, space, spirit. If you can use your powers to damage the target, they die when they run out of life points.&#10;&#10;To use the Resonance Ring, you must detect the opponent's two abilities and destroy them with a single blow, by releasing the matched wave from the ring.&#10;&#10;Do you want to use your abilities actively or conceal your abilities by bluffing and deflection, and aim for a blow with the ring? You make the decision.&#10;&#10;With three or four players, your target is the player to your left.&#10;&#10;With only three actions, attack, pass, or use the ring, players must choose different strategies. Players that are aggressive and attacking, risk being destroyed with a single blow from a ring. This keeps the game uncertain and tense.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Way of the Warrior (WoTW) is a solo system to simulate small tactical war operations during World War II; you will be in charge of an infantry squad during a series of missions: you can play a single mission or a campaign game where you'll be able to improve the skills of your soldiers (while facing the inevitable losses).&#10;&#10;This completely redesigned edition of WotW provides you two options to play the game:&#10;&#10;     Portable game: just print a few paper sheets and take your pencil and one die; no components to prepare and a very limited space required on your table.&#10;     Table Top game: play the game using counters (230+), cards (100+) and a playmat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Both options share the same common set of rules and provide the same content, but on a different format; you can of course mix the two options, for example using the Table Top version at home and continuing your camapign with the Portable version while traveling.&#10;&#10;The game covers the European Theatre of Operations, allowing you to lead the forces of one of seven possible armies: Commonwealth, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, USA or USSR.&#10;&#10;The terrain for each mission is generated on the basis of the selected theatre of operation, including:&#10; &#10;     Central and Eastern Europe (general)&#10;     Winter War (Finland, Russia)&#10;     Normandy&#10;     Beach head&#10;&#10;&#10;Additional rules for Airdrop missions are also available: with 25 different objectives, WoTW provides a great choice of tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Louis XV reigns in France, and it's the height of fashion to attend his lavish balls where important luminaries dress up in extravagant gowns and fancy frock coats, all eager to surpass one another in elegance and grace. In just a few weeks, Louis XV is hosting the final Grand Ball of the season, and everyone is clamoring for you to provide them with an elegant frock coat here, a sumptuous gown there, or even a small sum to fund the great fireworks display. You quickly realize that it's not just about your tailoring business anymore; it's about creating a presence at the most prestigious ball of the era and the chance to gain everlasting fame and prestige.&#10;&#10;In Rococo: Deluxe Edition, you are the owner of a distinguished tailoring business endeavoring to increase your prestige. Each turn, you play an employee card that allows you to perform a task, such as hiring a new employee for your staff, tailoring exquisite gowns and frock coats to rent or sell, or funding some of the many decorations. However, employees are not always able to perform all tasks, so you must plan carefully how you direct them, especially as each employee grants a unique bonus &mdash; including some that generate prestige.&#10;&#10;The Grand Ball ends after seven rounds with a huge fireworks display and final scoring. You will gain prestige points for the sumptuous gowns and frock coats you have rented out to guests at the ball, certain employee bonuses, and the festive decorations you have funded. Whoever has collected the most prestige at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Rococo: Deluxe Edition contains the previously released Jewelry Box expansion, the Festivity Dresses expansion, and the Fancy Dresses promo, as well as a new &quot;Madame du Barry&quot; solo mode expansion. This version of Rococo features changes from the previous edition of the base game, along with premium components including custom poly-resin lace and thread tokens; gold foil heat-stamped, wooden player markers; velveteen cloth bags for garments, silk and jewelry tokens; and upgraded punch boards for the garments, silk, and coins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All players follow the path of the rabbit and try to determine which location it is hiding in. Rabbits always turn when they have the chance, and if the stripe shows two rabbit holes, they change from one to the other. When a player thinks they know where the rabbit is, they grab the corresponding location tile first. If successful, they get to keep one of the stripes which is then replaced by another. Tiles that have been used are returned face down, so a memory aspect is added. When all stripes have been dealt out, the player with most stripes wins.&#10;&#10;",

A lot of videos taken by the protestors showcased the unnecessary violence exerted by the police force, the events keep going for more than half a year till the time of written.&#10;We hoped to let the players experience what ridiculous events had happened in Hong Kong during this time in the form of a tabletop RPG board game.&#10;&#10;This is a miniatures RPG game mixed with deck building elements.&#10;&#10;Players construct their own action decks which consist of different attack moves, defensive moves and other special moves. They can also acquire new moves through the missions. They are free to take out cards and add cards to their decks for the next missions. Remember, a bigger deck size also means it is harder to draw some wanted cards. Players must consider and make effective decks instead of adding all the cards they get.&#10;&#10;The game is turn-based. Every player performs different actions like these:&#10;&#10;Move &ndash; move the player on the map based on its speed, sometimes they can have special moves with some special action cards.&#10;&#10;Attack &ndash; Players can play cards from their hands to perform different attacks, they have different attribute requirements and the players often have to roll a set of dice to determine the attack strength.&#10;&#10;When an action card is used once, it is discarded. When the player runs out of action cards, he needs to find a safe place to rest to replenish the deck! But they come back automatically once the current mission is over.&#10;&#10;Search &ndash; Players can search the objects on the map and will trigger sudden events, often they have to choose between two options, but sometimes they don't have a choice, it is instead determined by some current conditions.&#10;&#10;Specials &ndash; There are many special moves, like healing wounds, dealing with tear gas, take videos, etc.&#10;&#10;Save Others &ndash; In some missions there are NPC protectors spawning on the map, the players can save them by moving to them and clear the enemies nearby.&#10;&#10;As this is a coop game, the enemy&rsquo;s turn would be played according to the AI deck.&#10;&#10;Remember, do not advance to the very front line always as this is a very hard game.&#10;&#10;There are different objectives in different missions, like saving protesters, surviving for some turns, protect the Lennon walls, setting road blocks, collecting police violence evidence, expose to the mass through the six months.&#10;&#10;Those are just what would happen in one mission, between the missions the players can use the experience earned to upgrade their attributes, get more action moves and construct their own action decks, etc. And remember the final goal is to survive through the missions till November, and increase the mass supports (an in-game value) by that time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer'&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A combination of the gambling game of Texas-Hold'Em poker and the word making game of Scrabble.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;The spoker&trade; pack of cards (98 letter cards + 2 'Joker' cards - blanks)&#10;The spoker&trade; playing mat for up to 6 players&#10;The 300 branded hexagonal spoker&trade; chips (made from wood and in 5 denominations)&#10;The spoker&trade; carry case&#10;The spoker&trade; rule book and other games that can be played with the spoker&trade; pack&#10;&#10;The aim of a  game of spoker&trade; is simple. A player tries to put together the highest scoring word from the eight letter cards available to them (unlike Texas Holdem Poker which makes the best 5 card hand from 7 cards available). The word is made from the 3 letters that were privately dealt to each player (hole cards) and the 5 turned over on the spoker&trade; playing mat (the 3 'flop' cards, the 'turn' card and the 'river' card -community cards as in Texas Holdem Poker). Players can use the hexagonal note pads provided to write down and juggle the letters around to help make up words. Players bet in a series of rounds, exactly as in Texas Holdem Poker (with small and big blinds). The winner of the 'Pot' is the player who reveals the highest scoring word at the end of the 4 rounds of betting, or the last player left in the game, as all other players have folded their cards.&#10;&#10;spoker&trade; therefore, places the intellectual and vocabulary expertise of word making, within the exciting arena of gambling and gives you the opportunity to make a profit from your combined skills. A word expert could beat a skilled gambler on many occasions, however a skilled gambler could very well beat a top word player too, due to their knowledge of gambling strategy and bluffs.  An expert in both these fields would find spoker&trade; an exciting and refreshing concept and an excellent opportunity to make a good profit through spoker&trade; gaming!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer, Jonathan Stone&#10;&#10;",

As mortals you are trying to reveal your 4 columns (8 cards) to appease the gods while avoiding curses and lock/keys.&#10;&#10;The game is simple, match the god character cards, top and bottom, in your columns to cancel out the points. If you match multiple adjacent columns with the same god you score a Midas Touch which gives you negative points. Finally, if you are the first one to reveal all cards in your columns you get negative bonus points. The player that gets the fewest points wins.  While that may seem simple, the gods are full of passion and your opponents are full of fury so be ready for curse cards that inflict pandemonium and lock/key cards that stop you from changing the cards in your columns.&#10;&#10;The core deck is designed for 2-5 players and the party expansion is designed for 6-10 players. Typical game-play time is 15 minutes per round. Ideal for friends and families that love strategy, laughter, spite, and glory. Appropriate for ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For this purpose, a camera lens hole was cut in the fuselage under the observer&rsquo;s position. The airplane was also fitted to carry 100kg/220lbs of light bombs on the wings, giving it a wide range of missions. Released in early 1917, its usefulness meant the airplane was still in the front&ndash;line use at the end of the war, both on the Western Front and the Middle East. About 1150 were built by war&rsquo;s end&#10;&#10;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand (4 different altitudes), and a specific deck of maneuver cards, and special cards depending of the model.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Will you have enough space for the goods on the return trip, or will you leave a worker behind to rest? In any case, time is of the essence as the ice melts and jeopardizes your sleds.&#10;&#10;Icy Dice requires six standard six-sided dice at minimum, but we recommend two sets of six standard six-sided dice, with each set in a different color. Components include one player sheet per player, and a shared sheet per game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But of course, it is not all hard work in Sylvania: the annual bonfire is coming up and it is a festival the entire village works towards.

They move around the map to attack the other players, the Merciless Horde of Yin, and the Humanoids of the Claw. This can provide fame and, when attacking other players' households, gold.&#10;&#10;Tyrants can also adventure into such places as the Vale of the Prophets and the Caves of the Necromancer, which may result in gaining magic items or other benefits, but may also have negative effects.&#10;&#10;Each turn a tyrant must also roll for a random event; there is a 1/6 chance nothing will happen but otherwise a player may be ambushed, raided, given gold, etc.&#10;&#10;One unusual rule is that a player is allowed to write a secret message to another player, but it may not be delivered properly; based on a die-roll the message may go astray and a different player may receive it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
