    "Description": "&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.&#10;&#10;Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.&#10;&#10;Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules:&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OverlookVoidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.&#10;&#10;This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NestsOn the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).&#10;&#10;Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VoidlurkersThey will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;WhispersersThey will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;StalkerHe is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DespoilerEquivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Contamination cardHere it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Whispers mechanicThis mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;CombatIn combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.&#10;&#10;Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Event phaseIn the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.&#10;&#10;But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Overall feelOverall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game features a negotiation system so that you can attempt to talk your way out of sticky situations using translator tech, rather than always relying on your fusion pistol sidearm, although it's nice to have a backup plan.&#10;&#10;The game includes more than thirty maps of derelict starships, ringworlds, and exoplanet surfaces, and while primarily a solitaire game, Where Humans Don't Belong also provides rules for a two-player co-operative experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shards of Alkemae may be played at three different levels, Novice, Apprentice, and Master. Game play remains essentially the same, but rules change from level to level.  Regardless of level, players take turns laying down tiles to form the game board and move their game pieces about the board, trying to lay claim to regions worth the most points.&#10; The tiles (based on Penrose tiles) are of two types, kites and darts, which fit together to form a quasi-symmetric  tessellation. A gold kite serves as the centerpiece and entryway for game pieces to move onto the playing area. Sixty kites and thirty-six darts are placed into separate bags, from which players draw blindly to begin their turns.  Represented on each tile face is one of the following elements: earth, air, fire, or water.  Additionally, there are twelve &ldquo;wild-card&rdquo; kites, which can serve as any of the four elements.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game by drawing a tile from each bag and setting them in front of the player, one face up, one face down.  On a turn, a player draws a tile from either bag and sets it down adjacent to the tiles already placed. A player may place the tile drawn, either tile in front of that player, or any &ldquo;face-up&rdquo; tile from another player. Judicious tile placement  usually  results in the formation of one of seven geometric patterns, called &ldquo;shards&rdquo;, which are named: ace, deuce, jack, queen, king, star, or sun. Any player completing one of these shards receives a token representing the shard formed. After placing a tile to form a shard, the player then advances one of four playing pieces (in the shapes of chemical glassware) onto the game board.&#10;&#10;As players place more tiles, the game board grows, and like-colored regions of each of the elements form.  Players accumulate shards which may be turned in for gold &ldquo;transmuting stones&rdquo;, which are then used by a player to lay claim to a region (any contiguous grouping of like-colored tiles). Players try to move their game pieces into regions and lay claim to one region of each element before the other players.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player claims one region of each element, or all the tiles have been placed on the board. Two key components of a winning strategy are prediction (determining  where wealthy regions will form) and risk/benefit analysis (choosing whether to claim smaller regions early or wait until they grow into more prosperous ones as the board grows).&#10;&#10;",

You will imperson one of the 8 different girls, each with 3 main characteristics (boobs/butt, one-piece swimsuit/two-piece swimsuit and hair colours(red, blonde, brown, black) + suntan(extra one)). The main objective is to &quot;catch&quot; the letches on the board using this characteristics (letch has his own preferences).&#10;&#10;But be wise, you can only play/discard one &quot;action&quot; card and charm only one letch using your &quot;charm&quot; ability  during your turn. Action cards make the difference, because they can make you charm more letches in a turn, interrupt other player's actions, make the letches charmed by others run away from them and come back to the beach (the neutral war zone) or simply steal them, enhance yourself, earn new characteristics and more.  As time passes more letches will come to the beach, so basically... The longer you play the greater your odds of winnning... Or losing. But don't worry, Catch The Letch has been built with the idea of having fun and playing many many games in a short amount of time, with each game lenght of 20 minutes max (8 players), down to 10 minutes (2 players)! We decided to make a game for as many people as possible, because we have a lot of fun when we play toghether with friends, but sometimes we do even like to relax and have a fast game with one or two of them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The monsters are really hungry and need someone to feed them.)&#10;&#10;In Monster Farm there are 5 phases to the game&#10;&#10;Phase 1&#10;In phase one, everyone gets 5 five Monster Cards, then you pick one and pass the others. Each Monster Card has the fruit required to feed it listed below. Overall, the more points a monster is worth the harder it will be to feed it. You keep doing this until you have drafted your farm. In this stage, you might be trying to draft easy monsters to speed up the game and get a blitz win.  Or maybe you go with a few big, harder monsters hoping that if you feed just a few big guys, you can pull it off.   Or maybe you do a balanced draft. It is all up to you and the monsters you draft will affect the way you play the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Draft 5 monsters for your farm!&#10;&#10;Phase 2&#10;In phase two, a Seasonal Event happens; this will cause all farmers to adjust their strategy. It could be gaining a monster, losing a monster, or maybe gaining some random fruit and more. Things will change and affect your strategy. However, this is an environmental change and it affects everyone. It is not just one player becoming lucky or unlucky.&#10;&#10;Phase 3&#10;In phase three, there is an Open Market bid.   You are bidding on a bundle of three fruits. Each player bids on the market starting with the first player for that round.  Each player must bid higher or pass.  If you pass you are out of the bidding round. This becomes quite tricky. Maybe you really need only one fruit or you may need all the fruit.  How much should you bid?  It could also be that you don&rsquo;t need the fruit but you buy it so that you can prevent someone else who does need it from buying it.  Do you bid it up and hope you don&rsquo;t get left with it? A lot can happen here. There are various fruits, some will help you feed you monsters others will give you a permanent income bonus.  At the bottom right of each card, you can see how many of those there are in the deck.&#10;&#10;Also once per game, you can play a Monster Thief to steal the bid! It is like a tactical nuke. You only get to use it once during the game so play it wisely.&#10;&#10;Phase 4&#10;In phase four, you are buying fruit on the Black Market.   The fruit is random and you can even get a rotten fruit which is completely useless. Since it is the Black Market, there is no quality control.  Remember the Monster Gems you spend here means that you will have less when you go to bid on the Open Market.&#10;&#10;Phase 5&#10;In phase five, you collect your base income of 3.  If you have purchased Fruit Stands or Monster Cafes from the Open Market or Black Market, your income is increased.   For each Fruit Stand, you will receive an additional 1 Monster Gem added to your income.   For each Monster Cafe, you will receive an additional 2 gems during this phase.   You keep these cards until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;Repeat phases 2 thru 5 until someone has fed all of their monsters. The first person to feed all their monsters receives a Monster Egg for an additional five points.  All other players finish playing the rest of that round.   Then each player adds up the points on their fed monsters and the one with most points wins and is now the &ldquo;Master Monster Farmer!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In Monster Farm, you get an amazing 2 to 6 player game that the whole family can play in about 30 minutes. I have been playing board games for quite some time but often much of my games go unplayed because they just don&rsquo;t fit the number of players, or they take too long, or they just don&rsquo;t fit the ages/abilities of the players. I wanted to make sure that the game would be fun for both adults and kids. I wanted it simple but yet have a good depth of strategy.   Also, I wanted a game where you don&rsquo;t just play for 5 minutes then wait 15 minutes until it is your turn again.   This game passes the Smore Games QualityTest, which is, after people play the game once, they want to play it &ldquo;Smore!&rdquo;   I want to thank all my playtesters and the feedback they have given.  This is an OUTSTANDING GAME!  Have fun!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "POLITRACES is a board game that give you the opportunity to feel like a participant in a real Political Races and prove to others that you deserve to get the Power and become the President!&#10;&#10;STANDARD RULES OF THE POLITRACES GAME&#10;business board game for 3-8 players, age 8+&#10;&#10;The Goals of the Game&#10;&#10;1. Become President - 1st place. It is necessary to pay a fee for participation in the Elections, go to the Small Circle and win the Elections by collecting the most Votes.&#10;2. Become Prime Minister (or Secretary of State) - 2nd place. The President decides who will take this position.&#10;3. Become Oligarch (1) - 3rd place. It is necessary to buy the Institution Oil Derrick. Oligarch has the right to give or exchange their Votes (but not to sell to the Treasury), however they can`t go to the Small Circle and become the President. If the President gives the Oligarch the 2nd place, then they share the 1st place.&#10;-1) Possible if more than 4 players are playing (see the Institution Oil Derrick).&#10;&#10;     The remaining players take their places according to the number of collected Votes. &#10;     It is useful for players to choose the strategy, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;- collect resources and Votes to pay the Elections fee and try to become the President;&#10;- collect resources to transfer them to your Candidate for Presidency and increase their chances of winning;&#10;- collect resources to buy an Oil Derrick (if available) and become an Oligarch.&#10;&#10;     Execution of agreements depends on the wishes of the players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#208;&#161;oncept of the Game&#10;&#10;All people who strive for power are conventionally divided into four categories that have different, but equal resources, forming the Political Quadrant&copy;:&#10;- Businesspersons (entrepreneurs) - have money or other resources which can be quickly sold;&#10;- Activists (popular people) - know how to gather, motivate and encourage other people to act;&#10;- Public Officials (civil servants) - have connections and authority;&#10;- Experts (smart people) - have special knowledge and status.&#10;To get the Power (win the Game) players need to collect all the specified resources and get voters Votes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;1. Game preparation&#10;&#10;The players, who sit in a circle (1), lay the Playing Field (2) (game board) in the center.&#10;The Chance and Debate cards are shuffled and laid out face down on the specially marked places.&#10;Players choose who of them will be the Treasurer, i.e. responsible for the Treasury (3) (game bank), which is placed at the bottom of the Game Box, which contains cards, chips and others).&#10;-1) Participants play clockwise in the order they originally sit down to play (until the end of the Game).&#10;2) The Playing Field consists of 4 sectors and 2 circles which divided into cells.&#10;Sectors. The Game has 4 color sectors, which correspond to certain resources in the form of chips: Businessperson (green color, Money resource), Activist (purple color, People resource), Public Official (red color, Connections resource), Expert (blue color, Knowledge resource). Each sector consists of seven cells. In each of the sectors there is a START cell with which the Game begins. Having passed the sector cells, the player goes (down) to the Big Circle and plays there (the exception - Go to Another Sector cell). Players may get back to the sectors thanks to the Crisis cells or some of the Chance cards.&#10;The Big Circle is Political Races. It consists of 24 cells. There are also 2 freestanding cells: Jail and Resort.&#10;The Small Circle is Elections. Located in the center of the Playing Field and consists of 6 cells. &#10;3) In the Treasury any 2 resources (same or different) may be exchanged for any other 1 resource or a Vote, but the Votes cannot be sold to the Treasury (except for special game situations). Exchange in the Treasury can be made only at the time of the player`s turn. The Treasury does not give loans, advances, does not accept Real Estate as collateral, etc. Stealing from the Treasury is prohibited.&#10;&#10;2. Starting the Game, the first move, next moves&#10;&#10;At this stage, players will move between sectors and the Big Circle. To determine who will make the first move each player will throw the Dice one time. The Player, who has the highest number (1) on the Dice, becomes the First Player, selects a pawn (game chip) and puts it on the START of any sector of their choice (2). The remaining players take turns, going around the board clockwise from the First Player by selecting their pawns and putting them on the following START (3) cells.&#10;The Treasurer distributes to each player 5 chips of their basic resources and 2 chips of each remaining resource (4).&#10;For each turn started in a Big or Small Circle, players will receive 1 of their basic resource (5) until the end of the Game from the Treasury (passive income), even when the Elections are announced (except for a situation when a player stays on the Jail cell).&#10;The First Player rolls the playing Dice (with 6 faces) once and moves forward the number of cells indicated on the Dice clockwise.&#10;Once on some cell, the player is obliged to perform the action that is indicated there (only once, when they gets on the cell).&#10;When the Dice is pictured - this means that the player need to roll the Dice to determine what event will occur (the special conditions for the Institution Police). &#10;When some resource or Vote chip is pictured - this means the corresponding resource or Vote chip.&#10;Also, before the end of their move, players have the right to interact with other players and do operations (6).&#10;When the player has completed all the actions, they announces the end of their move (themself).&#10;All next players, clockwise, do the same actions as the First Player.&#10;It is important to be attentive and keep an eye on other players. If someone did something forbidden during the Game (for example, made a move when it should be skipped) or forgot to do something (for example, to get their basic resource), but the player&rsquo;s move is already over, then the Game continues without correcting the situation (except for situations such as moving someone else&rsquo;s pawn).&#10;Players are not allowed to combine their resources and/or Votes.&#10;What is not prohibited is allowed in the Game. This means that players may freely interpret game situations (rules) and make non-standard decisions.&#10;Players can speed up the Game by reducing the Election participation fee, announcing early Elections (counting Votes), limit the time of the players moves using the hourglass or making more Debates (see Debates in the Description of the Game Cells).&#10;- &#10;1) If several players have the same highest number (for example, 6:6), these players will roll the Dice again.&#10;2) There are 4 START cells in the Game in four equivalent sectors, where you may start the Game. This determines the basic resources and right to immunity of the players: Businessperson (green color, Money resource, immunity from the Business Center and Hotel), Activist (purple color, People resource, immunity from the Union of Activists and Society for the Ecology Protection), Public Official (red color, Communications resource, immunity from the Police and Tax Inspection), Expert (blue color, Knowledge resource, immunity from the Institute of Expertise and Academy).&#10;3) If there are more than 4 players, the placement of pawns continues in the second round. That is, the fifth player puts their pawn on the same START cell, on which the First Player pawn stands. And so on.&#10;4) Resources (i.e. game currency). After placing the players pawns, each player receives from the Treasury 5 resources of the sector in which they started the Game (the basic resource), as well as 2 resources from the other sectors.&#10;For example, a player on the START of the Businessperson sector (green color) will receive 5 chips of Money, 2 of People, 2 chips of Connections and 2 chips of Knowledge.&#10;5) If during the Game some player gets into another sector, they still continues to receive their basic resource, which they initially received.&#10;For example, the player started the Game in the Businessperson sector and its basic resource is Money, and then they got into the Public Official sector, but they still remains a Businessperson until the end of the Game and receives one Money as basic resource. &#10;6) Operations. Players can perform any operations that do not violate the Rules of the Game (contacting other players, exchanging or selling their resources and Real Estate, using Chance cards, etc.), but only during their turn. If some player misses a move, they cannot perform operations (exception - the Resort cell).&#10;Resources and Real Estate (except the Oil Derrick) can be freely disposed of (exchanged or sold), while Votes are not (exceptions - see the Oligarch description and the Political Party cell).&#10;Presents. During their turn, players may make or accept gifts: resources, Real Estate, Chance cards.&#10;Out of resources. If the player does not have resources (or Votes) for payment (to another player or to the Treasury) - they must purchase necessary ones (in the Treasury or from other players). If resources are still insufficient, the player must sell their Real Estate (if available). If the player does not have resources or Real Estate for payment, they may either pay 1 Vote to the Treasury (even if they has to pay another player), or go to the Jail for 1 move (except for the Candidate for Presidency).&#10;&#10;3. The Small Circle, Election of the President, the end of the Game&#10;&#10;To get to the Small Circle, it is necessary to pay a participation fee to the Treasury - 10 of each resources (1) and it is also necessary to have 10 Votes (which remain in the player&rsquo;s hands).&#10;The player can go to the Small Circle only at the beginning of their turn (before the Dice is thrown), but the player is allowed to conduct any operations before this (for example, sell Real Estate or exchange resources with other players).&#10;The player who has moved to the Small Circle (the Oligarch cannot) puts the Game pawn on The Beginning of the Campaign cell and becomes Candidate for Presidency (has immunity and cannot get to Jail when there is nothing to pay).&#10;After one Candidate for Presidency has collected 50 Votes, they announces the Election of the President (2), after which the players finish this Game round (counting from the First Player) and play the Final Round (3).&#10;Elections. After the Final Round was payed, each player may take 1 Vote from the Treasury and give it to their Candidate for Presidency (you could Vote for yourself), after what the Votes are counted and the winner (just 1 person(4)) is announced as President (1st place). &#10;The President decides who gets the 2nd place. &#10;If there is the Oligarch in the Game, they takes the 3rd place (or if the President appoint the Oligarch 2nd place, then the Oligarch shares the 1st place with the President).&#10;The remaining players are ranked according to the number of Votes in their hands.&#10;-1) That is, the fee for the participation in the Election of the President is 40 resources, namely 10 Money resources, 10 People resources, 10 Connections resources and 10 Knowledge resources.&#10;2) Only Candidates for Presidency (that is, players who at the time of the announcement of the Election were in the Small Circle) may compete for the post of the President.&#10;After the announcement of the Election of the President, none of the players may go to the Small Circle and become a Candidate for Presidency.&#10;3) For example, if 4 people play and the 3rd (in a row from the First Player) player announces Election of the President, the 4th player goes after him/her, and the final round is played, that is, all players, starting with the First Player, make 1 more move (the last one). &#10;4) If, after counting the Votes, it turns out that several Candidates for Presidency gained the same number of Votes, more than others, another Game round is held (until one winner is determined).&#10;&#10;Description of the Game Cells&#10;&#10;1. START. The Game begins with this cell. There are 4 START cells, which are located in the 4 different Game sectors. During the Game, players will get to START cells of different sectors. Every time some player gets to the START cell, they gets 2 resources of the sector in which this cell is located (indicated on the cell).&#10;2. Award. The second cells of all sectors. Here players only get resources pictured on the cell, the number of which determined by the Dice.&#10;3. Chance. If the player gets to the Chance cell, the player takes the top card from the Chance deck, which lies on the Playing Field (on the specially marked spot), reads what it is written on the card and follows the instructions.&#10;The possibility to transfer the card to another player is indicated on the card. &#10;If, after using the Chance card, the player moved to another cell, the relevant instructions are followed. However, if the player is returned to the cell where they stood (i.e., the last move was canceled), the cell instructions are not executed. &#10;If the card cannot be used, then the player draws the next card.&#10;4. Exhibition, Meeting, Round Table and Training. The fourth cells of all sectors where players should skip the next move and, at the same time, receive the resources pictured on the cell, the number of which determined by the Dice.&#10;5. Forum Brings Resources. The fifth cell of all sectors, where players receive resources from other sectors. First, the player rolls the Dice to determine resource from which sector they will receive (counted from the next sector clockwise) and then they rolls the Dice again to find out the number of the resources they will receive.&#10;For example, a player, being in the Activist sector, gets to the Forum Brings Resources cell. To find out which resource they will receive, the player rolls the Dice for the first time. Let&rsquo;s say, the number 3 on the Dice, what means the 3rd sector clockwise from the Activist, that is, the Businessperson sector. This means that the player will receive Money resources, the number of which is determined by the second roll of the Dice.&#10;6. Raiders Attack Your Business, Your Organization Splits, Attestation, and Exam. The sixth cells of all sectors.&#10;The player should throw the Dice:&#10;- if the number is 1, 2 or 3 on the Dice - the player goes to the START cell of the sector in which they is and, accordingly, receives two resources which are pictured on the cell;&#10;- if the number is 4, 5 or 6 on the Dice - the player remains on the cell which they stands on. &#10;7. Go to Another Sector. The seventh cells of all sectors. The player may throw the Dice to determine the sector in which they will go to the START cell and receive corresponding 2 resources (counted from the next sector clockwise). To stay in place, the player has to pay the Treasury 1 pictured resource.&#10;For example, the player gets the Go to another sector cell of the Businessperson sector, where is offered a choice:&#10;1) Pay 1 resource (which is pictured) to stay on this cell and move to the Big Circle from the next move;&#10;2) Roll the Dice to go to the START of one of the sectors and receive 2 pictured resources.&#10;Suppose that the player decides to roll the Dice and gets 2. This means that the player must go to START on the second sector clockwise, namely the Public Official sector.&#10;8. Real Estate Market. There are 10 Real Estate Market cells in the Game, where players may buy and sell Real Estate.&#10;There are 2 types of Real Estate - Institutions and Investments.&#10;In Standard rules we only use Institutions.&#10;The player, who purchased an Institution, gets profit from its use if some other player gets to them, also they gets 1 resource of the color of the Institution for each turn that the payer started as the owner of the Institution. &#10;Real Estate may be profitably sold if the corresponding Chance card is drawn out.&#10;Before the Game starts, all Real Estate is stored in the Treasury.&#10;The Game has eight pairs of standard Institutions cards (Business Center, Hotel, Union of Activists, Society for the Ecology Protection, Institute of Expertise, Academy, Police, Tax Inspection) and additional ones - Oil Derrick. &#10;Real Estate Cards symbolize the 4 gaming sectors, as evidenced by their value, content and color (except for Oil Derrick).&#10;The Treasurer divides the Institutions cards into two identical decks, one of which is mixed and will be offered to the players if they get into the Real Estate Market cell, and the second is stored in the Treasury.&#10;All Real Estate cards have a Market Price and a Crisis Price, shown on the cards. Players have the right to make any Real Estate deals between themselves  (sell, buy, exchange, etc.).&#10;When a player is on the Real Estate Market cell, they chooses one of the options (the player cannot change the decision):&#10;- buy for the Market Price (build on this cell) 1 from 3 randomly drawn cards of Institution (If the player buys the Institution, then one card of the Institution is kept by the player, and the second card, stored in the second deck in the Treasury, is put on the Playing Field on the Real Estate Market cell on which the player stands, after what the cell becomes the cell of this Institution);&#10;- to sell one of its Real Estate for the Market Price to the Treasury (if the player is in their Institution, they may sell it by Market Price as well).&#10;- refuse the deal.&#10;Any player may sell any of their Real Estate at any time at the Crisis Price during their move.&#10;The player may sell/exchange their Real Estate on the general terms before purchasing a new Real Estate.&#10;Any player has the right to purchase any Real Estate, if it is offered by the Treasurer (if the player can afford it).&#10;The right to purchase the Real Estate cannot be transferred to another player, but later it is allowed to perform any operations with it (see the Gameplay item).&#10;The cardholder has the right to fully or partially release a player who came to their Institution from any card effect (for example, when a player must pay to the Treasury, go to Jail or make a speech), under any conditions (to agree with each other).  &#10;Once in some Institutions, the player should make a speech (to speak), after which the remaining players (listeners) must vote if they like this speech (raise one hand up for like):&#10;- if no one likes, the speaker receive nothing;&#10;- if the minority like (less than half or half of the listeners), the speaker receives 1 of the resource pictured on the card, from the Treasury;&#10;- if the majority like (more than half of the listeners), the speaker receives 2 of the resources pictured on the card, from the Treasury.&#10;! Exceptions from the general rule&#10;The Institution Police - may send the player who get this Institution for maximum 3 turns (how to read the Dice indicated on the Cover of the Rules and on the Bottom of the Game Box).&#10;The Institution Oil Derrick - the most expensive Real Estate in the Game, which gives the player the status of Oligarch as well the 3rd place. If there are playing less than 5 players, then a pair of the cards Oil Derrick is excluded from the Game (there will be no Oligarch in the Game). The Oil Derrich may be sold just to the Treasury just for the Crisis Price.&#10;9. Crisis. If the player get on the Crisis cell, they has to go to the START cell of the corresponding color (close to this Crisis cell) or pay 1 resource to the Treasury, which is pictured on the Crisis cell in order to stay in place.&#10;10. Speech on the Channel. This cell gives the player the opportunity to choose: to get Votes for themselves or to get these Votes for another player. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.&#10;11. Debate. When a player gets to the Debate cell, they during 1 minute (use hourglass) draws cards (one by one, starting with the top) from the Debate deck (lies on the Playing Field), reads silently the term (word or phrase) and explains by any method this term to other players who have to guess it and say out loud.&#10;It is forbidden for the player (who explain the term) to say the term or any part of that it, or even speak the root word (even if other player already told it). Also, it is forbidden to show a card or point to an object denoting a term. The term must be guessed exactly as indicated on the card.&#10;Players will receive credit for guessing correctly when they say an exact translation of the term that is indicated on the card (for example, for the English word Tax other acceptable translations would be NALOG in Russian or PODATOK in Ukrainian). &#10;If the player guessed the term, but used word-for-word translation into another language (if the translation is not on the card), and this translation is accepted by most players as correct, it is believed that the player guessed correctly.&#10;If the term is guessed, the one who explained and the one who guessed will receive 1 Vote chip, and the used Debate card will be placed in a used discard pile.&#10;If several players correctly named the word at the same time, then (after the Debate), those players will each throw the Dice and a person with a highest number takes the Vote.&#10;After the term has been guessed, the player will draw another card and explain it as long as the hourglass still has time left.&#10;A player may continue explaining the last card (which he/she took before the minute expires) after the hourglass ends, on the other hand the player may throw the card into discard pile without a penalty.&#10;Fine. If the player violated the rules of explanation or could not explain the term and wants to go to the next card Debate - they must pay a fine of 1 Vote (other players don`t get Vote for this term). But it the time is up, then the player doesn&rsquo;t pay the fine and just finish the Debate. &#10;Because standard Debate cards has 6 words written and numbered in English, Russian, and Ukrainian, then the player throws the Dice  before the Debate starts to determine under what number they will explain the terms.&#10;For more Debates, players may increase the Debate time to 2 minutes and/or use 1 or 2 of the Real Estate Market cells as a Debate cell (to do this, put the card that symbolizes the Debate on the Real Estate Market cell).&#10;12. Hospital. Being on this cell, the player rolls the Dice:&#10;- if the number is from 1 to 3, the player is healthy (doesn`t pay);&#10;- if the number is from 4 to 6, the player must pay 2 of any resources at his/her discretion to the Treasury.&#10;13. Vacation and Resort. If the player gets to the Vacation cell, they places the pawn on the Resort cell near the center of the Playing Field. The number of moves that the player is to make to be on the Resort cell is determined by the Dice:&#10;- if the number is from 1 to 3 - the player remains on the Resort cell 1 move;&#10;- if the number is from 4 to 6 - the player remains on the Resort cell 2 moves.&#10;The exit from the Resort cell is made through the Vacation cell (the Vacation cell will be the first cell the player moves to; if number 1 is on the Dice and the player gets to the Vacation cell, the effect of the Vacation cell does not happen this time).&#10;If the player is on the Resort cell, they may get resources and perform Game operations, but not roll the Dice and move the pawn.&#10;14. Jail. The player may get to the Jail cell for 1-3 moves through the Police cell (see description of the Real Estate Market cell) or when they has nothing to pay (see the Out of Resources in the Gameplay item). If the player gets to the Jail cell, they puts their pawn on the Jail cell near the center of the Playing Field.&#10;The exit from the Jail cell is made through the Police cell, if some player has already built it (the cell Police will be the first cell of the player&rsquo;s move: if number 1 is on the Dice and the player stops on the Police cell, the effect of the Police cell does not come this time).&#10;If there is no Police cell, the player leaves the Jail through the closest clockwise Real Estate Market cell free of Institutions (if the number on the Dice is 1 and the player stopped on the Real Estate Market cell, the effect of the Real Estate Market cell does not come this time).&#10;15. Casino. On this cell, the player is to make a bet (only with resources) and roll the Dice, which defines the result:&#10;- if numbers 1 or 2 are on the Dice - the player loses their bet, which goes to the Treasury;&#10;- if numbers 3 or 4 are on the Dice - the player takes back their bet;&#10;- if numbers 5 or 6 is on the Dice - the player wins, and their bet doubles (the player takes the same resource as their bet from the Treasury).&#10;Players cannot take bets from other players as well share bets.&#10;16. Political Party. On this cell, a player may sell any number of Votes to the Treasury at the regular exchange rate (1 Vote = 2 of any resources at the player&rsquo;s choice). This is the only Game situation when players may sell Votes to the Treasury.&#10;17. The Beginning of the Campaign (as well the Debate cell). The player who gets to the Small Circle puts their pawn on this cell, which acts as a regular Debate cell (that is, after the switch to the Small Circle, the player immediately starts the Debate).&#10;18. Forced Auction. A player (Candidate for Presidency) who gets to this cell may force (order) any other player to sell one of their Real Estate for the Crisis Price (except for the Oil Derrick) to the person they points to (to another player, to themselves or to the Treasury). A player cannot be forced to buy Real Estate. The operation (transaction) occurs immediately, during this move.&#10;19. PR. On this cell, the player has the opportunity to get Votes for themself or remove (to the Treasury) another player&rsquo;s Votes. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.&#10;20. Litigation. On this cell, the player decides what action to take: to get 1 Vote for themself or lose 2 of their Votes, so that the opponent is deprived of 3 Votes.&#10;21. Protest Action. On this cell, the player has the opportunity to take away Votes from another (at their discretion) player. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.&#10;&#10;MAKE THE GAME HARDER&#10;&#10;1) Read the Dice as is pictured on the Cover of the Rules and on the Botton of the Game Box (every time when the Dice is pictured), specifically:&#10;- if the Dice indicates a 1 or a 2, it means 1 resource, 1 Vote or the player will move next (first) sector clockwise from the current position;&#10;- if the Dice indicates a 3 or a 4, it means 2 resources, 2 Votes or they will have to move second sector clockwise from the current position;&#10;- if the Dice indicates numbers 5 or 6, this means 3 resources or 3 Votes or they will need to move the third sector clockwise from the current position.&#10;For example: a player is and is in the Go To Another Sector cell in the Businessperson sector and they rolls the Dice. Suppose the number 3 or 4 shows on the Dice. This mean, that the player needs to move their pawn to the START in the second sector clockwise from their current position, which is the Public Official sector.&#10;&#10;2) Add-on: Real Estate Investments - cheap Real Estate in the Game, which may be purchased on the Real Estate Market cell at the same conditions as Institutions (the player has to choose which type of Real Estate they want to see for purchasing).&#10;Investments give 1 resource of their color per turn and kept in the players hands (i.e. they are not placed on the Game Field).&#10;If players use Investments, then the Institutions gives 2 resources per turn.&#10;&#10;3) Add-on: extra decks for Debate (for example Tough Debate deck - there are hard with explanation).&#10;If the player guesses the phrase, but changes the word order (for example, electoral system = system electoral), it is believed that the player guessed correctly.&#10;&#10;",

In this adventure, an expedition of explorers will arrive in balloon to the mythical eighth island of the Canary Islands to find a fabulous treasure. The terrain is dangerous and the objects that can be carried are few, so all the players have to work together to be able to advance, find the treasure and return to the balloon.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board made of 49 reversible tiles and 10 tiles that form the treasure map, so that each game will be completely different. In addition, 12 inventory items and two decks of cards will make this journey a true survival adventure. As if this were not enough, a volcano in the middle of the island threatens to cover it all with lava, so the search will have to be against the clock.&#10;&#10;In every round, players will make a movement (up to 3 tiles), reveal an event card and make an action (resolve the event with objects from the inventory, help another player, etc). The last phase of the round is to place a new lava tile.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Riot Quest chaos continues with the new Wintertime Wasteland starter box! After plundering and looting all they could find in the more civilized corners of the Iron Kingdoms, the heroes (and villains) of Riot Quest are headed to the strange, frozen north in search of more treasure.&#10;&#10;This starter is fully compatible with all previous Riot Quest releases and kicks off a brand new block of post-apocalyptic, winter-themed models and expansions for the game. Wintertime Wasteland introduces new Arena maps, new Bounty and Treasure decks, and loads of new beautifully sculpted Hero models.&#10;&#10;The Wintertime Wasteland also introduces exciting new game mechanics, like ultra-powerful Legendary Riot Gear and Tag-Team Heroes (that's two Heroes combining their efforts to work as single game piece in your Crew).&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re new to Riot Quest, Wintertime Wasteland is a perfect starting point to take the icy plunge into the loot-questing lifestyle. And if you&rsquo;re a veteran scavenger with a seasoned Crew, Wintertime Wasteland is ripe with new blood to add to your Bench.&#10;&#10;So, get your fightin&rsquo; pants on! It&rsquo;s time to gear up, wreck face, and get paid!&#10;&#10;In Riot Quest, players assemble a crew of 5&ndash;10 Heroes and an equal number of Riot Gear cards to compete with up to three other players in a chaotic battle to score treasure and rack up victory points in an Arena.&#10;&#10;Each round, players alternate taking turns by activating one of their Heroes to perform various actions, such as running around the Arena, attacking Enemies, or raiding Treasure Chests. A player has a limited pool of Action Dice to spend each round, with at least one die being spent for each action a Hero performs.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, Treasure Chests will randomly appear around the Arena, which a Hero can raid to gain valuable Loot. Loot is spent to purchase the Riot Gear a player selected at the beginning of the game. This Riot Gear upgrades that player&rsquo;s Heroes.&#10;&#10;Bounty cards represent the goals each player is attempting to achieve in order to score Victory Points and ultimately win the game. These Bounty cards might require a player&rsquo;s Hero to do a certain amount of damage to an Enemy during their turn, to interact with a specific token that was put into play by the Bounty card via a rig action, or any number of other possible goals. Every time a player meets the goals of a Bounty card, that player claims that card and its associated Victory Point value.&#10;&#10;Claiming Bounty cards isn&rsquo;t the only way a player can score Victory Points. By attacking and knocking out Enemies, a player can claim Scrap cards, which are also worth Victory Points.&#10;&#10;As Treasure Chests are raided, Bounty cards are claimed, and Heroes are knocked out, they are constantly being replaced at the start of each turn. This means the Arena is a dynamic battlefield with constantly evolving conditions and situations. To achieve victory in Riot Quest, a player needs the right tools at the right time, the cunning and foresight to react to the chaos of the Arena, and a little bit of luck.&#10;&#10;-description from kickstarter page&#10;&#10;",

The queen and the stone now define a line (straight or diagonal). If the next square of that line, going in the direction of the opponent's stone, is vacant or the next squares hold your opponent's stones followed by an empty square, then your color stone is placed on that square, thus trapping your opponent's stones between itself and the moving queen. Captured opponent stones are replaced with moving player's color stones.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;If a player is unable to make a move, he must pass, when all players pass the game ends.&#10;&#10;The player with the most pieces on the board wins.&#10;&#10;Description by the designer.&#10;&#10;",

You might find one a veritable hub of entertainment, with stalls hawking merchandise and local snacks, where another is a seedy, filthy, and dangerous, den of scoundrels. Most are a mixture of both.&#10;&#10;This double-sided board depicts two entirely different pitches, one for an Old World Alliance team, and the other for Underworld Denizens. On one side, you'll find a cobblestone market square, hastily cleared for a game. Barrels, bottles, tables and stalls surround the edges of the pitch, and the end zones are marked out in pink and cream checked patterns. Flip it over to find a dank cavern pitch, littered with ominously glowing fungus. Cracks in the stone have been patched up, and the remains of unfortunate victims can be seen casually strewn about. The End Zones are marked in glowing green checks.&#10;&#10;The package includes two double-sided dugouts to match the two styles of pitch. Each dugout features the usual Score tracker, Reserves, Knocked-out and Serious Injury boxes, and a re-roll tracker. You'll also find rules to represent the particular features of both sides of the pitch.&#10;&#10;Key Features&#10;-Double-sided pitch for Old World Alliance and Underworld Denizens teams&#10;-Features an urban market square on one side, and a dark, dank cavern on the other&#10;-Includes special rules for both sides of the pitch&#10;&#10;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Only by destroying all of their motherships will you halt the alien advance.&#10;&#10;Megablast is a solo deck building game, inspired by the shoot 'em up video games of the 90s.&#10;Blast your way through three levels of alien waves.

There is no deck shuffling so you can manipulate your deck to unleash devastating combos to defeat the end of level bosses and win.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW&#10;The game is played over three levels. During each level you will face four waves of alien ships, and then must defeat the end of level boss. When you defeat the third and final boss you win the game. You will also encounter asteroids, meteors and other hazards.&#10;&#10;Enemies spawn in the top row of a 4 x 3 grid. They move down the grid towards your ship before either flying off the bottom, or being destroyed by your attacks. You must maneuver your ship to avoid enemy fire whilst trying to defeat as many of them as possible.&#10;&#10;For each level of the game, there is a deck of upgrade cards for your ship. When you defeat a wave of aliens, you gain a new card of the current level. When you defeat a boss, you gain a card of the next level. Use card actions to attack, move, defend, and draw &amp; play extra cards. Decide what to play, hold, and discard to set up powerful combos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This is the first title in Small Box Games' Small Batch line of games.&#10;&#10;Played over 5 Years (or rounds), players gain points at the end of the game for their played pieces and controlled spaces.  However, a player may win the game before the end of the 5th year by meeting one of the winning conditions: controlling seven spaces of a single type, placing all 3 of their Outposts, or having 4 more placed Towers than the other player.&#10;&#10;12 double sided cards, each with two spaces, are randomly arranged in a 3x4 grid at the beginning of the game.  Each player controls 8 Towers and 3 Strongholds.  Players control the spaces their Towers occupy, as well as the unoccupied spaces that are orthogonally adjacent to their Strongholds.&#10;&#10;Controlled Desert spaces determine priority.  Forest spaces grant them strength and the ability to remove or replace opposing Towers.  Mountains grant gold, which players spend to keep their pieces in play at the end of the Year.&#10;&#10;Each Year, each player receives 2 actions, chosen from 3 different options: Tower Action, Stronghold Action, or Ability Action, with each of these options offering 2 choices.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But similar to the game's predecessors, Twilight Ravine revolves around a group of adventurers seeking treasures. Overall, the setting is designed to complement and expand the world view of the Kradia.&#10;&#10;",

Players must make strategic decisions every turn as they try to find advantage using a limited action economy.&#10;&#10;Every turn repositions the tiles, and every action has ripple effects. Each player has a limited air supply that they must protect while maneuvering around the board. Players have the choice each turn for what actions to take. Actions include searching for treasure, shooing away a single Jellyfish, moving, expending air to shift an entire row of jellies, or recovering treasure. When players manage to recover a treasure in the game, they collect a physical treasure gem to add to their hoard.&#10;&#10;The key event comes every turn as an increasing number of tiles are added to one side of the play area, and slid across. The sliding tiles push the furthest tiles off the game play surface, thus rearranging the board. The tiles are chose at random, but placed carefully. If a jelly stings a diver, they lose air. As they lose air, the number of tiles being added each turn increases.&#10;&#10;In order to win, divers must recover 10 treasures first. However there is not always a winner. All players must search for treasure while keeping an eye on their air tank. If the air tank gauge reaches empty, their search is over.&#10;&#10;",

The pitch is arranged into a grid of interlinking spaces (a centre spot and for each side 4 forward spots, 3 penalty spots and a 'goal' space).&#10;&#10;Starting from the centre circle, one player rolls the blue Attacker die, while the opponent rolls the green Defender die. &#10;The Defender will take possession (and therefore become the Attacker) if the Attacker rolls 'pass' and the Defender rolls 'intercept', or if the Attacker rolls 'chip' and the Defender rolls 'head', or if the Attacker rolls 'dribble' and the Defender rolls 'tackle'.&#10;&#10;If the Attacker manages to move the ball without interruption from the Defender to the penalty area, he/she can take a shot at goal using the red Striker die. The opponent gets a chance to block this shot using the black Goalie die.&#10;&#10;Outcomes: Blue (Attack: pass, dribble, chip), Green (Defend: tackle, intercept, head), Red (Striker shoot: left, centre, right), Black (Goalie save: left, centre, right).&#10;&#10;Big Match is a light &quot;stocking filler&quot; game and comes with a small felt bag to hold the components.

    "Description": "The 32nd issue returns to Panzer Grenadier (Modern): 1967 Sword of Israel, with the Royal Marines helicoptering into the Gaza Strip to commit mayhem. It&rsquo;s based on actual excuses offered by Egyptian officers for their defeat in the Six-Day War: that British commandos intervened in the fighting, helping the Israelis eject the Egyptian garrison. British Royal Marines did see action in South Yemen in 1967, and were the last units to withdraw in November of that year. But they did not fight in Sinai.&#10;&#10;The variant includes 24 die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces for 45 Commando (properly rendered &ldquo;Four-Five,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Forty-fifth,&rdquo; in RN parlance). You get eight new scenarios of Royal Marine action, fighting the Egyptians and fighting the Israelis, too.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Even worse, the ship is caught in the sun&rsquo;s gravitational pull which is causing even more damage. It is only a matter of time before you and the rest of the crew perish.&#10;&#10;You and the other crew members must repair the ship whilst using resources to divert what little power is left, back to the energy core. You must work together if you have any hope of survival. Get moving. You have limited resources and more solar flares are continuously causing more damage. Can you survive this Solar Storm, or will you perish in the burning abyss?&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may take up to 3 of the following actions; move, use resources to repair an area of the ship, use resources to divert power from an area back to the energy core, scavenge for resources, share resources, or strategically save actions for later in the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, the ship will take more damage. The level of damage will increase as the game goes on. Players win if they can direct power from all areas back to the energy core. However, players will lose if an area takes too much damage or if the resource deck runs dry.&#10;&#10;Solar Storm will give players a unique game every time they play due to the ship&rsquo;s areas being laid out randomly at the start of each game. In Solar Storm, cooperative play is essential as players cannot win on their own.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;Deluxe version includes:&#10;&#10;     8 room cards mini-expansion&#10;     4 large unique screen printed meeples&#10;     The 'Damage Control' mini-expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each correctly guessed word scores a point. When everyone has had their turn, the team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This free &quot;Harpoon V: Jumpstart&quot; explains the rules system to new players and familiarizes veteran Harpoon players with the many changes made to the fifth edition rules.&#10;&#10;The previous fourth edition was last updated in 2001(!), so there&rsquo;s a lot of catching up to do, not only in terms of new systems that have appeared, but better ways of modeling the complex interactions and technical details of modern naval warfare.&#10;&#10;Seriously, there are a lot of moving parts. For example, a detection by radar is affected by the range of the contact, its signature (which is not the same as its size), the type of radar, the radar&rsquo;s technology level, the weather, the contact&rsquo;s proximity to land, and how quickly the detection is processed (a new feature in this edition, the combat system). And then there&rsquo;s offensive jamming.&#10;&#10;Harpoon is a complex game. It is playable because we have worked hard to ruthlessly simplify the many interactions and abstract, or &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; processes that would otherwise slow manual play to a crawl. We want the game to be about making decisions, based on real-world trade-off s.&#10;&#10;This game requires that you learn about naval warfare. Like any game, the more you understand, the better your chance of winning. The rules explain, in real-world terms, how radar, sonar, and other sensors work. Some of it is arcane; all of it is real. And in naval warfare, finding the other side is the hard part.&#10;&#10;",

If a player gives a wrong answer, other can challenge them to make them return to from where they started. The first player to reach Paradise (i.e., the end of the track) wins the game.&#10;&#10;In the Territorial mode, players attempt to occupy the locations on the board, each of which is connected to a section of the Bible. Answering correctly lets you place a banner on a location, but you can score points only if you are not driven out by another player. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The cars race through city streets obeying basic traffic laws such as driving on the right, not stopping in the middle of intersections etc. In conjunction with each die-roll a card must be revealed which tells the player how they can move (or cannot). There's a no-overtake zone where cars in front may not be passed, and in general no two vehicles can land in the same space.&#10;&#10;The idea is to pick up two tokens matching your car colour at the two time-control zones marked with clocks, then be the first to cross the finish line to be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Allied invasion of Normandy was a watershed moment in the war. Months of careful planning proceeded while the entire uncommitted strength of the American, British, Canadians, and other Allied armies massed in England. Across the Channel the Germans strove mightily to create hardened defenses on the beach and back them with a slew of new and veteran divisions. The clash came in the early hours of 6 June 1944: D-Day. If the Allies failed to grab a large enough beachhead the invasion would be contained and eventually crushed. If the German lines broke, the full weight of Allied power would be loosed to drive deep into France.&#10;&#10;The D-Day Quad uses the Fire &amp; Movement system, designed to highlight the ability of motorized units to mass quickly for breakthrough and exploitation. Support fire, representing weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers, provides the extra punch to overwhelm a defense or shatter an attack. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower, and asset management.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;One 34&times;22 inch mounted game board&#10;400 Die-cut counters&#10;Color rules booklet&#10;One six-sided die&#10;Storage bags&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome! is a card game from Japan. Players are trying to be the most successful mayor, attracting new businesses to their town, or lose the next election! The game turns on being able to build up a company and also be the only player appealing to that company. Players do this by card drafting and bluffing, openly or blindly, until a final reckoning.&#10;&#10;The game has a simple deck of 80 cards and a start player marker. Played over two rounds, each round has four turns, and players take simple actions to improve their chances of re-election.&#10;&#10;The deck has 8 Tourist cards (orange), 12 Software (yellow), 12 Hotel (purple), 12 Merchant Ship (green), 16 Airlines (blue) and 20 Motors (red). Each card shows the number in the deck, so all the orange Tourist cards say 8. With three players, the yellow cards are not used.&#10;&#10;On the back of each card is a handshake. Players are trying to convert company cards they collect into handshakes. Most handshakes collected by the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled, a line of 5 cards is dealt up, the companies players are trying to attract. Players are dealt 9 cards each, and each selects 3 to pass to their neighbour once. The neighbour looks at them, and the passed cards then go into a deck shuffled up. This Round deck goes next to the line of companies.&#10;&#10;Now players choose two hand cards in secret and place them face-down. When everyone has chosen, these Appeal cards are turned face up. At the end of the round, after four turns, these Appeal cards will divide up the company cards evenly between players, turning them over into handshakes. So the players are trying to place Appeals such that they are the only mayor attracting that company at the end of the round. If more than one player has the same Appeal card out, the cards are divied up by proportion.&#10;&#10;During the round, players may add one only Appeal card (limit is 3), or make swap a new Appeal card in (face-up or face-down) sending the old card to the company line, or may turn one card horizontal as a Challenge. Once each player has taken one action, three cards are dealt up from the Round deck to the line. If a player had chosen a Challenge to match any of these, their Challenge card becomes a handshake for them. If it didn't, it is discarded from the game. The start marker moves on and play continues with another action.&#10;&#10;After four turns, all Appeal cards are shown, and the line of companies is divied up. Collected cards become handshakes, uncollected remain for the second round, with the Appeal cards being added to the company line.&#10;&#10;The second round is played over in the same way and the player with the most handshakes at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;The first edition was home-made by the designer in only five copies. The second edition was a full edition and the 3rd edition was only a straight reprint, although marked in the rules as a 3rd edition.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The green cards are dealt out to the players.

If they manage to do so, they can discard the green card; if not, they have to take it back into their hand. Answers can be challenged; but if you wrongly accuse someone of giving a wrong answer you have to take their green card. &#10;The first player to get rid of all their green cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

He is taken undersea to Ryugu palace and is entertained by the Princess Otohime for several days. But when he returns to his home, he has been gone 300 years. When Taro opens a gift box Otohime gave him, he suddenly ages.&#10;&#10;In the game, it is his grandson Urashima who returns to do battle with Otohime, in anger that his grandfather's life was wasted away.&#10;&#10;One player is Urashima, trying to reach and defeat the other player who is Otohime. She has laid out a path of various creatures to defend her, alongside possible traps or treasures. The attacking player must defeat the creatures before combatting the princess. Players and creatures have their hit points (HP) shown by dice, which the adjust up and down.&#10;&#10;Otohime takes one white die for HPs and the red die for combat. Urashima takes two white dice for his HP(max 12) amd the green die for combat. Urashima starts with a treasure card, an Onigiri (rice ball) which will restore hit points by rolling his green die once.&#10;&#10;Otohime lays out a path of hidden cards, 5 monsters with 5 treasures, face-down in which ever order she likes. The first card is turned up and the fight begins. The players roll their green and red dice, and the difference is taken as damage. If green is higher, the monster is hurt; if red is higher, Urashima is hurt; if the dice are the same, the monster is restored to full HP.&#10;&#10;After one attack, Urashima can choose another attack, or to run away. He loses 1 HP, and cannot look at the treasure card, but moves on to the next creature.&#10;&#10;If he defeats the creature, he can look at the treasure. This might be a bonus weapon, or nothing, or a trap. The cards all have a little Japanese text, but the icons and images are very obvious and clear.&#10;&#10;If Urashima can get to Tohime and knock her down, he wins. If Otohime or her creatures knock Urashima down, she wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MURDER IS IN THE AIR... AGAIN!&#10;&#10;A Murder Most Fowl: Bloody Plumage is the successor to the card game A Murder Most Fowl (2015). It is a peculiar card game about crypto communication, people reading, and card counting.&#10;&#10;2 to 4 teams of 2-players each (which means the game is played by either 4, 6, or 8 players) compete against each other to solve the assassination of His Excellency The Honorable Robin Poor IX, who is the sovereign cock of the Avian Kingdom. On the verge of chaos, the kingdom invites independent agencies to solve the murder before the whole world topples into an Animal World War! No pressure...&#10;&#10;The game is loosely inspired by the English nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin&ndash;&ndash; especially the Henry Louis Stephens&rsquo; 1865 book version which is named Death and Burial of Poor Cock Robin.&#10;&#10;TEAMS&#10;&#10;DOGLAND YARD (easy-to-play) The first team to arrive at the crime scene is Charlotte Holmes and Vet. Watson from the Dogland Yard. Charlotte Holmes is a petite lady of a stark demeanor. Her intelligence is the envy of many male colleagues. Vet. Watson (both a veteran and a veterinarian, so, we might as well call him Vet. Vet. Watson) is a frequently drunk, hulky, aloof, yet loveable medic. His accessory is a small barrel of whiskey that he carries around.&#10;&#10;S&Ucirc;RET&Eacute; FELINATIONALE (easy-to-play) From across the channel arrive the inspectors of S&ucirc;ret&eacute; Felinationale. Being the catastrophe magnet he is, after Inspector Purrouseau has crossed the border, the country declared a celebration, hoping that the murder will never be resolved. Queen Kat&rsquo;O is a cross-dressing tomcat with questionable garderobe and bedfellows. Yet his skills in Paw Fu and Pawate stop anyone from further inquiries.&#10;&#10;FBI (FEDERAL BEAVERS OF INVESTIGATION) (easy-to-play) From across the ocean arrive the agents of Federal Beavers of Investigation (FBI, for short). Originally a fox, Agent Murder has been raised by beavers after his family has been abducted by &quot;a strange light in the sky.&quot; Agent Scurry is a pedantic skeptic of almost everything. Her famous quote is &quot;What does the Fox say?&quot;&#10;&#10;28th JANISSARY BRIGADE (moderate-to-play) Sailing from the Middle Sea, the ases of the 28th Janissary Brigade arrive at the scene of the crime. Originally from the Avian Kingdom, Hatun Rolexana was kidnapped into the harem when she was young. She seeks to capture the attention of the Sultan by solving this crime and earn a name change to H&uuml;rrem. Leading the bugs of the palace, Captain G&uuml;rgzadeh can sniff out clues better than anybody else. But really, in his heart, he is a lupus of mus&icirc;ki.&#10;&#10;SPRING AND AUTUMN MAGISTRATES (moderate-to-play) From the faraway lands in the East, the territory of the dragon takes notice of this mysterious murder. Daughter of a criminal mastermind, Lin Tang is using her intelligence and resources to fight crime. One day, she hopes to face her arch-enemy, her father, Phu Manchu. Before traveling to the Avian Kingdom, she enlists the help of Charlie Phan, a renowned detective who immigrated to the Island of the Volcano a long time ago.&#10;&#10;ZOOKHRANA (hard-to-play) From the snowy lands of the north, the men of Zookhrana arrive with their coats and vodka. Bearis Akunin is a crime author who turned into a detective. He enjoys criminal cases that have twist endings. Perseus is a mysterious and silent spy with a hidden identity. He (or she?) is cunning, intelligent, deadly, and a little megalomaniacal. (I mean, really, who calls themselves a &ldquo;project?&rdquo;)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the first Monday in October, the all-powerful Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gather each year in their &quot;marble palace&quot; to decide the fate of a nation. Each player represents a long-standing institution or school of thought attempting to gain renown by shaping the composition of the high court, taking sides in landmark cases throughout the history of the United States, and determining the governing laws of the land. Players need to use their limited influence and actions wisely to manipulate the judicial philosophy of the Court and to prevail in as many cases as possible.&#10;&#10;Over the course of two hours, First Monday in October &mdash; for which designer Jason Matthews worked as lead developer &mdash; re-creates the history of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1789 to the present day, through three distinct eras: Era I represents the founding of the Court in 1789 through the Civil War in 1865; Era II represents the time period from 1866 until the seminal decision of Brown v. Board in 1954; and Era III represents the modern era from 1955 until 2010.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around the following four judicial philosophy tracks:&#10;&#10;     Commerce Clause: This track represents the scope of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to &quot;regulate commerce&quot; among the several states. &#10;     Equality &amp; Liberty: This track broadly represents the scope of individual equality and liberty, including but not limited to the 14th Amendment (i.e., equal protection, due process, and privacy rights). &#10;     Free Speech: This track represents the obligation in the 1st Amendment that Congress make no law abridging a person's freedom of speech, and the scope of permissible restrictions on that freedom. &#10;     Executive Power: This track broadly represents the scope of Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which enumerates the powers of the executive branch, including the Office of the President and law enforcement. &#10;&#10;&#10;Shifting each philosophy one way generally represents a more expansive Federalist interpretation of the above constitutional provisions that supports a stronger centralized federal government, whereas shifting each philosophy the other direction generally represents a more narrow Anti-Federalist application of these provisions that supports a more decentralized approach to government with less power concentrated at the federal level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
