    "Description": "Many heroic adventures begin with a ragtag group of folks gathering to discuss their plans to help save the land from peril! And many of those meetings took place at the town's local inn! In Meet at the Inn, you're the adventurer freshly setting out on your journey... but will you mostly encounter simple beasts and uneventful landscapes, or will you be trapped by a Null Zone, brave the Cavern of the Abyss, or command the power of the Genie?&#10;&#10;Meet at the Inn is comprised of 30 unique cards, each with unique Trait combinations and some with unique abilities. The goal of the game is to empty your hand of cards, but that is much easier said than done.&#10;&#10;Each turn you will only play 1 card from your hand if it matches a Trait with the top card of the Play Pile. If you cannot, you must draw a card from the Deck. Certain cards can remain in play with global effects, called &quot;Decrees&quot;. Some cards allow you to play out of turn to empty your hand faster, these are &quot;Chain&quot; abilities.&#10;&#10;There is also a Discard Pile, which helps get cards out of play, because when the Deck is empty and a player must draw a card, the Play Pile is reshuffled!&#10;&#10;Set up and teaching the game takes less than 5 minutes. Playing a game takes roughly 5 minutes per player. But Meet at the Inn really shines when you've played it a few times with the same friends because your strategy will adapt to the meta of your opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each set introduces new scenario cards. These tell the player which scoring conditions to use in the game as well as adding specific rules to determine the behavior of the non-human opponent. The solo game is played over two rounds but otherwise follows standard gameplay.&#10;&#10;To setup a game using any of the Lone Cowboy sets, choose 1 scenario card and place it in the center. Find the two scoring conditions listed on the scenario and add them to the center.&#10;&#10;Deal out 8 cards in a circle. The player drafts and places cards on their turn as normal, with any skipped cards going to the opponent&rsquo;s pile. The opponent follows specific drafting criteria to determine which card they take. Skipped cards go to the player as normal.&#10;&#10;Once all 8 cards have been taken, deal the remaining 8 cards in a circle and repeat the process. After all 16 cards are gone, the opponent scores based on the scenario card as well as for the three most common territories in their pile. The player scores their town as normal. If the player&rsquo;s score is higher, they win!&#10;&#10;",

It is possible to save up to 8 action points for the next turn. A player can only visit one of the 12 sights, if they are not more than 3 steps away. On the upper map border is a column for each sight. When the turn ends on one of the sights, the player places a token to the lowermost cell of this sight, if they have not already a token there. For example, on the Protestant Church the first player gets two victory point, the second player one, the third player five and the fourth player eight victory points. However, at the end of the turn, a player can pay six action points to move one their tokens one step higher. Tokens of other players are skipped. For example, if the second cell of the Protestant Church is occupied, a player can jump from two to five victory points. Players also get two bonus points for each different city district they have visited (sights have different colors.) As soon a player reaches the city hall (where also the Ratinger Spieletage took place), they cannot move on the map anymore, they get 4 victory points and place at the start of each of their turns one of their tokens a special cell, which gives one victory point per token.&#10;&#10;As soon one player has placed all of their 8 tokens, the current round is played to the end.

    "Description": "According to the rules, Fish, Farewell, Forever, is a &quot;single-player card game designed to free the masses of their suffering from earthly desires.&quot; The game is made up of a deck of 30 cards, with virtue cards, desire cards, and understanding cards.&#10;&#10;Players play through a deck of cards hoping to liberate cards to The Beyond.  Once the deck runs out, the player loses unless they can move 2 cards from The Beyond over the Styx and onto The Far Shore.&#10;&#10;A player wins if they can liberate all cards.  &quot;Elevated&quot; wins are also possible, which allow the play to liberate non-card components, such as the rule book and box insert.&#10;&#10;",

By August the North Korean forces, although bloodied by repeated US airstrikes and weakened by stragglers from their swift advance, were massed for what many thought would be a final offensive to take the rest of South Korea. The main focus of the North Korean attack was along the Naktong River where a small bridge head had been secured earlier. Victory here could insure that there would be only one Korea, ruled by Communist leader Kim Il Sung. A UN victory could buy time and set the stage for a counter-offensive that might send the Communists back and free South Korea.

Then, starting with Black, players alternate turns placing 2 discs of their colour onto empty spaces until either one of the players resigns or all cells are occupied.&#10;&#10;If, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn (after placing both stones) a squ bigger than any previous squ of any colour has been created, the player places one pyramid of her colour on each of the 4 corners of that squ (covering each of the 4 discs). This is, the pyramids are used to keep track of the largest squ of each colour. Notice that the discs covered by pyramids still count for future squs.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the player with the largest squ wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(Please play responsibly)&#10;     Reveal: Each player who chose a non-majority answer must reveal an intimate secret about themselves or accept a dare from the other players.&#10;     Three Strikes: Choose three non-majority answers and you're out of the game. Last one still in wins.&#10;     Gambling: Each player wagers before the hose reads the answer choices for a question. If you can answer the card correctly after the options are read out loud, you win. If you win, you gain all of the points wagered. In the case of a tie, no one wins. If you lose, whoever wins will receive your points.&#10;&#10;&#10;Example Card:&#10;What's the worst thing that can happen at your wedding?&#10;A. Your ex pops up&#10;B. The groom shows up late&#10;C. The families start fighting&#10;D. Someone spills something on your dress&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "8-Cylinder Overlords is a game of building, defending, and attacking roads in a post-collapse world. 2-4 players take on the roles of Overlords, human brains encased in heavily-armed and armored supercars that rule over auto-worshipping Pedestrians. There are only a few Overlords left and they are racing to build a Road to a Lost City of forgotten lore and restorative technology. The first player to complete a 20-30 space long Road and drive her Overlord to the end wins the game!&#10;&#10;Each Player draws cards from the Road deck and lays down the cards in a line to form their Road. Simple Pavement cards extend the Road. Installation cards give you many more options: Farms allow you to create more workers. Refineries create the Fuel that you must pay to build each part of your Road and to compete in the Auction phase. Fortresses allow you to attack your rivals' Roads with withering Barrages or daring and potentially lucrative Raids. Once the Card is added to the Road, Players crew their installations by placing Peds in the spaces on each card. Players then go through the breeding, refining, and attacking phases and end their turn with the option of selling any cards they don't use.&#10;&#10;During every phase of a Player's turn, the Overlord figure has a special ability that can be used to augment the action, such as drawing more cards, motivating installations to act again, directly attacking rival Roads, and more. But each Overlord Action costs fuel from the Overlord's reserve and Players must make good choices about when to use these additional abilities.&#10;After each round of turns, Players move to Walkerville, a neutral territory where upgrades, special power cards, more workers, and various unique actions are sold in blind auctions. If two or more players compete for a single auction item and reach the maximum bid, the issue is decided by a frantic, high-stakes Drag Race. Auction wins can dramatically turn the tide of the game and Players are encouraged to bid aggressively.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The 4 cards  face up are to be kept in hand and the 9 cards face down cannot be seen  or used until the end of the game when there is no more deck cards to draw from (9 Lives End Game).&#10;&#10;Each turn players must lay a card of equal or higher value than the  player before, for example: on top of a 4, you can lay a 4 or higher. If you have multiples of the same number you can lay them at the same time. If you lay 4 or more of the same number, you can Scratch the Deck (discard the pile and lay a new start card). As long as there are cards left in the deck, players must keep a  minimum of 4 cards in hand at all times, so, if you lay 2 cards, you  pick up 2, if you lay 1 card, you pick up 1.&#10;&#10;Every time you place a card of the same value of the player before,  for example: you lay a 5 on top of a 5, you pick a card up from the  'Good Cat Bad Cat' deck.

    "Description": "18Dracula is a print-and-play 18XX board game where the players buy and sell shares in fronts, and operate those fronts to hire monsters to send on rampages to harvest blood. The winner is the player who is worth the most blood at the end of the game - being their blood supply, and the combined value of their shares in fronts.&#10;&#10;Functionally, the game is very close to being a retheme of 1830. Despite lacking trains, it is very much a train game.&#10;&#10;Besides its theme, it is also novel for its map, monsters (which replace trains), and associates (which replace privates). The map uses cubes and nodes instead of tiles (like most 18xx games). You clear routes by removing cubes from the routes.&#10;&#10;Some monsters have special rules - such as a ghost being able to pass through a token, or a werewolf that roams adjacent towns instead of a solid route. Associates have some odd abilities, like opening a route between any two towns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in a densely wooded yet populated area where forest fires often occur. When fires start, players work together to put them out and save houses and schools from destruction.&#10;&#10;Players use several fire fighting approaches &ndash; bulldozers, water, helicopters and chemical extinguishers. Fires occur randomly (FOREST FIRE cards) and spread every turn. Wind changes direction and intensity frequently, affecting the spread of the fires. Players contain the fires with bulldozer firebreaks and throw water and fire extinguisher balls (fire retardant) on the fires by hand or from a helicopter.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, environmental factors like wind and drought increase, affecting the frequency, intensity, and spreading speed of fires, simulating the effects of climate change.&#10;&#10;We noted the other game of the same name and same setting, but the play mechanics are very different. This is not a strategy game, but a fairly simple but exciting family game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

All players must agree on which number to use. Place this number token on the Jungle hex.&#10;&#10;The Robber begins the game on the Jungle hex.&#10;&#10;- Special Rules&#10;The Jungle&#10;During the game, players may explore the Jungle and make valuable discoveries. The discoveries will aid them in developing their principalities. When the number on the token that was placed in the Jungle is rolled on the production dice, each player with settlements or cities adjacent to the Jungle will make discoveries!&#10;&#10;Like other land hexes, each settlement adjacent to the Jungle will receive one discovery when the Jungle number is rolled. Likewise, each city adjacent to the Jungle will receive two discoveries.&#10;&#10;-Discoveries&#10;Discoveries are not represented by cards as other resources are. Instead, they are represented by the Discovery Counters. Discovery Counters do not count against a player's hand limit of resources when a &quot;7&quot; is rolled on the production roll.&#10;&#10;Discovery Counters can not be stolen by the Robber, can not be claimed by a Monopoly, can not be earned through a Year of Plenty, and may not be used in any trades.&#10;&#10;Discovery Counters are used to aid the purchase of development cards. Each Discovery Counter can be used to replace any one of the three resources needed to purchase a card. Up to three Discovery Counters may be used on each card purchase.&#10;&#10;Any combination of Discovery Counters and the three normal resources may be used.&#10;&#10;For Example: a player may purchase a Development Card with one Ore and two Discovery Counters. Similarly, a Discovery Card could be purchased with one wool, one grain, and one discovery counter.&#10;&#10;III. Components&#10;In addition to all of the normal components of the Settlers game, you will need three additional components:&#10;&#10;1 Jungle Hexagon&#10;Discovery Counters (about 10 should be enough, the Victory Point Tokens from Seafarers work very well for this purpose)&#10;1 additional resource number token (valued 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, or 11)&#10;&#10;",

One of the six intersections on the Volcano tile will be affected. If there is a settlement on the selected intersection, it is destroyed!&#10;&#10;Remove it from the board (its owner may rebuild it later). If a city is located there, it is reduced to a settlement! Replace the city with a settlement of its owner's color. If he has no settlements remaining, it is destroyed instead.&#10;&#10;The presence of the Robber on the Volcano hex does not prevent the Volcano from erupting.&#10;&#10;Gold Variant&#10;Important: This is an optional rule. All players must agree to this rule if it is to be used.&#10;&#10;Volcanoes tend to be rich in valuable minerals such as gold or gems. If the players desire, the Volcano can produce resources when its number is rolled.&#10;&#10;This &quot;gold&quot; is distributed in the same manner as the Gold River hex in the Seafarers expansion: Each settlement that is adjacent to the Volcano when it erupts may produce any one of the five resources it's owner desires.&#10;&#10;Each city adjacent to the Volcano may produce any two resources. This resource production is taken before the results of the volcano eruption are resolved. Note that while the Robber can not prevent the Volcano from erupting, he does prevent any player from producing resources from the Volcano hex if he has been placed there.&#10;&#10;-Playing with the Seafarers Expansion&#10;When playing the Volcano scenario with the seafarers expansion, the Volcano tile can replace any desert or sea tile that all players agree on. The only restriction is that whichever tile is replaced by the Volcano must be adjacent to at least two other resource-producing land tiles.&#10;&#10;-Krakatoa Variant&#10;This variant is for use only with the Seafarers expansion. For this variant, form an island from three Volcano tiles. Place resource number tokens 4, 5, and 6 one on each Volcano.&#10;&#10;This variant should only be used with the Gold Variant described above.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn you can attack, scout, or pass to draw an event card.&#10;&#10;When you destroy a tank you collect it and it counts for points at the end of the game, with stronger tanks being worth more points. The game ends when all but one player run out of tanks or after the third Boco event card comes out, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club is a scenario and campaign book for the popular Check Your 6 Jet Age  Air Combat and Campaign Rules. The book provides comprehensive coverage of the clashes between the United States Navy and North Vietnam&rsquo;s Peoples Air Force between 1965 and 1968 during Operation Rolling Thunder with four campaigns, a mini-campaign and 28 scenarios. The scenarios can be played individually, linked to form campaigns, or combined as one grand campaign. The campaigns cover the battles that occurred during the annual southern monsoon fighting season.  The missions changed during the course of Rolling Thunder, so each campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The first campaign 1965: Hard Lessons Relearned covers the initial battles between the USN and VPAF and the failures of initial tactics and weapons at the start of Rolling Thunder.&#10;&#10;The second campaign 1966: The Grind covers the period where the operational failure of Rolling Thunder&rsquo;s restrictions became clear to the men fighting even as their weapons and tactics improved, the skill of the VPAF improved as well.&#10;&#10;The third campaign 1967: The Gloves Come Off covers the period where many of Rolling Thunder&rsquo;s restrictions were lifted, large strikes on VPAF airfields and the push to destroy the VPAF. Included within this campaign period is the mini-campaign &ldquo;A Birthday Gift for Uncle Ho&rdquo; covering the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s audacious mission to deliver Walleye glide bombs to a power plant in downtown Hanoi, and the running air battle that ensued.&#10;&#10;The fourth campaign 1968: The End of the Beginning covers the period post Tet Offensive, the US ended their operations over the heart of North Vietnam, and thereby created a safe haven for VPAF MiGs North of the 19th Parallel. The VPAF began to sweep south and with bait and killer teams, and the Navy had to change tactics again, counter to these attacks till the end of Operation Rolling Thunder.&#10;&#10;HISTORICAL RESEARCH: The book includes a sections containing historical background, the training, tactics and weapons of each side, an annotated bibliography for further reading, a color scheme guide, and a campaign map.&#10;&#10;AIRCRAFT STATISTICS and CAMPAIGN INFORMATION: The book contains aircraft statistics for 14 US and Soviet-built aircraft and their variants in Check Your 6 Jet Age  format for use in the scenarios. The book also contains detailed notes and pictures of the various aircraft featured in the campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

After forcing your way through the veil that divides the world of the waking from that of sleep, you must navigate the cavernous Underworld, encountering ghouls and gugs, in the hopes of finding your way to the world above and reuniting with the rest of your team.&#10;&#10;Point of No Return is Scenario 3&ndash;B of &ldquo;The Web of Dreams&rdquo; campaign, which follows the path of the investigators left behind to handle the horrors of the waking world in The Dream-Eaters. This scenario can be played on its own in Standalone Mode or combined with the other expansions in The Dream-Eaters cycle to form a larger four-part or eight-part campaign. Following the events of A Thousand Shapes of Horror, you have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. No wondrous lands or fabulous cities greet you; merely the dark, barren realm of the Underworld. Perhaps those who brought stories of the Dreamlands to Arkham had never ventured this far underground, or perhaps this place can only be found by those who force their way in. Either way, you are now hopelessly alone in a realm you have never heard of, and the only way out is through.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
