    "Description": "It&rsquo;s 60 BC, and the three most powerful men in Rome form a loose alliance based on marriage, self-interest, and a thirst for power. In Triumvir, you take the role of one of these Roman power brokers as you vie for power and position that inevitably leads to Civil War.&#10;&#10;Triumvir builds on Versailles 1919 where players use influence to gain control over issues and the path that history will take going forward. In Triumvir, you will use your three-dimensional influence in popularity, money, and legions to vie for the Consulship, Pontifex Maximus, and Governorships as you try to outmaneuver your erstwhile friends on the floor of the Senate. The game can be played with 1 &ndash; 3 players.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you will perform one of three actions: Place influence (popularity, money, or legions) on issues that are being debated in the Senate, Recover exhausted influence, or Settle an issue. These actions are punctuated by elections, revolts in the provinces, and domestic unrest. As one of the Triumvirs, you will have to balance your tempo of activities to ensure that you are not caught short on your ability to influence how events evolve and progress.&#10;&#10;Although Triumvir uses many of the basic mechanics from Versailles 1919, the design is thematically aligned to its subject. When an issue settles, your choices will alter your popularity and resources where the Consul often gets his cut. Each player has a unique personality card that asymmetrically captures your personality&rsquo;s strengths in how they gain and recover influence. These characteristics are enhanced by your growing tableau of patrons&mdash;some of whom bring additional resources.&#10;&#10;Revolts are intense events where the Governor of the affected province has to re-establish Roman rule. Failure to do so carries tough popularity penalties whereas success raises your stature. If you put down a particularly epic revolt in a grand fashion you can be awarded a Triumph with extra legions, but remember&mdash;sic transit gloria. The tides of fate can often turn against you in the next election or foreign war.&#10;&#10;This political danse macabre continues until the &lsquo;Crossing the Rubicon&rsquo; issue ends the Roman Republic and brings on a Civil War or one player dominates faction standing. Can you prevail against your political rivals as you try to dominate Rome? Your seat at the table awaits you in Triumvir.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Cartagena de Indias took place during the 1739 to 1748 War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain. The result of long-standing commercial tensions, the war was primarily fought in the Caribbean; the British tried to capture key Spanish ports in the region, including Porto Bello and Chagres in Panama, Havana, and Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia.&#10;&#10;Two previous naval attacks in 1740 had failed and for the third attempt in March 1741, the British had opted for a combined naval and land attack. After a series of unsuccessful assaults in the campaign, the British were forced to retreat, having suffered over 9,500&ndash;11,500 fatalities, in great part to disease, and considerable material losses. Some units suffered death rates of 80 to 90 percent. The victory demonstrated Spain's ability to defend its position and largely ended military operations in this area. Both countries shifted their focus to the wider European War of the Austrian Succession and hostilities ended with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.&#10;&#10;In this two-player game, one player will take the control of the Spanish forces and the other the control of the British forces. The British player will have to make a way thru the bay of Cartagena de Indias to conquer the Spanish while the Spanish player will have to defend the city to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",

These battles include:&#10;&#10;     Battle of the Schellenberg (1704) &#10;     Battle of Ramillies (1706) &#10;     Battle of Sheriffmuir (1715) &#10;     Battle of Mollwitz (1741) &#10;     Battle of Soor (1745) &#10;     Battle of Falkirk (1746) &#10;     Battle of Plassey (1757) &#10;     Battle of Minden (1759) &#10;     Battle of Warburg (1760) &#10;&#10;&#10;Of course, the book would not be complete without a set of classic 'Old School' wargaming rules. &#10;The obvious choice was Stuart Asquith's popular wargaming rules for Malburian Warfare 1702-1714.&#10;&#10;This work is published as part of The History of Wargaming Project range of books that aim to document the development of wargaming.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With the action cards, you can bully your fellow players by, for example, taking their cards, having them skip a turn, stealing a player and even more 'nasty' bullying cards! Of course, you can also defend your players in this game with the defence cards (blocks the attack card) or the offside card (blocks the action card). There are also 'super cards' in the game, each of which has a special power. If you really quickly kick your opponent out of the tournament, throw up the 'Penalty' card to take out multiple players immediately. Each team also has a Coach and can be used against the most dangerous attacks to defend you from the other player's attempts to score a goal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Met MadSoccer breng je de spanning van het EK naar je woonkamer!

    "Description": "Dark Overlord Reigns is a semi-abstract game of warfare that takes place in a forsaken fantasy world. White cubes represent forces that allow you to protect, fight, and perform tasks. You also manage three heroic leaders that journey around the tile map to aid your forces against the Dark Overlord; the rising threat to the free nations.&#10;&#10;Designed as a solitaire game, forces of the Dark Overlord are controlled by the game system. These forces consist of black cubes (dark army), blue cubes (hellbreed), and purple cubes (ghoul hordes). The dark army represents the overlord&rsquo;s regular army, the hellbreed represents his supernatural army, and the ghoul hordes represent his enslaved army.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game you are attempting to build up your white cubes while keeping the rival cubes to a minimum. A major feature in the game is &ldquo;worker placement&rdquo;. To overcome the Dark Overlord you must have your task force cubes (workers) fulfill various missions in order to recruit more forces and outwit the Dark Overlord. Ultimately, you must prevail in a final battle on the center tile in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of 3 phases. The first phase involves the emergence of rival cubes. The second phase involves the fulfilment of task spot effects (based on the accomplishments of your task force cubes). The third phase of the turn allows you decision-making opportunities using your heroes. At this point you can move your heroes, perform combat, deploy forces, pick up forces, and drop off runestones.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Parties travel from island to island, encountering prehistoric monsters, traps, and other enemies.&#10;&#10;The game started as a  convention game at Salute '97 (miniature wargaming convention), but the rules were published as an A4 spiral-bound rulebook, counting 18 pages.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a party onboard a small ship. Movement by ship is between islands. Once the party sets foot on an island, an encounter can occur, a trap can be found, etc. The goal of the game is to reach the island with the temple, and trying to escape again, upon which the game is won by that party.&#10;&#10;The whole game is played on a table with scenery, miniatures, etc.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Hunger Level tiles will then be revealed and the hungriest monster will eat the meal and add the total to its Power Level. If a monster eats too fast and exceeds level 20 it becomes too powerful and explodes. If it doesn&rsquo;t eat the right stuff and goes below level 1, it becomes hangry and eats its human.

A whole &quot;Team&quot; Based on its lead characters is worth Ten points, incomplete teams are only worth one point per character(For a maximum of four) if you have no complete teams, you lose automatically. The hands are broken up into their teams and incomplete ones are compiled into another deck.&#10;&#10;The player with the least points starts the team battles by playing one card from one team and may only use this team until it is gone, same with the enemy player. A third card is drawn from the deck to determine weapon values of both cards. The highest total force still wins.

    "Description": "You and your partner stand against a terrible Crisis.&#10;&#10;It shouldn&rsquo;t have been anything new; the two of you had surpassed many hardships before, and forged a bond stronger than steel together. Together, you were supposed to be powerful.&#10;&#10;But this time, things went horribly wrong. Even with your strengths combined, your last battle was certain to end in your defeat.&#10;&#10;And so, your partner made the ultimate sacrifice: they sent you back to safety, while they stayed to fight the Crisis alone.&#10;&#10;Two Stand To Fall is a solo storytelling game about people who would sacrifice for each other, in the face of a world that seeks their destruction.&#10;&#10;Perhaps they live, in spite of the world. Perhaps they die, and are forever separated.&#10;&#10;But there is a chance you both will come out alive. Therefore, you must try.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As technology advances, interpersonal communication is weakening by the day.&#10;Children are drowning in a digitalized world while their parents have their hands full with their smartphones.&#10;Therefore, we decided to develop an educational board game to teach children and adults about the Islamic faith through fun and games and to strengthen their relationship and communication with each other.&#10;Especially in this day and age, where there is only ignorance or half-knowledge about Islam, we want to bring light into the darkness with this game.&#10;With this game we also want to address non-Muslims in particular, so that they can gain an insight into Islam.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The game&rsquo;s design is that the Kaaba has to be circumnavigated seven times. Circling with the pawn is accomplished by answering questions on Islamic topics. The questions are divided into five difficulty levels. The more difficult the question, the more steps you can take if you answer it correctly. If a player, for example, correctly answers a question from category two, he or she can take two steps forward with the pawn.&#10;&#10;Winning:&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first to circle the Kaaba seven times with the pawn. The pawns are moved counterclockwise around the Kaaba just as is the case with the real Kaaba in Mecca. A circle (orbit) occurs every time the player has passed the starting position.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The concept is simple: Help the animals break out of the zoo. Zoo Break is compact and easy to grasp for kids as young as five, who are still learning their numbers, but it involves strategy and level variations that make it intriguing for the sharpest of gamers. (We challenge advanced gamers to try getting through Levels 1-10 in one play session!) Zoo Break can be played alone, or collaboratively by multiple people. It's a great family game.&#10;&#10;To play, simply shuffle the cards and lay them out in an 8x8 grid. Place the four colorful wooden animals in the center. Roll the green dice to guide the animals to freedom, using strategy to choose the best path for each animal. But watch out for the zookeeper! For every roll of the animal dice, you'll also roll the zookeeper dice. The zookeeper locks down cards and closes off escape routes with every roll.&#10;&#10;Win the game by breaking out all four animals before their escape routes close. Strategy abounds around which paths to take, and this makes for great interaction with kid co-players. Four free spaces help you on your way. But if the zookeeper locks down a card that is currently occupied by an animal, it's back to the central cage!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, not all of the British forces withdrew across the Channel.  To the South of the Somme, the 51st Highland Division remained to fight alongside their French comrades in the hope that a new defensive line could be formed and a second Britsh Expeditionary Force sent to continue the war.&#10;This campaign focusses on the actions on the Somme, with the British, supported by French guns and armour, attempting to crush a bridgehead held by the German 57th Infantry Division. If the Highlanders can push the Germans back across the Somme, the much anticipated Weygand Line may become a reality and the German advance South checked.&#10;The campaign is a total of Six game tables with the duration running between five and nine games.  &#10;Briefings are provided for both sides, along with measurable objectives, period maps, force and support option listings and everything you need to play this campaign through to its conclusion.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The attack over the Jarama river was to be coordinated with the Italian&rsquo;s offensive to the north and east of the city along the Guadalajara river. However, the Italians were taking longer than anticipated to get their forces into positions, hindered by poor weather and abysmal planning. With growing impatience General Franco ordered his forces to attack, supported by the German Condor Legion as well as masses of new German tanks, artillery pieces and ample supplies of ordinance.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

The goal of the game is to win the most cards. Gameplay is directed by one of 6 different cats that appear on the cards. Three cats provide players the opportunity to see the country map and its capital on their opponents&rsquo; cards, which players will be challenged to successfully remember later in play. The other 3 cats direct various play that allow players to steal or win cards by either correctly naming the capital for a given country, or by carefully selecting an opponent who will not likely know or remember the correct answer.&#10;&#10;Each of the 60 cards has a unique colorful map depicting several countries with one or more capitals identified.  One round of the game takes approximately 20 minutes.  The game moves fast enough that several rounds can be played, which has the benefit of introducing more countries and capitals into play.  A more challenging game can be played by requiring all capitals on a given card to be correctly named in order to win the card.&#10;&#10;The game can be enjoyed by people of varied ages and knowledge as everyone gets an opportunity to win cards based on their own competencies and strategy.  Ultimately though, as one learns more capitals of the world a distinct advantage will develop, especially if one plays repeatedly.&#10;&#10;",

Drache underwent a refit back to being a minelayer in the spring or summer of 1942 and was moved to the Aegean. She was re-equipped with two 105 mm (4.1&quot;) guns, five 37 mm and six 20 mm cannons. A rear platform was added with space for 240 mines on four rails. The Kriegsmarine renamed her Schiff, but she is better known as Drache so the name is retained here. The large flat rear deck made her suitable to test the concept of a helicopter carrier &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first &ndash; using a Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) as a spotter aircraft.&#10;&#10;The Kolibri was the world&rsquo;s first naval helicopter. It was unarmed but the Kriegsmarine intended to use it for submarine spotting. It could also be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance.&#10;&#10;Pack contains 1 resin &amp; metal vessel and game cards.

It was at this point that Pacific PT boats were upgraded to have 40 mm/37 mm cannon on the bow and stern. Three old Elco 77&rsquo; boats were converted into barge-busters by stripping off the torpedoes and adding extra armour, radar and more MGs.&#10;&#10;Contains 2 resin and metal vessels and game cards.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "May 1942 saw the first major, considered offensive by the Red Army in the war against Germany. Expectations were high, with four Soviet armies aiming to encircle the German Sixth Army and to recapture the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union. Those expectations were dashed within a fortnight by the German Army&rsquo;s ability to absorb the offensive and launch a counteroffensive of its own which, in its turn, encircled two Soviet armies.&#10;&#10;Kharkov, May 1942 &ndash; The Last Disaster is a miniature wargames campaign system, designed for two to four players, covering these events. It is designed for games in which a stand represents a platoon or in which the main unit of manoeuvre is the battalion. Suitable rules would include Spearhead, Blitzkrieg Commander, Command Decision: TOB, A Fistful of Tows, Rapid Fire Reloaded and others, including those which wargamers may have written themselves.&#10;&#10;The system generates fifty or so hours of gaming spread over ten to fifteen individual battles which are fought over six to fifteen daily campaign turns. The number of turns is flexible and determined by whether either player can encircle the enemy&rsquo;s forces. Progress in the campaign is measured along campaign tracks representing the two major axes of attack with a number of battlefield &lsquo;spaces&rsquo;. Each turn players decide whether to attack or not and then which parts of their total forces they commit to any ensuing battle. Battles will generally be around a brigade or regiment of four to eight battalions on each side. The results of each on table battle determine the speed of advance on the main campaign map.&#10;&#10;The book includes&#10;&#10;     a brief history of the campaign&#10;     background information useful in adapting the system to different sets of rules and suggestions for additional optional rules&#10;     a comprehensive set of Appendices covering&#10;         the Tables of Organisation and Equipment to platoon level for all divisions and regiments involved (around forty regimental sized formations)&#10;         a record of the At Start forces and reinforcements&#10;         a chart to track the position and composition of forces on each attack axis&#10;         19 colour terrain squares of the battlefields (based on nearly 600 square miles of original 1930s maps) which can be used to generate 570 six feet by four feet tabletops&#10;         a Campaign Quick Reference Sheet&#10;         a colour A4 Campaign Map&#10;         a set of suggestions to convert the system to Bob Cordery&rsquo;s Portable Wargame rules&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     100 A4 pages with 20+ colour illustrations.&#10;&#10;&#10;&ndash; Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cards either show a number and one of three colors, or a penalty in one of the colors. &#10;In each turn, one card from the stack is flipped open. Each player simultaneously picks a matching  card from their hand (matching means: same color or same number/penalty). All chosen cards are then revealed. The player who played the highest card in the same number as the open card gets all the penalties, which are either to draw cards from the stack or to steal a card from another player. &#10;When one player gets rid of all their cards, everyone gets points for the cards still left in their hand (number cards count their value, penalty cards count 10 points). When a player hits 100 points, whoever has least points, wins.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike other trump card games, this game uses four different suits, from which the player can choose to play their card for.  Every card has four symbols/strengths, these are: Tactic, Attack, Defense and Range.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the warrior cards are shuffled and all are dealt among the players as equally as possible.  Every player gets one joker card, the remaining joker cards are removed from the game.  After receiving their cards, players put them -face down- in front of them.&#10;&#10;The starting player takes the top card from his deck and pick one of the four symbols to play.  They call out both the symbol and the point value.  Then the other players take the top card of their decks and call out the point value for the chosen symbol and show their cards to prove their claims.  The player with the highest point value in the chosen strength wins the trick and places all cards -face down- at the bottom of their stack.  The game continues until a single player owns all the cards.&#10;&#10;Jokers can be used to win a trick, they always have the highest point value.  But they can only be played at beginning of the turn or if the corresponding symbol has been called out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
