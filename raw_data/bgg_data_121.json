    "Description": "Ahoy, adventurer! The Arctic is merciless: Your expedition team has to endure the unforgiving wilderness, the unexpected weather and the other fame hungry teams. Only one will be remembered as the conqueror of the North Pole. If you think you can adapt the ever-changing harsh conditions better than the others, start gearing up &mdash; the race is on!&#10;&#10;In Race to the North Pole each player has an expedition team which they have to navigate to the North Pole on the middle of the game board. The first player to get all of his or her pawns there wins the game. Game is played by moving with cards that are in front of you. Some cards allow movement while others also ambushing other players. But ambushing has a price! When ever you tackle another player you have to grab an &quot;Ice Mask Tile&quot;, which include equipment and some nasty hazards that might ruin your well planned schemes.&#10;&#10;Race to the North Pole also features a unique rotating board that simulates the Arctic weather. When a storm hits the board, everything changes! Your movement cards travel on the board and you receive a new set, the arctic maze that is formed out of cracks changes completely and the players travel around the board with the weather. This design has deep strategical elements that make every playthrough exciting and challenging to the very end.&#10;&#10;The game includes a free app Dized that gives players loads of new content, localizations, and mechanisms to use with the game through their smart devices.&#10;&#10;",

Arenas are won by creating the strongest combinations of numbers, and completing each arena also unlocks a special power with a limited number of uses. The powers get exhausted as they're crossed off, incentivizing players to claim them before their opponent. Will you bid your time by spreading your numbers as thinly as possible, or concentrate your forces early to access superior special powers?&#10;&#10;As both players always use the same dice rolls to generate their numbers, you cannot rely on luck to win.&#10;&#10;The game is a PDF file that can be printed on one sheet of paper and played using one dice and a pencil. Rules are also on one page, so that you can print it with the rules on the back of the sheet. Files are provided for both A4 and Letter size, and it can even be printed in larger sizes such as A1. Players who don't wish to print can use a PNG image file provided to play online.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with two players, as a team game with up to 10 players or solo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.&#10;&#10;The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.&#10;&#10;The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Confederate Army, victorious at Bull Run, sits watching warily across the Potomac at McClellans 100,000 plus troops train and prepare for the coming campaign season. McClellan is being spurred by politicians and press to use the army he has molded for operations besides drill.&#10;&#10;McClellan launches a bold flanking maneuver, taking his juggernaut by boat to the tip of the Virginia Peninsula at Fort Monroe. He slowly moves westward towards Richmond. This forces Johnston to react and fight or lose Richmond. The battles at Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Savage Station, Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill will forever be seared into the memories of the participants. It is here that the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac will be forged in the fire of battle.&#10;&#10;Forged In Fire is Worthington Games strategic level block game covering this campaign which should have and could have ended the Civil War three years earlier. The game features a mapboard displaying from the Virginia Peninsula to Richmond. It gives players the opportunity to fight the full campaign from McClellans advance to the emergence of Lee. The game includes the complete Peninsula Campaign as well as three scenarios: the Union advance from Fort Monroe to the Chickahominy River, Johnston's attack at Fair Oaks, and the emergence of Lee during the Seven Day's Battles.&#10;&#10;This game includes map, hardwood counters, labels, rules, dice, and necessary player aids.&#10;&#10;",

In Rebis there is no hand limit.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can play 1 card to another player&rsquo;s Active Shelf. You may choose to play your card with the positive or the negative value by considering that the sum of the book victory points in a shelf must never be negative. Whenever you play a card with a negative point value to another player&rsquo;s Shelf, you take 1 card from the Library deck.&#10;&#10;If your card causes the sum to exceed 13 points, you close the shelf by playing your card face down to create a new Active Shelf for the player. If you close another player&rsquo;s Active Shelf, you receive 1 Mixture token and the other player takes 1 card from the Library deck.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of your turn, after drawing a card, you may place as many golden dust mixture tokens as you want exclusively on your active shelf. Mixture tokens act as multipliers of the victory point value on the shelf where they are placed.&#10;&#10;When there are no more golden dust mixture tokens left, the players will take a golden mixture token instead, which can be placed immediately after, in any shelf of your preference.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck runs out or as soon as all mixture tokens have been taken, excluding the red mixture token. Count the total negative book value visible in all of your shelves and sum it to the amount of cards in your hand. The player with the higher result will receive the red mixture token, which will be placed in any shelf of the player&rsquo;s preference.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, count the total book value of each shelf and multiply it if there are any mixture tokens on the shelf. The player who has the highest total book value is the winner.&#10;&#10;A mini-expansion, Rebis: Zero, is included inside the base game's box.

The ranks and points of some cards of the &quot;nightmare&quot; suit will change.&#10;&#10;Excerpt from the Developer's Message in the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Somnia is a transcription of Mittlere Jass (aka Middler) and Molotov Jass, which are Swiss traditional trick-taking games. Mittlere Jass is for 3 players and Molotov Jass is for 4 players. Rules are quite close to original ones, while allocation of card points and card ranks are simplified, with a great help of fantastic art works and readable graphical design.&#10;The 2-player rules are our original variant, an homage to the traditions.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to build the most successful waste processing company, that will bring the highest income and the most victory points.&#10;&#10;The players incorporate the roles of waste processing managers who will build recycling and incineration plants, as well as waste processing facilities in order to transform unwanted waste into profitable business.&#10;&#10;The game lasts ten rounds, each divided into four phases. In the first littering phase players draw four waste cards each from the draw pile and choose exactly one of them to keep. Later on comes the investment phase in which players may purchase recycling and incineration plants as well as the waste processing facility and profitability tokens, that will be placed at the players boards. All those investments influence the recycling and incineration phase, which provides players with waste cards, that will be processed in the last phase in order to bring revenue.&#10;&#10;After the last, 10th round the game finishes and the time comes for assessment of the players efforts. Victory points are awarded for proper investments and gained money. The players may also be punished with negative points for garbage cards and waste cards that they discarded during the game. After summing up the victory and negative points, the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Waste processing has never been this much fun!&#10;&#10;",

Monopoly: The Mega Edition can be played in 1&frac12; hours with more fun than ever!&#10;&#10;The massive game board has 12 additional spaces, including 9 new properties. You'll be able to buy, for the first time: California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Arctic Avenues, plus the Gas Company. Each joins an existing group.&#10;&#10;Buy all the properties of a group, build your houses and hotels, and then keep on going by building Skyscrapers for a chance to earn &quot;mega&quot; rents. Good news: you can build houses and hotels once you own three out of four properties in a group (or two out of three in the smaller groups). You can even build a Depot on a railroad to double its rent.&#10;&#10;Start play with $2500, including a $1,000 bill.&#10;&#10;Roll three dice on your turn: two regular dice and the special &quot;Speed&quot; Die. The Speed Die gives you a chance for free trip to the next unowned property. (Later in the game the Speed Die could send you to the next property you owe rent on. Ouch!) From time to time you'll earn free &quot;Bus Tickets.&quot; Use them to go where you want to go, but beware: they expire! The Speed Die and the Bus Tickets make the action speedy, intense, and sure-fire fun!&#10;&#10;",

If the &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;jail&quot; dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; or &quot;jail&quot; dice, etc. The dice have a couple of &quot;Wild&quot; faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)&#10;&#10;If you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.&#10;&#10;Monopoly Express &ndash; an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S. &ndash; alters the gameplay as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The policeman from the &quot;Go To Jail&quot; corner of the board game replaces the words &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;jail&quot;.&#10;     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green &quot;GO&quot; arrow. A player earns $200 each time they roll GO, but they lose this money if they bust due to policemen. &#10;     The game includes an eleventh &quot;House/Hotel&quot; die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).&#10;     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance &quot;?&quot; logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.&#10;     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2021, this game was re-released in the US as Monopoly DICED! with square packaging rather than the round used for Express.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Citizens await the completion of a new park, and the players are architects tasked with its design. Be it building a playground for children to play on, installing benches for people to rest after a long day's work, planting trees where birds perch, sculpting a lake where fishes swim, or growing bushes where cats can hide in, players are responsible for planning the layout of the park.&#10;&#10;Mini Park is a tile-laying board game. On their turns, players randomly draw different types of installation tiles, then build the park according to placement rules. Meanwhile, players must also seize opportunities to place characters onto corresponding park installations and score points. When the park is completed, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the characters has a special ability which can be used (the diamond dealer, for example, can buy diamonds twice, the pickpocket steals a coin from the richest player etc.). Although all of the players try to gather as many jewels as possible, these cannot be collected easily as they have to be purchased with coins first.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the player cannot play any character during his turn. After this the jewels which have been collected are counted. Players score one point for each diamond and five points for each ruby they gathered.&#10;&#10;From the English rules:&#10;It is a time of intrigues over the marquis' domain. The Prosecutor, the extortioner and the countess covet the invaluable jewels of each other. To buy jewels at the best price, players will have to continuously impersonate new characters. Choose wisely between the 11 roles available and fortune will change hands relentlessly. But do not forget that money is only a mean to achieve your goal. At the end, the title of &ldquo;Marquis&ldquo; will go the one with the fullest jewel case. So be cautious!&#10;&#10;Forget &ldquo;Noblesse oblige&ldquo;, now play catch as catch can.

    "Description": "Millions of years old, amber is considered a semi-precious jewel used since ancient times. While the best known color of amber is yellow/honey, there are rare varieties of other colors. In Ambar, you want to collect the amber by following dangerous routes to create attractive jewels and sell them to the highest bidder in villas and castles. There are two main play areas:&#10;&#10;     The route days, which we will form by picking up cards from the route deck during the turn.&#10;     The action zone, which is made up of four fixed cards in front of each player.&#10;&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player picks up cards from the route deck, where neutral cards (cream color) and cards that represent dangers of the journey (black cards) will appear. Each card represents one day, and the more days you play (Phase 1 of the turn), the more actions you can take (Phase 2 of the turn). These actions are used to collect amber, produce precious jewels with it, and take them to villages where they can be sold.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two different rounds. The first round comes with fewer resources and involves less danger. The second round adds up the discard cards from the first round mixed with the new cards from the second round. When the cards of the second round are finished, the game ends, and the player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;During the whole game, demons are chasing the players. In the first round there is the snake demon, which chases the player who advances too much (five or more days of travel) and in the second round is the red demon, which always chases the player with the most gold.&#10;&#10;Quick turn overview: You take cards from the deck placing them on the board, and some events happen. When you hold, you take actions in your area, one for each card previously played on the board, producing your jewels. Then, you can sell to a trade card to get gold. Later, you can buy something with your gold, improving your resources. At the end of the turn, you will solve the demon cards, if there are any of them in this turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Champions 2020 has the same main mechanisms as StreetSoccer, which was published in 2002. Both games were developed in parallel over a thirty-year period. Why is the game set in 2020? A few soccer rules changed by that year, making the game more fluid.&#10;&#10;While StreetSoccer simulates soccer with five players on a side on a small square, Champions 2020 simulates stadium soccer, so the field is bigger. As coach you select 11 players as a starting line-up (goalie, defenders, midfielders, forwards), while the rest of your team starts in the dug-out for possible substitutes (after warming up).&#10;&#10;Your professional soccer players are more skilled than street soccer players, which leads to spectacular stadium matches. Players can try to hit passing balls, which can lead to throw-ins, corner-kicks and goalie-kicks. As skilled team players, your players can anticipate on passes. Your goalie is skilled, too. With good positioning he has the best save chances, which depends on the speed of the shot and the distance to the ball. A rebound is possible, but a better save is catching the ball in his hands.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the players are &quot;skilled&quot; in causing fouls (or &quot;schwalbes&quot;), too. As soccer coach, you can't always control your players &ndash; and that leads to free kicks, penalty kicks, yellow/red cards and injuries.&#10;&#10;For tournaments the yellow/red cards, injuries, extra time, penalty kicks and stats make the soccer simulation complete.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Stratopolis, players want to build wide, while also building big.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with twenty L-shaped tiles, each comprising three squares; one player has tiles showing all green squares, green and neutral squares, or two green squares and one red square, while the other player's tiles reverse red and green. Players shuffle and stack these tiles face down, revealing only the topmost tile.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a two-square tile (one red, one green) is placed on the table. Players then take turns adding their topmost tile to the display. A tile can be placed (1) on the table with at least one edge adjacent to an edge in play or (2) on top of at least two tiles already in play. When placed on a higher level, each square of the tile must be supported, the tile must be level, and red and green squares cannot cover one another. (Every other color play &ndash; such as green on neutral or red on red &ndash; is legal.)&#10;&#10;Once all tiles have been played, players count the scores of their zones, to find their best zone: number of squares in a contiguously connected area of their color times the height of the square in this area that is at the highest level. The player with the highest scoring zone wins.&#10;&#10;Variant rules invite players to play with a hand of tiles that they refresh after each turn or to play with all tiles available at all time.&#10;&#10;",

And don&rsquo;t forget to build hospitals to keep your koalas healthy!&#10;&#10;Koala Rescue Club is a puzzly polyomino game with two layers of decisions. First, you need to draw trees in specific shapes. Then you need to draw configurations of koalas on top of those trees. Cascading bonuses give you extra actions to work with, and merit badges give you goals to plan toward on each map. Koala Rescue Club can be played with any number of players, and provides exciting simultaneous play with an important message.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sam Grant covers the western theater of the American Civil War around the Mississippi area from 1862-1864.  It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;All artwork and graphics in the game Sam Grant was created by RPG/Historical artist,  Eric Hotz.&#10;&#10;",

Winter is coming and they are hoarding all the supplies!&#10;&#10;But to overthrow them, you need your own stones of power. Gather allies and ask for help from creatures all over the snowy kingdom to get your hands on stones. Only those who anticipate the plans of others, grab the most stones or use them most skillfully will be able to rise to become the new queen. Because there can only be one!&#10;&#10;Experience the first ever &quot;Bluff and Write&quot; game.&#10;&#10;In a total of 12 rounds, two, three or four of you will snatch dice from under each other's noses by tactically playing your cards.&#10;&#10;Will you prevail against the others, grab the right dice and place crosses in a targeted manner in order to rise to the throne of the 12 kingdoms at the end?&#10;&#10;You can look forward to both the familiar and popular trick card mechanic and the beautifully illustrated characters by Robin Lagofun. But this time you can expect a whole new component. The scorecard. In order to place the most crosses here, you have to get the best, the most or the most matching dice from the dice trays.&#10;&#10;Since the cards are known by all, the right dice can be scammed by tactical considerations and purposeful uncertainty of the others. However, every round is different!&#10;&#10;The card decks are rearranged every game and thus offer new challenges even after numerous games.&#10;&#10;Everyone has the same cards and competes for the same dice. Are the others greedy and want to grab the best dice, or are they too cautious for that? Take your chance!&#10;&#10;Your goal is to raise forces in all corners of the kingdom. To do this, you use the Stones of Power (twelve-sided dice) that you collect each turn.&#10;&#10;You get dice by selecting one of the character cards in your hand and playing it face down in front of you.&#10;&#10;Each character has special abilities that can get you the right color, the right number, or a completely new character card.&#10;&#10;But be careful, if several of you play the same character, he doesn't know where to help first and prefers not to help anyone. As a result, its effect cannot be used.&#10;&#10;In addition, the characters have different speeds. Characters with low numbers in the top center of the map are executed before the others. For this they are usually not allowed to take so many dice&#10;&#10;... But who knows if there are any dice left at all when it's the turn of the characters with the high numbers?&#10;&#10;Once you've got dice, you decide on your score sheet where you want to put crosses. For each die, you can decide whether to mark the color or the number.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the most points are awarded for a full row or column with 5 crosses. But beware: If there are exactly 2 crosses in a row or column, there are NO points!&#10;&#10;If you don't get any dice, all is not lost. Then you can use one of the powerful one-time effects that will get you back in the saddle very quickly. In some situations, you may even want to intentionally not collect any dice in order to be able to use one of these effects ...&#10;&#10;Whoever was able to place crosses the most cleverly at the end and thus received the most points, has won and becomes the new queen of the 12 kingdoms!&#10;&#10;-Translated from the crowdfunding page&#10;&#10;",

In the updated Risk, the Goal is to be the first player to complete 3 Objectives and be in control of your capital.&#10;&#10;Capitals are player specific and deployed during intial troop setup. Cities add to territories when calculating for Troop draft and are placed during game setup in random or pre-determined location. Troop deployment and activation is virtually identical to classic Risk.

Territories printed on cards are only utilized for the random placement of Cities during initial setup.&#10;&#10;Objectives and Rewards are broken down into minor and major categories. Minor Objectives include items such as Control Europe and Control 1 Enemy Capital. Major Objectives include items such as Take over 10 Territories in one Turn and Control 18 Territories. Minor Rewards include items such as Additional Maneuver and Guaranteed Card. Major Rewards include items such as Airfield and Attack Die.&#10;&#10;The new Goal of attaining Objectives provides much of the original Risk experience with a decreased time commitment and randomly selected Objectives changing the experience on each play.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Risk&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Risk (Revised Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Gameboard&#10;    7 Dice (3 Red D6, 2 White D6, 1 Sparkly Red D6, 1 Sparkly White D6)&#10;    Deck of 42 cards&#10;    5 Sets of Units (80 single troop blocks, 6 triple troop triangular prisms in Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Black)&#10;    5 Capitals (Short cylinders in each color)&#10;    15 Cities (Tall rectangles in grey)&#10;    Part Sheet (12 Objectives, 8 Rewards)&#10;    Rule book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "September 20, 1519: The activity on the deck is frantic. Sailors run from side to side, loading the final batch of supplies. On the royal stand in the harbor, the preparation is intense. The King has arrived to watch the fleet set sail: five mighty ships, commanded by five shrewd captains whose intelligence will be put to the test in the years to come. The cannons roar, giving the departure signal. The anchors are pulled up, and the sails unfurled. The voyage that will circle the globe has just begun.&#10;&#10;In Magellan: Elcano, you assume the role of a captain on one of these ships circumnavigating the world, and you want to collect as many goods as possible. Each player has an identical deck of 15 cards, and you start with five random cards in hand. These cards have values on them in two colors (from red, blue, and green) on opposite ends, and three decks of  ocean cards in red, blue, and green lie in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Reveal the top card of each deck. Each player then takes turns playing a card from their hand in front of them, building up to three piles &mdash; one in each color &mdash; and rotating a player card as desired to make it one color or another. Continue around the table until all players have passed or have no cards remaining in hand. Whoever has played the highest total in red discards their played cards and claims the matching ocean card; all other players return their played red cards to hand. In  the event of a tie, all players return their cards to hand, with the red ocean card remaining in place. Do the same with the blue and green cards.&#10;&#10;All players draw two cards from their personal deck, then you reveal a new red, blue, and green ocean card, piling up cards of the same color if they weren't claimed the previous one. Continue playing rounds until all players' decks are empty. Total your claimed ocean cards. Whoever has the highest sum wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Total chaos in the Wurst Factory! A batch of bad sausages has been produced and on top of that, they are alive! The only solution is throwing them on the conveyor belt and eventually they'll fall in the meat grinder so they can be processed again and become tasty sausages fit for human consumption.&#10;&#10;But the sausages will struggle to survive. They want to stay alive as long as possible so they will run away from the meat grinder and push the other sausages in front of them. But they will also have to keep an eye out for the Must-ard who will give them commands they must follow. They can also turn to the May-onnaise who will give them some options they might use. And don't forget the Ketchup. What's a sausage without Ketchup?&#10;&#10;Who'll be the last Wurst standing? Will it be you?&#10;&#10;Wurst Case Scenario is a funny very lightweight family game. The players are dealt an identity card randomly and they keep their identity a secret. Every turn all players play one card to influence the position of the sausages on the belt. When all players have played their card all sausages move one position further on the belt in the direction of the meat grinder. Eventually the sausages will move onto the meat grinder and they are eliminated from the game (but the owner of the sausage will keep on playing cards). When there is only one sausage left on the belt the game has ended and the owner of the sausage is declared the winner. When your sausage is eliminated, you can still keep on playing to plot your revenge. The eliminated players will try to make sure the last sausages fall in the grinder at the same time (this isn't as easy as you might think) and when this happens there is no winner. We have to admit, this really is the Wurst Case Scenario!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players compete to collect their container blocks from a central island and return them across the ice sheet to their respective camps before the Spring thaw.&#10;&#10;The game runs in two parts; Winter as the players lay ice tiles across the hex board to the central island, and Spring as the thaw allows the players to remove ice tiles. In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.&#10;&#10;A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.&#10;&#10;The Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternative symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of thirty cards: villagers numbered 1-17, samurai numbered 18-27, and three &quot;old fools&quot; who have no numbers. (With 3-4 players, you remove cards 1-5 and 23-27 from the game.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you deal 4-5 cards to each player, then place the remaining 4-5 cards in a pile called &quot;Goze&quot;. Each player starts with five &quot;Nobori&quot; tokens, each of which has a special power, and a player can choose to play exactly one of these tokens after looking at their cards. These tokens let you look at another player's hand, swap your hand with the Goze, double your points, etc.&#10;&#10;The lead player plays a card from their hand, then each player follows, with the highest card played winning the trick, then leading to the next trick. If a samurai (a red card) is played, then each other player must play a samurai, if possible. Otherwise the game has no required plays. An &quot;old fool&quot; played on its own is worthless, but if a second or third &quot;old fool&quot; is played into a trick, then the player of the last such card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;Players earn 1 point for each trick won and 1 point for capturing the 16. A player who took no tricks loses 2 points. After 5-9 rounds, depending on the player count, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Britain and Operation Sea Lion&#10;&#10;After the defeat of France in the spring of 1940, Britain alone remained in the war against German aggression. Follow-ing their triumph on the continent, the Germans organized and trained their forces for the campaign they hoped would win the war: the invasion and conquest of Britain. With the British army only slowly recovering from the tremendous loss of equipment it suffered during its hasty evacuation from France, the defense of Britain lay with the Royal Navy and, especially, with the Royal Air Force. For if the German Luftwaffe could drive the RAF from the skies of southern Britain, then the German armies would have a fair chance of crossing the English Channel and bringing the sparsely-equipped British ground forces to battle.&#10;Their Finest Hour is a two-player game recreating the military situation facing Britain and Germany in the summer and fall of 1940. At 16 miles per hex, the maps cover the entire British Isles plus northern France and western Norway. Each player controls the air, naval, and ground forces committed to the invasion or defense of Britain. Air units are based on groups of about 40 aircraft; naval units represent flotillas of destroyers and individual capital ships and cruisers; ground units are scaled at divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. The rules use the basic Europa game mechanics as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in detail.&#10;&#10;This box contains the following game components:&#10;&#10;    two 21 x 27 maps&#10;    1,200 die-cut counters&#10;    a complete set of rules&#10;    chart set&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing Time: up to 6 hours&#10;Number of Players: 2 players&#10;Complexity: Master&#10;&#10;Original Design: Marc W.

At each turn, you take 2 actions: move a totem of your choice (X or O) as many squares as you like, but always in the same row (horizontally or vertically), then place one of your pieces with the same symbol as the totem played, on a free square orthogonally around the totem's new position. You can only move a totem if you still have pieces of the same symbol in reserve, otherwise you will be forced to play the other totem.&#10;&#10;The most original aspect of Oxono is when a totem is completely surrounded. You can then play the totem over the surrounding pieces, and if you land on another encircled square, you can place your piece anywhere on the board. Note that you can use your opponent's colour to win by aligning symbols. The turnarounds are surprising for a game that lasts only 15 minutes and the replayability is maximum. The game feeling is very satisfying and the desire for revenge is immediate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description form the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You'll be shocked at how much fun you can get from thirteen little cards.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of four cards, leaving the last card face-down in the middle of the table. This is the secret victory condition of the round. Sometimes you want the lowest number in play, sometimes you want the highest number in hand... there are thirteen unique victory conditions possible, all based on highest or lowest number, either in play or in hand, and sometimes specifying black or white numbers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, you have some clues in your hand to help your process of elimination. Your hand of cards lets you deduce that these will *not* be the victory condition for the round. Your goal is to deduce a victory condition while also trying to meet it. And time is tight! You only have a few turns in each round to figure it out.&#10;&#10;There is one more brain-burning twist: If you're the dealer, you know the secret victory condition! The other players will closely watch your choices for clues! You could try throwing false leads to get the other players on the wrong trail. You'll have to be really clever to keep everyone in...

It is the seventh game of the Great Battles of the American Civil War series which includes Pea Ridge, Drive on Washington, Wilson&#039;s Creek, Cedar Mountain, and Jackson at the Crossroads/Corinth.&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation of the battle of Pleasant Hill, fought in Louisiana in April, 1864.  The Union Army was attempting to move up the Red River valley to Shreveport where it was overrun by a small Confederate force at Mansfield. The Union Army then retreated to nearby Pleasant Hill and took a defensive posture... on April 9, the Confederates attacked.&#10;&#10;Each Game-Turn represents 20 minutes of real time, each hex covers about 125 yards from hexside to hexside, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun.&#10;&#10;Included are a 22&quot;X34&quot; mapsheet, 200 counters, standard rules for the 'Great Battles' series, exclusive rules, and player charts and tables.&#10;&#10;Not a simple game... there are more than 20 pages of rules which include extensive rules for cavalry, artillery and line-of-sight, morale, and fire and melee combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is based on points earned by eliminating or demoralizing units and through capture of certain geographical objectives. The difference in points between the Union and Confederate players determine the level of victory.&#10;&#10;",

They will also need to supply 4 six-sided dice and a pencil.&#10;&#10;Your mission in each adventure is to locate and defeat the six enemies that dwell within the realm. Players roll four dice and must assign each of them to one of the four places on the adventure sheet (Movement, Enemies, Treasures, and Locations).&#10;&#10;MAP &ndash; One die must be used to explore the map. Each side of the die allows the player to shade in a certain shape of hexes on the map. When a number is shaded in in front of location, the player may attempt to battle the enemy there and secure the treasure that resides there.&#10;&#10;ENEMY &ndash; One die is also used to increase the power of an enemy. You must choose to either make the enemy have more health or deal more damage. So as the game progresses your foes will gain in power, so you need to balance how powerful you want them to get with how big the treasure horde is there.&#10;&#10;TREASURE &ndash; Another die is used to increase the size of a treasure horde by shading in the next square in the corresponding treasure. All sorts of helpful items can be had including swords, shields, and potions, but sometimes moving down the treasure track will add obstacles like traps or locks.&#10;&#10;LOCATION- The fourth and final die is used to increase the power level of a location. This both increases the amount of gold there and the power of the enemy. Whenever a star is shaded in on the location tracker you must shade in a box on the enemy residing there.

    "Description": "Warsaw Rising Up 1945-1980 is a board game for 3-5 players, where participants take the roles of Polish urban planners, architects, engineers and builders &ndash; members of design and building studios functioning within the Bureau for the Rebuilding of the Capital. They face the challenges of restoring Warsaw destroyed during World War 2, bringing back the city&rsquo;s prestige and importance in the fields of administration, culture and industry.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to rebuild Warsaw after the war and develop the city. The players have to get concrete, use the materials acquired from the debris of the destroyed Capital and various social funds that were used in reality during the rebuilding of Warsaw. However, not only the reconstruction itself is important, but also the appropriate location of the objects on the city map and competent delegation of the members of one&rsquo;s studio to work. One of the several tactical elements of the game is managing the project cards and workers. Using their extra abilities may be the key which will benefit one player and make the work much harder for another. But even for a moment they should not forget about acquiring building materials from prefabricated elements and building new panel blocks.&#10;&#10;The game covers the period of thirty-five years, so in subsequent stages many various tasks appear. They are related to political doctrines, tendencies in architecture as well as the general economical and developmental situation in Poland in the given period. But the most important feature of the game is that each time the players are able to rebuild Warsaw in a different way from this known from history. They decide whether the historical rebuilding plan will be realized and where &ndash; if at all &ndash; the Palace of Culture and Science will stand. The players also have an access to the plans that were never realized, both from the Six-Year Plan and later urban development concepts. The game includes a futuristic element, too &ndash; the players have plans of two subway lines at their disposal. Such plans actually existed in post-war Warsaw, but they were never realized due to economic problems. In this game it is possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the elements of Diplomacy that makes it so unique is the writing of orders for your pieces and then the simultaneous resolution of the move for everyone.  Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each tile contains a white arch and a blue arch, and may be oriented in three ways such that the corner colours are the same for each rotation.&#10;&#10;White starts by placing two adjacent tiles, then players then take turns adding two adjacent tiles such that edge colours match neighbouring tiles.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who forms a surrounded island of their colour containing at least one arch. If a move forms winning groups for both players, then the mover loses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Space Station Zero, a miniatures-agnostic tabletop wargame where you and your friends explore the hidden depths of the ancient station to uncover its darkest secrets... and perhaps survive. Designed to play solo, co-op, or as an adversarial skirmish game, Space Station Zero is created by Adam Loper and Vincent Venturella for 1-4 players&#10;&#10;Use any sci-fi miniatures you'd like to explore the massive and mysterious space station you and your crew have found yourselves in after an unsuccessful hyperspace jump. Enjoy a deep campaign system with a branching mission structure and overcome all challenges - and learn the truth of Space Station Zero.&#10;&#10;The players gather 5-9 miniatures to be their crew, building stats for each one based on the type of crew chosen (Medical, Science, War, Shipping, Pirate, Exploration). This crew is used to explore the unknown sections of Space Station Zero. Each turn or challenge represents exploring one compartment of the station and contains varying opponents or environmental dangers that must be overcome (some chosen by random die rolls). Rolling for each activation, the player moves their crew into the compartment. If activation fails, the AI opponent then begins to move against the player. Once the challenge is overcome there is a choice of next challenge. This branching adventure moves through the two dozen challenges allowing for a different experience each game.&#10;&#10;The game can end horrifically with the death of the entire crew (permadeath is a real thing in this game), or the crew can come to the end of their particular branching narrative.&#10;&#10;A winning play of Space Station Zero is accomplished by successfully overcoming each challenge along the branching path that unfolds during the course of the campaign.&#10;&#10;",

You have to be careful not to miscalculate because the dwarves cleverly build all kinds of useful things for their village from each resource during the production phases. For every gold coin a new dwarf comes to the village, for every stone a wall is built, for every combination of wood, stone and beer a tavern is built, and so on. Since the forest clearing available to you as a building site is not the largest, you must plan well in advance so that there is enough room for everything in your dwarf village. Of course, the wishes of the inhabitants must also be taken into account, so there is a lot to plan for your own dwarf village.&#10;&#10;",

After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).&#10;&#10;Some of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing. At the beginning of the game, border plots are the key; later in the game, control of lakes and large masses of tokens are at a premium. The scoring values vary over the 4 rounds considerably.&#10;&#10;",
