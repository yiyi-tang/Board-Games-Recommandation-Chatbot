    "Description": "The game box contains two compact discs with 60 pre-recorded horse races with commentary by a featured horse racing English celebrity commentator. Also contained are a pack of 60 starting prices cards, a betting slips pad, scrip (in various denominations), a pack of race cards numbered from one to sixty and a results pad &amp; pen.&#10;The object of the game is to accumulate the most cash by placing &amp; winning bets on six races. &#10;A player is selected as banker/bookmaker and hands each player (including him/herself) the same amount of starting cash.&#10;The first race commences with a starting price card from the relevant (shuffled) pack turned face up for all players to see. This will show each of eight individually named horses together with their starting prices for either a win or a place (second or third) as an odds expression. Each player is issued with a betting slip and now decides how to place bets given the information odds provided by the starting price card turned up. When all bets are placed, the banker collects the betting slips &amp; cash from each player and turns up a card from the previously shuffled race number pack. This will indicate which audio track of the two compact discs will be played for this race (track 1-60). After a full audio commentary of the race is heard, the race commentator will announce the winning and second and third placed horses. The Bookmaker writes down the named horses on the game pad provided in order to facilitate paying out the winning players at odds shown on their betting slips. After all bets have been settled, the next race commences in a similar fashion.&#10;At the end of the sixth race the player increasing his/her original capital by the most amount, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Irish tafl game variously spelled Fidhchell or fitchneal or fithcheall is the subject of much debate. The variance of spelling simply reflects the non-standardization of Old Irish [Gaelic] pronunciation and therefore spelling. When pronouncing these names, one should realize that a e or i which occurs in combination with another vowel is generally not pronounced separately but indicates only that the adjacent consonant is slender, which is to say palatalized. The h is used as a mark of lenition (a kind of consonant mutation that appears in many languages) or aspiration and hence th becomes roughly pronounced like the same letters in English &quot;think&quot; and the ch as in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;. Just to add to the confusion of names, the name in modern Irish Gaelic means Chess.&#10;&#10;Some scholars say the name referred not to any tafl game but in fact to a form of Latrunculorum. Others say that the name was used for the diceless form of Tawl-Bwrdd, a Welsh game believed by some to have included dice.&#10;&#10;If this name does refer to a separate game, it would be a game played on 9x9 not 7x7 grid. The basic rules are described  here but this site leaves out several details. Namely, if the king is by the center square so that an opposing piece cannot be placed on that side of the king, the the king can be captured by being surrounded on only three sides rather than four and similarly, if the king is beside a defender, the attacker can do same thing, i.e., simply place pieces on three sides in order to capture the king. The site does mention that only the king can either land on or pass through the center square but not that attackers move first. There is also a stub article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchneal on wikipedia which concurs on the initial placement of pieces. Notably the corners are occupied which emphasizes that the king need only reach an edge of the board, not necessarily a corner, for the player playing the defenders to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Some scholars say that the Welsh name Gwyddbwyll originally meant the same tafl game played in Ireland under the name Fitchneal. Like the latter, the Welsh name has confusingly come to mean Chess in modern Welsh. Most other scholars however disagree that this is the same as the Irish game which was played on a 7&times;7 grid.&#10;&#10;Two opinions exist among those who maintain that the name Gwyddbwyll refers to a purely Welsh game. The Wikipedia Gwyddbwyll page describes chess at the top of the page, and this game below, referring to it as Gwyddbwyll Geltaidd to avoid confusion. It notes however that the game is properly called merely Gwyddbwyll, the longer name meaning merely &quot;Celtic Gwyddbwyll&quot;. This website also shows the initial set-up and gives a brief but incomplete description of the game in Welsh. The game according to this opinion is played on 9&times;9 grid and the object for the defending player is to get the king to a corner. Rules are otherwise presumably like Brandubh.&#10;&#10;The alternative opinion that the game was played on a 7&times;7 grid is described at Celtnet. The initial set-up described there may be slightly speculative, but again it is believed that the other rules not described there were identical to Brandubh.&#10;&#10;",

Linguistically this makes sense but evidence is otherwise scarce. The game was definitely played on an 11x11 grid and a diceless version is described at http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html. The dice if used would as noted above either have determined if a player got to take a turn or how far he could move a piece.&#10;&#10;",

Players begin in the pre-existence and are either born as a member or non-member of the Mormon church. They then proceed through earth life, death, judgment, Paradise or Spirit Prison, the 2nd coming and Millennium, and finally gaining eternal glory in one of the three levels of heaven or being cast out into outer darkness.&#10;&#10;The game is fairly non-PC by today's standards and would probably not be endorsed by the LDS as non-members of the church are portrayed as sinners.&#10;&#10;The first person to achieve eternal glory is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The subject matter abstractly &amp; comically (for 1939, that is!) portrays the blackout period in England during the German bombing raids of early World War two.&#10;The pack of cards consist of five suits (Silhouettes, Fashions, Search-Lights, Views, &amp; Lights)and are numbered from two to twelve (minus the numbers six and nine)for the purpose of scoring. Additionally there five Black Out cards that provide the blocking element of the game and are valued at one point.&#10;Play consists of each player in turn playing a card from hand to table, face up, from the hand dealt (six cards for up to three players and five cards for four or five players). Each player builds a personal collection by adding either an identical number or suit to the card previously played. If a player is unable to do so, a card must be taken into the hand from the stock of cards not dealt. There is a blocking element of play by the use of Black Out cards which may be placed on an opponents pile in order to stop cards from being played on that pile and forces the player to play cards on other players piles. &#10;The first player to play all cards ends the round and each players played cards are scored. The game is played up to 200 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alea evangelii is  from the tafl family of games. The original name of the game is unknown. Alea evangelii is the first words of the twelfth-century Corpus Christ College manuscript 122, commonly known as Corpus Irish Gospels, which contains a description of the game. The game is believed to represent a naval battle and is played on a 18 x 18 game board. The description of the game states that it was invented at the court of King &AElig;thelstan of England (924&ndash;939).&#10;&#10;Each of the four corners and borders of the diagram is assigned to one of the four Evangelists. 67 pieces are derived from the Eusebian Canons: each Canon defines a number of pieces corresponding to the square of its number of columns. Pieces defined by a specific canon are grouped together on the board: such groups are labeled by a cross and the number of the corresponding canon.&#10;&#10;Four more pieces are painted in red (all the others are painted in black) and in the manuscript are mentioned as &quot;different men&quot; (varios viros): two of these four pieces are assigned to the Evangelist John (N14, F6), the other to Mark (N6, F14). The four &ldquo;different men&rdquo; are also labeled on the board as related to the passion of Christ.[8] One of the black pieces (E13) is referenced in the manuscript as &quot;the primary man&quot; and &quot;belongs to none of the evangelists&quot;; it represents &quot;the Unity of the Trinity&quot;, the one purpose of the four evangelists. Finally, &quot;the figure 1 in the middle of the alea signifies the indivisible substance of the Trinity, or the supremacy of the first canon&quot;.[6]&#10;&#10;The 16 pieces of Canon I form the diamond at the center of the board. Canons II, III and IIII, together with the four &quot;different men&quot; and the &quot;primary man&quot;, form the circle surrounding the central diamond. Canons V, VI, VII, VIII, IX are organized horizontally along the lines of the board. The four pieces corresponding to each of the four Evangelists in Canon X are placed in the four quadrants of the board (C14, Q14, C6, Q6).&#10;&#10;The manuscript mentions the existence of attackers and defenders, but the two sides are not differentiated on the diagram, which only presents the details of how the pieces are assigned to the four evangelists according to the Christian allegory which is the main subject of the text. In other tafl games the goal of the attacker is to capture the king and the goal of the defender is to make the king escape from the board, it has been assumed that this is the case also with the game on which the Alea Evangelii moralization was based.&#10;&#10;Games of the tafl family only have two kinds of pieces: a king that occupies the center of the board in the initial layout and a number of ordinary pieces divided between attackers and defenders with a 2:1 ratio. The &quot;dukes and count&quot; that appear in Alea Evangelii do not seem to fit this simple scheme. It is tempting to suggest that on his travels, perhaps in Rome, Israel may have heard of the new game just beginning to circulate in Europe, chess, with its comites, milites, and other pieces, and borrowed the idea of different ranks from that game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets one opportunity each turn to claim any unclaimed territory on the board, so there will be plenty of competition for the best land with the most abundant natural resources.  New territory is continually being discovered, so predicting the value of the real estate is difficult.&#10;&#10;Phase 3:  Each player may construct new buildings and upgrade existing buildings depending upon the size of her farmland and the number of adjacent resources she owns (fresh water, lumber, and stone).  Players may also relocate buildings (at a cost) to a square with more farmland.&#10;&#10;Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player laying tiles, claiming a territory, and building homesteads.  Players may compete for territory, seize an opponent&rsquo;s claim, or tear down an opponent&rsquo;s building.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of Antarctica&rsquo;s usable land and resources have been discovered.

Most cards are 1-10 number cards, but special cards include reversing the turn order, passing a turn, subtracting 10 from the total, adding 50, and setting the total to exactly 101.  Players lose one of their three &quot;101&quot; chits when they cannot play, ending the round. After multiple rounds, the last player to possess any chits wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game with no rules because it has so many.  A variety of cards from various games are shuffled together and divided amongst the players.  Failed collectible cards games are the preferred stock, but anything roughly card shaped can be thrown into the mix.  Players draw and play as they see fit, telling a collaborative story and trying to come up with an excuse to claim victory.&#10;&#10;There are a few guidelines:  On a player's turn, that player fills his/her hand to 7 cards, then plays 1 card...and does anything else justifiable by cards in play or in hand.  Additional cards may be played (even out of turn) whenever they seem appropriate based on their title, effect text, flavor text, cards in play, and any cards just played.&#10;&#10;For example, a player might play &quot;Smoking Man&quot; (X-Files CCG), giving you an excuse to play &quot;Smoke&quot; (Magic the Gathering CCG).  Another player discards your smoke with &quot;Wind&quot; (Towers in Time CCG).  The next player takes a turn, adding &quot;Bad Tequila&quot; (Deadlands CCG) and &quot;Desperate for Air&quot; (Aliens Predator CCG) to the smoking man, then eliminates him with &quot;blankout&quot; (Cranium Promo) due to drug overdose.  The controller of the smoking man tries to save him with &quot;A Second Chance&quot; (Wheel of Time CCG), but is thwarted by your &quot;Unanswered Prayers&quot; (Imajica CCG).  His hopes of winning with &quot;Be a Winner at Al's Tobacconist&quot; (a business card) are dashed.&#10;&#10;",

The video was produced by Ed. Arcade Movie Company in 1998.&#10;&#10;Are you curious about how gnomes live? Do you wanna know what kinds there are, and how they live? Find out with this game.&#10;&#10;This is based on the traditional &quot;Game of Goose&quot; board game. The game board consists of a spiral track with consecutively numbered spaces up to the number 63 with the starting point on the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to the roll of a die. The spaces are numbered and filled with objects that are specific to the lore of gnomes that you will learn about when you land on them. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a gnome is depicted. Landing on a gnome allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards, lose one or more turns, or be sent back to start.&#10;&#10;Ages 4-400. Includes VHS video, gnome board game, 6-piece puzzle board, 4 gnome hat pawns, and a white die.&#10;&#10;",

The game is for 2-6 players and takes 20 minutes to 2 hours to play.  The more players, the longer the game.&#10;&#10;There are many possible paths across the board.  There are hazards and obstacles along every path.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by die roll.  The person who is in possession of the &quot;Gem Die&quot; is allowed to roll two dice instead of the normal single die to determine movement.  All the other players must try to catch the one carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot;.  If the one carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot; is caught, the &quot;Gem Die&quot; magically goes back to the &quot;Gem Vault&quot;.  The action then shifts back to trying to acquire the &quot;Gem Die&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one person successfully brings the &quot;Gem Die&quot; back to the starting point or when someone scores a certain number of points by carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot; for certain distances across the board.&#10;&#10;The game is in an 18 inch long by 2 inch wide mailing tube.&#10;&#10;Contents:  Game container (mailer tube); game board (24&quot; x 18&quot; when unrolled); 2 opaque dice; 1 clear &quot;Gem Die&quot;; 6 playing pieces (clear and colored acrylic cubes); 20 glass point counters (smooth glass pebbles); 3 boat pieces (metal finishing washers, #8 size).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of the game is to collect as much money, love, and possessions as possible before you lose it all. The game can be played with 2-8 players.&#10;&#10;How to Start:&#10;Players choose their pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with $1500 (however the money can summed up to equal $1500 is fine. Ex. Two $500 bills and five $100 bills or three $500 Bills)&#10;&#10;All players start on the START space.&#10;&#10;Place all of the &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve Found True Love&rsquo; cards (8 total) on the &lsquo;Found True Love&rsquo; Space. Do the same for the &lsquo;Makin&rsquo; Money&rsquo; cards on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space&#10;&#10;Roll Dice to determine who goes first.&#10;&#10;After the first person is determined to start the game all players&rsquo; turns are random. After each play you must spin the bottle. When the bottle stops turning and the head of the bottle is facing someone that person goes. You cannot go twice in a row it must land on someone other than yourself. In the case of two players just go back and forth, no need to spin the bottle.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Once it is your turn, roll the dice.&#10;&#10;Move the amount of spaces as dictated by the dice.&#10;&#10;After you have moved to that space pick a card from the draw pile (the draw pile should consist of all cards that are not money, making money, or found true love cards). If you land on a space that says &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get scammed&rsquo;, you move to the large corner space with those titles on the board and DO NOT move off of it until you roll a &ldquo;6&rdquo; or higher by adding together both dice. Then you move only ONE space off of &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get Scammed&rsquo;. You can be sent to these spaces by either landing on them or drawing a card that sends you there, either way the rules apply.&#10;&#10;Follow what the cards tell you to do from there on out.&#10;a.    Put cards next to the draw deck that you cannot keep.&#10;&#10;b.    If you get a keepable card (ex. A house or car) and you already have it nothing happens just put it in the discard pile.&#10;c.    Re-shuffle the cards once there are no more left in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;d.    If you land on a corner space your turn ends there regardless of how many spaces you rolled.&#10;&#10;How to end the game:&#10;     Someone has found a true love card on the &ldquo;Find true love&rsquo; space&rsquo;, they have a job card, a house card, and a car card, land on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space to get a &ldquo;Makin Money&rsquo; card, and make their way back to the Start space. When they have done all this they have won the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The counters used for bidding are divided amongst players who bid zero, keeping a closed economy for &quot;money&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a set amount of &quot;game-time&quot; has gone by which all players' games add to when they are completed.

A hand limit also forces players to sometimes put down cards onto the board. Corridors are 1 space narrow, and if you overtake another player, you have to give him/her a card. Also, if you realize you are the killer, you have to announce &quot;festival&quot; and kill everyone else on the board (by overtaking them) before they escape.&#10;&#10;",

As the storm rises, and the currents take a greater and greater hold of your ship, can you steer your way home, or will you be swept into an inescapable whirlpool, or off the edge of the world?&#10;&#10;Athene is a game for 3-6 players. The game is played on a grid of tiles. The tiles start off as calm seas, and players play cards to control the movement of their ship. But as the game progresses, the tiles are turned over to reveal the currents, and the players have less and less control of where their ship goes. The longer a ship stays at sea, the more valour the captain will earn, but ultimately you have to get home before the seas become unsurvivable and your ship is lost.&#10;&#10;Due to lack of interest, JKLM have decided not to produce this game.&#10;&#10;",

I think that I&rsquo;ve succeeded on all counts.&#10;&#10;The design of GridIron Wars is what I&rsquo;ve come to term as Back to the Basics sports gaming. With the advent of the computer and the Internet, today&rsquo;s game designer has a wealth of data at his fingertips. Today&rsquo;s sports games are highly sophisticated and most are highly accurate as well. While a great many are outstanding designs, sometimes I feel like the &quot;fun factor&quot; has disappeared as the games have become more advanced.&#10;&#10;In GridIron Wars, every skill position player is rated to perform as they did in real life. You'll be able to compile full statistics for every offensive player. On defense, you'll be able to track individual player stats for interceptions and sacks for most seasons where the data is available.&#10;&#10;Defense plays a huge part in GridIron Wars, you'll &quot;see&quot; teams with great run defenses stuff the opposition with regularity. You'll experience the effects of team's with a great pass defense, or a lock down secondary.&#10;&#10;The game ships with a complete solitaire system that will select offensive and defensive play calling, as well as individual ball carriers and receivers. Or if you choose, you can handle all of the play calling yourself.&#10;&#10;",

The defensive side of the football is not neglected in Game Winning Drive, as you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; great defenses in action, and directly impact the game.&#10;&#10;As in real football, special teams play and turnovers have an impact in Game Winning Drive Football.

The dangerous Kick Returner&rsquo;s and Punt Returner&rsquo;s are a factor in Game Winning Drive. No other quick-play game covers all of the elements of football like Game Winning Drive.&#10;&#10;While other quick-play games give you a final result, Game Winning Drive tells the &ldquo;story&rdquo; of the game.

Also, unlike other quick playing games, Game Winning Drive adds many strategy elements to add to the realism and excitement of the game.&#10;&#10;Do you go for it on 4th down? Do you go for the 2 point conversion for the win, or kick the PAT for a tie? Do you try for an onside kick, or hope that your defense can shut down the offense for one final drive? With Game Winning Drive, the decisions are yours. There isn&rsquo;t another quick-playing football game in the market that allows your coaching decisions to impact the game.&#10;&#10;While your decisions may impact the game, your players on the field will ultimately determine the success of your team over the course of a season.

It is designed for a minimum 6 by 4 feet playing surface and uses ten-sided dice to resolve most of combat. Although Heresy is based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe using Epic scale miniatures, it is not authorized by Games Workshop, and any 6mm model range can serves as proxies.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are not based on any previous version of Epic. Counters, templates, and tables are downloadable. The game is meant to be as self-contained as possible.&#10;&#10;Heresy is available from http://www.netepic.org/EPICentre/Downloads/&#10;&#10;(Note: This link is dead)&#10;&#10;Heresy is now at this link: http://www.netepic.org/&#10;&#10;",

Each hole may contain some of the various golf hazards: bunkers, water, rough, trees etc. Three different games are described in the rules: novice, standard and handicap. For each golf hole, players select from several possible routes marked on the boards, study a club/distance chart to determine which club best suits the chosen route then roll a 14 sided dice to determine the accuracy of the shot (accurate, good, poor, hook/slice, fault). This repeats until the green is reached. Once on the green, separate charts manage the process of putting.&#10;&#10;The handicap version of the game allows chips to be won for good shots which can be played at various times during the hole eg to avoid bad rolls, negotiate hazards or make small advancements.&#10;&#10;Not so much an edit as an addition to the information. The designer and artist of this game was Eddie Solomons,not Eric as stated. He was assisted by his family who have happy memories of researching and dry running the game. One daughter, who was just 18 at the time was sent off to the patents office in London, England, to research the design of the then innovotive multisided dice based on a golf ball.How do I know all this? I am that daughter! Sadly, Eddie passed away on the 9th September 2011 aged 86. It was kinda nice to see his game remebered on the internet. Unfortunately, when his grandson arrived at his hospital bed to show him, he was already starting to slip away. Thank you,all the BoardGameGeeks, for immortalising part of the eccentric late Eddie Solomons.&#10;&#10;",
