    "Description": "Wargame Rules 1685-1845 (for Miniatures)&#10;&#10;The biggest innovation is the introduction of an alternate play system developed from that used in our very successful World War Two and Modern Armour rules instead of the more recently fashionable simultaneous movement in accordance with detailed written orders. Its main advantages are that it saves the time spent order writing, eliminates disputes of the &ldquo;If you do that, I do this&rdquo; type, simplifies interactions between the two sides, places less strain on players honesty, and largely makes umpires redundant once players know the rules thoroughly. The special sequence of play we have devised eliminates the inherent disadvantages of more primitive alternate move as opposed to alternate play systems.&#10;&#10;The more innovatory a set of rules is, the more unfamiliar it is going to be to the players. Please dont write in blaming us for departing from accepted methods; after all it WAS us that invented them. It is possible that in spite of our testing anomalies will start to rear their ugly heads as more and trickier players become involved. If so, they will be cleared up with one of our usual free amendment sheets. We are in any case happy to answer rule queries enclosing a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. Our test games have made us confident that the new system is a winner and will probably become the war-gaming standard. Let us know how you get on.&#10;&#10;By adopting alternate play and an apparently simple &ldquo;bang you&rsquo;re dead&rdquo; combat system, we have been able to introduce a little more complexity elsewhere in the rules without overburdening the poor players brain too much. This includes a new method of choosing terrain based on actual battlefields, a command structure incorporating brigades, divisions and if you like corps, consideration of the personalities of individual generals, and a simple but very effective method of discouraging telepathic heroism and ensuring realistic conduct by units, including provision for differing national characteristics. The net effect is to give the player the sort of variety in his games previously provided only by ancient wargaming.&#10;&#10;We take the RESEARCH part of our name seriously, and it is because of this that you will find many of the basic assumptions in our former set have been changed. In particular, study of contemporary drill books in the Ministry of Defense library has convinced us that the movement rates specified by us (and universally copied by our competitors) were wildly out. This led to changes in ground and time scale that were ultimately of great benefit to the rules. We must also mention Brigadier B.P. Hughes whose two recent books made an excellent starting point for reconsidering the whole question of weapon lethality under combat conditions.&#10;&#10;The extension of our period back to 1685 enables us to take in all Marlborough&rsquo;s battles, starting with Sedgemoor, the Highland rebellions, and the early battles of Frederick the Great, in addition to the Seven Years War, War of American Independence, campaigns in India, French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars covered in the previous set. Although at first chary of such an extension, our research discovered no good technical, tactical or organizational reason against it. However, had we gone earlier than 1685 we would have had to contend with half armoured infantry and three quarter armoured cavalry, while to go later than 1845 sees the introduction of the Colt revolver by Texas Rangers in the Mexican War, of the Dreyse breech loading rifle by Prussia against Denmark and of the expanding bullet muzzle loading rifle, together with the replacement of rigid lines by thick skirmish formations, at first unofficial but later recognized by authority.&#10;&#10;As for the beginner, do not be overawed by the size of this rule book and its apparent complexity. Start by reading right through it, but remember that all the basics are incorporated in the single thick reminder sheet enclosed, so that you will only need to turn to the main rules when you need fuller explanation. You will find that after a while you can increasingly rely on your memory instead of even the reminder sheet. Try and keep it simple for your first few games, bringing in more troops and more ambitious tactics when you get the feel. The rules are designed so that actual historical tactics will be the ones that work best.&#10;&#10;",

(In the original version of the game, these objects were cards; in newer versions, they're castle towers that stick together magnetically.)&#10;&#10;Each player receives one color and one number, keeping these values secret since they form that player's combination. Play starts with one player asking the player to the left if they have a certain color and number. If they have either of those values, they say &quot;yes&quot; and they become the next player; otherwise they say &quot;no&quot; and the question passes to the next player to the left to answer.&#10;&#10;When a player thinks they know an opponent's combination, on their turn they can name that player's color and number. If the guess is correct, that opponent is out of the game and the player gets another turn &mdash; but if they're wrong, they are out of the game instead and the wrongly accused opponent now has the next turn.&#10;&#10;As far as the rules go, that's it! How much do you talk to your opponents? Do you keep quiet or suggest questions for them to ask? Do you remind them who answered what, and if you do, did you remember correctly?! Are you spinning disinformation?&#10;&#10;",

Each of you have chosen a completely unique method of dealing with a particularly nasty bit of chaos that has been summoned and vow to prove your methods are the best.&#10;&#10;The player employing the mystic arts must manipulate a set of special double-faced tarot cards in hopes of arranging them correctly. Their goal is to arrange their cards in numeric (1/2/3/4/5) or alphabetical (A/B/C/D/E) order, from left to right. The very cards that they are arranging will also allow them to rotate, swap, and otherwise manipulate the order to their advantage. They win if they can properly align all of their cards before the Science player wins or their deck runs out.&#10;&#10;The player committed to the scientific method must be meticulous in establishing order from chaos. They pull dice from a bag, roll them, and place them on engine cards, with specific dice needed for each. They win if they can complete all 5 of their engine cards before the Seance player wins or their dice are depleted.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s not always a genteel competition, however, as both players have options that allow them to slow down each other&rsquo;s progress in this race to prove whose methodology is the most effective.&#10;&#10;",

Its elder trees can confuse the unwary and cause them &#10;to lose their way.&#10;&#10;The Seeker in the Forest of Wyr is a solitaire game lasting about 20 minutes. It needs only the deck of game cards, no dice or eurocubes required.&#10;&#10;To Win:&#10;The goal of the game is to finish one of six Quests randomly chosen from the Quest Deck at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;During each turn of the game you will choose one of the two bottommost row&rsquo;s Stage Cards - your Seeker&rsquo;s Path. Two of the goals (see next page) may make this choice for you. You must choose the card before you draw any cards to your hand.&#10;&#10;Each Stage Card on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path has a number in the upper left representing the Amount of Time you must take to overcome the card with the Abilities you have in your hand. The pointer icon next to the number shows whether you must have a total Abilities Number either great than or exactly one less than the Amount of Time needed.&#10;&#10;From the cards in your hand, discard cards to your Seeker Deck&rsquo;s discard pile, adding the Abilities Numbers in the upper left. of those you discard, to overcome the Stage Card you chose on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path. Be sure when discarding cards to keep their current orientation when placing them on the discard pile (i.e. the current Abilities Numbers should be oriented upward when placed face down on the discard pile.)&#10;&#10;The Magical Objects in your hand of cards can grant you special powers during your turn. You can play a Magical Object at any time during your turn. Discard them when you use their powers.&#10;&#10;If you are able to overcome the Stage Card it will either be removed from the game, temporarily grant you a temporary Abilities bonus or penalty, be set in a special pile, or be added to your discard pile depending on the card.&#10;&#10;End of the Game:&#10;When the Quest Card is drawn from the Stage Deck&rsquo;s draw pile, it is added to the Seeker&rsquo;s Path and play continues normally in its final phase.&#10;&#10;When the Quest Card reaches the bottommost row of the Seeker&rsquo;s Path (The Quest Card always has the highest Initiative Number when deciding what cards to move at the end of a turn) the game ends.&#10;&#10;2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards&#10;&#10;Best Artwork&#10;First Place&#10;&#10;Best Medium Sized Game&#10;Second Place&#10;&#10;Best Written Rules&#10;Second Place (Tied)&#10;&#10;Most Innovative Mechanic&#10;Second Place (Tied)&#10;&#10;",

You and your fellow players vie for control over the major cities of Britannia by spreading your mobs, collecting payouts, and using secret intelligence to advance your influence.&#10;&#10;Gangs of Britannia is a game that has been known to test even the strongest bonds between players. The game relies on a unique face down 'Prisoner's Dilemma' mechanism that determines between a deal or deception of your fellow players. If all players choose to 'deal', then they are all rewarded moderately and equally. If exactly 1 player deceives, the deceiver destroy enemy mobs and strengthens their own gang. But if more than one player deceives, then all deceivers lose out and those who chose to deal stay out of the fray. This prisoners dilemna mechanism is combined with secret information, where players have intel on bonuses and penalties in cities which they can use to their own advantage and also to mislead their opponents.&#10;&#10;In a game where luck decides little, carefully pick who you're forging deals and alliances with as betrayals can lurk behind the next card. One thing is certain amongst the Gangs of Britannia - trust is slowly built but quickly broken...&#10;&#10;",

Your hand consists of nightmarish aspects and you goal is to trade these with your friends. If someone can get a collection of similar aspects then they can master that part of the nightmare and contribute to your eventual escape - however each card that you receive in trade can force you to undertake certain actions, restrict who you trade with or limit how you can communicate. To make matters worse something is chasing you through the nightmare and you have to trade its card every ten seconds or be devoured. It's coming. Run.&#10;&#10;During set-up players choose a collection of nightmare types based on the number of players. This choice allows a group to include or exclude certain mechanics - so whether your nightmare will be an all singing all dancing nightmare is down to the exuberance of the players rather than luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;Escape the Nightmare is a challenging experience, with the average group losing a fair few games before their first victory. However the play time is quick and resetting for another go takes seconds. There are six difficulty levels to make the game accessible for groups of any level of skill and selecting different types of nightmare allows players to set the tone of their game to suit their preferences.&#10;&#10;",

The app includes a rather natty two-minute timer for each of the four themed zones of The Crystal Maze. There is an INCREASE TIME button, which allows an extra minute of time to be added for younger players.

The board depicts a tree filled with a square grid of movement spaces, which are gradually filled from the top with tokens representing acid rain. The players' pawns try to move through the remaining open spaces on the tree, ending their movements on a raindrop, &quot;flicking&quot; it off. Thus, it's a race between the accumulating raindrops and the players' collective ability to flick them off with clever movement plays.&#10;&#10;The rules encourage the players to discuss the options openly for each player's turn, and in fact they'll have their hands full defeating the acid rain together. Doing it alone is practically doomed to failure, and will cripple the other players, too. The level of difficulty is easily adjusted by varying the number of acid raindrops that fall onto the tree.&#10;&#10;",

A parchment manuscript has just been discovered, revealing the location of its gates. The city&rsquo;s immense riches described in the manuscript have inspired much desire and greed.&#10;&#10;As the head of a team of explorers and mercenaries, you have set up camp in the Paleo Archipelago. But other teams have also arrived at the scene.&#10;Protected by your mercenaries, your explorers are ready to launch a search for the keys that will give access to the city. It is up to you to take advantage of the archipelago&rsquo;s many reefs in order to stay ahead of your competitors.&#10;---&#10;In the basic two-player version of Paleo, players set up the 65 x 65 cm board with four central reefs, two sanctuaries for each player in the corners of the board, and five supplemental reefs placed according to various rules. Each player controls a team of five explorers and three mercenaries; you move these pieces by flicking them with your finger as in Crokinole. If your mercenary hits an opponent&rsquo;s piece, that piece is removed from the board; remove all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, and you win the round and score one point.&#10;&#10;The explorers are used to enter the opponent&rsquo;s sanctuaries and recover two keys that then allow the player to enter the gate of Paleo in the center of the board. (Any of your pieces that enters a sanctuary can be exchanged for another piece already captured by the opponent.) This victory is worth two points, and a complete game requires a player to earn four points to win.&#10;&#10;Rules are included to accommodate three or four players, in addition to rules for ten other games for 2-4 players such as hockey, a kayak race, and Capture the King.&#10;&#10;",

The second stage is similar to Poker with a smaller variety of valuable combinations: players bet on who has the best set of cards of the same rank. The third stage is played like the game of Stops (known under a variety of names like Newmarket and Michigan), where the cards have to be played in suit and sequence, the winner being the first player to run out of cards.

    "Description": "Yahtzee Frenzy Dice &amp; Card Game takes Yahtzee to the next level! Inspired by Yahtzee With Buddies, the popular mobile game, this family party game is a fast-paced, frantic dash to roll combinations shown on the cards. No shaker, no score pads--everyone rolls at once, makes as many combos as possible, and keeps track of their matches on their Dice Tracker card. Once a player has locked in a matching combo, they shout the fun name shown on the card such as &quot;The Spicy Burrito&quot; or &quot;Pair of Threeves&quot; -- and slap it before anyone else can. Power Up cards like &quot;Clumsy Roller&quot; and &quot;Dice Thief&quot; keep players on their toes with game-changing actions such as stealing a die from another player, or having opponents play with one hand behind their back. The Yahtzee game is easy to learn and quick to play, making it a great board game for family nights.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The twist is that now, proper names such as cities or celebrity names will now be allowed.  Other twists include &quot;playing words backwards or playing words unconnected to others on the board,&quot; Mattel said.  The game is a limited edition and will not replace the original Scrabble.&#10;&#10;Just like regular Scrabble, each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Not all precise details are known yet as Scrabble Trickster is due out in July in the U.K. only.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Capture: A Medieval Wargame is a game in which players use armies made up of Knights and Soldiers in an attempt to locate and capture one or more of the enemy crowns in enemy territory and safely return the crown to their home.&#10;&#10;Originally designed by first-timer Andrew Hunzicker way back in the 1980s, Capture was pitched to several big name companies but never saw the shelves. Only now is it seeing the light of day, having been given a beautiful makeover to help it grab the attention of gamers in 2015. Gameplay is in the style of &quot;Capture The Flag&quot; as you roll your dice to send your soldiers into the enemy's territory while also claiming cards from a deck that will hopefully give you the edge. Should you manage to steal an enemy crown, you'll race to return it to your own side of the board while also protecting your own, but watch out for the opposition forces that will swarm around you...&#10;&#10;Capture also comes with a unique element, adding a need for dexterity as well as strategy. Each game comes with a pair of catapults that allow you to fling boulders at the opposition forces, should you get the cards or dice rolls that allow you to do so. Knocking out a soldier will eliminate them, but it's not just the enemy that's under threat - should you hit your own forces, they will be eliminated as well!&#10;&#10;Capture is a game that works with a wide range of gamer types, from children who delight in hurling boulders across the board to take out their parents' pieces, to experienced gamers who want to take the strategy element to the next level, only occasionally throwing in the chaos of the catapult!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Damned Die Hard, the second game in The Glory Series, is a detailed, operational-level game depicting the conflict between Japanese and Allied forces in and around the Philippine Islands from December 1941 to May 1942.&#10;The game is designed for two players (but can easily accommodate additional players - a side might have separate air, naval, and ground commanders and/or multiple ground commanders, for example). The Allied player controls the US Army Forces Far East command and the US Asiatic Fleet. The Japanese player controls the IJA's 14th and 16th Armies and the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The Allied player must disrupt the Japanese advance, inflicting unacceptable losses on his opponent and denying him use of the Philippine ports and airbases for as long as possible. The Japanese player must quickly overrun the Philippines, allowing his forces to be redeployed for the campaigns to come in the Netherlands East Indies and The Solomons/New Guinea. Both players maneuver their ground, air, and naval forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;There are five scenarios in the game. These are:&#10;&#10;    Luzon is an introductory scenario designed to familiarize players with the core ground and air rules. No naval units or naval rules are used and the scenario is only 4 turns long. Play begins with the main Japanese invasion force already ashore on Luzon Island.&#10;    Invasion of the Philippines recreates the historical campaign for the Philippines.&#10;    The Philippines Reinforced explores how a somewhat reinforced Philippines garrison - based on accelerating scheduled US arms deliveries by about 1-2 months - would stand up to the Japanese assault.&#10;    The Philippines Fully Prepared posits acceleration of scheduled US arms deliveries by about 6 months, allowing for a nearly full-strength Philippine Commonwealth army to meet the Japanese attack.&#10;&#10;&#10;Bataan models the campaign for the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island using a special map at a scale of 1.6 miles to the hex and with play focused at the battalion rather than regimental level.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rule booklet&#10;    Two orders of battle booklets - the Japanese Order of Battle and the Allied Order of Battle.&#10;    Nine The Glory Series mapsheets (G7:NE, G7:NW, G7:SE, G7:SW, G8:NE, G8:NW, G8:SE, G8:SW, and G9).&#10;    Three counter sheets (G-9, G-10, and Europa universal marker sheet).&#10;    A set of ten charts for the play of the game&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players take the command roles of Robert the Bruce and King Edward II to lead their armies toward old-fashioned victory &mdash; medieval style &mdash; by inflicting damage on their opponent to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle.&#10;&#10;Scotland Rising is the first title in Worthington Publishing's &quot;PT-90&quot; game series, a line of wargames that can be played in 90 minutes. The eight-page rulebook has only four pages of rules and four pages of play examples, designer notes, and historical background.&#10;&#10;",

As with earlier versions of the game, players are presented with a claim or question, secretly vote yes/no to the claim, then guess how many people they think will answer &quot;yes&quot; to the claim. If one or more players guess correctly, they score points; if no one was correct, then the players who are only one off score; if no one was one off, then the players who were two off score; and so on. The first player to score ten points wins.&#10;&#10;As with Privacy: Scharf wie Chili, released in 2010 by AMIGO Spiel, Privacy No Limit features claims aimed an older audience, such as &quot;I've farted while making love&quot;, &quot;I've lied to my boss to get a co-worker in trouble&quot; and &quot;To survive, I would be willing to eat human flesh&quot;.&#10;&#10;Privacy No Limit includes 420 questions and 12 envelopes that are placed into the voting box secretly so that no one will learn of your lying, farting cannibalistic tendencies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In mid-1944, despite their rapidly deteriorating position, the Japanese launched a massive offensive in China. They had three objectives:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Open a land and rail route across China to their southern conquests in Indochina and the Dutch East Indies (and bypass the US submarine blockade along the Chinese seacoast), and;&#10;     Eliminate all the US bomber bases in China from which B-29s were targeting the home islands, and;&#10;     At a minimum, severely degrade Nationalist Chinese capabilities and best case, maybe even knock the Nationalists out of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;Operation Ichi-Go (&ldquo;Number One&rdquo;) was the largest ground offensive in Japanese history, with 500,000 troops, 800 tanks and massive logistics and artillery support. They used their tanks in armored divisions &ndash; the only time in the war they deployed such concentrations.&#10;&#10;Ironically, Japanese armies reached the goals that they set, but US airpower prevented them from using their land route to any great extent, and US victories in the Pacific gave the US plenty of other airbases to attack the Japanese mainland.&#10;&#10;However, the offensive made a huge difference to postwar Asia. The Nationalists lost important territory, including scarce industrial capacity and rice-growing areas vital to their economy. They also lost military prestige and an enormous number of troops, perhaps as many as 750,000 casualties, weakening their ability to fight the Communists. And fatally, in order to do the offensive, the Japanese emptied Manchuria, leaving defenses against the Soviets there very weak, and from areas in China where they had been containing Communist guerrillas, creating a vacuum that the Communists quickly filled.&#10;&#10;This two-player game has one side commanding the Japanese, and the other the Nationalist Chinese. A &ldquo;what if&rdquo; option allows for the exploration of the potentials of a massive US invasion on the Chinese coast (Operation &quot;Causeway&quot;), one of the many approaches the US considered before finally deciding to invade the Philippines instead.&#10;&#10;There is also a set of full solitaire game rules inside (by Steven Cunliffe) where the active player (as Japan) competes against the Nationalist Chinese side run by the game system.&#10;&#10;The game features nine monthly turns; units of maneuver are IJA (and US) divisions, with individual Chinese units varying in organizational size from divisions up to army groups. Most Chinese units are &quot;untried&quot; and only reveal their true value at the moment of combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer Ty Bomba&#10;&#10;Also includes a complete solo game using the same components designed by Steven Cunliffe, with the player commanding the Japanese attack against an automata Chinese defender.&#10;&#10;",

Six points is awarded for the touchdown and the player then kicks an extra point through his opponent's &quot;finger goal posts.&quot;&#10;&#10;Zelosport's version has a high gloss, durable, multi-colored playing surface designed very much like a real football field. It's actual size is 2'x4' and fits easily on most kitchen or dining room tables. The back side of the playing surface is covered in a non-slip material allowing the game to be played on most surfaces without constant movement.&#10;&#10;The paper football has been replaced by two very different objects. A one inch plastic &quot;slider&quot; with a small ball bearing inside is flicked down the playing surface for runs, passes, touchdowns and 2 point conversions. For kicking field goals, a three inch foam football is included. Also included with the game are two dice used by the defense to determine the play required by the offensive player, 8 rubber washers and a ball marker to mark the line of scrimmage and the score, down and plays completed, as well as a set of rules.&#10;&#10;",

The turtles are two-sided and have a different number of holes on each side, although always an odd number. On a turn, a player either takes a ball of any color, places it on an empty hole on a turtle, and moves that turtle one space forward in line (assuming it's not at the front) or moves one of his balls already on a turtle backward to a different turtle, leaving all turtles in the same locations. The game ends when all the holes are filled, and the winner is the player who has the most balls on the turtle at the head of the line.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Corvette Command is a strategic level solo narrative generating game giving you the chance to experience the worst that the Atlantic can throw at you while taking on the German U-boats. Your crew starts out raw and with basic skills which they get the opportunity to improve over the course of the campaign. Your mission is to protect the convoy from attack and success is measured by the scale of the losses incurred rather than by how many U-boats are sunk. If vital supplies are lost then this can impact on how quickly new technology becomes available to you such as radar and HF/DF detection.&#10;&#10;It is May 1941 and the Battle of the Atlantic is reaching a critical point. The Royal Canadian Navy has extended its convoy cover eastwards and the Royal Navy has pushed their cover west so that convoys are now escorted the whole way across the Atlantic. For the purposes of game play only these two forces have been combined and you command a single Flower Class Corvette all the way across the Atlantic. Although the &ldquo;Escort Gap&rdquo; has been closed the &ldquo;Air Gap&rdquo; remains. The escorts are still waiting for the arrival of ship borne radar and spotting surfaced U-Boats and keeping station on convoys in the dark and poor visibility is still reliant on the lookouts. Ship to ship communications is also via signal lamps and flags and occasionally by loud hailer. The game ends on 31st May 1943.&#10;&#10;There are optional advanced rules that enable you to play a quick set up one-off game or a two player game and introduce greater level of detail.  If you enjoyed Nicholas Monsarrat&rsquo;s book or film &ldquo;The Cruel Sea&rdquo; then don your sea going gear and head out into the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They are about to find that the legend is actually very real.&#10;&#10;Within the game, each player will represent a character trying to run away from the scary killer, which will be controlled by a different player every round. Scape is a matter of life and death, but as in a horror movie, Escalpo seems to be omnipresent , and one thing is for sure: HEADS WILL ROLL!!!&#10;&#10;In this game, players and killer choose actions among a pool of 5 different possible choices, which are the same 5 for every player. They may choose between &quot;Caress in the Tent&quot;, &quot;Meditating at the top of the mountain&quot;, &quot;Tell stories around the fire&quot;, &quot;Buy food at the Vending Machine&quot; and &quot;Ride a Kayak&quot;, those player that have chosen the same action as the killer are now hurt and give one of their life points to the killer.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, plauers will not retrieve their last played card. The killer, on the other hand, takes his played card back. Now he has all 5 action cards and players are down to 4 possible choices of action each.&#10;&#10;In the second turn o a round, the killer now chooses 2 of his 5 action cards, while players may try to survive with 1 out of their 4 cards. As it happened earlier, the players who play a action card that matches one of the action cards played by the killer, are now injured, and may handle one of theyr life points to the killer. The ones that managed to run, keep one their life point to theirself permanently, now.&#10;&#10;The round ends after the third turn, in which the killer may choose 3 of his 5 possible actions and the players may play 1 of their 3 remaining actions. After the third turn, the player to the left of the killer, will now assume the killer and the Round will happen the same as the previous one.&#10;&#10;The game ends ate the end of the round when every player have already played the killer once. The player with most life points, both surviving and killing, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Portuguese:&#10;&#10;&Eacute; f&eacute;rias de ver&atilde;o e uma turma de adolescentes est&aacute; num acampamento de arrepiar.

During your visit today, take a walk around the blocks to see how many cats you can find in Cat Town.&#10;&#10;Cat Town combines memory, hand-management and deck-manipulation, with players scoring points in three ways: finding cats, collecting items, and playing Travel notes cards. To set up, shuffle the deck of Cat, Item, and Action cards, deal two cards to each player, then create four or six &quot;blocks&quot; of cards, based on the number of players. On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then add the top card on that block to their hand.&#10;    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then reveal the top card on that block, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.&#10;    Playing an Item or Action card for the effect described in the text, then taking the action shown on the bonus icon.&#10;    Revealing a card at random from their hand, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each Cat in front of you as well as each pair of Items with the same name is worth 1 point. A Travel note played with three additional cards from the hand is also worth 1 points. The first player to score 6 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the active player chooses whether to add a card to their Journey row or to Rest and move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook row. Adding new cards runs the risk of revealing too many Hazards of the same type, which causes them to shuffle away all cards in their Journey. At the end of the game, each player scores the cards in their two rows. Stars earn points, while Skulls cost the player points. Any special abilities also apply, typically earning the player points based on specific placements or conditions. The player with the highest total is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Gain influence in numerous locations on the continent (the game map), send out groups of heroic adventurers and command ships on the high seas.&#10;&#10;Those who cleverly develop their influence on churches, magical societies and great lords will find themselves in a good position to assist their adventurers in the fight against competitors (and monsters) as well as convince the greatest heroes of the age to lend them their swords and wisdom. And last but not least, each secret organisation pursues its own agenda of intrigue in the Shadows of Power.&#10;&#10;The main gameplay is focussed around gaining a deck of cards, each of them representing regions on the map or powerful characters and then playing those cards to use the resources they provide - to recruit and move adventures, influence organisations and command ships. A major aspect of the game revolves around combining actions to make them more powerful and resolve them without spending too many turns - since every player has the power to dictate the remaining duration of a round!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, conflicts regarding the control of regions are resolved - an elegant majority system is used to determine the victor, but since conflicts are not resolved during the individual player's turns, everyone can react and have a small skirmish become a decisive battle for victory.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game features an innovative scoring mechanism that keeps the game free of bookkeeping hassles (all scoring is performed at the end) and also allows weaker players to catch up due to relative scoring systems.&#10;&#10;The game features many illustrations on the cards - dozens of characters of Dark Eye lore, organisations and regions.&#10;&#10;It is playable with 2-4 players as the basic game and there is a 5-6 player expansion available at launch.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Beyond Humanity: Astrominers&rdquo; is a board game for 2 to 4 players (up to 6 with an expansion) in which players manage competing groups of space miners extracting minerals from the asteroid belt. The challenge comes in planning how to manage your personnel and resources through a variety of missions to extract minerals and outmaneuver the competition. Build the wealth of your Corporation, and fuel financial and material success. Be careful to not be left behind, for to the victor go the spoils.&#10;&#10;According to the current scientific knowledge of potential space mining missions, players extract seven resources: Water, Xenon, Plasteel, Tungsten, Nickel, Palladium, and Gold, on three different types of asteroids: S-Type, C-Type, and M-Type.&#10;&#10;The game uses a collection of custom six-sided dice (7 for each player) with icons representing four types of workers: miners, automatons, geologists and inspectors.&#10;Workers availability is determined by the dice rolls each round, and a skillful management of those worker dice is necessary for effective resource extraction. Players draw Mission cards to their hand and then perform the Missions by placing the Mission card on the Mining Barge in the Dock and gradually filling its fields with worker dice. Order cards are first drawn to the player hand by placing a die with a geologist icon on the Refinery field, and then redeemed at the end of the round by paying the cost indicated on it to receive the victory points marked on the card. In addition, the game features a resource exchange, an Achievement set collection and a set of Executive Cards, providing more possible actions and ways to victory.&#10;Orders, Missions, Achievements, and gathered resources are the means to collect Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

(We have played it hundreds of times together, even in video telephone conversations.)  Graphics guru Patrick Tremoureux has used those to produce professional quality map and units.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game is: 1 day of real time per (10) game-turn(s), approximately 6 miles/10 kilometers per hexagonal space width, and brigade-to-division (8,000-15,000 men) unit scale, which amounts to 12 ground units on each side.

    "Description": "In The Sock Game, two teams compete to grab all the right items first &mdash; but it's going to be tough to find what you're looking for as each team has a large fluffy sock that has thirty tiny items stuffed inside it. On a turn, someone spins the spinner to see what the active players need to grab, then those people start digging. Whoever finds it first scores a point, and whichever team scores eleven points first wins (as long as they're beating the other team by at least two points).&#10;&#10;",

In each round, the players gamble to win a job, one player takes that job, then the other players play cards to stop them from finishing it. Along the way, they also try to bleed as much money from them as possible. After all, what are friends for?&#10;&#10;Jobs consist of a series of events, described on cards, which the player on the job must resolve with their ship, its contents, the cards in their hand, and whatever is in their stash. Along the way, all the players tell the tale of the adventure, describing how each card advances the scoundrel's story. Galactic Scoundrels is, more than anything, a storytelling game.&#10;&#10;",

In order to become a &lsquo;being&rsquo; of the afterworld, you must ensure that your mortal body is safeguarded and recognizable by your spirit. While your embalmers are well instructed on the methods of mummifying your physical body when the time comes, your pyramid is not yet complete.

However, being the first to place your Cap Stone does not necessarily make you the winner or indeed the greater Pharoah!&#10;&#10;You cannot place the Capstone without first placing all 9 items into the pyramid, and at least one God being tucked behind each item.

Spectators have gathered for the spectacle. Both sides are in for a shock as this will be the first major battle in a war that will last another four years and consume 600,000 lives.&#10;&#10;Now for the 150th anniversary of the battle, Worthington Games brings you, First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition. Players will take control of either the Confederate and Union armies, blue and gray wooden blocks with labels, on a mounted 22&quot; x 17&quot; map of the Manassas area, cards, and rules. The game will come with a certificate stating that it is a copy of 525 limited edition.&#10;&#10;First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition lasts nine turns, with each player receiving 8-14 cards per turn from an individual deck of 20 cards. Each turn is divided into a number of rounds, with players alternating rounds until both pass or both run out of cards; during a round, a player can play 0-5 cards, using each card for its movement point value or its action. After playing one or more cards in a round, the active player can attack a defender's units with adjacent, facing units. Each unit may move/attack or be attacked only once per round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score victory points for the opposing units they've eliminated as well as the victory point locations they occupy. Whoever scores more points wins.&#10;&#10;",
