This led to two battles, the first in April and the second in November. These became some of the biggest engagements of the Gulf War. The player controls Coalition forces while the game system controls the Opposition forces (the Insurgents), known in the game as OPFOR.&#10;&#10;This game includes scenarios for both battles for Fallujah, as well as a scenario allowing you to fight the entire campaign.&#10;&#10;Modern War #23, May-June 2016&#10;&#10;",

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Victory Lap Card. When played, each player puts their hand face down on the table and passes it to the next player. Only the player of the victory lap card gets to look at the hand in front of them, which they choose to either keep or pass. If they keep passing, the hands keep getting passed around, until the Victory Lap player selects a hand to keep. Play then continues with all players adopting the new decks they now have in front of them.&#10;&#10;",

With plenty of surprises around every corner, only the driver who knows how to react quickly&mdash;and carefully&mdash;will head home with a trophy.&#10;&#10;Building on the platform established by Turbo Rally Card Racing, THUNDER TRACK introduces a whole new level of strategy into the mix! Using your own 1:64 scale die-cast cars, race opponents along rally themed card tracks that you create. The cards are expandable so you can challenge unlimited players and build courses as simple or as big as you can imagine.&#10;&#10;On your turn, flip one track card over, and follow the signs as you race through jumps and obstacles toward the finish line&mdash;all while fending off attacks from your opponents. The first player to reach the winner's circle wins one of five trophies&mdash;and an advantage in the next race!&#10;&#10;But don't think for a second that getting to the Winner's Circle is easy. With over 30 RPM (Radical Performance Maneuvers) cards that allow players to boost ahead, burst through obstacles or sabotage opponents, THUNDER TRACK shifts racing strategy into high gear. Whether it's smokescreens and straightaways or pit stops and pace notes, the right RPM combo at the right time will keep your foot on the gas and your opponents off-track.&#10;&#10;If tire spikes and land mines can&rsquo;t seem to keep your fellow racers from taking the top spot in the winner&rsquo;s circle, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re also introducing 10 different weapons to choose from. Send your opponents skidding off track with a missile attack or drag them into the dirt and leave them stranded with a well-aimed grappling hook. But, whichever weapon you choose, you&rsquo;ll have access to unique special abilities and features sure to keep your opponents eating your dust.&#10;&#10;Think you've got what it takes to be a Turbo Rally Card Racing Champion?

Getting there was more challenging than originally thought. Only one climber will make it to the top. Will it be you?&#10;&#10;The Climbers: Family Edition retains the original gameplay of The Climbers with fewer components, resulting in a faster game experience while still accommodating 2-5 players. Also included is a special two-player variant, exclusive to this version of the game!&#10;&#10;Each player has three tools at their disposal: short ladder, tall ladder, and blocking disk. Your goal is to climb to the highest level of the mountain. To help with your climb, you may move and rotate blocks. Ladders can be used to climb large distances. Your blocking disk prevents other players from using a specific block. Use your tools wisely and at the right time to make the best possible moves in your adventure to the top!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Union General Joe Hooker had just completed a brilliant strategic maneuver, trapping Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Hooker's failure to follow up this stroke not only enabled Lee to escape the trap, but also allowed Lee to inflict a tactical beating on the Union Army. Unfortunately, Confederate casualties made theirs a Pyhrric victory.&#10;&#10;This wargame is part of the Quadrigame &quot;Blue & Gray II: Four Civil War Battles&quot;.

Inside the box you will find the two teams reaching the Champions League Final in the last year. TABLE UEFA is one of the few board-games on soccer able to well represent the real atmosphere of a soccer match! Players can move on the field passing the ball, shooting, creating pressure, fouls and even being expelled. The match is really fast-paced, realistic, and as a coach you can decide the final result by using the best tactics. TABLE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS A GAME FOR FAMILIES BUT IT'S SO realistic that its simulation level will also capture the imagination of gamers.&#10;&#10;The game is played taking turns: each turn the team owning the ball rolls a red 6 sided die and consequently moves a miniature on the field. The defending team concludes the turn with an alternative movement of 2 squares in order to mark the attacking miniatures. Each attacking miniature is marked when it has from 1 to 6 opponents in the next squares and its movements are always diminished by the same number as the opponents that mark him. The defender can then try to steal possession. Short passes are possible within 4 squares from the ball possessor and long passes and shots at goal are performed by rolling 2 white 6-sided dice. For saving shots, the goalkeeper will roll the same dice and compare the results. Special cards add tactical possibilities to any match development. The game is easy to learn and the marking rules with the alternative moves make it very similar to a soccer match: therefore any familiar playing styles are applicable.&#10;&#10;",

Somewhere there are the fuel tanks you need. &#10;Can you find them in time?&#10;&#10;Aim of the Game!&#10;In this solitaire game, you must find three rocket fuel tanks and return to your spaceship before your spacesuit runs out of oxygen or battery power. If either of these levels drops below 1 during a systems check, you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play!&#10;The deck of Map Cards (30 cards)&#10;The deck of Event and Equipment Cards (21 cards)&#10;1 Suit Card showing your remaining oxygen and battery power + 2 Tracking Cards which also include the Quick Rules Guide&#10;1 Astronaut, 1 Spaceship, and 3 Fuel Tank counters&#10;&#10;Setting the Game Up!&#10;Shuffle the Map deck and deal the cards out face down in a 6 x 5 grid, there will be 5 rows of cards, each row will have 6 cards in it.&#10;&#10;Find the card on the grid with the Spaceship icon on it and turn this card over to the other side, placing your Spaceship and Astronaut on it.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game!&#10;Each turn of the game will consist of 3 phases:&#10;&#10;Phase 1. Movement&#10;At the beginning of your turn you must move your Astronaut, from the card it is currently on, any number of cards in an orthogonal direction (this means up or down, left or right). The first two cards in distance you move you may do so for free. For each additional card you move during the turn you must lose either 1 level of your Oxygen or 1 level of your Battery Power. Move the Tracking Cards down the Oxygen or Battery tracks as needed to record this. You may change directions as you move (i.e. 1 card to the left and then one card up). You may never move diagonally.&#10;&#10;You are trying to find, using your spacesuit&rsquo;s equipment, a series of numbered beacons (in pairs) which will locate where the 3 Fuel Tanks are stored. These beacons give you a set of coordinates (one beacon points up and down, the other points left and right). You will need to locate the pair of matching numbered beacons and then move to the card the beacons point to. In the example to the right, X marks the spot where one of the Fuel Tanks is located.&#10;&#10;Phase 2. Events and Equipment&#10;After you have finished moving you must now draw 3 cards from the Events and Equipment deck. This deck has two types of cards.&#10;If this deck is empty when you go to draw a card, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck to draw cards from.&#10;&#10;A. Event Cards - these cause you to lose Oxygen or Battery Power due to your exploration.&#10;B. Equipment Cards - these cause you to gain resources you need (Oxygen and Battery Power), as well as give you special actions to help in your exploration.&#10;&#10;Keep the Equipment cards in your hand from one turn to the next. You will need a pair of the same cards to gain the listed bonus. You may have no more than three Equipment cards in your hand at the end of the Events and Equipment phase.&#10;&#10;Phase 3. Systems Check&#10;You must now check your Suit Systems. If either your Oxygen or Battery Power level is below 1 you have lost the game. Do not forget that you may spend a pair of matching cards at anytime during the System Check phase (Phase 3) to gain the listed bonus, by placing the cards on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game Background: &#10;You and your fellow Alien Lieutenants have fallen out of favor with the Supreme Leader, Qlepptar, after your terrible performance on the last plundering mission in the Andromeda Galaxy. Now the opportunity for redemption has arrived with the announcement of the next target &ndash; Earth!&#10;&#10;Your alien race &ndash; The Frantrexxians &ndash; exist for one purpose&hellip; to travel the cosmos in search of precious metals that can be pillaged from planet after planet. The method is simple: knock off the species on the top of the planet&rsquo;s food chain by implanting destructive weapons inside a lesser species. In the case of earth, that would be humans and cows, respectively. Once the greatest local species is eradicated, alien crews can easily swoop in and take all the planet&rsquo;s mineral treasures.&#10;&#10;For decades, scouting missions have come to earth to capture and probe these unfortunate bovines. Armed with the basic knowledge of these four-legged creatures, you must now work with the Frantrexxian scientists to find the most efficient and powerful ways to turn these animals into weapons of mass destruction! The most successful player will become Qlepptar&rsquo;s new First Officer!&#10;&#10;Object of the Game: Destroy the most earthlings by capturing and weaponizing cows, and releasing them back to Earth to inflict mass destruction!&#10;&#10;Game Play: &#10;Once Earth and The Mothership are set up in the middle of the playing area, players are dealt 7 action cards. They then take turns drawing 1 card and taking 1 of 5 actions:&#10;&#10;     Research a Cow Weapon.&#10;     Discard 1 Card or Swap 3 for 2.&#10;     Recruit or Steal an Alien Scientist.&#10;     Operate the Tractor Beam.&#10;     Steal a Cow Weapon Research Card.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will research cow weapon types, then use the tractor beam to capture and weaponize cows, and release them back to Earth to inflict damage. Damage is determined by both the amount of research cards in their weapon stacks, the rolling of damage dice, and skill points for Alien Scientists in the players possession.&#10;When all the Earthlings are wiped out (or no more cows are left in play), the game is over. Players count the number of Earthling Meeples they collected plus the +2 Extinction Bonus token (earned by the player who wiped out the last Earthing), and the player with the greatest total wins - and gets promoted to Qlepptar's First Officer!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players are adventurers seeking gold in an abandoned mine. Each ventures into the mine equipped with a lantern (with a limited amount of oil). The outer ring of hexes can be searched for additional equipment (torches, oil to refuel the lamp, mushrooms...) whilst the inner hexes are where the gold is to be found. First player to bring back six gold nuggets wins. Or,if all adventurers are killed, the player whose spider has scored the most kills wins...&#10;Finding gold isn't as easy as it seems; the richest hexes (smack in the mine's center, of course) only yield gold on a 4+ (on a d6); using the lantern gives a +1.&#10;Where it gets really fun is with the mine's other denizens: each player controls, in addition to his adventurer, a spider that hops from rock column to rock column (the pivot points where hexes meet; the board is 3D so this works really well) spinning webs --little cardboard barriers that slide into place between rock pillars. Adventurers &quot;attack&quot; the webs when they try to step through and could stay tangled (the adventurer pieces are slotted so they can be put on top of the web they're stuck in). Whilst thus caught, spiders can try to bite them --four bites and you're eliminated! The lantern is very useful in such a case as its light scares the spiders away.&#10;The spiders can co-operate to build stronger webs, and it isn't unusual for one spider to strengthen the web an adventurer is caught in so another spider has a better chance of biting him.&#10;All in all, a very enjoyable game. Works best with the full set of six players.&#10;&#10;",

There are also Non-Candy cards which can be used to avoid winning a trick and King cards which have powers that can change how the trick they are played to works.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has reached at least 31 points.

    "Description": "Vier zu mir! (Four to Me!) is an award-winning children's memory game in which the goal is for players to find sets of four animals that match those shown on their search cards.  Once a card has been matched, it scores a point for the player, and the one with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game includes a set of 24 unique plastic animals, 24 green tubes (film cannisters), and 24 search cards.  One animal is hidden in each tube, and these tubes are then distributed evenly among the players.  Each player is also given two &quot;search cards&quot;; each of these cards depicts a set of four of the animals.  Players try to locate all of the animals on one or both of their cards by asking other players for the ones they need.  If the acting player asks someone for an animal they are holding, that tube is passed to the acting player; as a reward, they can continue asking for more animals.  However, if the player they asked DOES NOT have the animal, the player's turn ends.  Once a player has all the animals needed to complete one or both of his search cards, he can reveal the card(s) and the animals to score 1 or 2 points.  Completed cards are set aside and replacement cards are drawn until no more remain.  The game ends once all 24 cards have been matched.&#10;&#10;Vier zu mir! was originally published by Altenburger und Stralsunder Spielkarten-Fabriken (ASS) in 1996, and won the Kinderspiel des Jahres in that same year.  In 1998 it was reprinted by Schmidt Spiele, and recently (2002) it was published again in a French edition by Tactic as &quot;Animazoo&quot;.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decision Games website:&#10;&#10;At the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the Israelis could only spare two brigades to defend the strategic Golan Heights. On 6 October the Syrians attacked with five divisions, three of them mechanized, supported by mortars, artillery, mobile SAMs, and a heliborne commando brigade. The Israelis were therefore badly outnumbered, but were quickly reinforced by reservists (much sooner than the Syrians had anticipated). More significantly, the Israeli Air Force appeared overhead to impede the Syrian assault. However, the Syrians' surface-to-air missile batteries proved at least partially effective against those aircraft. Thus, among other things, the battle for the Golan would test the preeminence of air support against the ascendancy of the SAM.&#10;&#10;Golan utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. But Golan also introduces a new element to the battlefield: surface to air missiles. The Syrians fielded numerous SAM batteries during their advance, downing many Israeli jets and compelling that air force to implement new tactics. A single armor battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy commando brigade defending a fort. As that attack gets underway, though, the air support may find itself under fire from a mobile SAM battery. More support will be necessary to take the fort, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Golan the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the Yom Kippur War. Winning is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;",

Most games are playable in a hour. Even with six players, the rounds are quick. The movement mechanics are designed to feel more like driving and less like geometry.&#10;&#10;Players select their vehicles from eight templates that represent a wide variety of vehicles from dune buggies and muscle cars all the way to heavy duty trucks and SUVs - each with its own unique characteristics. Players then use dice to further customize (and arm) the vehicles. The dice represent weapons, equipment and even the driver of the vehicle.&#10;&#10;Play is centered around a maneuver deck that allows the players to 'program' their action for a turn. Programmable actions include both movement AND attacks. But players need to be careful, their drivers may not be able to handle EVERYTHING demanded of them resulting in a possible loss of control.&#10;&#10;Games are scenario based with clear goals to keep the games shorter and focused. Scenarios include such situations as busting through a police roadblock, attacking a renegade compound, escort missions and more. Teams are used, allowing the players to be creative in their vehicle (and equipment) selections. Some vehicles may be better for certain tasks but it always handy to have someone riding backup.&#10;&#10;Players can check here on BGG, as well as dicefestgames.com for info on development, new vehicles, new equipment and new scenarios&#10;&#10;",

The Christian player controls the Christian kingdoms except when a &quot;War among infidels&quot; event gives the Islamic player control of one Christian kingdom's units for that turn.

    "Description": "From Avalanche Press:&#10;&#10;For over 700 years, Spanish Christians tried to exterminate the Arab kingdoms of southern Spain. This great &quot;Reconquista&quot; fired the crusading zeal of countless generations. The Arabs, or Moors as the Spanish knew them, saw the Spaniards as backward barbarians and fought ferociously to protect their sophisticated civilization. Finally, in 1482 King Ferdinand of Aragon embarked on the last campaign, to take the fabled city of Granada from its Islamic rulers.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing, physically beautiful game re-creates the final 10-year struggle for Granada. Players take command of the Christian and Moslem holy warriors. God is on your side. Will you prevail? &#10;&#10;Granada is a two-player game based on the 1481-1492 campaign between Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castille on one side (the &quot;Spanish player&quot;) and Muhammed XII and later Muhammed XIII on the other (the &quot;Moorish player&quot;). The game's designer is Robert G. Markham, known for Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide and dozens of other game designs.&#10;&#10;The game is not overly complex. The game board (mounted, 22x17 inches) shows southern Spain including the Kingdom of Granada and surrounding areas. A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.&#10;&#10;Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.&#10;&#10;In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, you'll choose which faction to play as and then set up the appropriate location to attack. Whether you're playing as Peter and his allies or Hook and his crew, you'll then assault your foes' base of operations, drawing cards to search every nook and cranny for lost boys, fairies, and pirate treasure, while positioning yourselves around the board to bypass or fight off your enemies. Combat and actions are resolved through a dice system that determines what you can accomplish each turn. As the Peter and his allies, the game is won when you rescue all of the lost boys aboard Hook's ship. As Captain Hook and his crew, the game is won when you capture all of the lost boys hiding in their camp. In either case, the game is lost when your foes defeat enough of your characters!&#10;&#10;",

Each Player takes part as a Jarl in charge of his own Viking Settlement on the fictional island of Fj&ouml;rnheim.&#10; Goal of the game is to regain the Favour of the Gods. To do so you will have to raid towns and villages in order to gather resources to construct new buildings in your settlement, as well as recruiting new warriors and building new ships.&#10;&#10;Every game starts with the summer raids, the so called &quot;Vikingfahrt&quot;. All Players pick a village to attack with their starting unit of Nordic Warriors. Afterwards they fight, following the intuitive battle system of fixed attack and defense stats combined with dice rolling. &#10;In case of success, the players get to loot the village for treasures by drawing one of 35 unique loot cards, this is the main income the Players have throughout the year.&#10;&#10;Back home in their Viking Settlement, the Players make use of their new gained fortune, recruiting more warriors, bringing sacrifices to the Gods and starting to construct more ships and buildings to extend their settlement.&#10;From now on every season will start with the drawing of an event card, there are 60 different ones, and each one of them may bring you joy or pain, or something in between. Every card has it's own story, many of them are inspired by actual mythic stories and events of the time.&#10;Another important part of the game are the ways of the northern Gods. Their will is represented by 60 cards. By bringing sacrifices and certain events, the Gods will grant you their Benevolence. Other events or hostile fellow Players may force you to draw Wrath of the Gods cards. As in the event cards, every single &bdquo;Card of the Gods&ldquo; tells a story, many of them following real Norse mythology.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when one of the Players has collected 7 &bdquo;Favour of the Gods&ldquo; points and therefore reaches the Golden Gates of VALHAL.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Y&#197;&#141;kai Quest is a collaborative board game, heavily based in the classic mechanics of beat&rsquo;em up games and RPGs. Set in a fantasy, Japan-inspired world, the miniatures included are designed with &ldquo;chibi&rdquo; look; this means a cute way of design, with the characters having big and expressive faces.&#10;&#10;The players can choose between different heroes: the samurai, a monk, a gunslinger, a priest, and more. Each one of them has a unique set of traits: movement, attack power, abilities, etc. At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or having access to powerful attacks.&#10;&#10;The y&#197;&#141;kai are the enemies of the game: inspired in the ones from the Japanese folklore, these supernatural beings will follow &ldquo;behavior cards&rdquo;, so their acting is managed by the own players. Those will indicate in an easy to follow way what the y&#197;&#141;kai will do in each given situation. The y&#197;&#141;kai will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from their specific deck.&#10;&#10;Heroes and Y&#197;&#141;kai take turns to play: they will move, attack and use abilities while fighting in the tiled boards. The gameplay has a staged feeling, represented by the different scenarios. To advance, objectives must be accomplished: eliminate a number of specific enemies, surviving long enough, etc. This goes until the heroes reach the last board, where the final boss of the mission appears. To win the mission, heroes must defeat this powerful enemy.&#10;&#10;",

Explore the route and you will run into wild Rocos to battle and catch for yourself.  Train your Rocos and teach them new moves. Do you have what it takes to become a Roco Ranger?&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;To win Roco Ranger, you must win battles against rangers and other players, to become the new champion.&#10;&#10;Your Turn&#10;Before you start playing, you must choose a starter Roco. Roco Ranger consists of two distinct phases. The capture phase and the ranger phase. During the capture phase you first choose where you want to go on the map. You can go as far as you want but you can never go back. You may then choose to search for items, search for Rocos or rest. Dice randomly decide what you will find, however stronger Rocos can be found further down the route. If you search for a Roco you get to battle it. You can gain XP, to level up your own Roco or capture the wild Roco. The capture phase is all about building your team. Whoever reaches the end first gets first pick in the second phase. Rushing over the route can be a big advantage, however it might be a better strategy to take it slow and build a stronger team.&#10;&#10;In the ranger phase you will fight strategic battles with your entire team of Rocos against opponent teams. Just like wild Rocos, rangers have an automated move sequence (this allows for solo play experience). However unlike battles with wild Rocos, you will now battle two vs two and can swap and replace Rocos until a all Rocos of a team are defeated. Victory will give you the title of champion!&#10;&#10;",

The number of products that can be sold each round is limited, so only the players who set the lowest prices will be able to sell something and (maybe) earn a profit.&#10;&#10;Each player holds several action cards that can be used during the game to influence your chances of selling products or ruin the selling by other players.

Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Second Edition Updated RulesStackable Traits are no more! &#10;To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled.  Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.&#10;&#10;Trait-or-Fire!&#10;Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.&#10;&#10;Spicing Up Events!&#10;The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.&#10;&#10;Faction-Only Cards!&#10;Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).&#10;&#10;Module Overhaul!&#10;There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).&#10;&#10;Say Goodbye to Characters!&#10;Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.&#10;&#10;First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!&#10;We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;New Combat Mechanics!Initiative in Engagements&#10;Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.&#10;&#10;Attacker and Defender&#10;Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot.  So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.&#10;&#10;New Skirmish Phase&#10;The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish.  Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only.  No more extra turns for defenders!&#10;&#10;Boarding Actions&#10;Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order.  You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World at War magazine Issue 13&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Guards Tank: The Battle of Prochorovka, July 1943 (GT), designed by Joseph Miranda, is the first of our new East Front Battles Series. That series will present operational simulations of medium-to-large-sized battles fought during World War II on that front. There will be two players in each game, and solitaire play is easily doable.&#10;  There are two general types of units in the counter-mix: maneuver (non-artillery) and artillery. In addition, certain units are classed as &ldquo;armored.&rdquo; Individual units vary in organizational size from platoons to regiments.&#10;   The action in GT is focused on the Kursk offensive&rsquo;s southern front, as the SS Panzer Corps breaks through the Soviet main line of resistance, held by elements of 6th Guards Army. The German spearheads are then met by a counterattack from 5th Guards Tank Army. What followed was one of the more controversial battles of World War II. There&rsquo;s still historical debate about its significance. Some historians claim German tank losses here made it the turning point of the war in the east. Others say German losses were exaggerated; it was the Red Army that suffered massively, and the Germans actually called off the offensive for strategic reasons. Here is your chance to explore those interpretations.&#10;  Each hex in GT represents one kilometer (0.62 miles) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents a day. There&rsquo;s a nine-turn short scenario and a 13-turn long scenario. The rules weigh in at a little under 14,000 words. Two experienced players can complete the short scenario in about four hours. Rules cover such items as: reinforcements, replacements, command-control, zones of control, adjacent and ranged combat, first and second wave combat, suppression, anti-tank fire, airpower, weather, fog of war, supply, untried units, and special tactics.&#10;&#10;Originally published in World at War magazine #13 (Aug-Sep 2010).&#10;&#10;",

Each explorer dropped on a space earns money if a trading post of the same color is on the space, so other players may earn money on your move. Drop an explorer on a river crossing, and it washes downstream to the previous river crossing.

    "Description": "The Campaign for North Africa, 1941-42&#10;&#10;What, another North Africa game? Yes  but here is something almost completely different from any WWII Campaign game you've seen: no CRT (or any other tables), buckets o' dice, and cards  all used in a totally new approach to gaming that can be learned in 5 minutes and played in a few hours.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics for Blood &amp; Sand will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. However, Designer Richard Berg, no stranger to this campaign, has added to this accessible simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no sirree!&#10;&#10;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 27) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (The cards don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you're so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units, build fortifications, or bring in Reinforcements. The RP choices are theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent's) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement, to forcing the Allies to Withdraw units, to the effects of Rommel and other leaders.&#10;&#10;What the Players are Saying: Here are some the reactions from the Blood &amp; Sand play testers and rules readers:&#10;&#10;&quot;Very simple and very easy. No one should have a problem with the rules.&quot;  Adam Freitag&#10;&#10;&quot;I would hope to use it as an introductory wargame, but I am optimistic that it would be sufficiently interesting to keep experienced wargames happy as well.&quot;  Paul Marjoram&#10;&#10;&quot;This looks like a fun game  The added tension of the need to balance the use of RPs [Resource Points] for units, forts and cards is appealing - a good abstraction of the logistics concerns of the campaign.&quot; Edmund Hack&#10;&#10;&quot;Using cards in this manner may make for some very agonizing decisions - a good thing in a game. I also think the combat system is clean and simple, yet effective.&quot; Jeff Paul&#10;&#10;The rules for Blood &amp; Sand are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire, covering four scenarios, ranging in size (the two maps are used only in the full campaign game) and playing time Playing time for the Basic Game has averaged about 3 hours. 176 counters including the blanks).&#10;&#10;",

They come back as soon as enough mortals pray for them to reappear on the battlefield. The three tiers are interdependent. Gods lose power and actually cannot exist without the support of mortals. The strength of prayers, faith and oaths taken in the gods&rsquo; names is what keeps the gods going.&#10;&#10;Gods are the real powerhouses and keep the mortals fighting - without them, mortals lose heart.

The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to cross the Marne River and exit units southward off the map through the Surmelin valley.&#10;&#10;The first game turn of FB represents roughly the first two hours of operations after the Germans began crossing the Marne. Those operations were conducted in the slowing conditions of early morning darkness. Every game turn after the first represents from 15 to about 45 minutes, depending on the intensity of tactical action that takes place within each turn as the daylight battle unfolds.&#10;&#10;On the US side the units of maneuver are infantry platoons, along with static heavy weapons emplacements. The latter represent one or two dug-in and pre-sited heavy machineguns and/or 37 mm guns (&quot;one pounders&quot;).&#10;&#10;The German units are organized so as to be reflective of the chaos created among them by the intense US aerial and heavy artillery bombardment that was conducted against their north bank marshalling areas and bridges. That is, German units represent ad hoc, mixed, tactical formations (primarily storm trooper infantry), ranging in size from sections and squads up to almost full companies, which the Germans self-organized as they left the complete chaos of the riverbank and moved into the semi-chaos of the actual battlefield. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 yards from side to opposite side.&#10;&#10;The reverse sides of all the units in the game show carnage. That is, they present a depiction of the human wreckage remaining when units of these small sizes are eliminated in combat. Whenever a unit suffers that fate, players simply turn it over in place, so its carnage side thereafter shows upward within the hex of its elimination. When flipped to their carnage sides, units permanently cease to be &quot;units&quot; for all game purposes, thereafter serving only as reminders of the recent horror that took place in that location.&#10;&#10;Carnage markers have no combat effects or stacking values, nor does their presence in a hex generate any extra movement cost for living units as they enter and/or pass through the killing field. Alternatively, if your tastes don't run to an appreciation of carnage, you may choose to ignore the reverse sides of the units and simply remove each unit to a traditional, off-map, &quot;dead pile&quot; as they suffer elimination.&#10;&#10;",

The players can negotiate and try to persuade the others to deal with the rest of the events.&#10; Stage 2: Decision-making&#10;Beginning by the first player and clockwise, each player chooses one of his game cards and places it face-up on one of the events. This action must be repeated until all players have played all their cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stage 3: Scoring&#10;Once all the cards have been assigned, all the events must be checked one by one, analyzing the game cards placed on them.&#10;After checking the three events, the total movement of each culture must be calculated. Now check if any player has won. In this case, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

If a fruit is revealed, whoever first yells out how many of that fruit are on the revealed card claims the flipped card; if a number, players compete to yell out whichever fruit appears that number of times. Once you flip through the entire deck, whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can play with five fruit tokens and five number tokens. When you yell out an answer correctly, you claim the token that shows that answer, whether from the center of the table or from another player.

You are tasked to evacuate crew members from an exploding spaceship, taking them via pods to secure refuges on a nearby moon.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to rescue as many crew members as you can, taking them from the spaceship to the four shelters in some nearby moons. However, be careful: The combination of crew members in each shelter could make the escape not completely successful!&#10;&#10;Players will alternate their turns following the round in clockwise order. On their turn, a player becomes the active player. On each turn the active player can take up to two actions. To take an action, the active player must:&#10;&#10;     Place one of their available action tokens on one of the activation spaces on their action cards, marking the action the player wants to take. If the chosen action does not have any free activation spaces (without a token), the player cannot take that action.&#10;     Resolve the effect of the chosen action. This effect must be resolved in its entirety before taking a second action.&#10;&#10;&#10;After taking the two actions, the active player will take all their action tokens from the activation spaces for basic actions. In addition, if all three spaces for advanced actions (Board, Program, Pilot) have an action token on them, the active player also takes those action tokens.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing using the normal rules, until one of these conditions is met:&#10;&#10;     There are no spaces left in the refuges, or&#10;     There are no crew member on the pods beyond the barrier.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as one of those conditions is met, the game ends and players proceed to scoring.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the photo cards in three piles: pics of three animals, of four animals, and of five animals. Each player starts with a three-animal photo in hand, showing what the player wants to see. On a turn, a player starts by seeing whether she can make her photo with the current animal layout &ndash; that is, if the right animals are in the right order somewhere in the circle; if so, lays the photo down and draws another one. Then the player takes one of four possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Swap two adjacent animals.&#10;    Swap one animal with the top card of the animal deck.&#10;    Place the top card of the animal deck on the bottom of that deck, then reveal the new top card.&#10;    Return your photo card to the bottom of the deck, then draw a new one.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player can then achieve a photo card, she does so, drawing a replacement afterward. After a player has taken four photos of animal trios, she then draws from the four-animal photo deck; after completing three of those, she draws five-animal photos. The first player to snap a second photo with five animals in it wins!&#10;&#10;",

Bids are valued based on the size of a suit (e.g., three-of-a-kind beats two-of-a-kind, etc.), and if the size matches, you compare suits: Gold, Silver, Crystal, Marble. If size and suit match, compare a secondary bid (3 gold and 2 marble beats 3 gold and a silver).&#10;&#10;The highest bidder activates the card's special effect and adds it to their discard pile. (Eventually it returns to their hand and activates again when in a winning bid.) The winner of the bid also gets to add a room to one of their two towers, while the other players draw cards. Play proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;Each player's two towers must match one another. The winner is the player with the tallest lower tower.&#10;&#10;Unlike most deck-building games, you do not void your hand after your turn. Players who win bids discard their bids to build their towers, while other players draw cards.&#10;&#10;",
