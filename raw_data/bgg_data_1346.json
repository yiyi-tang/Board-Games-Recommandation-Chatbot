    "Description": "When you need big, bad and ugly it is hard to go past the ISU-152. This tank destroyer is designed to sit in a concealed position and destroy enemy tanks whilst being impervious to enemy fire thanks to a survivability stat of 2, Fortress, which helps to keep the tank safe when being shot in the side, and the benefits of being a Tank Destroyer which improves the tanks survivability when concealed. If there is one downside the ISU-152 it would be the relatively low initiative, but this can be improved by adding Situational Awareness to your radio operator.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The M4A1 Sherman (76mm), much like it&rsquo;s slightly less powerful brother, is one of the most recognizable tanks of World War II and can be counted on to perform reliably in almost any role on the battlefield. It bring a solid set of stats with a firepower of 5 standing out amongst the crowd meaning you can get away with little to no upgrades. Of course if you want to make a good thing better, then it is hard to beat a Vertical Stabilizer to give your tank an advantage on the move, whilst the Wright Continental R-975C4 engine that enhances your tanks initiative can benefit both M4 Sherman variants, as well as the &ldquo;yet-to-be-released&rdquo; M18 Hellcat (can someone say &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo;?).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Churchill VII takes more to put down than an angry elephant! The Churchill VII is also very interesting as it comes with a couple of great options to enhance the tank to your specific needs. Swap out to a Churchill VI turret and reduce your firepower, but gain the Fortress rule, or upgrade the gun to the OQF 77mm Gun Mk. II to gain an additional firepower at the cost of some of your initiative.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "nestorgames GP is a fast and furious racing game for 2 to 8 players, derived from Top Speed by the same designer, that simplifies many aspects of its predecessor (same mechanism, but using dice instead of cards) and also adds some fun twists such as special items or shortcuts. It is a tribute to the arcade racing games of the 80&rsquo;s, such as SuperSprint or Nitro.&#10;&#10;GAME OVERVIEW (please refer to the rulebook)&#10;&#10;The player with the highest qualifying value goes first in the pit lane, with the rest of the players going in the same order as they are sitting and counterclockwise.&#10;&#10;On your turn, if your car is belly up (you crashed on your previous turn) flip it over and pass the turn. You car doesn&rsquo;t move.&#10;&#10;Otherwise, roll one of your dice. Then you can opt to stop rolling dice on roll another one, and so on until you&rsquo;ve either stopped rolling dice or you&rsquo;ve rolled the same number twice. Notice that you can&rsquo;t roll more than 6 dice.&#10;&#10;One of these three things can happen:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You&rsquo;ve rolled the same number twice but the car is not on a corner: Your car does not move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     You&rsquo;re rolled the same number twice and the car is on a corner. You&rsquo;ve crashed! (see Crashing) Your car does not move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     You&rsquo;ve stopped rolling so you don&rsquo;t have repeated results: Add up all the values of the rolled dice and move your car forward exactly that many spaces along the track. Other cars don&rsquo;t block your movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;If your car moves and ends its movement on a non-corner space occupied by another car, you bump into it. Move that car one space forward. If, as a result, that car bumps into another car repeat the process. If a bumped car moves into a corner, it crashes (see Crashing). If there was another car (or more) on that corner then all of them crash on that space.&#10;&#10;CRASHING: When a car crashes, flip it over belly-up, take one of its dice and place it on its &lsquo;box&rsquo; by the side of the pit lane. You won&rsquo;t be able to use the dice that are in your &lsquo;box&rsquo; unless you Fix the car (see Fixing your car).&#10;&#10;Races are usually played to 3 laps, but this can be agreed upon. The first car crossing the finish line after that many laps wins.&#10;&#10;Additional rules include fixing your car (recover a die), using a shortcut once per race, picking up and using special items (bombs, wrenches, turbo boosters, rockets and oil spills), championships, teams,...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Valenrelm you play as a kingdom that is competing for domination of the land. Start the game by choosing which kingdom you will play as and the tactic and specialty you will start off with. Tactics change the way your armies move on the map and specialties give you a bonus in one area. You can change these during the game as the world map unfolds changing situations require new capabilities.&#10;&#10;There are two main decks that you draw from, the tile deck and the action cards. The tiles are used to explore the world and build the world map as the game progresses. This means the game has near infinite variation and no two games will ever result in the same world map. As you explore, you will encounter brigands who have come to inhabit the land of Valenrelm. Defeat them in battle and occupy the farms and villages they guard to expand your kingdom and gain the resources you'll need to recruit more armies and play action cards. Farms provide you with food while villages provide either iron, wood, or stone. There are also camps and castles that are used to recruit armies. The different types of armies have different abilities on the world map and are useful in different situations. Moving your armies on the map will allow you to conquer more territory.&#10;&#10;Action cards are used to give you a temporary advantage over the other players. Most of the cards cost resources so having a steady supply of them is essential. Some cards affect your armies, some affect the armies of other players, some have negative effects. Using them at the right time could tip the balance of power and help you achieve victory.&#10;&#10;When armies battle, the two players use their battle cards to play out the battle on the battlefield. Every player has the same battle cards unless they have chosen one of the specialized armies that has their own unique battle card. The cards are orders to the units in your army to perform a specific maneuver on the battlefield. The maneuvers each have their own offensive and/or defensive capabilities. Each player chooses their three cards for the center and left and right flanks and reveals the cards at the same time. You could order one of your units to charge at the enemy but if their unit used shield wall, the attack would be blocked. Another unit could flank the shield wall and defeat it. The battle mini games are quick, only lasting a minute or two. You could win, lose, or tie a battle. The result of the battle then effects what happens on the world map.&#10;&#10;You can win by occupying most of the settlements, all of the castles, being very wealthy, or destroying everyone else's settlements. Valenrelm is a dangerous place where your fortunes could change at any moment. How will you forge your path to victory?&#10;&#10;",

(He's offering the ORE-SOME style dollars, but we'll give him a 1 for 1 exchange rate because we're generous that way.)&#10;&#10;Now mechanically speaking, Sarsparilla makes DMML slightly more valuable than it should be, so it&rsquo;s not recommended in highly competitive play but it was just meant to be a fun little reference to our first game, ORE-SOME that we hope you enjoy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Included with Kickstarter pledge rewards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Tatts&quot; The Racecourse on the table is a simulated horse racing and gambling game from Australia published during the 1920's. Players consist of banker or &quot; Bookmaker&quot; and &quot;Punters&quot;. The Punters place tokens or cash on the names of horses on the playing board. These horses are given &quot;odds&quot; to win. The Banker then gives a large pointer a spin which has the horses names on the board and when it comes to rest the pointer indicates the winner. The banker then pays the winner according to the odds marked on the board. Punters can back more than one horse or the top three winners.&#10;&#10;From an Australian sporting perspective, Tatts has some historical interest. The horse names are Australian Champion Thoroughbreds from 1920 to 1921 with horse names synonymous in winning the richest races in Australia, such the Melbourne Cup, Sydney Cup, Caulfield Cup and Rosehill Guineas.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "That individuals with special abilities exist was discovered by Adam Weishaupt early on. He recognized the potential of his discovery and began to systematically track down the victims of witch hunts and provide them with a safe place to go into hiding. A secret society soon evolved from this undertaking, which Weishaupt called the &quot;illuminati&quot; and used to manipulate the balance of power in Europe to his advantage. &#10;When the Templars became aware of him, however, he saw himself forced to find a new place of refuge in North America, which was still shaken by the Civil War. Due to the change in government and the general unrest, it was much easier for Weishaupt to set up the secret society there that covertly intervenes in world affairs. Through the foundation of the &quot;Council of 13&quot;, the New World Order was born.&#10;&#10;",

The purchasing phase and the fair phase will be repeated, and the first player to win two gold medals in the Fair Phase will win.&#10;&#10;The bottle contains up to three materials, and the combination of the three colors can be used in various roles.

The more you play the more you discover the different strategies you can use to avoid the trolls, and be the first team to get out of the troll mountain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Khornate Blood Bowl teams often find themselves at a disadvantage in leagues due to their inability to put scoring touchdowns ahead of goring their opponents. Against all odds, the Skull-tribe Slaughterers buck this trend, believing that the higher they rank in leagues, the better calibre of skull they will be able to claim for Khorne. As a result, the Skull-tribe Slaughterers have made their extremely bloody mark in the NAF as one of the greatest teams around.&#10;&#10;Want a team that can both mutilate your opponent with ease, and score a good touchdown? Khorne teams have plenty of brawn and just enough brain to make it happen. Marauder Linemen are hardy enough to withstand plenty of punishment and smart enough to remember to pass the ball once in a match. Those who endure the brutal training regimes of Khornate teams become Bloodseekers. Impressively violent and single-mindedly bloodthirsty, they specialise in putting the opposition out of commission while offloading any erstwhile Blood Bowl balls to the team's Khorngors &ndash; houndlike Beastmen who are utterly intent on scoring touchdowns.&#10;&#10;The multi-part kit is comprised of 64 plastic components with which you can assemble The Skull-tribe Slaughterers, a Khorne team for use in games of Blood Bowl. The team is made up of six Bloodborn Marauder Linemen, four Bloodseekers, and two Khorngor. This box also contains two double-sided Blood Bowl coins, two turn and re-roll markers, four Blood Bowl balls, and a transfer sheet with 222 symbols and icons to customise your team with. This kit is also supplied with 12x 32mm Citadel Round slotta bases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is played on a tactical board and the purpose of the game is to defeat the rival kingdom by summoning creatures that move across the battlefield or by casting powerful spells.&#10;&#10;Esopya is also the name of a fantasy world.

It is a resource that allows people to grow and dominate others. Some defend their sources, others seek for new ones.&#10;&#10;You can build your own deck, with your own tactics, or play with a ready-to-play one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "White sandy beaches, the gentle sound of waves, and a well-functioning drug cartel: this is what the &quot;Isla de Cubaidos&quot; is known for &mdash; that, and its international superstar Dayana.&#10;&#10;But for you, the Caribbean paradise could soon become hell because the secret drug network that you have built up on the island is threatened by a public scandal: Dayana has disappeared on the island without a trace. Can you find out what happened to her before the police search party arrives and inspects your island?&#10;&#10;Masters of Crime: Rapture is a co-operative deductive murder mystery game in which players must solve puzzles, follow clues and make decisions to solve a case. They do this using the included deck of cards, twelve hidden realistic clue documents, and the Internet. Through a choose-your-own-adventure mechanism, players make decisions that influence the course of the game and lead to solving the case in the end. One by one, they enter different realistically designed locations and encounter the various suspects. Then they choose from three different ways to deal with the situation and receive points based on their decisions. Complex puzzles and escape room elements must be solved in order to progress further in the case.&#10;&#10;The game is closely intertwined with the real world, and players have to keep using traditional apps like Google Maps or Wikipedia to gather information. Email, detailed web pages, and cell phone calls are also part of the immersive gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Castle of Mind for Kids is the little sister of the Castle of Mind board game, designed to be played with kids from preschool and challenge even older ones. It's an exciting two-person strategy board game in which players are the first to try to get their lion to the cliff in the middle of the board by controlling various animal discs. Its rules are easy to learn, the gameplay is fast, the playing time is approx. 5-15 minutes. Perfect for an introductory strategy board game.&#10;&#10;The game board indicates where in the starting position the two players can place the discs for each animal. Once each animal disk is in place, the starting player moves one of their animal disks to a neighboring space. Players cannot move diagonally with their animal discs. Any animal can enter any field, but only a lion can enter the middle red field. Players take turns moving their discs, and if the animal moves to a square of the same color (corresponding to its habitat), it can chase an opponent's animal that is on a square of the same color.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to win: players get their lion to the cliff, or chase the opponent&rsquo;s lion. Or, if our opponent can&rsquo;t take a valid move, we win.&#10;&#10;Players need to be very forward-thinking and attentive, keeping an eye on the entire board to protect our animals while moving with them and our lion. It is an enjoyable logic-strategy board game that can be taken out again and again, which perfectly develops logical thinking, the ability to plan ahead, the ability to combine, the concentration of attention and social skills.&#10;&#10;",

Be inspired by history or choose a different path as you conduct actions,  grow the movement of supporters and ultimately win the vote!&#10;&#10;Suffrage is a card based board game about the iconic and pivotal struggle for women&rsquo;s suffrage in early 20th century Britain and Ireland. Each player takes the role of one of six historical women, all interesting and important personalities in the movement. The goal of the game is to acquire a large enough movement and persuade enough male MP&rsquo;s over at Parliament to support the cause of votes for women. The game consists of 110 cards and 60 custom suffrage supporter miniatures.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players choose 1 of the available action cards. Depending on what kind of action is chosen, some supporters will join the movement, while others will leave. Suffragettes for example will gladly join the cause, planting bombs and conducting sabotage, while Suffragists instead support peaceful actions, slow and steady. Similairly, the upper class women and the working class women support - and reject - different actions. It is up to the player to choose which path is most efficient, based on the available action cards.&#10;&#10;Once a large enough movement is gathered, the player goes to the Parliament, where - based on the size of the movement - a certain number of MP's (Members of Parliament) will either vote YES or NO to the demand of women's right to vote. A player wins the game by getting at least 10 YES votes.&#10;&#10;",

It was designed to reenact battles between the Ottoman army and the allied Christian forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. Gameplay is entirely based on strategy, with zero luck factor. In the case of 4 players, the game becomes semi-cooperative; two commanders are in charge of the same army forces, but the winner will be the one with the higher score on the winning side.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of two phases. In the first phase, players prepare for their planned operations behind the screens. The second phase is the combat itself, when the pre-defined commands are executed. The game ends when 50 victory points are achieved by any of the parties.&#10;&#10;Both armies are controlled by means of troop cards, which govern the operations of the &ldquo;troop towers&rdquo; representing the specific army corps on the board. Troop cards are double-sided: turning them over, players can develop troop capabilities and unlock more advanced features. The available options for movement and combat are determined by troop capabilities and terrain conditions. Certain terrain structures (such as bridges and tranches) can be built during the battle.&#10;&#10;The rulebook includes 4 real battle scenarios, but the modular board allows players to set up a custom play area, giving the game unlimited replay potential. &#10;&#10;&#10;A Kereszt &eacute;s F&eacute;lhold 2 vagy 4 f&#197;&#145;s absztrakt harci j&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely az eur&oacute;pai sz&ouml;vets&eacute;ges seregek &eacute;s az oszm&aacute;n hadak k&ouml;z&ouml;tti,  XVI-XVII. sz&aacute;zadi csat&aacute;k &uacute;jraj&aacute;tsz&aacute;s&aacute;hoz ad kereteket.

    "Description": "Men (Egyptian: Mn) is a 5,000 year old game from ancient Egypt. It is roughly contemporaneous with Mehen and Senet. One of the most mysterious of ancient games, only two partial boards have been discovered by archaeologists, along with a detailed tomb painting depicting the board layout and playing pieces, and one sculpture depicting players playing it aboard a ship. Game scholar and designer Zach Horton recreated a speculative version of the game and it was released in two versions by Pandora Games: as a deluxe boxed Kickstarter set with Mehen and later as a standalone game. This modern reconstruction closely follows the ancient evidence and produces a unique game with a trading theme wherein players send ships out on trading missions and wager on when they will return, while manipulating them en route in an attempt to fulfill their own predictions and foils their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a unique three-dimensional board, enabling playing pieces to be placed both flat on spaces and upright in grooves. This aspect has been re-created in the modern version utilizing a handmade wooden board.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player chooses on their turn from a number of different options, from gaining sticks to throw to obtaining movement banks that can be accumulated for later sprints, to sending a new ship off on its journey. No player &ldquo;owns&rdquo; any of the ships. Any player may move any combination of ships however they wish. Victory points are obtained by performing certain actions (setting sail, picking up goods, bringing goods home), as well as by correctly predicting how long a given ship will be at sea. Every time a ship sets sail, all players mark their prediction on a simple, but hidden, ledger. When a ship returns, predictions are checked against the actual results. Meanwhile, all players manipulate conditions on the board to try to make their own predictions come true!&#10;&#10;Any number of ships can be sailed in a game, but only 5 can be on the board at any given time. Only 5 cargoes can be picked up and returned to port during the game.  Once all have been picked up, &#10;ships can continue to sail, but do not pick up any cargo on the Foreign Port space (though they must  still pause there).&#10;Once all 5 cargoes have been returned to Port, the game ends.  After scoring that ship, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;",

These resources can only be obtained by requesting favors from the Keepers of the PANTACLE. There are 7 types of favors that provide either resources or powers whose effects will make your progress easier. Beware though! If another player has the right set of cards in hand, they can counter your request and bribe the favor away from you.&#10;&#10;To light a flame on the PANTACLE, players regularly need to sacrifice accumulated resources. The further players progress, the harder the PANTACLE resists and the more complex the game becomes. Indeed, a player who lights a flame receives a reward (resource, power) but also a curse, despite the sacrifice of resources.

    "Description": "Rumini - Haj&oacute;napl&oacute; (The Logbook) is a quick and thrilling card game which brings to life the adventures of Rumini and his friends from the popular storybook series. &#10; The game includes 32 scene cards, featuring some of the main characters from the book. But only 8 of these cards are used in each game; these are selected by the players using a secret drafting method, so nobody knows exactly which cards will be part of the set.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt character cards of lower or higher value. Each round, a scene card is flipped over. Players can play a card to the corresponding scenes in which the specific character appears. But choosing the right moment is crucial because character cards become more valuable in the later rounds! The question is whether there will be another matching scene coming up later! Otherwise, players risk penalty points for cards remaining in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the player with the highest score &ndash; ultimately the one who is most successful in playing the right cards at right moment.&#10;&#10;In the year of its release, the game was awarded the Game of the Nation 2021 (Orsz&aacute;g J&aacute;t&eacute;ka) joint professional prize in family &amp; party category, as well as the JEM Board Game Award (JEM T&aacute;rsasj&aacute;t&eacute;k D&iacute;j) in national development category by most popular Hungarian board gaming magazine JEM.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gyors &eacute;s izgalmas k&aacute;rtyaj&aacute;t&eacute;k, melyben Rumini &eacute;s bar&aacute;tai kalandjai elevenednek meg. 32 jelenetk&aacute;rty&aacute;t tartalmaz a j&aacute;t&eacute;k, ezek mindegyik&eacute;n n&eacute;h&aacute;ny Rumini karakter szerepel.

But if you press your luck&hellip;Papa is going to wake up and jump out of the cave, and you&rsquo;ll have to give away your goodies! If you can catch him with your &lsquo;bear&rsquo; hands, your goodies are safe.

    "Description": "Duel Trading Card Game is a realtime online card game where players assume the role of a powerful mage, casting spells and abilities trying to reduce their opponents HP to 0 to win the duel. There are no creatures or items allowed in the Tournament of Gods, so player&rsquo;s decks that they build consist entirely of spells and abilities. Duel is realtime, meaning there are no turns and both players receive 1 Mana every 5 seconds to use to draw cards and cast spells and abilities.&#10;&#10;Cast a spell by spending the amount of Mana listed as a gold number in the top right of the card and set the projectile sideways on one of the Spell Timers in the center of the field. Set it facing your opponents, as if it was in the air on its way to hit them. Your opponent then has 10 seconds to hit that incoming attack with one of their own, (and if the one that they use is double the ATK or more of the one it collided with it not only kills the weaker one but also continues on towards the enemy&rsquo;s HP.) or use a quick-play ability such as Blink or Reflect.&#10;&#10;Players make decks of 50 cards that have no other restrictions whatsoever, just a 50 card max, but they do also have something called a Type Mastery, which is a single type (card color) that they can cast for 1 less Mana and take one less Damage from. There&rsquo;s no limit to how many spells can be used against a single incoming attack, and there&rsquo;s no limit on how many can be played per turn, or how many cards players can draw per turn either, the only limit is how much Mana you have.&#10;&#10;",
