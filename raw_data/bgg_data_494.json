Each player controls a faction of rebels and is trying to get their faction to control five (of twelve) cities or three Royalist cities. Players receive production for their holdings, build units, move and fight, etc., in a reasonably familiar fashion. There are rules for supply and fairly elaborate rules for scouting.&#10;&#10;There are two unusual features of the game. One is that the Royalists take part in the game but are not controlled by a single player - when it is the Royalist's turn to build or move the player to the left of the last player to do something takes control of them. The other is that every turn has an alliance phase, in which the players may make or break alliances between their factions. The player order for each turn is determined by drawing cards, and all factions in an alliance move when one of the faction cards is drawn (the members may vote to wait for a later card rather than moving at the first opportunity).&#10;&#10;",

Players acquire wealth by buying and selling on the black market and correctly answering trivia questions about Soviet society and other Russian curiosities.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to weave their way through the three social classes and make it to Red Square. Players exchange their privileges to move to the next social level -- a concept that is known as nomenklatura in Russian.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;HEROES in Mythical Greece&quot; is a greek CCG (Collectible Card Game) that takes place in Ancient Greece. The game is heavily based in the greek mythology trying to be as faithful to it as possible.&#10;&#10;The players take control of a famous greek Hero and they play allies, locations, actions and equipment to assist him in his quests. The game can be played in two modes &quot;Duels&quot; and &quot;Quests&quot;. In &quot;Duels&quot; two players fight each other, trying each to eliminate the opponent by either reducing his life total or gaining enough fame. In &quot;Quests&quot; players try to advance their Hero, by taking him from his early age and completing quests in order to take fame and have him rise to become a living legend. At the same time their opponents try to stop them by playing monsters that will prevent them from completing their quests. The first one to reach a certain level of fame wins.&#10;&#10;Currently, only one set has come out, the first Rhapsody as it is being called, named Genesis. There are plans for more expansions in the following years.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Die Siedler von Hessen (The Settlers of Hesse) is the first in a new series of historical regional map expansions for the venerable Settlers of Catan line. The new line profiles famous regions of Germany during the Middle Ages, when Celts, Romans, and Germans intermingled.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Hessen celebrates the state of Hesse, home to Wiesbaden and Frankfurt am Main. Like Die Siedler von N&uuml;rnberg and the other historical expansions, it features a fixed map board. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.&#10;&#10;The rules of Hessen cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Hessen is followed in six month intervals with new additions to the map line, each adding a new German region. Next in the lineup are Die Siedler von Rhein, Die Siedler von Pfalz (Palatinate), and Die Siedler von Saar.&#10;&#10;Part of the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

The dealer goes first and flips over his top card from his pile onto the center of the table.  The other player flips over his top card onto the played card. If the player places on top of the pile a card with a number (Officers), he captures the pile unless his opponent can recapture them. Recapture is achieved by the player flipping over an Officer card in the amount of turns of the previous displayed numbered card. For example, if the player placed a &lsquo;Cop&rsquo; card which is numbered 3, then the opponent would have 3 turns to try and place on top of that card another numbered Officer card.  If he cannot recapture, his opponent gets to take all the cards in the pile.&#10;&#10;Stop Thief consists of 32 cards.  There are 20 thief cards and 12 officer cards.  The officer cards include 4 cards depicting each a detective, cop, and police chief.&#10;&#10;",

Large number of vehicles will use the main rules and the few specially for that scale. 15mm to 1/35 will probably be infantry combat with a few supporting vehicles. These will use the main rules, the few rules for the large figures and the matrix for receiving wounds. The matrix is designed so a man might be hit, wound and live to fight some more. The last part would be at a reduced ability. A man hit in the left arm can still shot a pistol with his right hand.&#10;&#10;",

You control the 6 guardian angels.  Your opponent controls the 6 demons (or the 6 messenger angels if your opponent prefers not to play the demons).  Players take turns moving, following the rules of movement, until one player has successfully moved all of his/her pieces to the opposite sides of the board.&#10;&#10;However, it&rsquo;s not that simple.  You can only move your piece on a tile of matching color.  Players flip tiles to match their piece.  You must find a way to clear a path for both your blue pieces and your orange pieces while trying to block your opponent&rsquo;s pieces in the process.&#10;&#10;Offering two styles of play, this game is sure to become a favorite among game players of all ages and skill levels.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone who finishes a correct Lulatsch within the same trun, gets the number of cards of his figure.&#10;&#10;The problem is to decide when to add which cards to your figure, as you have only one action per round deciding wether to draw a new card while discarding an old one (either from the drawpile or one of the discardpiles) or &quot;build&quot; your figure. And for example not all feet go with all legs as some have trousers and other have not.

This can be rather difficult, because 18 &quot;magnetic fields&quot; block the same number of routes. Besides moving his space ship during his turn, a player takes any magnetic field and places it on a new route.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A wargame about the final phase of Russian offensive in summer 1944. After the success of operation Bagration and destruction of German Army Group Centre, the Soviets advanced quickly towards the Vistula river and Warsaw. Already exhausted from the earlier fights and 500km advance the Russians encountered strong German forces pulled from the Italian front just when they were about to cross Vistula and capture Warsaw. At the same time the Warsaw Uprising began, complicating the German situation.&#10;&#10;The game uses the &quot;Wielkie Bitwy II Wojny 1939-45&quot; or &quot;WB95&quot; (Great Battles of World war II 1939-1945) rules designed to simulate large battles of World War II. Counters represent regiments (Germans) or divisions (Russians), one hex represents 2500m, one turn represents one day.&#10;&#10;",

This is a stop-gap game in the sense that is provides exciting passtime activity for children above ten and even adults. The point is that the game enables you to re-play four campaigns of the 16th century /they took place actually/ with a relatively high degree of faithfulness to reality. This game is not the usual simple one you play with dice, it requires brains, tactics and good strategic ideas. If there are two players, one is the commander-in-chief of the Turkish army the other one is that of the Hungarian one. They take steps on the battlefield /the table/ which is authentic both historically and geographically.&#10;While stepping forward - in line with their strategic ideas - they fight each other, protect or storm fortresses. In case of more players the countries may be divided among them, e.g. the players can be commanders of a Northern Hungarian castle or that of a Transdanubian fortress respectively...()&#10;We sincerely hope that this short piece of information arouse your interest in this type of game outstanding also in its design, and being the first of its kind - since historical strategic games are just about to be spread in Hungary...()&#10;&#10;",

Players' pieces represent the wagons of a bold family just arrived from the Old World and working to reach the west coast.  Performance is based not on how well any one wagon does, but on how well players manage all of their wagons.&#10;&#10;The game is played as a trick-taking game.  The goal of the game is to advance wagons as quickly as possible.  Every trick scores movement points.  These points propel wagons across the board.&#10;&#10;Every hand also features a hand evaluation step.  Bidding a hand correctly scores extra movement points.  Missing a bid scores nothing.&#10;&#10;Blocking is also an important element of the game.  By placing wagons on the game board&rsquo;s prime paths, players can force each other to either go around or give up some of their precious points to push opponents forward and out of the way.&#10;&#10;This game has been self published (at prototype quality) in an edition not to exceed 200 copies.&#10;&#10;",
