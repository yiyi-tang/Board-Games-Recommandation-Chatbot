    "Description": "It&rsquo;s Saturday morning, with the cartoons on the television and adventures running through your head. With grim determination, you pull back the elastic band and take aim. The tension builds and your fingers begin to tremble as the army man is centered in your sights.&#10;&#10;The plastic soldier stood still, believing itself to be safely in cover behind the couch leg. It doesn&rsquo;t even hear the snap of the elastic as he sails into the air from the force of the blow.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Elastic Warfare.&#10;&#10;Elastic Warfare is a ruleset for tactical miniature wargaming to be played with a standard set of army men and a set of rubber bands designed to be played in your existing living room.&#10;&#10;The ruleset is inspired by &quot;Little Wars&quot; by H.G. Wells in creating a ruleset for children and adults using toys they already own. The rules are extremely simple-to-learn utilizing only simple measurements and dexterity based shooting.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules add strategy, without adding complexity in the form of a tactical deck. Move as many soldiers as you want, but the more you move the greater the risk of falling for an enemy ploy.&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;     This ruleset does not require anything past a measuring device, a set of army men and a handful of rubber bands&#10;     It requires no specialized terrain, as it's designed to use your existing tables, chairs, and furniture as the battlefield. Or play on your tabletop using the included Tabletop-Scale rules.&#10;     Accuracy in this game is based on player skill with a rubber band and terrain is physically placed. This means combat is quick, and simple to learn even for children.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FIRETEAM: Tactics (FTT for short) is a tactical tabletop war game designed for small-scale battles with plastic brick models and figures.&#10;&#10;The action takes place in the near future where aliens are invading Planet Earth - or, as a matter of fact, anywhere you want it to, as long as there are battles involved. &#10;Gameplay is mission-based and allows advancement for any surviving characters, adding RPG-elements into the mix. &#10;There is no requirement for measuring tapes or rulers. Most dice rolls in FTT are made with twelve-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Except for the hexagon-patterned surface of the battlefield itself, which you can have printed on vinyl, canvas, or any other suitable material at your local printer, everything on the table is represented through plastic bricks and compatible figures. Units as well as obstacles and terrain pieces will look amazing, given you are a skilled enough builder and have some Lego or other brick building toys at your disposal. As one might easily figure out, there's a significant advantage over using traditional glued and painted miniatures in a game like this: When something falls and breaks (you know it WILL), there's no reason to suffer a nervous breakdown over the amount of elaborate work that went into it. Instead, putting things back together will take just a couple of seconds.&#10;&#10;Just like the building brick toys that inspired me, FTT is a modular system designed with expandability in mind. This means the core document will provide you with mostly basic rules, but other content, such as units, weapons, and missions, is kept separate, making it easier to customize the game and add more content. While you will quickly realize how accessible the creation of your own material is, I probably won&rsquo;t be able to resist providing you with extra content in the long run, as well. Expect more settings, scenarios, game modes, units, weapons, powers, and rule expansions from me in the future, as my building brick collection grows and evolves.&#10;&#10;Download your core rules PDF for free. I don&rsquo;t intend to make any money off this project, and I will do my best to keep fine-tuning and updating the rules and other downloadable files according to any feedback I receive.&#10;In addition to the core rules, you will need the following to play the game:&#10;&#10;     DIY printables: battle mat, stickers, unit cards, and weapon cards &ndash; included with your download&#10;     Unit spreadsheet: Required for creating custom units by yourself &ndash; included with your download&#10;     Dice: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, 20-sided, at least one of each&#10;     And last but not least, fitting plastic brick building toys to make the game pieces and matching figures. &#10;&#10;&#10;For the standard flavour the core rules where designed in mind with, I recommend using contemporary or futuristic-looking soldiers, aliens and robots &ndash; figures best found in various Lego sci-fi themes, such as &ldquo;Alpha Team&rdquo;, &ldquo;Exo Force&rdquo;, &ldquo;Space Police&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alien Conquest&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Galaxy Squad&rdquo;. Weapons and gear from third-party manufacturers such as Brickarms or Brickforge work like a charm on these.&#10;&#10;For best results, customizing figures by mixing and matching their components is key. Obstacles and other terrain pieces are simply built from bricks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer / publisher&#10;&#10;",

Like many families, our lives had become a bit disconnected &ndash; the kids (then 11 and 13) were glued to their consoles or tablets ?, and quality time together was becoming harder to find.&#10;&#10;One evening, we decided to shake things up with a family game night, and what followed was a memorable rollercoaster of emotions. ? There were moments of laughter , tactical alliances that formed and crumbled , some tears (mostly mine! ?), and a healthy dose of good-natured chaos.  We crowned victors , debated strategies , and dove right into another round or tried a new game. It was one of those nights that reminded us how much joy and connection games can bring. &#226;&#156;&#168;&#226;&#157;&#164;&#239;&#184;&#143;&#10;&#10;As we talked about the characters, silly names, and what we loved (or would change) about the games we played, someone jokingly said, &quot;We should just make our own game!&quot; ? That spark of an idea grew into a full-fledged family project, and, well&hellip; the rest is history.&#10;&#10;We dove headfirst into creating &quot;It&rsquo;s Been Emotional&quot;, pouring ourselves into every detail &ndash; the artwork , the characters ?, the game mechanics . Through countless drafts and revisions , we&rsquo;ve crafted a game that we believe is not only fun but also deeply relatable.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;re incredibly proud of what we&rsquo;ve created and can&rsquo;t wait to share it with you.&#10;&#10;Whether you&rsquo;re a family looking to reconnect, friends seeking laughs , or just someone who loves a great game, we hope &quot;It&rsquo;s Been Emotional&quot; brings you the same joy and unforgettable memories that inspired its creation.&#10;&#10;Thank you for being part of this journey. Let&rsquo;s play, laugh, and make it emotional!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;EXPANSION PACKSNew Characters &amp; Game Mechanics&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce 3 exciting expansions for It's Been Emotional, each bringing new complex emotion mechanics and 35-40 fresh cards to elevate your gameplay experience!

    "Description": "The Desolate Waste Campaign is a post-apocalyptic, science-fiction campaign designed to be used with a slightly modified version of Gruntz where we make extensive use of the specialists, commanders, and monster rules to allow for a more nuanced skirmish style game. A basic person or Crew Member will use the Gruntz specialist template with scout level damage capacity. &#10;Characters and Crew Leaders will use the Commander templates and abilities. Large monsters like dragons, large demons and inter-dimensional monstrosities will use the monster rules.&#10;The first thing you will need to do is create a Crew Leader and 2-5 Crew Members. &#10;You will need to generate their background, their class, goals and motivations and buy any special talents or abilities and their starting gear and weapons. You will also need to choose your groups initial allegiance to one of the many Power Groups.&#10;&#10;Your Crew will need to acquire food, water, clothing or armor, weapons, ammo and eventually transport and energy or fuel. Life in the Desolate Waste is a constant struggle for survival.&#10;&#10;The Desolate Waste Campaign is a set of rules for playing skirmish games in an original post-apocalyptic setting using the Gruntz 15mm ruleset. &#10;It provides 25 linked scenarios and a sample crew and crew leader as wella s a complete description of the Town of Crossroads. The Scenarios tell the story of Earl Moore and his road crew and their overthrow of the wicked Viola Chance while defending from an invasion from Precinct 8.&#10;&#10;The campaign setting also provides complete rules for surviving in the Waste, meeting contacts, performing jobs and complete descriptions and backgrounds of the 11 power groups in the Waste. There are also tables for random encounters in the Waste as well as generating salvage and job rewards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Rising Storm&#10;&#10;The representatives of a local preservation society from a world within the sector, called Heaven's Gate, have been working with the governments of Earth for the last two decades. These representatives have helped scientists from around the globe in understanding the very advanced technologies of the Synod of Worlds.&#10;&#10;As a result, the overall level of technology for the planet has jumped far ahead of what was predicted and the Earth is on the cusp of a new era of exploration and war. Planetary and orbital defenses have been manufactured non stop since the Prometheus Revelation. Planetary Defense Forts are littered around the globe on volcanic islands and barren mountain ranges in order to minimized collateral damage. Armies of powered armor, tanks and mecha fighting vehicles have been rolling off of the production lines and the men and women who will pilot them trained relentlessly in thier use. New tactics and weapons have been developed and the beginnings of a space navy are taking shape.&#10;&#10;The preservation societies cannot provide warships to the Terrans but only old and frail cargo haulers of various sizes. Many of these have been put to use building a naval shipyard in the asteroid belt. The first of many warships are not due to for completion for many months and even more months for shakedown and training of its crews. The rest of the second hand frieghters are being hastily converted, with some advisor's assistance, into heavily armed Q-ships and commerce raiders. A half dozen bulk frieghters are being converted into military transport ships and one enormous bulk goods ship into a fleet carrier capable fo carrying squadrons of drone fighters. The first Operation of this new fleet would be to establish a base in the nearby system of Alpha Centauri.&#10;&#10;The Alpha Centauri system lies on the main trade route and shipping lane through the sector. It is one of the many links in the jump chain between the Jump Gate worlds of Heavan's Gate and Lion's Gate. Jump sensors will be placed around the main jumps points and a ground base will be placed on the only habitable world in the system, Alpha Centauri 3a, nicknamed Plymouth Rock by the predominately American ground forces.&#10;&#10;The Alpha Centauri Campaign uses a Logistics Point and Intelligence Point system to represent the Tail of the military force you are commanding on the table-top and to give you a real sense of growing or depleting resources with each victory or loss. Intelligence Points earned represent the ebb and flow of information on the battlefield. In order to play another scenario you must spend Logistics and/or Intelligence points as you attempt to find, fix and destroy your enemy.  It is fairly simple and uncomplicated.&#10;&#10;The campaign is compatible with the Full Thrust, Stargrunt II and Dirtside II rules systems available for free from Ground Zero Games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reaping the Whirlwind...&#10;&#10;The naval portion of the Battle of Sentai is over and very costly. The carrier Enterprise went down with all hands fighting three Synod destroyers. Her fighters destroyed a Synod battlewagon and a heavy cruiser. The Ark Royal rotated the combined fighter groups of both carriers throughout the battle and kept them in the fight. Her own planes destroyed the three ships that had jumped the Enterprise and the combined groups claimed another heavy cruiser and a light cruiser before the day was out.&#10;&#10;The light cruiser Charlotte died duelling with two wounded heavy cruisers. She had already claimed a battleship with her initial salvo of capital ship missiles. The two heavy cruisers were so badly mauled that they attempted to disengage but were run down by the destroyers Tang and Skate. After dispatching one of the heavy cruisers it was chasing the Tang turned and exchanged fire with a light cruiser. It took hits to the engine room and bridge and drifted out of control into Sentai's atmosphere, all hands are assumed lost.&#10;&#10;Despite the losses we have secured the orbital space around the planet and the gator freighters have entered orbit. The Marines will assault the planet and neutralize the ground defenses in preparation for a larger landing by the Terran Legions. We plan to seize the spaceports and ground based planetary defenses before a counter-attack can be launched by the Synod through Hevan's Gate in the next system. This planet is the key to the sector. If we can hold this world, then the rest of the sector will be far more vulnerable and in no position to threaten Sol.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Twelve more scenarios recount the continuing fight for the Sentai System. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;The second volume is District Commander Binh Dinh, set in the jungles of Vietnam circa 1969. This is a period of transition that sees Government forces shifting their focus from pitched battles to providing population security and pacification. Mr. Train gives each player very different tools - here, we have rules for Agent Orange, the Phoenix Program, and the Ho Chi Minh Trail, among others - with which to pursue a sometimes shifting set of operational goals in a highly-customizable sandbox.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Age of Steam Con 2020 Map Set contains two new maps.&#10;&#10;Southern China&#10;A robust rail network in Southern China is in the people&rsquo;s interest. While the long-term opportunity for private ownership of rail networks in communist China is limited, there is still plenty of money to be made from outside interests happy to receive any goods China offers. You will find that the national government is happy to provide you with the support needed to build your networks and to power your locomotives for longer deliveries&mdash;as it slowly incorporates your early work into a National Railway that will become the pride of the country and will be used to power China's own economic self-interest.&#10;&#10;The limitation of only four track ownership discs per player and gaining support from the government is unique to this map.&#10;&#10;Brummie Rails&#10;Birmingham was a center of creativity during the Industrial Revolution. Small, specialized workshops and highly skilled trades resulted in several innovations. Birmingham produced more patents during this period than any other region in England, including the development of the Watt Steam Engine. This expansion map focuses on the unique qualities of the locals known as Brummies to develop and give birth to the Age of Steam.&#10;&#10;The main twist of this map is there are no special actions at the start of the game; these have to be revealed using the Develop special action.&#10;&#10;",

You start by placing a primary producer/Base Card to create a new habitat. Each animal card will list what it can eat leading up to an apex predator. Each new habitat is connected as the game goes on, but with human projects such as roads and housing estates these habitats can become disconnected. Animals that could once be moved are now trapped. You must strategically place your animals, human projects and natural events to thwart your opponents. The game mechanics have been designed to practically demonstrate how humans are causing issues but also how we can help in a simple and family friendly game lasting 25 - 45min.&#10;&#10;Each animal card will also feature data about that animal so you can learn things like their weight, population size/trend as well as where they fall on the endangered species list.&#10;In the rules you'll also find a list of organisations that are working hard to protect our natural world.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all their cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Place Action Cubes to expand your armies, build fortresses, buy more resources to transport your forces, disrupt other player&rsquo;s plans and much more.&#10;&#10;During the Battle Phase you will attempt to conquer the provinces of other players or the neutral provinces on the board that have yet to have a ruling clan.

Former Synod worlds within the sector have joined with us and our allies. Members of the Preservation Society have flocked to our banner and provided a desperately needed resource of information and technical expertise. The shipyards of Titan and numerous mining operations within the asteroid belt and small moons of Jupiter and Saturn have built the largest fleet in Human history. Our close allies, the Aven and Fel'akin, have trained with us and a mutual respect and admiration have grown out of the desperate years of the first Synod War. The Sector, however, will never be safe as long as the Synod controls the galaxy. The Synod scourge must be eradicated.&#10;Task Force Alexander is composed of nearly three hundred warships and four hundred thrity five transports. The 1st, 2nd, 5th and 7th Marine Divisions along with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Terran Legions form the backbone of the invasion ground forces. Numerous other Terran regiments and brigades support the primary landing forces along with four Fel'akin wargoups and six Aven multimode fighter wings. Fleet Admiral Harlie Mason commands the combined forces.&#10;Their First Target is to break into the Hevan Sector through the Qetesh Gate system. Soon they will be knocking on Hevan's door.&#10;&#10;'Gatecrasher is the 1st in a series of campaigns to liberate the Hevan Sector from the oppressive and genocidal rule of the Synod of Worlds.

    "Description": "The Qetesh Gate system has fallen and given us a valuable foothold into this sector. The next planet in the local jump chain is called Pathu Bahli and is a major mining and transportation hub in this sector. Normally a gate system would be the linchpin of a sector but Pathu Bahli is home to a Division of Galax Interstellar and it's corporate headquarters for this sector of the galaxy. Other than the extensive mining and refining facilities and the planet has considerable infrastructure which can be valuable if we can eventually colonize this world with our own people.&#10;The system is full of resources and even possesses some ancient starship wreckage we might be able to reverse engineer and who knows what we might learn from that technology. The Admiral has declared this to be a critical system which must be taken before we move deeper into the sector. There are no native lifeforms other than plants and the atmosphere has a higher than normal CO2 level making it barely warm enough for life but requires anyone on the surface to wear a re-breather or sealed suit.&#10;Dense cloud cover and rough terrain make it difficult to recon the area from orbit. Small recon teams from the 15th MEU (SOC) will have to drop in and take a look. We have some captured shuttles from the Qetesh Gate operation which could be used to smuggle recon teams into place. Once we have a better picture of the situation on the ground and the extent of their defenses we can send in the Legions. &#10;&#10;Dropping In is the 2nd in a series of campaigns to liberate the Hevan Sector from the oppressive and genocidal rule of the Synod of Worlds. &#10;It provides 4 scenarios detailing the initial invasion of the Pathu Bahli system. &#10;It is compatible with Gruntz 15mm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Chang units hit the perimeter while Marine elements of the now famous Echo company took out the comms tower and secured the headquarters facility.&#10;Once they were relieved by the Legions, Echo Company was sent out into the ruined wasteland to investigate a energy field detected from orbit. What they found was an alien device of unknown function. A battle erupted around the device as Echo company fought off repurposed labor bots sent to destroy them. Once the device was secured they set out on foot to the landing zone for pickup. Consensus labor bots seemed to appear out of the woodwork as Echo company fought their way to the LZ. Once the handoff was complete with the techs on the dropship Echo company recieved word from an embattled Chang Cadre near their position. They boarded three smaller VTOLs and made a mad dash to reinforce their new allies. One of the transports took fire and crashed far from the Chang position.

    "Description": "Gapa is an iconic card game that focuses on having fun, but in which competition with other players is an important element. This time it is a set created for the youngest. It consists of 31 cards with dimensions of 5 x 5 cm, each of which contains 6 different drawings.&#10;&#10;As with the traditional version, players play a few cards when playing Gapa Junior. Then one player draws one card and places it in the center.&#10;&#10;At this point, the duel of speed and perceptiveness begins. Players are supposed to compare whether the card from the inside has at least 1 element in it, which is also on the card they are holding. If this is the case - they must get rid of this card very quickly, and the one who does the fastest wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each character card has two sections on which to mark the life points and the aura points with paper clips. The battlefield is set up at the players' discretion; any household items or really just anything can be put on the table. The rules contain seven scenarios and the encouragement to invent your own. &#10;On their turn, a player can move, attack or do other actions, for which they pay with aura points (the only limit on how much they can do in a turn). Distance to other players is measured by a simple ruler on the side of the character card and can affect the aura point cost.&#10;The winning conditions are defined by the respective scenario, like last meeple standing, team versus team, first meeple to reach the highest point in the arena, etc.&#10;&#10;",

For the last few weeks freed prisoners of theirs have been all over the local media net telling stories of midnight abductions, torture and the killing of other prisoners. The SSS know they are in a bad situation and to make matters worse they have abducted the planetary governor and are using him as a shield against retaliation from the growing resistance movement. They are holed up in an old planetary defense fort far up in the mountains to the west of the capitol.&#10;Mr. Johnson has tasked Black's Commandos with finding and rescuing the governor before he is killed as a propaganda piece by the Synod. Mr. Johnson has provided satelitte surviellance data about the fort and its defenses. He didn't say where he got this data from and we know better than to ask. The data seems solid but then again no intel is perfect. However, it is enough to formulate an ops plan.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides a short campaign of 4 linked scenarios for the FiveCore Skirmish Gaming Evolved and its supplement Five Parsecs from Home.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 3 possible actions : draw a card, play a card (and eventually its effect), or use the power of a card that is already on the table. It's that simple ! Of course, cards will interact with each other, and players will have to correctly manage them to be efficient.&#10;&#10;The first player that reaches a Power Level of 25 with his active cards triggers the endgame ; all other players get a last turn. Then, the player with the most powerful team wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

For many people the Parthians are a vague presence on the eastern edge of the world. As this guide shows, they were really a bridge between civilisations, linking Rome with India, acting as a barrier to nomadic tribes moving westwards and even having some contact with China.&#10;&#10;The second purpose is to offer up some army lists (designed to fit with Impetus rules but easy to follow and equally easily converted for other wargames rules) to help those wargamers who use Impetus and who want to field the armies described in the guide. The idea is that the lists will enable you to produce an army which is reasonably authentic and as much as possible has some of the strengths and weaknesses of the original.&#10;&#10;The third purpose is to provide a simple campaign to help players use their armies within their historical context.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Napoleonic Ships Game&#10;&#10;These Rules have been written to provide a Fast-Play set in which the fun aspect is highlighted. &#10;A game can be single ship to ship combat, or larger Fleet actions, and can run from a half to a couple of hours depending on the size of the Fleets and experience of the players. Several Fleets and multiple players can easily be incorporated.&#10;&#10;The Movement system is Hex based, eradicating those minor tweaks and disputes bought about by rulers and angle markers. Ship types are generalised into three levels of Rated and several non-rated types, and include Frigates, fire ships, Bomb ketches, merchantmen and fortifications. Playing counters and sample Fleets are provided.&#10;&#10;Combat includes exchanging cannon fire and grappling the enemy to board with Marines!&#10;&#10;The effects of wind direction, day or night actions and accumulated damage is represented by various simple mechanisms that are easy to learn, yet hold subtle variations that an experienced gamer can exploit.&#10;&#10;There is little record keeping, other than moving counters on a board, so the main focus can be kept on the models on the playing table. It is an I-Go-Y-U-Go turn system that prevents individual ship orders and snarl-ups, but does mean you have to keep your wits about you!&#10;&#10;The Rules are originally intended for Napoleonic period ship combat, but can easily be used for other periods in which projectiles are the main offensive weapons, as opposed to the ramming tactics of earlier navies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Only pay for the ones you want, and print out as many copies as you need to create your own epic WWII air battle.&#10;&#10;The Liberator was faster than the B-17, had a longer range, and carried a larger bomb load. Over 18,000 Liberators were built, more than any other Allied aircraft. However, it was overshadowed by the older B-17&rsquo;s fame and apparent toughness, much like the Spitfire took more glory than the equally capable Hurricane. The Liberator&rsquo;s longer range made it ideal for the Pacific theater, and took the more difficult missions into the heart of Germany.&#10;&#10;This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the B-24 Liberator and three scenarios that reference other aircraft.&#10;&#10;     Operation Tidal Wave:  A low level attack on the Ploesti oil refineries.&#10;     Berlin:  Liberators attack a railroad station in Berlin.

It promotes face-to-face communication for teams, families, schools and friends.&#10;&#10;There are several methods of game play, the most common being one cards in the middle, with each player getting five cards. Players make connections between pairs of adjacent words, scoring as they go (each cards being worth from 1 to 5 points).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This all combines for fun and exciting skirmish miniatures play.&#10;&#10;Act With Daring includes ten scenarios linked by three campaigns and one grand campaign. Players recreate small skirmish conflicts, armoured clashes and mixed infantry and vehicle battles. &#10;Play the heroic defense of La Horgne or De Gaulle's famous counter-attack at Montcornet. Additional scenarios deal with the intense fighting in the Ardennes forest, the daring river crossings at Montherme and the final destruction of the Ninth Army. German forces will encounter French senior command units as headquarters and outposts are overrun. Optional forces allow for maximum replayability.&#10;&#10;This 102 page book also includes a combat diary that details the day by day advance, attacks, and maneuvers of the German and French forces. Background information, tactical maps, force descriptions, and tables of organization for the Ninth Army and Sixth Panzer Division all enhance play and unit motives.&#10;&#10;The scenarios are ideal for 15mm to 28mm individually-based figures. &#10;Act With Daring scenarios are usable with many gaming systems: Arc of Fire, Battleground WWII, Crossfire, Battalions in Crisis, Cross of Iron, Disposable Heroes and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;     10 Scenarios&#10;     3 Campaign Games&#10;     Squad Reference Sheets for each scenario and force&#10;     Historical Notes on the Invasion&#10;     Detailed Day-by-Day Combat Diary&#10;     OOB for the French Ninth Army&#10;     OOB for the German Sixth Panzer Division&#10;     Historical Maps&#10;     Campaign Rules&#10;     and more...&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This leaves any debates about historical accuracy where they should be - between the players.&#10;&#10;The rules feature:&#10;&#10;     Limited visibility, which limits the enemy player to shoot only at what has been spotted rather than being able to target anything on the table.&#10;     Alternate unit activation instead of one army then the other army.

The engine creates a system where the pace of action and initiative is determined throughout the turn. Players are forced to make choices and perform actions of which the immediate consequences may not be established. It keeps on your toes every turn.&#10;&#10;Players will be able to quickly get to grips with the game as the rules are intuitive and quickly remembered, with several 'playing card' size quick reference cards and Unit Cards providing all you need to manage a game.&#10;&#10;A supplement for playing the American War of Independence has been release in PDF format called Land of the Free.&#10;&#10;The rules feature;&#10;&#10;     68-pages in full colour.&#10;     A unique card based system that offers simultaneous play with a degree of unpredictability that focuses on the heat of battle. &#10;     The game 'engine' system is ideal for multi-player games.&#10;     Simple, clear text, organised in a logical flow, see our sample pages.&#10;     Simple clear rules mechanisms that are repeated through rules allowing fast learning and play.&#10;     Clear, precise examples with thoughts on alternative options, see our sample pages.&#10;     Detailing leaders with personality traits for command.&#10;     Uncluttered larger font play sheet, 11pt Arial.&#10;     Play cards to copy and other quick reference aids.&#10;     An introductory scenario. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Starting from the historical positions of the Italian and German formations, one player, as the Italian, must try to save Rome from falling into German hands before the arrival of American paratrooper reinforcements to support them in rescuing the Eternal City from Nazi occupation. This wargame can also be played with a German opponent, or from the German perspective as an alternative solitaire play wargame trying to secure the Eternal City before the arrival of the American paratroopers. Historically, the Germans declared Rome to be an &ldquo;open city&rdquo; after the surrender of their former Italian ally.&#10;&#10;",
