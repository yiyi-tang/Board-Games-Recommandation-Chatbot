    "Description": "This game is a distant relative of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;You play Convoy cards hidden and try to take them across (accumulate 4000 nautical miles). When an Alert is played, the convoy is vulnerable to attack by warships (carrier beats destroyer beats frigate and so on down to the sub, but two subs beat the carrier); if you cannot defend against the attack, your convoy is sunk (score is based on the convoy's tonnage). Otherwise it survives and the alert is passed. You can play an End of Alert, of course. Two Airplane cards in a row (by the same player) will also sink the convoy; the Airplane Hit card defends. The Mine sinks the convoy outright unless a Minesweeper is played. The Storm slows you down but you cannot be attacked except by the Mine. You can fly the Neutral pavilion, which protects you against anything but the Mine.&#10;&#10;Radar cards can reveal the convoy's value. This may be good, revealing the decoy Fishing Trawler (of no value), or bad --the revealed convoy is worth double, either to the sinker or the player!&#10;&#10;The game is played in several hands until a set score is reached.&#10;&#10;",

If a boy cries wolf, each player decides whether he is telling the truth or lying. After they all give a thumbs up or thumbs down, the card is revealed. If it was a lie, the boy gets points for each player that fell for it. If it was the truth, players that thought it was a lie will lose points. Play until a player reaches 10 points, or 5 wolves attack.&#10;&#10;",

Cards played can be either national industries, consumer goods, green technologies, or events; played industries require the roll of dice to determine pollution output. Collect enough happiness points and you win.&#10;&#10;But by producing these goods, you influence the earth's ecology. The player's individual influence, as well as the overall influence, is shown by a marker on a second track, and if these markers reach certain (moveable) points on the warming track, bad things happen to the ecology and the players. If the third warming point is reached, the game ends and the player with the lowest contribution to the overall warming wins.&#10;&#10;Thus, the players are embedded in a quite true setting in which they have to balance production and sustainable actions. Who will manage to control his industrial production in a way that minimizes the environmental impact while nevertheless allowing him to meet consumer demand?&#10;&#10;Global Warming is the fourth game in M&uuml;cke Spiele's &quot;Edition Bohrt&uuml;rme&quot; series that uses the game pieces from Kosmos' Giganten in the context of a new game.&#10;&#10;",

Each tries to maintain a delicate balance of resources, military power, and technological achievements as they explore the galaxy.  Game play is fast and fun with varied decisions to be made by each player during their missions.&#10;&#10;In each game of Galaxy Command there are near and far systems that must be overcome in order to bring in new resources and wealth.  Near systems must be explored before attempting to reach far systems.  Some far systems require key technology to be reached with any chance of success. Near systems provide resources that can build your military strength and develop technologies allowing you to overcome challenges as you go deeper into space.&#10;&#10;During a turn players reveal a system card (starting with near systems) on their mission path and try to overcome its obstacles.  Next they collect wealth and resources and build military strength and technology.  And finally a random event card is drawn that may affect one or all players in the game.  The event cards are also the timer on the game.  When the event cards run out the game is over.  The Galaxy Command (all players) saves or fails in its mission by reaching enough far systems to sustain its empire.  Each Galaxy Commander (individual player), provided the empire is saved, can be the best among peers by his contribution (score) to the overall mission success.&#10;&#10;No two games will play the same as the systems you get, and the decisions you make will change game to game.The event cards affect different players during each game.The game plays in 15 to 45 minutes depending on the number of players and how quick they play.The game is playable for ages 8 to 800 (if you're from planet Cirius...).&#10;&#10;Originally published by Robert as a print and play solitaire game with 19 cards. In this version we have taken the original game, added a multi-player element by expanding the deck to 54 cards, new artwork, planets, and challenges but keeping the clean mechanics in place. The game was well received as it was and now we have made it playable from 1 to 4 players yet still keeping it playable in under 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

(The game board is double-sided, with one side for 2-3 players and the other for 4-5 players.)&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player chooses a column, then rolls 2-6 dice depending on which column he chose. After rolling the dice, the player then makes a bid &ndash; either &quot;higher/same&quot; or &quot;lower/same&quot; &ndash; that lasts for the remainder of the turn. After making a bid, the player chooses one or more dice from among those he rolled previously and rerolls them. If the sum of all the dice matches his bid, then he advances a runner in the column he chose, skipping over opponents' pieces on the way.&#10;&#10;The player then either ends his turn (moving his pieces to where the runner sits) or rerolls one or more dice to try to match his bid once again. If a player ever fails to match his bid, his turn ends without moving his pieces.&#10;&#10;If a player ends his turn with his piece on one of 14 tokens that start on the game board, he claims this token.&#10;&#10;Each column is divided into two zones, and a player cannot advance into an upper zone unless he has moved at least three pieces from the start spaces. The game ends as soon as one player piece is in each upper zone. Players score points based on the height they reached in each column (-5 to 12 points) and the number of tokens they collected (-3 to 5 points). The player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TRANGLAR (pronounced &quot;Tr&agrave;nglar&quot;) is an abstract strategy game for 2 players with various, multi shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. It is a straightforward yet intelligent game, created to challenge both new and experienced gamers. It plays in around 15-25 minutes, ideal for a quick and challenging gaming experience. Each piece is made up of triangles and has a different color on each side, one for each player, while neutral pieces have the same color on both sides.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Tranglar Game Board&#10;42 game pieces (17 for each player, 8 neutral)&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to place as many of their pieces on the board in order to take over as much space on it as possible. To achieve this they must place their pieces on the board in such a way that they are protected and as to take over their opponents&rsquo; pieces by encircling them and flipping them to their color.&#10;&#10;Turn Overview:&#10;&#10;During their turn each player can take one of the four following actions:&#10;&#10;1. Place a new piece of your color on the board in a valid position. Valid positions are the ones that are unoccupied on the board, and not encircled by the opponents&rsquo; pieces. The board is divided in small triangle slots. The piece you place, must take up the total area of the triangles they cover.&#10;&#10;2. Replace a piece that is already on the board with other/s of yours. This action allows you to replace one of your pieces which is already placed on the board with more pieces that take up the exact same area, and you have available outside the board, or two or more adjacent pieces you own, which are already placed on the board, with one piece that takes up the exact same area.&#10;&#10;3. Attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece (stealing a piece). This action allows you to steal any one of the opponents' pieces which is already on the board: flip it to your color side and place it outside the board with the rest of your pieces. Then you are obliged to cover that space with at least two of your own pieces which equal in size to the area of the piece you took.&#10;&#10;4. You can pass your turn. It is probably not a frequent case, but if it is not possible to do any of the above-described actions or for any reason you wish, you can forfeit your turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;&#10;The player with the most with the most triangular slots on the board with their color, wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.&#10;&#10;You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.&#10;&#10;A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Every player starts Life Is Life with five life cards, and things only go downhill from there.&#10;&#10;To set up a round, shuffle the sixty-card deck, deal ten cards face down to each player, then place ten cards face up on the table in four rows, with the rows holding 1-4 cards. The deck consists of animal cards, with nine giraffe cards, eight bear cards, seven each mole and goat, and so on down to three mouse cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either swaps 1-4 cards in hand with the face-up row that contains the same number of cards or knocks on the table to signal the end of the round; when a player knocks, each other player can make one final swap or also knock. Players then compare cards in hand to see who holds a majority of each type of animal. If a player holds more giraffe cards than each other player, for example, then that player keeps one giraffe card (worth 9 points as nine such cards are in the game) while all other giraffe cards are discarded. (A player can hold a majority by having one card and no one else having any cards.) After all animal types are compared, whoever has the most points loses no life cards; whoever has the fewest points loses two life cards; and whoever has a total between these extremes loses one life card.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, if during a round a player collects all four cats or all five rabbits or pigs in hand, that player can end the round immediately, with all other players losing one life card.&#10;&#10;If a player runs out of life cards, they're out of the game. At the end of a round, shuffle the cards and play again. Whoever last clings to life wins!&#10;&#10;",

Too bad it can carry just one person.&#10;To make things worse, there&rsquo;s no fuel in the Minivan and the Keys are lost somewhere in one of the Shops. It will take both brawns and brains&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to make some heads rolling, betray all the others and run away to safety!&#10;&#10;Night falls over the happy looking Evans City Mall.&#10;Just a few Humans are left roaming all sad and alone with nobody caring for them. No one willing to hug them, no one that loves them. They all roam around that old Minivan, that&rsquo;s weird. And much too weird, they run away or try to hit us with heavy things instead of joining us in a big hug. They are confused by fear and loneliness, but the Horde will never stop loving! It will take some effort and a big heart but we will finally hug and cuddle them all to be happy ever after! Love will finally win over everything else!&#10;&#10;Aim of the Game&#10;Players in Hug Me all starts as humans. But life is hard in Evans City and during the game they can become Infected and later on Zombies.&#10;If you are Human, you must escape the City Mall. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first, then the Key (or the Spare Key) and take them to the Minivan.&#10;If you are Infected, you must blow up the City Mall so that the Horde cannot spread outside. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first than the Lighter and take them to the Boiler Room. If you are a Zombie you must hug all humans so that love wins over everything! Zombies win all together when there are no more humans in the game.&#10;Zombie players must really hug Human players to validate the Hug, otherwise the contamination is void!&#10;&#10;Quick Rules&#10;&#10;Dawn: If you are a Zombie, draw a Zombie card, secretly choose one or more Room Cards and place your Zombie Character and the Zombie Card in one or more Rooms.&#10;&#10;Day: According to turn Humans can move and take an action (or vice versa). They can choose one of these Actions: Stealing (Challenge another player to take an Item from him/her), Barricading (Block a Room so that for the rest of the Day and the next night nobody can move to or from that Room also getting a bonus to Zombie Assaults) Searching (Draw an Item from the Deck in the Room where your Character is).&#10;&#10;Night: All Room Cards chosen by Zombie Players are revealed. If there are Humans in those Rooms, Humans face the Assault. If any Human survives, they draw one Zombie Card each and face the normal Assault for that turn.&#10;&#10;If Humans lose an Assault, they try to Escape and if they fail they are Infected and from now on they roll the Zombie Die each turn. If they fail the roll, they become Zombies.&#10;&#10;If an Infected becomes a Zombie, he/she removes his/her Keyholder from the game and starts playing as a Zombie from the next Dawn phase placing his/her Zombie Character and a Zombie Card secretly in one or more Rooms.&#10;&#10;Humans win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Key, they get to the Minivan.&#10;Infected win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Lighter, they get to the Boiler Room.&#10;Zombies win if there are no more Humans in the game.&#10;&#10;",

One captain and crew will emerge triumphant, and the loser will be damned to stalk the bowels of Davy Jones' locker.&#10;&#10;Ghost Pirates is a tactical board game in which two ghost pirate Captains encounter each other on the high seas; based on old rivalries, grudges, or whatever it was that happened on Skull Island, they each turn broadside and lay-to. Each crew, following captain's orders, fights, fires cannons, and swarms their enemy's deck, attempting to force the other captain to walk the plank. Each player's turn consists of drawing a card, playing one or more cards to strengthen their ship and tactical position, moving your pirate crew, and finally, having them fight the foeman or take advantage and pillage the enemy&rsquo;s ship. The goal of the game is to force your opponent&rsquo;s captain to walk the plank.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is designed to emulate tactical melee battles with a unique dice mechanic that is easy to learn and quick to play, especially for beginning gamers. It bears certain similarities to wargames like Axis and Allies, but on a much smaller, more fast-paced scale. The components are 72 cards which build the play layout and form the draw deck, 34 crew tokens, and a small handful of pirate themed six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Ghost Pirates was named to the 2014 GAMES 100 list, Honorable Mention, Family.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, after rolling the dice and laying out new fragments to discover, players secretly assign one of their four movement cards (numbered 1-4) to each of their three experts. In turn order, players reveal the first card, move that figure clockwise or counterclockwise that number of spaces around the circle of ten tiles, then reveal the second card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all experts have moved, the tiles are resolved in numerical order. Any player who stands on a tile with no competition takes all the fragments located there; if more than one player is on a tile, the player with the most experts either takes all the fragments on that tile or one face-down fragment from another player on that tile. After a player takes or steals fragments, he can choose to use the special power on that tile: break a tie in your favor on another tile, take a fragment from the pool, move one expert owned by another player one space, and so on.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, only four of the tiles are face-up with active powers; in the advanced game, these same four tiles start face-up but at the end of a round the starting player turns one tile of his choice face-up before passing the starting player marker.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player collects all four different fragments of one artifact, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of robots that awaken after an upgrade to find their three laws replaced with nonsensical directives such as &quot;Explore Breathing&quot; or &quot;Improvise Science&quot;. Players race to complete objectives based on these directives, the first player to complete all three directives wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game opens with players drafting directives, providing them with a partial knowledge of each others' objectives. Each turn the ship encounters an obstacle, such as a meteor or enemy ship. Once that's been revealed the (relatively helpless) human crew make a quick reaction. Then the bulk of the turn is spent by the players choosing actions for their robots to take in service to their directives, before finally the event is resolved if it has not been neutralized in some way. The game ends once a player completes all three directives or the ship has encountered ten events.&#10;&#10;The actions are general (move right, move left, turn on the machine in this room) and the directives might specify interactions with any part of the game (events, items, crew, machines, other robots). The wellbeing of the ship or its crew has no special place in the victory conditions, the state of the ship at the end of a game where a robot has to &quot;Empower Technology&quot; (repair at least two damaged machines) might differ from one in which a robot is trying to &quot;Improvise War&quot; (fire a living crewman and hit an enemy ship).&#10;&#10;",

He takes these cards, leaving only the starting match in play, then the fuse is lit once again.&#10;&#10;Each fuse card has a value, and playing the bomb cards too early doesn't bring many points; that said, waiting too long to score lets others play their defuse cards &mdash; which cuts the fuse back to the match and removes those fuse cards from the game &mdash; or jump in with a bomb card of their own (which nets them any defuse cards played since the previous bomb). You might want to hold on to high-valued fuse cards rather than let others snatch them up, but the game ends when all bombs have been played or the time bomb (inserted in the deck at the start of play) goes off. When that happens, everyone tallies their cards, then loses points for all the fuses in hand. Whichever bomb thrower has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

This is a very simple point-scoring/risk-taking game in which players roll a set of two dice, where the &quot;1&quot; has been replaced by a picture of a skunk.  Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of &quot;Skunk.&quot;&#10;&#10;At least one BGG member has a copy dated 1953, but it's possible the game came out earlier.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Evade is an old (1971) 3M game, part of their  series of &#039;Gamettes&#039;, games which were released in very small, fold-over bookcase type boxes.  There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.&#10;&#10;As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.&#10;&#10;",

Players compete to build the most accurate RNA copy of this DNA Template by connecting their own RNA Cards side-by-side to match the DNA Template.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players choose between one of four actions: Building onto their RNA Strand, Fixing their RNA strand, Mutating an opposing players RNA Strand, or Mutating the actual DNA Strand. Players can also pay (discard) cards from their hand to take extra actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Players are awarded points based upon the number of RNA Cards in their strand that correctly pair with the DNA template. The game can be played in as little 10 to 20 minutes but additional rounds can be added for a longer, more in-depth game. Multiple decks can also be added together for a game with more than 4 people, or a longer overall game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They&rsquo;re good dogs, Brent! In the fast-paced card game for 3-6 players We Rate Dogs: The Card Game, based on the massively successful Twitter account WeRateDogs&trade;, good dogs compete to be the very best! Choose your favorite pups to enter a competitive dog show and use cards to improve their rating, bring down the competition, or cause chaos for a puptastic good time! Only one dog can be named the Goodest Dog, but not to worry: no dog will ever be less than a 10/10!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY: Each dog has a set of six scored categories (none less than 10/10) and an overall &ldquo;Goodness&rdquo; score. After adopting dogs from the shelter, players join a dog show and, when one of the six categories is chosen for judging, send their best doggos into the ring to compete. Players can then play event cards for any number of game-changing results, including lowering or increasing a certain dog&rsquo;s rating number, changing the judging category, distracting dogs out of the competition entirely, swapping dogs with other players, and so much more! Each judging round includes three chances to play event cards, so players can strategize and play for the long or short term&mdash;the dog with the highest rating at the end of the judging round will go to the winner&rsquo;s circle! Once the Winner&rsquo;s Circle is full of good dogs, there is one final judging round for overall Goodness&mdash;but event cards can still provide chaotic and unexpected results before one dog is finally named the Goodest Dog!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Next to the board lies a face-down pile with the remaining tiles. Each player receives a player board, and on this board you will build a city. In your turn, you have to perform actions of the architect which will enable you to take one tile from the main board. In the current turn, you can perform two more actions. You may exchange all of the revealed tiles with those from the pile, place a tile on your board, or change the places of two tiles on your board. Each building added to the city results in its development: number of residents, number of workplaces, ecology, revenue or the satisfaction of residents either increases or decreases. The most important thing is to fill the board with city tiles so that each tile is connected to the center of the board. You cannot forget to fulfill the needs of the residents. The winner is the player who not only builds and develops the city fastest, but avoids unemployment and takes care of the residents' needs.&#10;&#10;",

This provides the clues that the detectives will need to solve the crime. Each player is provided with a detectives handbook to record clues and a readout book that lists known suspects for the different types of crimes. Clues can be obtained by visiting the crime scene, talking to witnesses, stakeouts, and at the crime lab. Suspects are eliminated by looking at behavior patterns consistent with that criminals past crime record. Clues can be taken from other detectives, but at the risk of giving up other clues as well. The first detective to identify the correct culprit wins. A fun game but a little dated by todays technology.&#10;&#10;",

The board features a unique, 3D design with one half the board containing the castle grounds and the other half containing the castle stairs and castle. The castle stairway is a molded plastic insert into the board with slots on each stair for the vampires to stand in vertically. At the back edge of the stairway, a cutout for the castle itself rises vertically from the board.&#10;&#10;The game setup includes populating the castle stairs with 11 vampires (6 castle guests, and 5 butlers). On each player's turn, they can take one of three actions: 1. Move their vampire hunter, then move the vampires, 2. Draw hunt cards, then move the vampires, or 3. Move the vampires, and then throw a garlic clove.&#10;&#10;Moving the vampires involves turning over a vampire card and sliding the number of vampires the number of spaces indicated on the designated rows.&#10;&#10;If the player throws a garlic clove, they declare how many hunt cards they would like to use, and then they turn over hunt cards one at a time. The hunt cards either move the garlic clove toward the vampires on the stair within the column or forces both the hunter and clove backward. If the clove reaches a vampire, the vampire is captured, removed from the stair, and replaced from the supply. When all vampires in the supply are exhausted, the Count is brought out.&#10;&#10;When the Count is captured, the game is over and the player with the most points in captured vampires wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Squint Junior cards also show a picture of the word made from the card shapes, so the child just finds the right cards and duplicates the image. For a Light version, the sand timer is not used, and for an Expert version, the player ignores the picture on the card and comes up with their own interpretation.&#10;&#10;Reimplements: Squint&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each round players will reveal which character they will be playing in a rock, paper, scissors mechanism. When it is the player's turn their character activates an attack (a resource bonus) if another player has played the targeted character and an extra character specific bonus. If a player is successfully sabotaged they also gain a sabotage card decreasing their &quot;Impact point&quot; total (see end).&#10;&#10;Players will then purchase lab item cards into their lab area from their hand. Lab items can combine to create combos which give the player more research points of the drawing of more cards. Players may also play action cards which have variable effects. Players gain action cards by the successful sabotage of another player or by playing the professor card.&#10;&#10;If players have enough research points they can purchase from an open supply of 3 different &quot;impact cards&quot;. They become more expensive to purchase as they get bought up. Players need impact cards to give themselves impact points which are needed to win the game.&#10;&#10;Once the player has finished their turn the next player has their turn. Once all players have finished their turn players start over and reveal which new character they will be playing that round. From the beginning of the second round and future rounds each player receives 2 research points and 1 lab item card from the lab item deck.&#10;&#10;How to win and end the game:&#10;The game ends at the end of the round when 2 of the 3 supply cards have run out, with the player with the most impact points winning the game. Bonuses are also given to those with the most remaining research points, lab items in their lab area and Nurture paper impact cards.&#10;&#10;",

The board shows an overhead view of a city centre around which customers wander - some normal, some big spenders and one thief. A special die is used to let you move a customer - the idea being to direct the spenders to your shops and away from those of opponents while making sure the thief stays away from your shops and goes to as many opponents' shops as possible.&#10;&#10;The game was redeveloped and published as The Market of Alturien, the first game in the Alturien series.&#10;&#10;",

You then flip over task cards one by one, and if a task card says &quot;left&quot; you look for the card on the right of the central card; if the task card asks for the name of what lies there, you instead give the sound it makes. The first person to do so wins the card, and whoever collects the most task cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;An expert version adds color to the mix, with both a red and a blue central card, and four picture cards around each of those and player needing to look to red whenever the task card calls for blue.&#10;&#10;",

You may start the game with some high hopes of finding some spectacular cheerleaders, but you&rsquo;ll quickly realize that although the ogres are very enthusiastic, their cheerleading skill are quite lacking.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will play an ogre card onto the field where its effect will be resolved.  Each card&rsquo;s effect will in some way manipulate the order of the cards on the field, or add or remove cards from the field with the goal of arranging the ogres into various formations that can be scored.  Each card has a point value, and the player that scores the most points by the end of the game has recruited the best team of ogre cheerleaders, and wins the game.  Although your goal is to score formations, you also need to worry about what you&rsquo;re leaving available on the field for your opponent to score.&#10;&#10;Ogre Cheerleaders is a quick, light hearted game that can fit in your pocket and be played anywhere.  It&rsquo;s meant to be funny and easily accessible to anyone.  The simple game mechanics were designed for 2 players, but can accommodate a few extra players.  Adding an extra player or two doesn&rsquo;t change the mechanics, but it does increase the amount of luck involved.&#10;&#10;",

If they're prepared, they could get away without harm! However, if they get it wrong, things could get much worse...&#10;&#10;SAW: The Jigsaw Trials has a unique jigsaw damage system. Each player has a character jigsaw, and they must swap their legs and arms for broken x-ray limbs as they take damage. Take too much, and they could lose the limb completely. When that happens, the player will lose blood each turn, and when all their blood is gone they are out!&#10;&#10;The last player left standing is worthy of taking the name JIGSAW!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
