    "Description": "Hunters on the Shoreline is an attempt to provide a set of fast, east to use miniatures rules that will accurately reflect the quick, vicious battles between light naval forces. It is designed for use with P.T. Dockyard 1/600 resin miniatures. The tactics used in these operations were much different from standard naval tactics. Actions took place at point blank range (many MTB captains kept grenades handy on the bridge for ready use) and were often measured in minutes.&#10;&#10;The focus is primarily in the European Theatre, but the rules are equally useful for actions between PT boats and the Japanese Navy.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules and miniatures, you will need an area at least 6' by 4', a metric tape measure, turn radius circles, and at least 2-4 each of 4 sided (d4), six sided (d6), eight sided (d8), ten sided (d10), twelve sided (d12), and twenty sided (d20) dice as well as making a few simple templates as described in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

The only escape way was fleeing to the hills and several citizens made it, and more others were captured by the pirates and put in slavery in Berberia.&#10;&#10;Will you manage to avoid the sack of the city and save its inhabitants?&#10;&#10;Or will you sack the city and gain reputation among the Pirates?&#10;&#10;The game consists of 24 colourful units to be cut and glued, 18 nice cards, a gourgeous map to be printed on A3 folio and the English   rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Field of Mars was originally intended to function as a 'battle board' for the Lace Wars series, which is 'operational' in scope and normally resolves battles using a combat results table. To add value to the product, Field of Mars has been designed to function as a complete game in its own right, suitable for playing both random and historical battles devised by the players. No knowledge of the Lace Wars rules is required. (Caveat: the game does not include any historical scenarios.) With some modification it could also be used to play battles generated by different game systems.&#10;&#10;The game uses a gridded mat and terrain tiles to create a wide variety of battlefields. The players' forces are deployed on this mat in stacks of counters called 'wings'; the wings are the 'manoeuvre unit' in this system. The players issue orders to their wings by rolling dice and distributing them among their wings. The more pips a die has showing, the greater the number of tactical choices its wing has. Once orders have been issued, a series of discrete steps is followed, each permitting the execution of one particular kind of action (for example: Advance, Fire, Assault). In each step the players decide whether any eligible wings (those with the correct die value) will execute that action. The object of the game is to render opposing wings hors de combat. In the context of the game this means the wing is removed from play. This is accomplished through artillery and musket fire, cavalry charges, and infantry assaults. The first side to go over the required number of hors de combat wings loses the battle.&#10;&#10;The rules include instructions for creating random battles using the counters provided and also instructions on how to use the game to fight battles generated within the Lace Wars system.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1) One large play mat, called the Battlefield.&#10;2) 360 die cut counters representing various generic forces, plus markers. Scale is variable.&#10;3) 60 terrain tiles&#10;4) Rules, charts, and tables.&#10;&#10;",

But both the USA and the USSR were always keen to harm each other in the Third World, and to drag every dingle despot to the &quot;right&quot; side.

Unfortunately, the stories are true, and you find yourself trapped in a parallel dimension.&#10;&#10;Joined by other unfortunate adventurers, none of you remembers when you arrived, but you have a strange sense of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Have you done this before?&#10;&#10;A giant stone obelisk stands before you, etched with various unusual symbols. You have a feeling that the secret to your escape hides beneath the ocean waves...&#10;&#10;Each round consists of three phases: (1) rotate the &quot;first player&quot; card to the next role, (2) remove timer cards from all decks, and then (3) each role completes their turn in order.&#10;&#10;Turns consist of each role taking 3 actions. Players work together to explore the triangle and remember the 91 symbols on the bottom of the ocean tiles.  There are 2 symbols per ocean tile. The appropriate symbols must be remembered and secured by player pawns to lock-in the escape pillars in the corners of the board.&#10;&#10;There are 91 symbol cards with 10 symbols per card, and each symbol is represented in the deck 10 times so that each card has exactly one symbol that matches when paired.  That one symbol is available at each pillar to lock in for a limited number of rounds.  If not locked in it is replaced by another symbol or if no more are available, players are trapped forever within the Bermuda triangle.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;91 Symbol Cards&#10;46 Ocean Tiles&#10;18 Mysterious Pillar Tiles&#10;6 Role Cards (Bonus: several customizable role cards)&#10;6 Avatars&#10;4 Player Aid Cards&#10;3 Locked-in Pillar Markers&#10;1 Player One Card&#10;&#10;",

Also included is the &quot;true and fascinating history of the Monopoly game.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Original, Long-suppressed monopoly game:&#10;This is the genuine Atlantic City monopoly game, from which Monopoly was largely copied, and which was studiously ignored by the producers of Monopoly for forty years. Its existence was brought to light dramatically in a recent lawsuit by the makers of the Anti-Monopoly game. This historic Atlantic City game was created in 1930 by Quaker teachers as an improvement of an already exiting folkgame, which was also called monopoly. The Atlantic City folks, who until now have never gotten credit for inventing the world's most popular board game, played on il cloth board of the same kind supplied in our game- which can be rolled up, and presto, you have travel monopoly. Rid the time warp into the past and play on almost the same type of game equipment created by the real inventors of Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Your Original monopoly game:&#10;The forerunner monopoly folkgame had been played in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and many other American cities since about 1910. The folkgamers enjoyed putting their won street, utility, a d railroad names on their game. We invite you to follow in their footsteps with the second board in our game equipment and the second set of black and white title cards. Pick the names which are most meaningful for you and mark them on your equipment, using either wipeoff or permanent black soft tip markers - or even crayons. BE CREATIVE.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;In the year 1808, amidst Napoleon's European conquests, Prince Regent D. Jo&atilde;o VI relocates the Portuguese court to Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro. In 'Rio 1808,' players step into the shoes of leaders from influential families, vying for nobility during this pivotal historical shift.&#10;&#10;Set against a backdrop of intrigue and opportunities, players dispatch their workers&mdash;represented as upgradable dice&mdash;to fulfill the wishes of royalty, construct iconic monuments, and sway both the church and society. Resource management is critical, with strategic delays in resource acquisition and a labor market where training workers enhances efficiency but also raises demands.&#10;&#10;As influence with the court grows, so does income, but the social complexities among workers intensify. The 'jealousy' mechanic among nobles, coupled with the constant need for gifts, adds a layer of challenge to societal ascent.&#10;&#10;At the game's conclusion, nobility is earned through the cumulative impact of influence, wealth, and achieved objectives. 'Rio 1808' delivers a eurogame experience set in colonial Brazil, featuring worker placement, influence control, and set collection mechanics. It provides a unique immersion into a crucial period in Brazilian history, where strategy and cunning are key to attaining the coveted nobility.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

They meet at local events, take photos with grass roots fans and then bash each other to bits.

We discovered the Royal Martian Federation (RMF), the Hielo, and the Myst; and made contact.&#10;&#10;Although historical rivals, we worked together to survive the frigid conditions, stockpiling resources and launching probes across the Milky Way.&#10;&#10;One probe returned compelling data from the Copernicus System in Quadrant 1. Coper has a yellow dwarf star and an intriguing group of planets. A dazzling radioactive element, that we named Vertium, was discovered. Our physicists think it could heat our colonies, and upgrade weapons and armour.&#10;&#10;As word spread, the rebel groups bolted for Coper. The fragile cooperation evaporated. Each faction is now out for itself - claiming planets and mining Vertium. The stakes are clear: for whoever controls the Vertium will control Coper and perhaps the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Brooks out.&#10;&#10;VERTIUM is a quick and tactical space colonization game for 1 to 4 players. Players are faction Commanders directing their Captains to claim planets and mine the powerful radioactive element Vertium.&#10;&#10;As influential moons orbit the colonized planets, additional Vertium is gained. However, you'll have to be wise and courageous, because your rivals have their eyes on your spheres and resources.&#10;&#10;Prepare for conflict.&#10;&#10;&#10;         There are 2 expansions included as well as SOLO rules. ** &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Expansion #1 - NEW DISCOVERIES:&#10;&#10;A new discovery has been made in Coper! Some planets contain a different radioactive element: Gelbon. Combined with Vertium, it powers a planetary weapons system named CUBE (Cubic U-Beam Emitter).&#10;&#10;Expansion #2 - SHADOWS OF THE COMPLEX:&#10;&#10;Through traitors and spies, the dreaded Complex has learned about the Vertium and tracked down the Rebels in Coper. The Complex has dispatched a squad of giant killer robots (aka the Titan) to eliminate their adversaries once and for all. To stand any chance of survival, the Rebel factions will have to lay aside their differences and work together.&#10;&#10;",

The board has a factory at the center (the target for the bomber), two fighter bases on the upper and lower left, and a bomber base at the lower right. The rest of the board is filled with images of colored airplanes connected to between 2 and 7 other locations (bases, factory and other plane images) by white two-way arrows. The bomber is silver; the smaller fighter figures have colored wings: red, yellow, brown, blue and green.&#10;&#10;The bomber moves first, along any arrow to an open adjacent space. The five fighters then move in turn, and the order must be kept the same from turn to turn. Planes must move if possible, but cannot move to a space already occupied.&#10;&#10;The bomber must reach the factory to drop its bombs and then return to base. It may bomb, move off the factory and return to bomb again without returning to base. If it bombs once or twice, it must return to its own base. If it succeeds in bombing three times, it may return to any of the three bases. If the bomber gets back to base, the bombing player wins.&#10;&#10;The goal of the fighters is to surround the bomber, occupying all of its adjacent spaces so that it is unable to move. The fighter player who makes the final decisive move to surround the bomber is considered the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Whenever you leave a place in the Board, you must take the Card corresponding to it. With this, there will be holes opened by the drawn chips, which will prevent the movement of the Markers. However, when you exchange the 5 elements and get the Yin-yang symbol, you can return with the 5 elements on the board and in any position, giving you another option. It will win the match who first get 3 Yin-yang symbols. You can also make exchanges, since the balance requires detachment, thus getting some element you need to complete the 5 required. You can change your placeholder, always respecting the Cycle of generation and dominance used in The Theory of 5 elements. Generation allows your player to change positions on the board. Dominance allows the player to move his Marker and pick up elements in the game. Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood must be balanced. That was the only way Yin-yang had been able to win.&#10;&#10;",

This was the slogan of Vichy France, which was formed after France's surrender to the invading Germans in the spring of 1940. Interestingly, while unoccupied Vichy territory was limited to southern and eastern France, the map of all of France behind P&eacute;tain is filled shoulder to shoulder by supportive French men and women.&#10;&#10;The full text of the final 1940 card reads: &quot;Marshal P&eacute;tain appeals for French unity.

Seven of these circles represent &quot;money cards&quot;, while the eighth is called the Poker Pool.&#10;&#10;To begin a hand, each player puts a chip in each of the nine circles; the dealer antes two chips in each. The dealer then passes out the full deck to the players, adding an extra dummy hand. If the dealer's hand contains no &quot;money cards&quot;, he may exchange it for the dummy; otherwise, he may auction the dummy, with the winner paying the dealer and replacing his own hand with the dummy.&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer starts by placing his lowest card in any suit in front of him. Whoever holds the next highest card in that suit then plays, and so on until the Ace of that suit is played. A player who is able to play a money card in its normal sequence collects that pot.&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the ace in a suit then leads his lowest card of a suit of an opposite color. Whenever players reach a gap caused by one of the missing cards in the dummy hand, whoever played last leads his lowest card in an opposite-colored suit. The first player to get rid of all his cards then collects the money in the central pot plus, from each other player, one chip for each remaining card held.&#10;&#10;The hands end with each player putting together a poker hand from his cards, with the highest poker hand winning the Poker pot. All chips still on the board remain there as players ante for the next round.&#10;&#10;The back of the game board provides a second game called Lucky Roll. It is played with 3D6, and players bet on either a total result from 3-18, or on a single number coming up at least once, twice or on all three dice. Whichever player acts as banker pays off the winners and keeps the remaining bets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you'll cultivate corn, beans and soybeans, and to win, you'll need to harvest more than your opponents.&#10;&#10;To do that, you must complete the patterns in the objective cards, all while outsmarting your opponents so they do not harvest before you. Each turn extra events can help you, allowing you to plant more, exchange crops, or even destroy parts of the farmland.&#10;&#10;Crop Rotation: Bug Plague contains the base game and the Bug Plague expansion. The expansion adds an action rondel as alternative to the die to define the turn's extra event. Each player must evaluate if it is Worth pushing their luck with the die or discard objectives to use the rondel and ensure the desired event. This lowers the base game's randomness and increases the game's strategic possibilities.&#10;&#10;But the defining characteristic of the expansion is the appearance of a locust swarm that endangers the whole farm. Using it, the game changes from competitive to solo/cooperative, and the players must work together to complete the objectives before the bugs devour everything.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After each round players can disrupt their opponents future flight plans by rolling dice to activate Stealin Steve the squirrel and Patch the pit-bull.&#10;&#10;Stealin Steve takes a resource from the location and any bird present, hording them in his nest.

For clarity, some rules sections have been modified not with content but with a new structure, e.g., additional subsections, more bullet points, or more images and examples&mdash;and even in-depth examples. Additional cross-referencing of rules expanded unit-image diagrams,&nbsp;large font size&nbsp;for easy reading and a detailed Index and Glossary have also been updated.&#10;&#10;Other new additions to the&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;v5.1 rules are numbered examples within each rules section and throughout the manual, to make referencing certain sections and subsections easier.&nbsp; The&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;rules manual has received high ratings and praise for getting players into the game and out of the rules.&#10;&#10;Changes to the rules can be easily spotted as they have been highlighted in blue text. We encourage new players to read the two gameplay narratives (for infantry and vehicles/ordnance) found at the back of the book before reading the rules, to familiarize yourself with how a scenario plays in an intuitive and observational manner. The LnLT&nbsp;v5.1 rules can be used with any previously published module, including the LnLT Solo system.&nbsp; The Core Rules have seven additional sections adding an additional 110 pages.&nbsp; The additional sections are listed below.&#10;&#10;Additional Manual Sections Found in the Core Rules:&#10;&#10;Infantry Gameplay Narrative&#10;Vehicle &amp; Ordnance Gameplay Narrative&#10;Outline of Play&#10;Charts and Tables&#10;Rule Reference&#10;Starter Kit TEC&rsquo;s, Scenarios, and Game Tables&#10;Starter Kit Counters and Maps&#10;&#10;The LnLT Core Rules can be viewed and downloaded via the Online Library&nbsp;including our Bootcamp Training Videos.&#10;&#10;Please Note:&nbsp;There is no difference between the Printed, PDF, or Online Library Editions except were noted.&nbsp; &nbsp;The LnLT Core Rules do not include any printed versions of our game map,&nbsp;counter sheet, or player aid cards.&nbsp; Our printed edition of the game map, counter sheet, and player aid cards are available within our&nbsp;LnLT Starter Kit product.&nbsp; The LnLT Starter Kit included with LnLT Core Rules is a Print and Play Edition.&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our LnLT manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

    "Description": "Cesare Borgia. We are in the Renaissance period in Italy. You are a hired hand of Cesare Borgia, the fearsome Commander of the Papal troops, and son of Pope Alexander VI. The Borgia clan gained power due to bribery, murder and intrigue which resulted in a lot of enemies. To keep them under the thumb, more bribery, murder and intrigue is required. All these actions are, of course, performed in the interests of the Holy Church and to protect the salvation of the poor Christian souls.&#10;Religion is not your concern. You&rsquo;re hired for the money.&#10;&#10;Cesare Borgia a board game of skills management and determination for 2-5 players set in the Renaissance period in Italy.&#10;&#10;GAME IDEA:&#10;Players try to perform missions in Italy and move therefore from city to city. To perform the missions, players require a mix of different skills: sabotage, theft, assassin and intrigue, represented by colored tokens. Money can be useful to acquire missing skills. Finally, to move, travel tokens are required.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw 2 tiles out of a bag and place them on the corresponded grid. The purpose is to form series of similar tiles. When this is done, you can exchange the tiles for tokens. With the right tokens, you can move and perform the missions in order to gain victory points (VP).&#10;&#10;GAME SET-UP:&#10;Place the game-board in the middle of the table.&#10;Each player gets a player board. Select one randomly or choose one. Make the choice by common agreement. Each player places his player board in front of him.&#10;Each player gets 6 tokens, one in each color. Three tokens are selected and placed on space 1 of the player board. The other three form a reserve and are placed on space 0. Each player takes his Heroic Exploit card which is placed next to the player board.&#10;Each player places the pawn of his color in Rome&#10;Shuffle the Mission cards and pile them in a facedown stack next to the game-board. Draw a first Mission card and place it face-up on Firenze (city n&deg;1). Then, draw a second Mission card and place it on Napoli (city n&deg;2). Draw a 3rd and 4th Mission card and place it respectively on Siena (city n&deg;3) and Ravenna (city n&deg;4).&#10;Put all the tiles in the cloth bag.&#10;Shuffle the Event and Upgrade cards separately and pile them in 2 facedown stacks next to the game-board.&#10;Place the Reference sheet next to the game-board. Keep the tokens and markers in a reserve aside of the game-board.&#10;Select a Start player randomly, which starts playing his turn.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY?&#10;Starting with the Start player, each player completes his turn in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of:&#10;&#10;drawing and placing tiles&#10;scoring lines&#10;exchanging tokens&#10;moving around the map&#10;executing a mission.&#10;&#10;You can mix up all these actions and perform them in any order. However, after executing a mission, your turn is immediately finished.&#10;&#10;EVENTS:&#10;Some mission cards mention &ldquo;Event&rdquo;. After placing a new Mission card, the player at the left of the active player draws an Event card and places it face-up upon an available Mission of his choice. Place the card in this way that all important info remains visible.&#10;&#10;Events mostly make the achievement of the missions more difficult by increasing the number of required tokens. Sometimes events yield an extra reward. In this case, keep the card among your fulfilled mission cards as a reminder. Other events are discarded when the corresponding mission is fulfilled.&#10;&#10;Some events show the roadblock icon. In this case, place or displace the roadblock marker on a path leading from one city to another. A path with a roadblock marker cannot be used. There is only one roadblock marker which must always be displaced, once it is put in the game. Discard the Event card after placing or displacing the roadblock.&#10;&#10;When the stack of Event cards is depleted, shuffle all discarded cards again and form a new Event stack.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME:&#10;The game is nearly finished when a player has reached or exceeded a certain number of victory points. Finish the ongoing round in order to give each player the same number of playing turns:&#10;&#10;Two players: 12 victory points required&#10;Three players: 11 victory points required&#10;Four players: 10 victory points required&#10;Five players: 9 victory points required&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has the most victory points. Occasionally, check the following tie-breakers in descending order: number of fulfilled missions, number of upgrades in hand, number of yellow tokens in stock or number of other tokens in stock.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Updated rules can be found in the 'Files' section of the BGG page or from the Paradox website (www.gamesbypetesanders.com). You will NOT require any new game pieces. !!!&#10;&#10;Paradox is a turn based card game in which players act as the offspring of leading timetravel scientist &quot;Doc&quot;. Doc, a genius and slightly extrovert scientist, has spent his career in the pursuit of time travel.  But Doc is becoming old, and needs to hand over his legacy before it is, ironically, lost in time. To select who will be his successor, Doc subjects you to the ultimate test, to return to the past in order to change history so that only one of you is born, sentencing your siblings to be the children that time forgot.&#10;&#10;Paradox uses cards to plot the progress of game time and describe the events happening in each day. Player markers are used to track the location of players through the various timelines that may arise throughout the game.  Players can change the events occurring in a day, create new timelines, or destroy timelines all together.&#10;&#10;A selection of time travel devices can be found allowing players to go back to the past, fast forward to the future, or move between timelines all together.  Astute players can use combinations of time travel devices and the correct event cards to go for the surprise win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player plays one card either face up or face down. If it's face-up, the player plays the effect on the card; if it's face down, the card just sits there.&#10;&#10;After playing a card either face up or face down, a player can declare that they're off to the ball! Each other player in clockwise order can choose to join them on this journey or not. Once everyone has decided, all face-down cards are revealed. If these cards collectively show at least one pumpkin, dress, rat, mouse, and lizard, then Cinderella indeed goes to the ball; everyone who thought they'd go to the ball then takes one face-down glass slipper card from that deck. If a pumpkin, dress, or rat is missing, but the Fairy Godmother is revealed, then the Fairy Godmother can replace one of those missing items. If not all items are present, then those who didn't go to the ball take a one face-down glass slipper card.&#10;&#10;In either case, all of the item cards are shuffled, then a new round begins. Once the final glass slipper card has been claimed (with anyone else who needs to score taking an item card to represent 1 point), the game ends. You then reveal the glass slipper that has been tucked under the Prince card at the start of the game, and whoever has the matching slipper claims this card (and its points). Glass slipper cards are worth 1-3 points, and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood in Space is a micro but complete set of rules for solitaire or co-op skirmish game, set on a sci-fi background. &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; refers to the small set of rules, the small time required to complete one game session and the small number of miniatures required (4-10 figures being a common range).&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven Scenarios covering iconic sci-fi scenes like exploring the planet surface, attacking an enemy base, searching an abandoned starship, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.&#10;&#10;Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.&#10;&#10;",

How times have changed...&#10;&#10;In The Hellfire Club two to eight players take on the roles of the destitute final members of an ancient aristocratic secret society as they recount&shy; the tales of their greatest adventures to the patrons of the shadiest public houses of Old London Town. Drawing on the cards in their hands for inspiration, the players will weave an ever more elaborate (although far from honest) tale of daring and adventure in the hope that the drinking den&rsquo;s patrons will offer them a penny for their woes. As competition for the pennies on offer increases, so too do the exaggerations and outright lies the players will tell about their role in the story in the hope of making themselves seem more deserving. But watch out &ndash; at any time another player can challenge your version of the story by playing a less impressive card from their own hand thereby revealing your exaggeration and taking the rewards for the story that would otherwise have been yours! When the tale reaches it&rsquo;s thundering climax, whoever has been given the most pennies wins the game!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;The Old Hellfire Club is a storytelling card game featuring push-your-luck and memory mechanic that add a spark of tension to an otherwise hilarious game. At its heart is the deck of 100 Boast cards. The Boast Deck includes 100 cards in 10 suits themed around a full spectrum of Victorian melodrama from motives and perils to crimes, insults, and teatime and each illustrated with an excerpt from an original Victorian era masterpiece! Players cooperate to tell a story including the plot elements from their own cards, but opponents can challenge the active player&rsquo;s boasts by playing less impres&shy;sive cards of the same suit with lower values. Thus, lies are unmasked, embarrassing truths revealed and any pennies earned by the active player that turn are lost!&#10;&#10;",

The initial scenarios supplied are between 3 and 5 turns (each turn is a game session).&#10;&#10;During these sessions, in consecutive impulses and in a card driven system, the players take action with their powers to obtain victory points (which are the objectives that each power pursues).&#10;&#10;Although there are economic and diplomatic actions, Ultima Ratio Regis is a military campaign game, so it is focused on the different naval or land campaigns that the powers carried out in the modern age to achieve their objectives.&#10;&#10;The military system is very original (it covers half of the rules), and with it, we not only fight great land and naval battles, but also sieges and long land campaigns of erosion of the enemy.  The scale of play varies depending on where we have our military units, but to give us an idea, a western land unit represents approximately a whole regiment, and a naval squadron about 10 ships of line or between 30 and 50 galleys in the Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;The game include a new system that prevents great uchronies, without over-directing the players.  In this way, the player with the most victory points accumulated between all his powers wins, that is, the one who has come closest to the objectives of the set of powers he is carrying.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Place museums and relics to the side as they are bonuses acquired during the game. Each player starts with five expedition cards in hand; if anyone holds an event card, they should discard it, and redraw until they have five cards, after which event cards are shuffled back into the deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, draw one expedition card, then choose to either send out the expedition team (i.e., place the specialist cards on the table), replace any number of specialists in hand by redrawing, or explore. You can explore only if you've already established an expedition team. When you explore, see whether the cards played match any of the artifact requirements on the table; the artifacts can be retrieved by consuming certain specialists, and the player can continue exploring the next card in the same continent as long as the requirements match. At the end of your turn, check that all four continents hold at least one artifact; if not, draw ten new culture cards and place them as at the start of play.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 5/7/8 museums or relics have been uncovered, depending on whether you have 2/3/4 players in the game. Players then tally their scores from artifacts collected, along with any bonus points they've acquired. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Arkham Asylum, violent and criminally insane villains are locked away from Gotham's citizens in specially constructed cells. But often, these villains break free and it becomes Batman's job to bring them back to the asylum before their darkest whims are realized.&#10;&#10;And, as is often the case, the Joker seems to be missing. Chances are he can be found in Jokerland, an abandoned fun fair the Clown Prince of Crime converted into his own playground. Here, attractions are functional, but from a mad man's point of view, and they aren&rsquo;t really fun in any conventional sense.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes two game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with three scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can&rsquo;t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won&rsquo;t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.&#10;&#10;-description from the Kickstarter page&#10;&#10;",
