You could set a time limit with halves or quarters controlled by a timer, play a set number of turns each before the match ends, or set a goal limit (ie: first time to three goals).&#10;&#10;",

Then check to see if the current objective is complete. If yes, place it in front of you and draw the next objective card then move the frog onwards one step in the grid. If no, just move the frog onwards.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the frog has moved up the grid (from left to right and bottom to top) and then reversed her journey back to the starting card in the bottom left.

If you're hoping to solve them, you'll have to put your intelligence and convictions to the test: are the facts about infernal creatures or simple mystificators ?&#10;&#10;Embody Detective Holmes, Dr. Watson, or Mystery Hunter Thomas Carnacki. Keep your mind clear, be methodical, question witnesses with tact, search places, find clues and confront the puzzles, because the hero is YOU!&#10;&#10;Sherlock Holmes: Enqu&ecirc;tes Surnaturelles is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ROBOTS! is a casual strategy card game where players try to collect robots&mdash;consisting of runs like 2,3,4 or sets like &quot;three of a kind&quot; in poker&mdash;while defending collections from the onslaught of robot violence. It's a race to collect as many points as possible while dodging freakin' laser beams and avoiding short circuits. It can be played with 2-5 players ages 12+ with a single game consisting of multiple hands, lasting about 60-120 minutes total.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;ROBOTS! is a take on Rummy meaning it's a &quot;draw and discard&quot; card game, but with a Take That mechanic.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; cards are removed from the deck and each player is given an &quot;Attack Card&quot; to help remember the rules. The most technically inclined player is selected to deal first (this is ROBOTS! after all). The dealer shuffles the deck and deals each player seven cards, clockwise starting to the dealer's left. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the center of play and the top card is turned face-up. The face-down cards become the &quot;Robot Factory&quot; and the face-up cards form the &quot;Scrap Heap&quot; (also known as the discard pile). The first player is the person to the dealer's left.&#10;&#10;The Player's Turn&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will first draw from either the &quot;Robot Factory&quot; (stack of face-down cards) or pick up one or more cards from the &quot;Scrap Heap&quot; (the face-up/discarded cards). If the player picks up more than one card from the Scrap Heap, the bottom-most picked up card must be played that hand in a spread (we'll get to that in a minute). Otherwise, picking the top card from the Factory or Scrap Heap does not require the player to lay down any cards at all; the player may save the card for later play.&#10;&#10;The player now makes a spread if they have the ability, although sometimes waiting can be a useful strategy. A spread must consist of at least three cards and can be:&#10;&#10;A sequence of numbered cards (run) of the same suit (color) such as all gray 2,3,4 or all purple 11,12,13.&#10;&#10;A set of the same numbered cards such as red 9, green 9 and blue 9.&#10;&#10;A star card can be used as either a 1 or a 15, but runs cannot wrap around. Red star, 2, 3 is allowed, but 14, star, 2 is not.&#10;&#10;The wild robot can be used in place of any number, but it will prevent the player from constructing a robot (stay tuned).&#10;&#10;These spreads will go in front of the player face-up for all to see. They will remain there until the end of the hand (or until an opponent blows them to bits with an attack card). The player can lay down as many spreads as desired on their turn, but they may never pick a card back up from a laid down spread. Once the player has completed their laying down of spreads (or of course done nothing), the player must discard a card from their hand to the top of the Scrap Heap. Be sure that all of the card numbers are visible since players may elect to pick these cards up on their turn.&#10;&#10;Ending the Hand and Scoring&#10;&#10;Play will continue clockwise until one person plays all of their cards leaving one final card to discard, thus ending the hand. Points are tallied and the dealer duties rotate to the left. Points are awarded for cards played in a spread such that:&#10;&#10;Cards numbered 2-9 are worth five points &#10;Cards numbered 10-14 are worth ten points &#10;The star cards are worth fifteen points &#10;Wild cards are worth zero&#10;&#10;The spread points are positive, but any cards still in a player's hand when another player discards their last card become negative. Yup, it's entirely possible to end the hand with less than zero points. Write the scores down and the dealer passes to the left.&#10;&#10;At this point, you might say, hey, this is EXACTLY Rummy. But no! We have robots, and these robots have special powers.&#10;&#10;Building a Robot&#10;&#10;If a player makes a spread of all five of the same robot, the player has &quot;constructed the robot&quot; and gets 50 bonus points in addition to the normal point values of the cards. However, if a player uses a wild card in the set, the player does not build a robot and thus earns zero bonus points.&#10;&#10;Remember those &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; cards we removed at the beginning? When a player builds a robot, remove those five cards from the hand and replace them with the corresponding &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; card. These robots are impervious to attacks. At the end of the hand, the robot is disassembled and the original five cards are shuffled back into the deck.&#10;&#10;Robot Powers&#10;&#10;There are also six attacks that take effect when the corresponding card is discarded to the Scrap Heap. These are powerful moves that can shift the game dynamic, but the actions are only playable on the high-point cards. Choosing to discard and play a powerful card means an opponent may either score them or use the power against you.&#10;&#10;The six powers are:&#10;&#10;Short Circuit: When discarded, choose a player. That player must place two cards from their hand on the bottom of the scrap heap. That player draws two cards from the robot factory.&#10;&#10;Tractor Beam: When discarded, place the bottom half of the scrap heap under the robot factory. Don&rsquo;t count this card and round up if the heap has an odd number of cards.&#10;&#10;Recycle: When discarded, take any single card from the scrap heap into your hand.&#10;&#10;Force Field: When discarded, the next player cannot pick up any cards from the scrap heap.&#10;&#10;Freakin' Laser Beam: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&rsquo;s sets under the scrap heap, this card lowest. If a set is broken, the remaining cards return to the owner&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Alpha + Omega: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&rsquo;s sets under the robot factory. If a set is broken, the remaining cards go onto the bottom of the scrap heap.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;The first player to score 300 points at the end of a hand wins the game. Feel free to change the victory points required to win to a lower or higher number to shorten or lengthen the game, respectively.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players use cards to create level maps, rooms, as well as positions for Items and Enemies.&#10;&#10;Playing is an exciting adventure of exploration, combat, and survival as you try to eliminate the viruses that are invading the Mainframe from another dimension and collect the key codes to unlock the Firewalls.&#10;&#10;Players begin each Level by drawing and arranging 16 Map Cards so they are all connected. As they move onto each Map Card, they are entering a new Room and then must draw 10 Room Cards and place them anywhere on the Room Mat.&#10;&#10;Then they draw 3 Item/Weapon Cards and 3 Monsters Cards. These may be placed anywhere in the Room, but must be at least 3 squares away from the Hero's starting position. Line of sight is critical, as players may not target objects behind walls and storage containers. Finally, they move through the Room picking up the Items/Weapons and defeating or avoiding the various Monsters.&#10;&#10;This process is repeated for each Room until they have picked up the 3 Key Codes to unlock the Firewall and advance to the next Level.&#10;&#10;Levels increase in difficulty as more Monsters are added every 3rd Level. Adding players means doubling the Monsters per Room and then everyone works together to clear each Level.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing and clearing Levels infinitely.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Throughout the game Rangers will build two areas: an Ecosystem consisting only of species in their BiOME, and a Sanctuary made up of any species in their hand. At the end of the game, points are awarded for different aspects of the Ecosystem and Sanctuary, and the winner is the Ranger with the most points.&#10;&#10;If using 1 Starter Pack between Rangers, each Ranger takes their 9 BiOME cards and the rest of the cards are shuffled. Deal the remaining cards evenly between the Rangers, up to a maximum of 9 each. Leave the rest aside. If each Ranger has their own pack of cards, they may select 9 BiOME and 9 non-BiOME cards for their hand (rather than randomly dealing). Each Ranger now places down an Eden card (the first card in your ecosystem) and 3 Sanctuary cards.&#10;&#10;DURING THE GAME&#10;&#10;The Ranger whose turn it is is called the Active Ranger and has 3 choices: Endangerment, Sanctuary or Clash.&#10;&#10;In Endangerment, ALL Rangers place a species into their Ecosystem (called an Eco card). The Active Ranger then rolls the die to see which danger (e.g. Persecution) must be overcome. Rangers use their remaining Holding cards (i.e. those not already in Ecosystem/Sanctuary/Life Cycle) to overcome the danger. If a Ranger can&rsquo;t overcome the danger, they lose the Eco card they just played, plus 1 of their Sanctuary cards.&#10;&#10;In Sanctuary, the Active Ranger only places a card into their Sanctuary. No more than 4 species are allowed in the Sanctuary at any one time.&#10;&#10;In Clash, the Active Ranger nominates another Ranger, and both choose a species from their Holding cards. Both cards are placed face-down on the table, and revealed at the same time. Follow the Clash matrix to find the winner of the meeting between the two species. Both cards are placed into each Ranger&rsquo;s respective Life cycle (the discard pile) and rewards/punishments enacted (see full Gameplay guide for Clash matrix and outcomes).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;When a Ranger runs out of Holding cards or Sanctuary cards, the game enters Brumation. Each Ranger still in play then has 2 turns as Active Ranger each, before the game is finished. At this point, each Ranger counts their score from their Ecosystem and Sanctuary (see Gameplay guide for scoring system), and the winner is announced.&#10;&#10;The starter pack features 54 amazing species, including 9 cards from the Forest, Desert, River and Scrub BiOMEs, 7 cards from Sky, 6 cards from Coast, and 5 cards from Mountain!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tobago: Volcano, playable only with the Tobago base game, complicates your search for hidden treasure.&#10;&#10;In the original game, treasure awaited under palm trees, next to huts, in forests, and in the mountains. Thanks to a volcano that takes up seven of the board's hexes and now towers high above the game board, lava comes into play. During set-up, each player places a triangular tile of three hexes near the island's perimeter, with one of these hexes being covered with lava; the player's ATV starts on another of these hexes.&#10;&#10;During the game, you can violate the normal rules of card playing by laying down an illegal card, e.g., &quot;not in the mountains&quot; when an &quot;in the mountains&quot; card was played earlier for this treasure, after which you immediately cover this card with one of the four new volcanic clue cards included in this expansion: next to/not next to the volcano and next to/not next to lava. Once this treasure is claimed, the volcanic card is returned to the side of the playing area for subsequent use.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player collects an amulet, they add another hex of lava to the game board, whether adjacent to the volcano or lava already in play. This means that the island will transform dynamically throughout the game, possibly moving treasures to locations where no one suspected them previously. After all, the largest forest might not stay the largest if overrun by lava, and the forests themselves might even disappear completely!&#10;&#10;During a turn, an ATV can travel over lava &mdash; but not stop in lava &mdash; if the player spends an amulet or (if they have no amulets) discards their largest treasure card. Don't let your travel routes get cut off by the lava flow...&#10;&#10;",

These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.&#10;&#10;b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.&#10;&#10;c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MEGAcquire GOLD is my next step in continuing the quest to expand Sid Sackson's magnificent ideas and get them onto as many gaming tables as possible. You can secure a new challenge based on an old, favorite, and familiar game for the price of $80 plus shipping to your location after production is complete in May 2022. Not a cheap cardboard rendition of an icon, on which the pieces slide across the board, but a tough durable plastic edition with an expanded board and hexagon shaped tiles. Double the possibilities, double the fun, and an outcome undecided until the end.&#10;&#10;We have made a few minor changes from the production run of MEGAcquire and this next production run of MEGAcquire GOLD. The money has been changed to prepaid debit cards and the denominations have been raised to 1, 5, 10, &amp; 50 million. Who will become the first billionaire in MEGAcquire GOLD? The rule booklet has a new cover and included in the booklet is a sample game narration to help first time players and a Stock Price Extension Chart that is used to help calculate payouts when companies are bought out and at the end of the game. We have also enlarged the tile holders and redesigned the box insert for better storage. The company markers are being made in three different shapes to better designate the difference in their starting price value and to give them a 3D effect. The playing tiles will be gold. So as the board fills up during game play, it turns to gold!&#10;&#10;MEGAcquire GOLD is an exciting journey of strategy and luck, for three to six players, through the corporate world of building empires and wealth. Live in the world of fun and fortune as you maneuver to outwit your opponents. Build and merge companies while shrewdly buying, trading, and selling stocks to become the wealthiest player. Each player builds companies by adding tiles, and they increase their wealth by purchasing stocks in these companies. Cash flow is obtained by selling majority and minority shares through mergers. It is not always prudent to have the most stock in the biggest company if you can build and sell enough smaller companies to generate a large income. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of the corporate world, but you will always need the &ldquo;luck of the draw&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;MEGAcquire GOLD will appeal to players of any age who like the feeling of power that is acquired through achievement. It is recommended for ages 13 and up, but cannot be limited in age because of the early possession of business savvy that can be found in younger players. Average playing time is two to three hours, but shorter time limits can easily be set.&#10;&#10;MEGAcquire GOLD is a perfect learning tool to teach younger people a sense of how the world of investing works. It illustrates how investing in stocks can be very strategic, but at the same time requires some luck. They learn how their wealth can grow as they build their companies, and how their cash flow can increase by selling companies, while subsequently using the profit to make more investments.&#10;&#10;MEGAcquire GOLD is played on a 15&quot; x 13&quot; plastic board that contains 182 hexagon spaces with 182 corresponding hexagon tiles. The hexagon shape allows six different ways to connect. For MEGAcquire GOLD, the board will be colored silver and the tiles will be colored gold. Therefore, as the game progresses, it turns to gold. Each hexagon is labeled with a designation A-1 through N-13 and each tile has a corresponding designation for its place on the board. Each player draws 12 tiles to start the game and then draws a replacement tile after each turn. The tiles are used to create and grow companies. While creating and growing these companies, the players buy, trade, and sell stocks in an attempt to become the wealthiest player.&#10;&#10;There are 14 different companies to choose from when building an empire -- seven hotels and seven corporations. Each company has a colored Company Marker that represents that company's designation. The companies have different starting values that include low, medium, &amp; high-priced companies.&#10;&#10;The seven hotels are:&#10;Luster - Red - 2 million starting price per share&#10;Teton - Yellow - 2 million starting price per share&#10;Arcadia - Dark Blue - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Global - Brown - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Fanfare - Green - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Krause - Teal - 4 million starting price per share&#10;Regal - Pink - 4 million starting price per share&#10;&#10;The seven corporations are:&#10;Unity - Beige - 2 million starting price per share&#10;Solon - Gray - 2 million starting price per share&#10;Watts - Purple - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Helix - Orange - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Digital - Baby Blue - 3 million starting price per share&#10;Quasar - Charcoal - 4 million starting price per share&#10;Physics - Burgundy - 4 million starting price per share&#10;&#10;The markers for the hotels and corporations are &quot;buildings.&quot; The &quot;small buildings&quot; are used to designate the lower priced companies. The &quot;medium buildings&quot; are used to designate the medium priced companies. The &quot;large buildings&quot; are used to designate the high priced companies. Each marker is colored to match the company it represents.&#10;&#10;There are 25 stock certificates for each company. When the supply has been purchased, there are no more stocks available unless a player trades some back to the bank when they are out of money or the stocks are returned through mergers.&#10;&#10;How To Play MEGAcquire GOLD:&#10;&#10;Players can play one tile per turn. When two hexagons are placed together, they form a company. The player who places the tile that starts the company gets to chose what company they want from those that are available. The player then receives a free share of stock in that company as a founding bonus.&#10;&#10;Players are allowed to purchase six stock certificates of any company on the board during their turns. By receiving the free share of stock, the player who starts the company always has control of keeping majority shareholder status in that company unless they decide to purchase something else before they hold a &quot;true majority&quot;. Since there are 25 stock certificates for each company, a true majority is attained when a player owns 13 shares. No other player can purchase more shares than the player who holds 13 shares.&#10;&#10;Stock values increase as tiles are played that grow companies. The Information Cards are used to keep track of stock prices and shareholder bonuses as the companies grow and merge. As the companies grow, smaller companies will be merged into larger companies. This is accomplished when a tile is played that connects two companies together. The larger company always takes out the smaller company. If the companies are of equal size, before the merging tile is played, the player who plays this tile gets to decide which company will survive.&#10;&#10;At the time of the merger, the players who hold first and second majority in the smaller company receive bonuses, and all players who hold stock in the smaller company have the option to sell their stock for the current market value. A player can choose to keep their stock if they expect the company to open again. When a tile is played that merges more than one company, the companies are cashed out starting with the smallest company first.&#10;&#10;Companies are considered &quot;safe&quot; when they reach 21 tiles. A &quot;safe&quot; company means that they can't be taken over by a larger company and will remain on the board until the end of the game. Tiles that would connect two safe companies cannot be played. Instead, those tiles are turned over on their designated spaces on the board and new tiles are drawn. Companies can increase in value up to the level of 101 tiles.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 120 million. Investing this money is based on the tiles in a player's hand and the companies they can grow. When a player runs out of money and it is their turn, they can trade stocks they have purchased for other stocks that are more beneficial to their portfolio. Yet they can only trade the amount of stocks it takes to raise money for the stocks they are purchasing. Players cannot trade stocks for cash.&#10;&#10;A large amount of money can be generated by opening and selling small companies, which creates cash flow to reinvest. But conversely, a large wealth can be accumulated by holding majority in the larger companies. The winner needs the ideal mix of investing, and a little bit of luck, that provides the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;It takes approximately two to three hours to fill the entire board of MEGAcquire GOLD, but shorter time limits can be set. If you only want to play for an hour and a half, just be sure to let all players have equal turns and end the game at the designated time. At that time, all companies are cashed out at the current market value, which is based on the number of tiles in the company. All players count their earnings and the player with the most money is the MEGAcquire GOLD Master.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each section is modular, making it easy for players to use the appropriate rules, and to select the exact level of game detail desired. More than 20 different sections are included, among them:Blunt Trauma: When Body Armor stops a bullet, it only stops the penetration; it does not necessarily stop the severe bruising and possible broken bones which may result from the bullet's impact. The wounds caused by non-penetrating rounds, called Blunt Trauma, are fully discussed.&#10;&#10;Smoke: A common factor on many battlefields, Smoke provides vital protection from the enemy during dashes across streets and open areas, towards hostile positions, and during retreats. The full effects of Smoke are explained including the duration of Smoke clouds generated by Smoke Grenades, the effects of wind on the cloud, and the partial visibility possible while the smoke clears.&#10;&#10;Blind Fire: The standard response to enemy Smoke screens, Blind Fire (firing without being able to see the target) can also be vital in house-to-house fighting, when pinned by enemy fire, or providing harassing fire against unseen opponents.&#10;&#10;Among the other sections included are: Ballistic Accuracy; Weapon Reliability and Weapon Damage; the Three Round Burst; Explosive Ammunition; Permanent Disabling Injuries; Effective Minimum Arc; Optical Scopes; Spotting; Cover Generation; Large Scale Battlefields; Leadership; Ground Burst Explosions; Mines and Traps; Time of Flight; Evasive Action; Recoil Recovery; Off Hand Fire; Free Actions; Skills; Training; and Experience.&#10;&#10;-from the back of the book&#10;&#10;",

Or for the second throw you could decide to keep the pair and throw the remaining three dice getting a pair of fives, now you could mark it as two pair, 22 to the second column. Or you could hold on to the two pairs and throw the last dice third time, getting another five that you could mark as a full house, 27 to third column.&#10;&#10;4th column is forced column from top to bottom, where you need to start from triple ones followed by triple twos etc. 5th column works similarly, but from bottom to top, starting from the yahtzee followed by sum etc. You can't skip any, but you can mark a dash (0 points) if you so choose or are forced to. For the 4th and 5th columns you can use 3 throws.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

On the AP&rsquo;s turn, it will resolve the focus card in the &ldquo;5&rdquo; slot of its focus row and reset that card to the &ldquo;1&rdquo; slot. To assist with that, the AP has its own set of unique focus cards, designed specifically to remove decisions from the AP&rsquo;s turn so that you won&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re playing for the AP yourself.&#10;&#10;And what&rsquo;s more, the AP isn&rsquo;t just for solo play. It can also be used in games with up to three human players to provide an additional opponent against which you must compete. Will you coexist peacefully with the AP, manipulating it to your advantage and turning it against your human opponents, or will you team up with the other humans to carve up the AP&rsquo;s territory for yourselves? The decision is yours.&#10;&#10;-description by the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fubuki-class are described as the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;modern&rdquo; destroyer, twenty-four of the class served in the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were built between 1926 and 1933, and despite being decidedly older than some of their adversaries, they remained formidable opponents until the end of the war.&#10;&#10;Of the twenty-four vessels, only two survived the war, with eight sunk by submarine, two by mines and many by air attacks. Notably, the Ayanami traded fire with the battleship USS North Dakota during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, inflicting severe damage, but was then set upon by USS Washington.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

They performed every task expected of a destroyer, including anti-aircraft, anti-submarine and more traditional surface-based actions.&#10;&#10;They served almost exclusively in the Pacific during World War II, capable of covering the vast distances required by fleet actions. In total, Fletcher-class destroyers accounted for the destruction of 20 Imperial Japanese Navy submarines. &#10;The 'Fletcher-class was considered a successful design and many went on to serve in the Korean War and at Vietnam.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Each set must show a (not very) plausible reason for missing work, the real activity the slacker is pursuing, and one to four methods of attaining the necessities for survival while not working: food, cash, shelter, and transportation.&#10;&#10;Players begin each turn with up to five cards in hand, discarding and replenishing before actually playing cards into sets. The discards are placed in front of the player - replenishment cards can be taken from the draw pile or from other players' discard rows. Once the player has five cards, he/she creates and adds to sets.&#10;&#10;Points for sets are calculated from base card values, card combination multipliers, and bonus card conditions.&#10;&#10;For example, the player might start a new set with the &quot;Fell Off The Roof Again&quot; Excuse. She adds the &quot;Building a Couch Fort&quot; Activity and the &quot;Van Full of Nuns&quot; Transportation card she picked up from another player's discard pile.&#10;&#10;Each round ends when at least three complete sets have been created and a player declares &quot;Back to Work-ish.&quot; Total up the sets, and the slacker with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Six historical and hypothetical battles are presented in this Scenario Pack, including:Soviet Intervention in Baku: When ethnic strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis went out of control in early 1990, Soviet troops were called in to bring order to Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. This Scenario is a night street battle between Soviets and a crowd of well-armed Demonstrators.&#10;&#10;Crackdown in Latvia: In January of 1991, the Soviets sent troops into seven different Republics in an attempt to end nationalist movements. In this Scenario, Soviet Special Forces fight Latvian police for control of the Interior Ministry building, in a battle that was televised internationally.&#10;&#10;Other Scenarios cover Black Berets in Lithuania, Vigilantes in Azerbaijan, and Ethnic Strife in Georgia. There is even a Scenario for what might have happened if the Soviet military had tried to kill Boris Yeltsin during August's failed Coup. Each Scenario includes a detailed Map, special rules, and full data for all the combatants. Also included is background material for each of the Scenarios, plus an overview of the Soviet military and security forces.&#10;&#10;-from the back cover&#10;&#10;",
