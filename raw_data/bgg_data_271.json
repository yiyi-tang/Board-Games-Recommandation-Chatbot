    "Description": "Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;The 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BASIC DESCRIPTION:&#10;The Skip-Bo Dice Game attempts to translate the original Skip-Bo card game into a two- to four-player dice game. It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;The game includes 12 dice, three in each of four colors, and 17 mission cards. Each three-die set of set of dice includes a normal six-sided die, a six-sided die with the 2 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo, and a six-sided die with the 4 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo. The 17 mission cards include three-number sequences (i.e., 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 1-3-5, 2-4-6) or descriptions of three-number sets (i.e., all dice same, all dice even, all dice odd).&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Each player takes a three-dice set and one of the mission cards is revealed. All players roll their dice attempting to roll the sequence or set shown on the revealed mission card. Rolled dice that match a portion of the mission card can be saved aside when the remaining dice are rerolled. A player may use one Skip-Bo wild logo to represent a needed die on the mission card. When a player's rolled dice match the sequence or set shown on the mission card, he or she calls out, &quot;Skip-Bo!&quot; and collects the mission card. Another mission card is revealed and play continues until one player has collected five mission cards, winning the game.&#10;&#10;PACKAGING:&#10;This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label. The top of the can pops off (twist to open). The one sheet of rules, 12 dice, and deck of 17 mission cards fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin. The tin also has a coin slot in the top that serves no purpose for the Skip-Bo Dice Game.&#10;&#10;",

All cards cost the same but have varying resale values (some are even worthless).  Complete sets are worth more, and some commodities are worth more than others.&#10;&#10;Assassination can be attempted if you land on one of the two Assassination squares, on the same square as your victim, or once per go around the board if you have enough money (500 k$, forfeiting your turn to do so).  Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).&#10;&#10;Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a geopolitical simulation of local influence in the Middle East on the flow of oil supplies to the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.&#10;&#10;You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.&#10;&#10;To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.&#10;&#10;From the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:&#10;&#10;A political strategy game&#10;&quot;In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival. That means energy and the key to energy is oil. In this game there is but one object - and that is to survive&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Unlike many other cooperative games, players cannot see each other&rsquo;s cards. On top, they are not allowed to communicate with each other to provide hints about the cards they hold. Over the course of 1 to 12 missions, between 1 and 5 players will fight a series of terrifying monsters. Each mission requires the player(s) to defeat 7 monsters without running out of cards; their fate is in your hands!&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player must select and perform one of the following 5 actions:&#10;&#10;Fight - Play one of your action cards face-up next to the monster card on which your hero disc is located.&#10;&#10;Move - Whenever you move your hero disc from one monster card to another, you must discard 1 action card from your hand.&#10;&#10;Recover - Draw action cards from the draw pile, so that you hold up to 5 action cards in your hand. No matter how many cards you draw, you must then discard a card from your hand, face-down.&#10;&#10;Support - Give one or more cards from your hand to a fellow player. The receiving player must then discard at least 1 card from their hand to the discard pile, face-down.&#10;&#10;Consult the Oracle - Draw the top 6 action cards from the deck and place them face-up on the table. Choose and discard one of those cards. Then return the remaining 5 cards to the top of the deck in any order of your choosing.&#10;&#10;A mission is won when the last Chimera is defeated. However, if a player ever holds no action cards in their hand AND has to draw from the depleted draw pile, the mission is lost. On the other hand, if the draw pile is depleted but the players can still take turns with the cards in their hands, the mission may still be won.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.&#10;&#10;To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.&#10;&#10;Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.&#10;&#10;The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.&#10;&#10;Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.&#10;&#10;And so it goes.&#10;&#10;This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.&#10;&#10;",

The actions are: drawing a stop, drawing a trail, and building a camping lodge. In order to draw a trail, the player must draw either a straight line or a line with a single 90 degree bend in it between two of their own stops.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered by the requisite number of boards being filled with camping lodges. Points are awarded for each area that a player's trails go through, animals that can be seen from their trails, and building camping lodges next to stops. Points are lost for any stops that are not connected at the end of the game. The player with the highest total points across all the boards wins.&#10;&#10;Rift Valley Reserve is a highly tactical, no luck, game that offers much strategic depth whilst using a very simple ruleset meaning the game appeals to gamers and families alike. Try to score the most points while blocking off your opponents; no crossing, branching or using of other players' infrastructure is allowed.&#10;&#10;",

Each player manipulates his aircraft on a grid which simulates air space. 255 counters.&#10;&#10;This game places two sides in a jet (era) dogfight. Each player starts with 3 planes, chosen from 14 different types available. One side are the 'Intruders'. the other 'Interceptors'. Each turn represents 30 seconds of real time. There are a variety of missions and you may use whichever aircraft you want, so that you can guage the different performance capabilities of each craft. This is an old-fashioned wargame and has been superceded by much more realistic (although also much more complicated) games, but if you like the theme and you want a quick, 'fun' wargame, this is ideal.&#10;&#10;",

Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.&#10;&#10;A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In The Enigma of Leonardo, players try to collect keys by creating patterns in the cards before them on the table.&#10;&#10;To start the game, deal each player ten cards. Each player takes five of these cards at random, places them in a + pattern, then turns them face-up; the other five cards form that player's hand. Each card has two of twelve symbols in the upper-left corner.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player replaces one card in his + with a card from his hand, moving the first card into the + of his left-hand opponent in the same location; that opponent discards the card that was in that location. If a player creates a horizontal or vertical line of cards which each feature the same symbol, that player takes a key card showing that symbol. (A player can claim a particular type of key only once.) If all five cards in a player's + show the same symbol, the player can claim any key card that he does not already have. The first player to collect seven key cards wins.&#10;&#10;The Enigma of Leonardo includes rule variants featuring additional ways to play.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The player can place either, but once he places a Sweetness '3', he must continue to do so exclusively&#10;Scoring is n(n-1), where n is the number of cards:&#10;0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, &#10;110, 132&#10;Special Colour Tree&#10;Points 20, but only if no other apples of this colour are outside of the bad batch.&#10;Loses 20 if an apple of the same colour is played outside of the bad batch. &#10;This card cannot be placed if there is a card of its colour anywhere but the Bad Batch. However, a card of the same colour may be played at the cost of all points for this batch.&#10;Unlucky batch&#10;Sweetness must add to 13 or worthless. &#10;Points: Square numbers per card used, but only if hit 13 exactly!&#10;E.g. two 5s and a 3 would be 3 cards, so 9 points &#10;9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144&#10;Fortepiano Height Batch&#10;Points are the difference in Height between each pair * 2. Heights may not be the same.&#10;E.g. Heights 1&amp;5=8 points. 2&amp;3=2&#10;Max: 48&#10;Sweet Couple Batch&#10;7 points for each 2 of the same Sweetness. &#10;Each pair must have the same Sweetness to be played.&#10;Max: 42&#10;Steady Height Batch&#10;Rule: Height must be within one of the previous cards each time. &#10;E.g 3-3 or 3-2 or 3-4&#10;Points: Odd Prime numbers&#10;I.e 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41&#10;Max: 41&#10;Bad batch&#10;-1 point for each tree planted here. (0/1 points on easy mode)&#10;Max: -12&#10;&#10;The game ends when each player has 12 cards, and the winner is whoever has the most cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tactics III&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Malta! is an easy-to-learn, light strategy/group game for at least two players. On a modular board with moving, turning, and disappearing spaces, players vie for a good board position and a strong hand. On every turn, players draw based on their piece's location, play half their cards, and move. They lose if they run out of cards during their turn or are on a space where they cannot move. The cards' effects vary from useful to nasty, and so playing more cards may be more of a curse than a blessing. As players get eliminated, will you be the only player to not lose?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are a freelance journalist working in the city of Arkham. One day you hear about a mysterious ritual taking place in the underground cellar of the city&rsquo;s prestigious Miskatonic University. You and your team decide to infiltrate and investigate the ritual anonymously, in the hope of securing the next exclusive. Without much thought you step into the cellar, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long before you come to regret your decisions. The cellar is a shrine to ancient god and the horrifying ritual is tearing apart the minds of those who participate, causing them to go insane!&#10;&#10;In the dark and musty cellar, worshipers are passing around artifacts. The light is dim so you can&rsquo;t quite make out the artifacts you are passing around. However, further away in the distance you get a glimpse of what others are holding. You can see the effect these magical artifacts are having on their bearers. You will need to deduce what you&rsquo;re holding by studying the other worshipers.&#10;&#10;Preserve your sanity and escape from the ritual alive!&#10;&#10;Game Play Overview&#10;&#10;In Arkham Ritual, you don&rsquo;t see the card you are holding. Instead, you see the cards other players are holding. You must guess the card you are holding by looking at other players&rsquo; cards and the cards that have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple rounds where each round consists of multiple turns. During each turn, one player draws the top card of the deck, looks at it, and passes it to another player. The player who receives the card has a choice either to a) discard the card he / she is holding face up and take the new card without looking at it, or b) pass the card to another player without looking at it. After a player takes a turn, another player takes his / her turn.&#10;&#10;The round continues until one of the round end conditions is met, at which point all players reveal their cards. At this time, if you are holding a cursed (red) card, then the card corrupts your mind and you lose your sanity. If you are holding a sane (blue) artifact card but some other players are also holding the same artifact card (regardless of their color), the artifacts create an unpleasant resonance, corrupts your mind, and you will lose your sanity. You successfully survive the ritual only if you are holding a unique sane (blue) card.&#10;&#10;Players lose their sanity by discarding sanity markers. New rounds continue until one or more players have lost all their sanity markers. All players who still have sanity markers survive the ritual. Will you successfully investigate the ritual and come out alive!?&#10;&#10;Components&#10;28 cards&#10;30 sanity tokens&#10;7 player aids&#10;1 play sheet&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is from the Bananagrams (letter tiles in a banana) company.&#10;&#10;The Pairs in Pears game involves making pairs of intersecting words that consist of tiles of all the same pattern. One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).&#10;&#10;The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).&#10;&#10;The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.&#10;&#10;",

The trick, though, is that items of cutlery lie all over the floor, blocking your way to the treats along with the shelving units that stand in the middle of the floor. As in the original Kakerlakak, the cutlery items have a pivot in their center, and players can turn the cutlery during the game to open and close paths.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she rolls the cutlery die, then moves the cockroach 2-3 spaces based on the number of pips showing, turning an indicated piece of cutlery before, during or after the move. She then rolls and moves again. Starting after her second move, an opponent rolls the cook die after each movement, and if the cook shows up, that player's turn is over and the dice pass left to the next players. Alternatively, if a player reaches her goal, her turn ends.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach all four of her food goals, then reach the hole in the kitchen floor wins.&#10;&#10;Kakerlakak includes action rules that speed up gameplay. The cockroach and cook players both roll simultaneously, with the cockroach player moving as quickly as possible because as soon as the fifth cook face is rolled, the turn is over.

The realm was thrown into bitter conflict as each of the nine houses vied for power over the others &ndash; each seeking to reunite the broken Empire under their rule. This conflict became known as the Game of Crowns.&#10;&#10;In Game of Crowns, each player takes control of one of the nine noble houses. During the game, players can exchange cards and favors through diplomatic relations, or directly attack opponents through warfare in order to take what they want.

As far as the artwork for the box, the Milton Bradley people had their staff do that.  At one point, the amount of sales was over a million and it approached two million.&#10; Thank you for your interest about the game.
