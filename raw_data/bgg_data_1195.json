The corpses from a hundred battlefields have risen up and are now intent of devouring the last few remaining flickers of life in this truly accursed land.&#10;&#10;Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies is a post-apocalyptic survival game in a ravaged Renaissance world where small bands of survivors battle the hordes of the undead in a desperate bid to prolong their miserable lives for a few moments more. Each player will control one or two survivors and must withstand the fiendish scenario created by the umpire. The rules include a detailed profile of each survivor character explaining their attributes and skills. A fearsome array of armaments are available - the finest of black-powder technology - not to mention the best of the stabbing, hacking, impaling, smashing, crushing and slicing - close combat weapons available to the Renaissance soldier. But the survivors will need to be prepared, a terrifying array of undead creatures are arrayed against them. The rules describe a variety of different undead threats, from slow, stupid and frankly rather confused zombies, to faster moving more predatory undead creatures and even grossly fat zombies that can explode infections zombie goo all over an unlucky survivor.&#10;&#10;To make matters worse for the survivors, the umpire has at their disposal an extensive deck of &quot;event-cards&quot;. These create a wide variety of unforeseen, awkward and even downright dangerous situations that can trip up the most prepared band of survivors - from fumbling weapon handling and misfires, accidental powder explosions, to bad omens and even accusations of witchcraft. And to start players off, there are two starter missions included and guidelines for creating your own testing and terrifying scenarios using the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is a world where the weak are crushed and the strong survive, where those who are bigger and more powerful bully those who are weaker and more vulnerable. It is a world at war, with armies clashing violently on the fields of battle. A great general is needed to lead these armies, and that general is you!&#10;&#10;Chronicles of Blood is a game where you, the reader, takes on the role of an army commander in the world of Arax. It is your job to fight lead your troops to glory, destroying the enemy and either saving or conquering the world, depending on the army you choose.&#10;&#10;Arax is a dark and dangerous world and a time of reckoning is approaching. The ancient empires of men, dwarfs and elves are crumbling, beset on all sides by the dark hordes of the orcs, goblins, demons and the undead.&#10;&#10;The once magnificent elven forests, at one time beautiful, green and lush, are now withering and dying, the magically-crafted towers and wondrous tree-cities that lie within broken and shattered. Only the elven talent at manipulating mana, the magical force that permeates Arax, has stopped their race from being wiped out.&#10;&#10;The dwarven fortresses built high in the mountains of Arax are now overrun with goblins, who burrowed up through the earth and attacked from within the otherwise impenetrable fortress walls. One by one the fortresses fall and, although the dwarven courage and skill with weapons is legendary, even they find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of goblins pouring in to their homes.&#10;&#10;And humanity find themselves sorely pressed on all sides, their cities and towns constantly raided and besieged. The barbaric orc tribes march down from the north, pillaging everything in their path. The necromantic legions from the southern desert kingdoms shamble forward, unrelenting in their march towards the human lands. Some humans even turn against their own, worshipping demonic powers in secret and plotting the downfall of their race from within.&#10;&#10;The final battles that will decide the fate of Arax are fast approaching. Soldiers line up on opposite sides of the battlefield, ready to lay down their lives in service to their commander. Will you lead your troops to ultimate victory, or will you fail in your leadership and suffer humiliating, crushing defeat?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FAST ATTACK CRAFT RULES FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1950&#10;&#10;A SET OF QUICK REFERENCE SHEETS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE&#10;&#10;The rules are for the recreation of small naval engagements with Fast Attack Craft such as missile boats and smaller warships, mainly in coastal waters. The period covered runs from the late 1950&rsquo;s onwards and allows for the use of aircraft and helicopters.&#10;&#10;The new 2nd edition of the rules has been updated to incorporate our standard A&amp;AGE initiative system, where play alternates between both sides, with the winner of initiative deciding who will move the first unit each turn.&#10;&#10;To represent the uncertainty of modern warfare units on both sides may start the battle as unidentified &ldquo;blips&rdquo; or Contact Markers. Forces with inferior technology may be forced to deploy their units on table, rather than being &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;, while superior forces may have more &ldquo;blips&rdquo; than units, making it more difficult for the enemy to detect where the real units are. A Contact Marker may be detected and become a radar contact, though that must be visually identified before it can be attacked. You can only attack (or be attacked) if your unit has been placed on the table as a model.&#10;&#10;Movement is regulated by means of a system of speed settings, which reflect the maximum and minimum speeds at which the vessel may move in the current turn. The settings may be changed at the end of the turn to plan next turn&rsquo;s movement, and they may also be altered due to damage.&#10;&#10;The Combat system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and resolution is split into a Launch Phase, typically when missiles are fired against enemy targets, and a Combat Phase, where hits by all are resolved and damage inflicted. The subtlety here is that each Phase operates separately, with the order of actions alternating between the players. In the Combat Phase, the active ship does all its direct shooting, but at the end of its actions all incoming missile attacks are resolved against it. Damage it now suffers may mean that any missiles it has launched, and which have not yet been resolved, may become ineffective.&#10;&#10;Damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. It is also possible for vessels to suffer Special Damage, which further degrades their ability to function. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti-aircraft fire with guns and missiles.&#10;&#10;We have updated the game set up and introduced a simple points value system for players who want a relatively balanced game. There is also now a system of determining victory or defeat, based on the level of damage each force has suffered. This system represents the effect of damage to valuable assets forcing one or even both sides to retire rather than lose ships.&#10;&#10;There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.&#10;&#10;They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules provide players with all they require to fight land wargames set in the Second World War involving the major nations involved. We have included France, Germany, Great Britain and the Commonwealth, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. This decision was influenced by the availability both of models and of reliable source information to help create the game data. We wished to be able to depict the sometimes subtle differences between different national characteristics, particularly regarding Infantry organization and equipment, and differences in both weapons and vehicles.&#10;&#10;This book contains everything the Player needs to play the game. This means the rules, and the data tables. We decided not to include extensive organization tables or scenarios. There is a wide range of material readily available which Players can use when putting their forces together.&#10;&#10;Players should feel free to prepare their games using historical formations, for which we provide guidelines about Unit structures, or they can be completely free form with Units put together as the players wish. You should not, however, mix both styles. Historically, armies did use some fairly ad hoc formations such as German Kampfgruppen with various arms of service all mixed together in Units. It was also quite common in the Western Desert for both sides to make use of captured equipment, which would give your games an additional exotic flavour.&#10;&#10;The basic Units in the game are Platoons of Infantry or Tanks, and Batteries of Artillery. An Armoured Unit consists typically of 3-5 model vehicles; an Infantry Unit has 2, 3 or 4 Bases of Infantry, each representing a Squad; an Artillery Battery usually has 4 Guns, though there could be fewer or more depending on historical practice. It will normally have an Observer and, if it conducts an attack affecting an area, could be Off-table.&#10;&#10;An Infantry or Cavalry Base represents a squad or troop, based on historic organizations. Some nations have fewer squads making up a platoon, though the individual squads may have larger numbers of men, giving them a better Saving Throw. We do not make use of lower level detail, such as who is actually holding any Special Weapons such as a PIAT or Bazooka.&#10;&#10;There are a number of important features in this set of rules.&#10;&#10;The Game Turn does not follow a strictly IGO-UGO method, though Initiative is determined in a traditional fashion.&#10;&#10;Each Game Turn, the Players get a variable number of Orders which can be assigned to any of their troops. The number available is dependant on the number of Units in action and the effectiveness of their Commanders.&#10;&#10;A Game Turn is split up into a number of Phases, which alternate between Players. In each Phase a Player can Activate one of his Units and carry out one or more Orders, depending entirely on what the Player wants to do. Each Order is regarded as an Action representing 1 to 3 minutes.&#10;&#10;When a Player decides that he has taken all the Actions he wishes to with a Unit, play transfers to his opponent, who Activates one of his Units. This means that as the game develops, each Player must choose which enemy threat to react to, and which can be ignored. When a Player has run out of Orders, he can no longer Activate any Units. His opponent continues to use his Orders, and when he has used his last Order the Game Turn ends.&#10;&#10;This system of alternating Unit Activation means that there are fewer Game Turns, but a large number of Activations and some Units may be able to make sweeping advances across the table (with all the attached risks).&#10;&#10;Each Order expended is deemed to Fatigue a Unit, making subsequent tasks more difficult. In some cases, Fatigue is in fact just that, physically tiring a Unit. In other cases, such as when firing Ranging Rounds for Artillery, which is not going to tire out the troops particularly, Fatigue represents the effect of time being taken to check on fall of shot, etc. Players must make a decision whether to expend a higher proportion of the available Orders on some Units, at the expense of others.&#10;&#10;The Fog of War is also present in the form of Contact Markers. These represent the uncertainty surrounding the location of the enemy. These allow the Commanders to keep the location some of their Units uncertain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hidden Territories is a game of heroic adventure, where mighty &mdash; or cunning&mdash; heroes explore  the kingdom of Westri, the nexus of the multiverse and filled with perilous monsters, nefarious enemies, and fantastical locations. Players choose one of a multitude of adventurers; their characters traverse the land encountering members of the various factions who vie for power or terrible beasts hungry for flesh &mdash; or souls. The kingdom of Westri and its inhabitants are fighting unseen forces, struggling against the grip of chaotic, entropic forces which threaten to rip apart the very fabric of the multiverse.&#10;&#10;Play solitaire or cooperative in this game of exploration, adventure, and heroism. Consult the huge volume of the gazetteer to utilize the pre-programmed paragraph system. It&rsquo;s easy to learn to play, as the programmed event sequence lets you focus on the fun of exploration as your character sets out on a quest. For each event or encounter, you, as one of the included hero player chapters, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful &mdash; or may cost you dearly. Hidden Territories has elements of a complex game designed to recapture the high adventure and heroic struggles of fantasy literature &mdash; and that famous fantasy role-playing game from the 1970s.&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories can be largely played solo, cooperatively, or even with a but of conflict between the players. But victory can only be claimed by uncovering the true nemesis of the kingdom, and defeating a final adversary. It is a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armor, artifacts &mdash; even and allies. Game play sessions extend and continue, with linked quests. Time passes, and events are influenced by player choice. Heroes must use strength at arms, guile, or negotiation to defeat a hidden and ancient evil before a magical darkness envelopes all that is good.&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories combines many different elements:&#10;&#10;     Exploration: player characters travel across the hexagonal game board to reach exciting destinations.&#10;     Random encounters: players draw encounter cards each time they enter a new hex.&#10;     Parlay, fight, or flee? many events result in opponents to negotiate with or to fight.&#10;     Random events: players draw event cards each time they enter a new tile&#10;     Leveling up: players improve their characters&rsquo; skills and knowledge of magic and gain equipment.&#10;     Paragraph Reading: an extensive plot is uncovered by reading paragraphs out of a book, discovering secrets only denizens of the kingdom know, or piecing together parts of the conspiracy puzzle. Clues help with solving mysteries and help determine how to win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories features a series of Event and Encounter card decks that set pace of the game and ensures players acquiring experience to level up before they are ready to take on more difficult challenges (events and enemies). Characters acquire new spells and skills as they level up from experience. Finding loot increases wealth, so more equipment, arms and armor, and other items can be acquired. Of course, travel is perilous in this wilderness hexcrawl, so provisions, foraging, and weather all impact the heroes&rsquo; progress &mdash; getting lost in the trackless wastelands can be as dangerous as stumbling about in the darkness of some ruined dungeon.&#10;&#10;Inside the box, Hidden Territories contains:&#10;&#10;     The large map game board, showing cities, villages, castles, and ruins scattered across 500 hexes means hours of game play exploration.&#10;     A huge Gazetteer that details the points of interest and other information about the hexes.&#10;     Standup figures representing archetypal warriors, knights, wizards, priests, and other fantastical characters.&#10;     Various decks of cards for events, encounters, items, spells, skills, and the denizens characters encounter. An analog artificial intelligence ensures outcomes are never fully predictable, and the storyline changes based on player choices.&#10;     Dice - lots of dice. Power up actions based on the dice pool, or sacrifice health or luck when heroic deeds are called for.&#10;     Numerous counters and chits to mark the location of encounters, hoards of loot, and other unknown obstacles to overcome. Use some of these to track weather, time, fatigue, and the ultimate countdown to doom.&#10;&#10;&#10;As scenarios play out and quests are completed, players learn lore, hear rumors, acquire knowledge, train to develop martial or magical powers. Talk, trade, or fight through bizarre encounters to unravel the dark secrets behind the impending chaos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pandora's fury is a tabletop miniatures game designed to let you play out skirmishes and battles in a Post Apocalyptic landscape.&#10;&#10;Set in the same world as &quot;Pandora's Wake&quot; RPG, the game lets you fight skirmishes and battles with any miniatures and in any scale.&#10;&#10;After the 'Pandora Event' an alien world known to us as 'The Other-Verse' has ripped holes in the skin of our reality, holes through which deadly diseases, carnivorous plants and killer monsters have swept across Earth and destroyed mankind's civilizations.&#10;&#10;In 'Pandora's Fury' you can play gangs of survivors battling for resources or simply fighting to survive or you can play swarms of creatures from 'The Other Verse' as they sweep across the landscape, destroying all they encounter.&#10;&#10;Includes rules to convert your 'Pandora's Wake' RPG characters to the Pandora's Fury miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The world is ending.&#10;Not in a single, catastrophic moment, but slowly and painfully, screaming out its dying agonies in prolonged death-throes that may last a generation. It is dying,  murdered by another world, a malevolent world, a world that devours all it touches and makes it like itself, a world the survivors of our world have dubbed &ldquo;The OtherVerse&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;In Pandora's Fury the players will create groups of survivors who are struggling to stay alive in a post apocalyptic world that is being over run by the incursion of the Other-Verse and its hostile flora and fauna, which are slowly and inexorably turning our world into a copy of their own.  Survivors must battle these hostile elements of an alien world, gather supplies and deal with other bands of survivors, some hostile, and some not, to try and survive in a world gone mad.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the early years of the fall of human civilisation, several back woodsmen have survived due in no small part to their isolation from larger pockets of habitation. The Alien diseases which ravaged the cities after &ldquo;The Pandora Event&rdquo; ripped a whole in the fabric of our reality, letting the Other-Verse in, have yet to trouble the small community.&#10;&#10;The residents of Blackwood would like to keep it that way.&#10;&#10;The small community has already begun to fortify itself with barbed wire and by constructing other fortifications, including a watch tower. Now they have also begun to clear the woods closest to their micro community in order to create a field of fire and to remove cover form any one or any thing that may try and approach the small community and may seek to do it harm.&#10;&#10;While out felling trees, however, some of the locals discover that there are already creatures from the Other-Verse lurking in their woods, and they are hungry!&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The Blackwood Chainsaw Massacre&rdquo; is a skirmish scenario designed for the &ldquo;Pandora's Fury!&rdquo; rules but which can be easily modified for any other skirmish rules you like. Statistics for the combatants are included, using the Pandora's Fury! rules system. Use any scale or miniatures you like.&#10;&#10;The Scenario pits lumber jacks and townsfolk against the horrors of the Other-Verse in a desperate fight for survival.&#10;&#10;This scenario was featured in the games room at Moria Con 2015.&#10;&#10;",

He collected a mixed force of 5 companies of the 3/60 Rifles, some artillery and the Mounted Squadron formed by men from 58 Rifle. Arrived at the plateau of Ingogo, known also as Schuinshoogte, he met the Boers who started to fire with precision, pinning the whole column.&#10;The precise aim of the Boers neutralized the guns first and pinned the British on the plateau; to reduce pressure, Colley ordered the Mounted Squadron to attack, but the Boer fire blocked the attempt. As well, the charge of Captain MacGregor with a company failed as well.&#10;A fierce thunderstorm broke down and the situation for the British worsened as they suffered fatigue and exhaustion; as evening fell, Colley realized that his men would be able to stand there and ordered a retreat; the Boers did not guard the British convicted that they were in no position to move from the heights and thus the British managed to escape.&#10;&#10;Will you manage to pass the plateau or will you defeat the Empire with your burghers?&#10;&#10;40 gorgeous counters, a colorful A4 map and English rules wait for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the scale we use, 10cm represents 1 nautical mile to 10cm. The rules incorporate weather, spotting, submarines, aircraft, shore batteries and minefields. They take account of Crew Quality and allow for the use of Contact Markers to represent the initial uncertainty of exactly where the enemy forces might be.&#10;&#10;The gunnery system is simple and you roll 1d10 to hit with each gun. When you score a hit, an innovative damage system takes account of the gun calibre and range to determine which type of dice is used to test for penetration and the amount of damage inflicted. Torpedo and Mine attacks use a similar mechanism, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system. Not all guns can engage all vessels, and the largest guns have a minimum range. Simple aircraft rules allow for air attacks against ships and for air to air combat.&#10;&#10;In line with the intention of the rules to provide a simple system, armour is standardised for each type of vessel, and guns are grouped by calibre into 10 classes. Detailed differentiation between the performance of specific guns and ships is not present.&#10;&#10;A collection of ship data is provided covering significant vessels from 10 nations in this period, with over 300 vessels. A simple conversion system allows you to create game data for ships not in the lists provided.&#10;&#10;The rules also include the Order of Battle and pre-prepared data sheets for all the ships that took part in the Battle of Jutland.&#10;&#10;Recommended scale: 1/1200 TO 1/6000&#10;Complexity: 5/10&#10;Level of detail: 4/10&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It sounds like a group, gathered and talking. As you move closer, you spot them, another party of dungeon-delvers, standing in a circle by a fire, laughing and showing one another their finds. You want that gold. You deserve that loot. You cry out, sword raised and your party charging behind you. Tonight, the treasure will be yours! Just before you clash, however, several skeletons begin to crawl from out of the ground, shuffling to their feet and now standing between you and the opposition. The battle, now begins...&#10;&#10;Death in the Dungeon is a set of tabletop miniatures rules for skirmishes between dungeon-delving parties. It is presented in a classical zine-style format and will be released in a series of issues, this being the inaugural release. Death in the Dungeon focuses on party progression with attention to scenarios, story and treasure. Use gold to build a team of adventurers, choose their race, class, outfit them with armor, weapons and items, then send them into the dungeons beneath the world of Kith.&#10;&#10;When a game of Death in the Dungeon ends, it truly doesn't. Your party information is saved and tracked and between skirmishes, you can progress the members of your party, buy new weapons, items and more. The game and progression continues until you and your opponent or group decide to end and begin a new campaign.&#10;&#10;Death in the Dungeon was written and created by CPOP owner and founder, Neuicon and pays homage to the old school. Included in the initial release, are: a background and introduction to the world of Kith, the core rules, rules on party and adventurer creation, rules for spellcasting, scenarios, rules for looting, rules on handling progression, advanced weapons and items tables and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game would later become CPOP's flagship title and see a rise in popularity due to its many, many insane influences: thrash metal, synthwave, over-the-top violence, gore, horror, exploitation, action, fantasy and the post-apocalypse, all of which would be mashed up into a bad 80's Italian film and spew forth, the Toxic Holocaust, also known as the Goremageddon. Add to it, the ability to create gangs and every member of your gang from scratch, including their traits, weapons, equipment, abilities, spells, mutations, vehicles, the ability to see action on the very first turn and much, much more, and you have in your hands a game of maximum overdrive.&#10;&#10;An Overdose of Death! allows you to create a gang and every member in that gang from scratch (purchasing the unit's base rank, traits, abilities, equipment, weapons, mental or physical mutations, spells and more), play in three different modes (standard, boss and grudge), fight on battlefields in 2 by 2 to 4 by 4 feet in size, play a variety of scenarios and through several different battlefield conditions, field vehicles and totally customize your vehicles from scratch and much, much more.&#10;&#10;We welcome you to revisit the original second edition, originally released in 2012, along with everything ever released for the game, such as: Toxic Holocaust 2: An Overdose of Death! (introducing six factions: the Wasteland Warriors, Unholy Crux, Skravers, Reptors, Thermonuclear Warriors and Omega Corporation), Waste in Space: the Fatal Feast! (introducing two new factions: the Doom Legion and Prophets of Mars), Saalythic: Rise of Deraathis (introducing the Saalythic faction) and Black Inferno: the Raiders of Atlantis (introducing the Raiders of Atlantis faction).&#10;&#10;Included with your purchase is a 1920 by 1080 HD wallpaper of An Overdose of Death!, so that you may adorn your screen with the madness of the Goremageddon.&#10;&#10;We welcome you to the Goremageddon.

    "Description": "The World Undone (TWU) is a new operational, division level WW 1 system inspired by the brilliant late John Young&rsquo;s The Marne. What results is an extremely simple, nuanced, and quick playing, immersive simulation of the first big German victories of WW1. Play is broken down into a simple Move-Combat-Move-Combat phase for each side, with units participating in the first combat phase unable to move or fight during the second. The game covers August 13 to September 13th covering both the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. Separate CRTs are used for German and Russian forces to reflect differences in quality and doctrine. This is an extremely low complexity game that I hope will be able to draw new players into wargaming, and remind old players why they started gaming in the first place. The World Undone will be a 3 part series covering East Prussia, Galicia and the Western Front (maybe Serbia/Austria too).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined through a simple Clausewitz-inspired Victory Point ratio system determined by control of towns, important objectives, and casualties.  Scenarios cover Tannenberg, Masurian Lakes, and a &lsquo;Campaign game covering both operations. Variants allow for additional replacements to change the balance of things. The Russian player can win automatically by taking Konigsberg, while the German player can win automatically by eliminating a percentage of Russian SP.  Players can combine the Galicia, East Prussia and Serbia Games together to simulate the entire Eastern Front in 1914.&#10;&#10;SCALE: 1 day turns, 2-3000 men per SP, 7.2 Kilometer hexes (4.5 miles)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All you will need is a pencil, three dice, and about five minutes.&#10;&#10;Each round, roll two dice and fill in one of the scoring zones. Some zones need to be filled in a certain way, and most will cause some sort of effect, so the order you fill them in is important. If you ever can't fill a zone, you'll lose a ball. Lose three balls and the game is over.

Everybody's places their pawns on the board and they try to avoid the &quot;it&quot; from catching their pawn. If  &quot;it&quot; catches a pawn , he/she places it randomly on the board. The board indicates some sounds (animal sounds, human sounds etc) and the person who had this pawn must immitate this sound. &quot;It&quot; has to recognise him/her . If so, the person who recognised gets a penalty card and becomes the new &quot;it&quot;.&#10;&#10;Side B (green) : The &quot;it&quot; chases the other people by rolling dice. There are also 27 character cards (with 3 dinstict elements each)and everyone takes a secret caracter card trying not to reveal their character as they run to escape from &quot;it&quot;. If the &quot;it&quot; catch a player, he/she can ask them 2 more questions and if he/she find their secret character they take a penalty card and they become the new &quot;it&quot;.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the 6 penalty cards, everybody checks their own penalty and the person with the fewest cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is in this sky colony where you will find Earth&rsquo;s most powerful, wealthiest, and most influential individuals.&#10;&#10;These people enjoy having the largest portion of the pie, not to mention toying with the lives of everyone else on Earth &ndash; the Underbelly, as the inhabitants of Stratos love to call it. But you are not the type who tolerates these kinds of apathetic, arrogant attitudes. You must challenge these oligarchs and get into Stratos; you consider this action to be a show of defiance, proof that the leviathan city is not exclusive to the powerful few. &#10;But first, you must establish a name in the Underbelly, a strategy that will help in getting you and your crew into Stratos. Unfortunately, this is a journey that's not free from danger. Stratos has tight security, and authorities have their eyes on the gates 24/7. Anyone caught entering illegally is subject to instant termination without trial.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, you have found a way in. The Tubes &ndash; vertical shafts that serve as the city's waste chutes. The Tubes will be your one-way ticket to wonderland, your only chance of acquiring a large portion of the pie. Of course, you will need the help of your crew to get in. So hone your skills, upgrade your abilities, and procure as many supplies as possible to achieve your objective.&#10;&#10;You must employ cunning strategies and pick the juiciest missions among the lot. Regardless of which faction you choose, remember to use their key abilities to your advantage. That&rsquo;s how you can outwit the competition and eventually win the game. So do you have what it takes to become a part of Stratos' elite citizenry?

    "Description": "A brief history of Runya&#10;The Kingdom of Runya is one of the 7 great Kingdoms in this&#10;world.  What makes Runya special is the vast number of games&#10;you can find that are capable of earning your living.  Each week there are large tournaments that pay cash prizes.  Once per month in each of the 8 regions of Runya, the winners of weekly events are invited to a Regional Tournament.&#10;&#10;Regional winners are automatically entered in the annual event held in the capitol city of Liberia.  The National tournament is the largest event in the Kingdom and is played over the course of 7 days.  Players bring their avatars and compete in a series of randomly chosen game types.  Brackets include solo play as well as teams and occasionally players will be forced into co-op situations with competitors.&#10;&#10;This year, the main event of the Nationals is a new dungeon&#10;crawling game, aptly named &ldquo;Dungeon Crawlers&rdquo;.  Who will&#10;come out on top?  Let&rsquo;s find out!&#10;&#10;In this game you'll play as one of 8 Heroes from the 1st Season of the &quot;Legends of Runya&quot; series.&#10;&#10;Game Setup aka (Building the Dungeon)&#10;&#10;1. Ensure all meeples are in the drawing bag and shake them up.&#10;&#10;2. Separate and stack all the decks Floor tiles, find the 4way starting tile, then shuffle the rest and put it on top of the deck.&#10;&#10;Shop cards, shuffle all 20 shop cards and deal them into 4 stacks of 5.&#10;&#10;Potion cards, put 3 potions on top of each stack of 5 shop cards&#10;&#10;Boss/Treasure cards, With the treasure pile or boss faces UP, shuffle them blindly (Yes, this means that you will KNOW which boss is coming up. Place them strategically)&#10;&#10;3. Each player choose an avatar from the 8 Heroes.&#10;&#10;4.  The person who chose an avatar first will place the first tile in the center of your play space.  (This will be the 4way tile with blue lights in the corners).  Place 1 gem in that room and roll the Monster die to see how many monsters are in that room.  (Then draw them at random from the meeple bag.  Continue taking turns clockwise placing tiles and spawning monsters using the Monster die.  This continues until you no longer can place a tile or you have placed all of them.&#10;&#10;THE ENTIRE DUNGEON WILL BE BUILT BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS&#10;&#10;Rules for placing tiles and spawning monsters&#10;1.  You MUST place the 4way tile FIRST&#10;2.  Starter tiles must leave space for the shop cards behind them.                            &#10;3.  As long as at least ONE corridor connects, you can place a tile.&#10;           (Yes, even if 2 other corridors end at a wall)&#10;4.  When you place a starter tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die.&#10;                  (Starter tiles are free of monsters)&#10;5.  When you place a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die, instead, you take the top card from the Boss/Treasure deck and place it on that tile face-up (Monster details up, Treasure chamber picture up)&#10;6.  Whenever you roll a 5 or 6 on the Monster die, that room gets a gem due to it&rsquo;s difficulty to clear.  Whoever kills the last monster in that room gets the gem.&#10;7.  Once all tiles are placed and Monsters have been spawned, place a shop outside of each starter tile&#10;8.  Place avatars on the starter tiles with the picture of your chosen Hero.  If the starter tile for your Hero didn&rsquo;t get placed, place your avatar in the 4way tile. &#10; ONLY THOSE STANDING IN A STARTER TILE CAN SEE INVENTORY IN THE ATTACHED SHOP  &#10;It is a secret what items you have available in your shop when you start.&#10;&#10;Now you are ready to play!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To play cards on the table players must build sets and runs of cards, rummy style.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;The Shuffle Game of Life is an exciting card game version of the popular board game, perfect for travelling and a quicker game! The game play lasts for approximately 20 minutes and is suitable for ages 7+ with 2-4 players&#10;The aim of the game is to be the first person to get 100 life points by getting rid of all the cards in your hand by playing them onto the table. To play cards onto the table you must be able to make sets and runs or add to other players sets and runs. How to play &ndash; Each card is worth a certain number of points which accumulate as you play them onto the table. At the start of your turn take a card from the draw pile or discard pile (your choice), if you can make a set or runs then play them onto the table in front of you.&#10;A set is three or four cards showing the same career or house but in different colours. A run is three or more consecutively numbered cards of the same colour. If you can add cards to another players set or run on the table during your turn. &#10;You need to play all the cards from you hand as quickly as possible to score life points, that&rsquo;s why it is worth adding to other players sets and runs. The game also includes wild spinner cards these can be any number to complete a set. At the end of your turn you must always discard a card onto the discard pile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We provide rules for six kinds of cartoon vehicles: Conventional, Wacky, Spooky, Futuristic, Superhero, &amp; Supervillain. You choose a vehicle type &amp; a theme that fits your vehicle. Next you pay points to purchase Add-Ons (cartoon weapons, special abilities, hazards, tricks, &amp; so on) that fit your theme. A wide variety of possibilities are included so you can create (or recreate) almost any cartoon vehicle; the points system keeps them balanced.&#10;&#10;From 2 to 6 players race their toy cartoon cars using a simple simultaneous movement system; attacks are also simultaneous. Collisions &amp; attacks are resolved quickly. If a car loses all of its damage points, it Blows Up, loses some Cheers (which you collect to be able to win the race), moves back 2d6&rdquo;, then keeps on going. All of this means lots of action &amp; very little down time for players.&#10;&#10;C4 plays quickly &amp; is suitable for both younger players &amp; older players with short attention spans (like most gaming groups, in our experience). It plays faster than most other car combat games &amp; can get pretty hilarious at times.&#10;&#10;With 6 vehicle types, 6 cartoon themes, 15 customizable weapon types &amp; more than 40 customizable add-ons to choose from, you&rsquo;ll be able to create or recreate just about any &lsquo;toon vehicle imaginable &ndash; as long as you have a toy vehicle that can represent it. The points system keeps them balanced, so a Wacky baby bird in a jalopy or a beagle sitting on a doghouse with imaginary machine guns can cause just as much mayhem as a Superhero in a specially designed ubermobile.&#10;&#10;",

Old assumptions have been challenged and &lsquo;lost&rsquo; data has been deduced through diligent research and conservative conjecture. Some ships that were so shadowy in detail to border as myths have been documented and detailed and made worthy of hitting the game table. When coupled with the explosion in the availability of gaming models in both 1/600 and 1/1200, it is clear that Anaconda required an expanded points list.&#10;Yes, the game includes the basic calculations that allow gamers to generate the point values, but hey &ndash; here at Blue Water Designs, we got your back!&#10;&#10;This is an expansion of the point lists within Anaconda.

Like in any government, corruption and self interest make getting things done nearly impossible. It&rsquo;s up to the player to navigate the political landscape keeping the people, the military, the monarch, and others happy while they pursue their goals. By passing and amending legislation, players can change the very makeup of the game, making it easier or more difficult to meet their ultimate end goal.&#10;   &#10;     The main venue of participation players can make it through using MP Cards. MP Cards come in three varieties: Actions, Amendments, and Events. Actions can be played at any time to win over MPs from across the aisle, help more of your party members get elected, and even filibuster a bill you don&rsquo;t want to pass. Amendments on the other hand are attached to a bill in question, only going into effect if it is passed by Parliament. Amendments could change the effects of a bill, alter the rules of the game, and even dish out some pork barrel spending to your constituents. The final type of MP Cards are Event, disastrous circumstances that affect whichever player has drawn the card. These Events can be from a crisis in your district, to an embarrassing scandal that ruins your reputation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The main character is Grace Flynn herself, the notorious pirate with her sword Tyrfrost and magical Bloodsilk sash.&#10;This book contains a complete rule set showing how models (the miniatures or markers for each character or enemy) move, fight and do actions in the game, such as searching for artifacts or swimming through shark-infested waters. There is also a small section on the flora and fauna of the Underlands, the subterranean region of a hollow Earth where Grace and her crew must escape.&#10;&#10;The core rules in this book are based upon the Song of Blades and Heroes (SOBH) game engine by Ganesha Games and are designed for fast and furious play with plenty of heroic action, ethereal magic and advanced technology, all handled with a few rolls of 6-sided dice. The rules have been designed for battle using 28 mm &ldquo;heroic scale&rdquo; miniatures, with one figure representing one character or creature.&#10;&#10;Game scenarios are played on a tabletop and require an area of 24 by 24 or 36 by 36 inches with scenic materials for terrain such as water, ruins, trees, and other obstacles added. Each scenario in the book has a map layout that shows where players and enemies start and where scenery can be placed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Space, 2120. FLT was discovered decades ago, along with a surprising number of inhabited worlds. Now, in regions throughout the galaxy, the search is on for mineral-rich asteroids. In Spacemaster 2120 your small mining craft will explore the 24 sectors of SR-227 and collect six types of minerals. Planets in the sector have different demands for these minerals, so to turn a profit you must plan your movements carefully and act accordingly. You&rsquo;ll also have to convince the inhabitants to trade with you &ndash; or use force to convince them. Fuel is no longer an issue, but you&rsquo;ll have to visit Earth for the turbo variety or convert some Uraninite. Other minerals can be used for various purposes, although it's usually better to deliver them for profit&hellip; and don&rsquo;t forget to watch out for those darn pirates!&#10;&#10;Spacemaster 2120 can be played on instinct, casually or seriously. Players can deduce what minerals (and to a lesser degree, planets) have yet to appear. They can look ahead one or more moves -- &quot;if I do this he will probably do that.&quot; It's up to the players. You can play aggressively or peacefully. The rules set is small, there is exploration, meaningful choices, screwage, a bit of combat and some luck. A typical sequence of turns for a player might be: explore, mine, move, try to trade. Lots of &quot;flow,&quot; fun and replayability to be enjoyed in this light and fascinating space game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Isles of Treasure players take the role of ship captains exploring the surrounding sea looking for treasure while avoiding marauding pirates and sea monsters. The board is made up of tiles placed face down at random during setup. All players begin at a shared stronghold. Players gather supplies until they feel ready to venture out to sea. Each time your ship moves it costs supplies, so the further out you venture the more expensive it is. You also use supplies to flip tiles face up discovering what is hidden underneath. What you find could be something good like an island to resupply on or search for buried treasure, or it might be pirates who ambush you and take everything in your cargo hold. Don&rsquo;t worry you can get revenge on those scurvy pirates, just resupply, sail out after them, and take back your treasure by force. The only way to ensure your treasure is safe is to get it back to the stronghold. Once there, it scores victory points for you. Until you get it back, other players can attack your ship and take it for themselves. The game is over once all of the tiles have been flipped face up. Whichever player has the most treasure safely secured at the stronghold wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
