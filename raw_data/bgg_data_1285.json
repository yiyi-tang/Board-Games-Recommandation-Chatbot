Designed to support company to battalion/task force sized engagements.&#10;&#10;Also includes a set of vehicle creation rules that are pretty straight forward.&#10;&#10;Envisioned using on a terrain table, not a hex map. That&rsquo;s why all values are given in centimeters instead of hexes. If you want to increase the scale, use inches; the values will still translate. Or, you can use a hex map and just translate all values into hexes. It&rsquo;s flexible.&#10;&#10;summary from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

You must lay low for a week and guard your take; there's no honor amongst thieves here, and everyone wants the most they can get. Plus, rumors are there's a snake in your midst that might be out to get the prize jewel for themselves, and a rat could be trying to foil the whole operation.Each player will be dealt a random crew card to tell you what your part in this band of thieves is. These are not hidden from other players, since teamwork is dreamwork, after all. Each person brings their own unique talent, or specialty, to the crew, usable throughout the game. You will also be given a random role card, possibly giving you a secret double agent part to play. These should not be shared and will affect how you can win the game. There are four regular crew member cards, one snake card, and one rat card. As with any squad, the more people you bring in, the likelier it is to have defectors.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of seven rounds, or days. Every day will begin with players taking turns to choose their actions for the day by placing a token on the box next to the action of their choice. For morning actions, you will use the numbers on your crew cards to determine turn order. After that, turn order is based on the last round's actions going from top to bottom on the action card in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Your goal, as the thief you are, is to hoodwink your way through the week, exchanging loot with players and the score to end up with the best take for yourself. Don't get too greedy, though! If you end up with more than the score, your zealousness will be shown, and the crew will take you out. The prized diamond is also supposed to be shared, so any crew member holding it at the end will mark you for an early demise, as well. Additionally, the bank loaded a tracker into the loot that will get you caught and disqualified if you're holding it at the end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Set the corner tiles aside briefly&#10;2. Shuffle the interlocking pathway and answer tiles&#10;3. Takes turns connecting tiles to build the board game configured into pathways through a garden &#10;4. Distribute and connect the corner tiles, generally at the end of pathways&#10;5.

The next clockwise player becomes the current player.&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME: &#10;The game is over when there are no more flowers on the pathways to collect. Players add up all the points on the flowers they collected. The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the youngest player wins.&#10;&#10;The simpler game uses a pair of dice to form equations. Game play is similar to above.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They finally place their player die on their Joker, with the one pip face up.&nbsp; These two players take on the role of a jester who is attempting to win over the Royal court.&nbsp; They will do this by playing quips on the Kings, charming the Queens to gain their favor, and utilize the Jacks of the trade to manipulate their opponents.&#10;&#10;There are specific movement rules for each card in the Royal Court, and the Jokers. which you can simply move to either adjacent card.&nbsp; Jokers are set by each player at the start, adjacent to two cards within the Royal Court, so moving from a Joker means you have two options.&nbsp; From the Kings, the players can move to any adjacent card to that King, meaning it has a number of possibilities, depending on where that King lies. From a Queen, a player may move anywhere within that Queens row, which gives players three options. Moving from a Jack, players must remain in that Jack&rsquo;s column.&#10;&#10;Once a player has moved to a new card, they initiate a Jest, except when moving back to a Joker.&nbsp; When a Jest takes place, each player must play a a card matching the color of the In addition to each face card having a different movement rule, they also have their own Winning Jest Scores, and Win Results. Unless the players happen to be on the same card, only the initiator (the one who moved onto the new card), may gain the Win Result for that Jest.&nbsp; When moving to a King, the player who plays the highest car, wins. The initiator may gain one Quip Point for winning.&nbsp; If a player moves to a Queen, the lowest card wins, and the initiator may gain a Favor Token for winning.&nbsp; Finally, on a Jack, the initiating player decides whether high of low will win, before the players play their cards.&nbsp; When the initiator wins on a Jack, they may take away a point of their choosing, either a Favor Token or Quip Point. If there are none to take, the initiating player gains a Favor Token instead.&nbsp; The end game trigger is when a player reaches six quip points, which is indicated by them turning their die with the six pip face up. The players will then compare scores, and whoever has the most points, Quip points and Favor points, wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Featuring beautiful space art. Players draw from a common deck and race to create enough celestial objects into their area of space to complete a common goal, which takes the form of a randomly selected Galaxy card. Once the goal is achieved by any player, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with 5 cards and draw 2 cards beginning each turn. Every card in the game is multiple use; play, resource payment or special discard ability. Cards are played from hand by discarding payment but each card a player controls will also generate a resource token during their turn which may be used for playing cards. The more a player controls the more powerful they become thus making it easier to play more cards.&#10;&#10;This game is about choices and sacrifice. And with many circumstantial abilities and effects the replay value is very great. There is also a planned expansion in the works.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A historical fiction game set in the &quot;age of sail.&quot; As the captain of a small sailing ship, you sail into uncharted waters where strange things happen from time to time.&#10;&#10;- The game board shows a map of the archipelago with marked sea lanes, which players will use to move their ship between islands. At the top is a large weather panel, with a Beaufort scale, as the wind strongly affects ships and possible actions. Thanks to the mechanics of uncovering weather tiles, players have an accurate forecast for the next two days.&#10;&#10;- In their turns, players can move their ships, fight with cannons or boarding, and perform a number of other actions, such as building facilities, buying or repairing ships, selling goods and valuables found on islands or at sea, and hiring captains, officers and sailors. Moving ships around the board is extremely simple, but good planning and the use of maximum speed can determine the outcome of the game, as sometimes, especially close to the finale, it is very important to get our ship in the right place at the right time.&#10;&#10;- Immediately after landing on an island, the player discovers the exploration cards there, which describe adventures, encounters, events or objects. You can find both good things on them (such as pirate treasures) and not-so-good things (plagues, dark forces, strange creatures...). So it's better not to approach this task without having a full crew and with the right action cards in hand.&#10;&#10;- Although the Misty Waters are unexplored, the archipelago is nevertheless full of native life forms. Some of them are humans... Players will face all threats, but also other players.&#10;&#10;- There are two trading posts with taverns on the islands. Here you can make profitable deals, gamble (inviting other players too!), meet &quot;interesting&quot; people, arrange risky tasks or missions for which you will need cargo holds, passenger cabins or.... cannons.&#10;&#10;Each player builds a deck of Action Cards, which in fact is a set of useful tools, such as weapons, additional sails, maps, tactics or experts that can help in difficult situations, significantly affecting the chances of victory. Since the number of Action Cards is limited - you need to choose them wisely, according to your preferred strategy.&#10;&#10;- Since the game is designed for 1-4 players, and each player can command up to two ships (6 different types), spectacular sea battles are not uncommon on Misty Waters. (Especially when the Galleass of the conquistadors sails out of the harbor, fully loaded with gold and jewels, and everyone wants to get it.)&#10;&#10;- In addition to the players' ships, there are quite a few &quot;AI&quot; tokens on the board, such as pirate and conquistador ships, sea monsters, cannon batteries, rafts, and trapped chests in the sea vortex. You can also come across unique units, such as the Flying Dutchman.&#10;&#10;- To win the game you must become the governor of the Misty Waters. You can achieve this either by: winning an election, conquering a certain number of islands, acquiring the legendary Conquistador Treasure. Often the fate of the game is weighed until the last minute.&#10;&#10;- Players can choose team play against other teams, solo play or solo mode.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards trigger actions such as being forced to swap more cards. Duplicate numbers deduct bonus points from your score (a good thing) but duplicate colours and shapes add points (a bad thing). When you think you have the lowest score you can challenge (but each player can only challenge once per round), and the player with the lowest score goes through to the next round, with play continuing.

At the start of a hand, shuffle the deck of 54 cards &mdash; the standard 52-card deck, plus high and low jokers &mdash; then deal 13 cards to each player. (With two players, each player draws two cards, keeps one of them, draws two more cards, keeps one, etc. until each player has 13 cards.)&#10;&#10;The lead player of a hand plays a card, and everyone must follow suit if possible; if they can't, they can play any card. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and whoever played this card places it to the right of their player sheet.&#10;&#10;Every other player looks at the props depicted on the card they played, marks off each prop on their player sheet, then places their card to the left of this sheet. A player sheet has a number of special powers (illusions) listed on it, with 3-5 props underneath each illusion. As soon as you've marked off all the props on an illusion, you can use it, whether now or in the future. What's more, each player who lost the trick takes an apprentice token and places it in their reserve, where they can have up to three tokens. You can add these tokens to cards played in future tricks to increase the value of your played card. Transform a 10 into a Jack, Queen, or King!&#10;&#10;At the end of the hand, score points as follows:&#10;&#10;&bull; For each card used to win a trick, 5 points.&#10;&bull; For each completed illusion, 3-5 points based on the number of props.&#10;&bull; For each suit, whoever has the most cards of this suit to the left of their player sheet scores 2 points for each card; ties are friendly.&#10;&#10;After you've played the proper number of hands, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;In the solo game of Illusions of Prestige, you deal two hands of 13 cards, look at them both, then keep one of them, shuffling the other one to represent your opponent. When you lead a trick, you flip cards from the opposing deck until you find one of the matching suit. When the opponent leads, you deal two cards and use the higher one.

The basic unit of play is the possession - defined as a period of extended control in the opponent's half of the pitch that may result in a shot. A typical game features 30-40 possessions and takes about 40-45 minutes to complete.&#10;&#10;All team and player ratings are based on actual statistics from the 2019-2020 EPL season. Team sets for 2020-2021 will be made available following the conclusion of the current season.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

With a list of what you need, you can roll the dice to move throughout the mansion, picking up items when you find them. Each time you look at an item in a room, whether you collect it or not, you&rsquo;ll draw an action card which may take you to a different place, and that may change your strategy for your next turn. The action card may help the hotel developer move forward to the front door, and that puts the pressure on you and the other players to complete the search before she makes it inside.&#10;&#10;Since you also need to put together a set of collectible books, all of which are piled in the attic, it&rsquo;s your choice when to go there instead of rolling the dice. And then there is the location to the secret passage. Each player has cards that offer clues, but you&rsquo;ll need to know who has what to narrow down the possibilities. If you are the first to work out where it is, you&rsquo;ll be able to move freely throughout the house, but you&rsquo;ll have to decide if it&rsquo;s worth it to spend your turn on the search for it, or if your time is better spent in other choices. Players who are familiar with Jane Austen&rsquo;s books will recognize characters and situations, but no knowledge of them is required to play. It&rsquo;s all about the search!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The cards might earn you money, or affect the next jump, or help/harm another player. Some cards are LD cards and laid down and then have benefits for every turn. The most important card is a players Hold card. It is placed face down and is a player's end-game strategy. Are you betting on Franco landing a great jump, or trying to profit from his fiery death.&#10;&#10;Every few turns/seasons Franco will perform a jump. It could be a luck jump by rolling a die, or a skill (dexterity) jump by sliding his vehicle token up a ramp and onto a target. Bad jump landings result in damage to Franco's vehicle and injuries to himself. His mechanic will need money to repair Franco's vehicles, and his doctor will try to double bill for any hospital visits.&#10;&#10;Each turn is a season of the year. So a game could last all 40 turns/seasons. However, the game could end abruptly if Franco dies or is forced into retirement because of excessive injuries. When the game ends, the player with the most money or glory wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &mdash; and after the first boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon, gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.&#10;&#10;Also included, Curses! Foiled Again! is an expansion for 5-Minute Dungeon that brings new challenges and abilities to the party in their quest to defeat the Dungeon Master. The expansion adds Boss Cards to the Dungeon, two new heroes (Druid and Shaman), and powerful Artifacts that can be activated once per dungeon to help the party. This expansion also adds support for up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Also included in the Big Box are several Kickstarter only exclusives all bundled together in a limited-edition Curses-themed 10.5&quot; x 10.5&quot; box!&#10;&#10;This is a Kickstarter Edition.

    "Description": "Ex nihilo is a highly tactical and quite novel stack-fighting game with an emergent checkmate-esque win condition. The novelty of this game lies in its central gimmick: Every move consists in moving a stack. In this sense it is a pure movement game. Yet, the game features both placement and captures.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;The game is for 2 players and is played with stackable pieces of two colors on a hexagonal arrangement of hexagons (a hexhex board). The board starts out empty. The game is over as soon as one player is unable to make a move. The other player is then the winner.&#10;&#10;Movement &ndash; overview: &#10;Stacks move along straight open lines and grow when they move away from the center cell. This game is unusual in allowing movement of stacks containing 0 pieces. It is by growing these that pieces get onto the board in the first place.&#10;&#10;Movement &ndash; details: &#10;On your turn, you must move a stack not topped by an enemy piece to an empty cell reachable through an unbroken line of empty cells. By convention, a single piece is considered a stack of size 1 and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;If, after you have moved a stack, it is farther away from the center cell than before it was moved (measured in number of steps), its size is increased by 1 per step further away from the center it now is. This is effected by adding pieces to the top of it from your hand.&#10;&#10;You may move a proper part of a stack by splitting it.  That is, if a stack contains several pieces you can choose to only move the top n pieces, given that you do not change their order, for any number n less than the number of pieces in the stack.&#10;&#10;You may also move a whole stack, but only on the condition that you move it farther away from the center cell. A consequence is that moving a whole stack always results in its size increasing. Together with the convention that empty cells contain stacks of size 0, this also has the consequence that you can effectively place a new stack on the board by moving a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;Note that nothing special happens to the cell you moved the 0-stack from &ndash; it still contains a 0-stack.&#10;&#10;Capturing &ndash; overview: &#10;Flanked enemy stacks are captured by being taken hostage for a move. Capturing is obligatory: If a capturing move is available, a capturing move must be made.  The winner will be the player who manages to force their opponent to capture an immovable stack.&#10;&#10;Capturing &ndash; details: &#10;If (and only if) the top piece of a stack is of your color, it is said to partake in flanking an enemy stack if (i) this enemy stack is exactly in the middle of a line of otherwise empty cells going from the flanking stack to another one of your stacks, and (ii) all three of these stacks are of the same size.&#10;&#10;If, after you have moved a stack, it partakes in flanking one or more enemy stacks, you must immediately move one of these enemy stacks. Except for the obvious difference that you are moving an enemy stack, all normal rules apply to this move. For example: If the captured stack grows (if you move it farther away from the center cell, that is), it grows by the addition of pieces of your color, so situations where this hostage move must itself be a capturing move are possible. Such chaining of captures must continue until you capture a stack that is not in a position to continue the chain. Growing captured stacks is the only way to take ownership of them more permanently.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
