Each card in hand gives players 2 choices of conditions to add to the conditions on the word stax in play. The more conditions, the more the stax are worth. If they can think of a word or phrase that fits all the conditions, they can claim the stack and all its points&hellip;for now! Players are aided by special cards which allow them to manipulate the stax and claim them for their own!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;5 cards are laid on the table representing the intitial stax (7 for a 3 or 4 player game), and each player holds 3 cards and 5 cubes in their hands. On a turn, a player places a card such that one additional condition is added to the stack. The player says a word that fits all the conditions of the stack and claims it for their own by placing a cube on the stack, then draws a new card. Claimed stacks can be claimed by other players if they can add a card to the stack. Special cards allow players to perform other actions such as swap, remove, or rotate cards. If a player cannot play on a stack, they discard a card from their hand and lose a cube permanently. When all players have either run out of cubes or cards to play, the game ends and each player recieves points for their claimed stax.&#10;&#10;Word Stax was an entry in the 2021 54-Card Game Contest, where it placed 4th for best solitaire game, and 6th overall.&#10;&#10;",

Anachronistic aesthetics and wicked machine designs bring the game to life.&#10;&#10;Planes Battle Buildings is a 2 to 4 player miniature strategic game. Each player controls a faction of miniature planes or walking buildings.&#10;&#10;Players then draw terrain hex cards to reveal and traverse the unknown landscape. The aim is for each player to gain area control, retain enough resources to maintain and expand their collection of planes or buildings. Conflict arises when players battle over terrain or attempt to pilfer the other player's resources.&#10;&#10;Game play is either skirmish mode (where one players wins all) or adventure mode where a scenario is chosen with its own unique set of rules for the players to follow.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This board game, simply named Charlottesville, is similar to Monopoly; players accumulate properties and try to bankrupt the other players. It was created as a business class project by local high school students, in approximately 1987-1988.&#10;&#10;The square board is filled with local Charlottesville, Virginia businesses which purchased the spaces. The box is decorated with the same artwork as part of the board. It comes with four pawns; two dice; round plastic chips to use like houses/hotels; play money sponsored by a local bank (Jefferson National Bank); property cards; two sets of 'Chance'-like cards, sponsored by Hallmark stores and the local Seminole Square shopping center; and a rulebook with a brief description of Charlottesville's history and location.&#10;&#10;Note that this game is very different from &quot;All About Charlottesville - Albemarle County, VA&quot; which uses a board made from large puzzle pieces and focuses on visiting businesses to complete a shopping list.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You will become siblings, and cook the traditional Tet tray together&#10;&#10;Summary of games&#10;&#10;The game has 3 stages including going to the market, cooking and completing the dish. After the market closes, players will check their trays and score points. The person having the most points will win. There are 4 traditional dishes that will be cooked including bamboo shoot soup, jellied meat,  square glutinous rice cake, and pickled onion. Each dish will correspond to 1 color and need 4 different ingredients to cook&#10;To set up, each player has 5 ingredient cards, the remaining cards will be called a market deck. The turn starts with the oldest person called the eldest brother/sister. The player takes 2 cards from the market deck, chooses 1 of the 2 cards to decide what to cook in turn&#10;Stage 1: Go to the market: You draw ingredient cards from the market deck&#10;Stage 2: Cook: You can put 1-3 cards into the pot. You can put cards that are the same color as the dish you are cooking, or different color cards.&#10;When you play a different color card, you will activate that card's function. However, if there are more different color cards than the number of players + 1, the pot will be destroyed and the dish cannot be completed.&#10;&#10;Stage 3: Complete the dish: The dish can only be completed when there are 4 ingredients to cook it (not counting the number of cards). The player who plays the last card to complete the dish will take all the cards on the pot to his tray to score points at the end of the game. If there are more different color cards than the number of players + 1, the pot will be destroyed.

The prince and princess want to get married, of course. The evil witch wants to cast a spell on the princess, the evil wizard on the prince. But their respective good versions try to prevent this. If they don't succeed, the court marshal laughs up his scheming sleeve. If the seer sees through the traitor's evil intentions, he has fulfilled his mission. And the court jester? He wants to stage a spectacular wedding.&#10;&#10;The game is played over several rounds. In each game round, a character card is dealt to each player.

The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham.  1848LT is set in the western part of the US.&#10;Two to six players represent investors in railroad corporations, spending their initial capital to buy wholly-owned Private and Subsidiary Companies and shares in Public Corporations and the Credit Mobilier.&#10;&#10;The Public Corporations, each controlled by the largest shareholder (its President), build track and run trains in order to earn revenues.  These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock. &#10;A key feature of 1848LT, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of the President and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&#10;&#10;Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent Corporation is the sole responsibility of its President.&#10;&#10;&mdash; user description&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taiw...St. Ives Free&#10;&#10;In 3226, revolutionaries have freed Taiw...St. Ives from the oppression of the Third League. But are the people of Taiw...St. Ives really free? Or are they just trading on oppressor for another? With the Third League unlikely to stand for treason, Taiw...St. Ives will be the center of the universe for a brief period.&#10;&#10;Turning Points: Taiw...St. Ives fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Third League Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for control--and survival--of this instrumental world.&#10;&#10;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &circ;_&Ntilde;??Taiw...St. Ives flavor.&circ;? The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Taiw...St. Ives, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.&#10;&#10;",

Each time a player &ldquo;passes&rdquo; because they are unable or unwilling to play a higher combo, that passing player purloins two cards from the previous played combo to re-use next hand--one card for them and the other for their opponent.&#10;&#10;As players start each new round they combine the cards dealt at the beginning with the &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; cards chosen or allotted from the previous round.  At the end of each round players score for the number of cards left in their opponent&rsquo;s hand, and at the end of the three rounds the winner is the player with the highest total points.&#10;&#10;",
