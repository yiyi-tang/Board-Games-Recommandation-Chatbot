The game is mostly dictated by the spinner and the cards are primarily the game board and status markers for the spinner results. The one exception is the fielding cards which will give variable results for base running after hits are spun. There is little to no decision making in the game as it is totally run by the spinner and fielding cards.&#10;&#10;The instructions are in English and French.&#10;&#10;",

However, be aware of the dangers: tribes trying to protect their land, a harsh environment full of surprises, and outlaws prowling the desert in search of riches.

German parachute and glider troops began an assault to seize control of three airfields along the North coast at 0600 on 20 May 1941; they were to be followed by airborne and seaborne reinforcements.  COMET - Crete 1941 focuses on the action around two of the German objectives &ndash; Maleme airfield and Souda (COMET was the German codeword for the western assault).  The German player&rsquo;s aim is to obtain a foothold so that follow-on forces can land and take permanent control of the objectives.  The aim of the Allied player is to prevent the German reinforcements from landing and subsequently to defeat the assault forces.  The game is played in alternate turns each player being able to move playing pieces and make attacks against their opponent in succession.&#10;&#10;",

Ultimately, the invading forces had the potential of capturing Rome, described by Churchill as &ldquo;the keys to Europe&rdquo;. Planning for the invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord, was well advanced and any success or failure at Anzio would surely lead to ramifications for the larger invasion planned for France.&#10;&#10;In Anzio &ndash; Drive to Rome, each player takes command of either the Allied of Axis forces, and each player moves his supplied pieces in an attempt to fulfill the victory conditions as set out further below. The game commences on 22nd January 1944 following the Allied invasion and finishes on 1st March 1944 unless the automatic victory conditions are fulfilled by either player.&#10;&#10;",

Another example of this is the yellow group, traditionally Atlantic Avenue, Ventnor Avenue, and Marvin Gardens being replaced by the hotels Radisson Saint Paul, Minneapolis Hilton and Towers, and The Marquette Minneapolis Hotel.

    "Description": "Monkey Business - Cash is Kong!&#10;&#10;Setting&#10;What do you do when a pestering primate is wrecking havoc at the junkyard where you work? The obvious, of course: throw money at the problem!&#10;&#10;With the Monkey Business expansion, Spank the Monkey enters the glamorous world of champagne-filled hot tubs and gold-plated supermodels. Sure, it's still just a junkyard, but it's a blinged-out junkyard filled with the spoils of the rich and famous. And with the introduction of the green stuff comes a whole range of new, exciting possibilities. Spend to succeed in your actions, and use your wad of cash to buy yourself out of trouble. But, as always, be the first to Spank the Monkey.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;Each player starts with one coin. During the game players will be able to earn more coins and use their coins in various ways.&#10;&#10;There are essentially three ways that you can spend your coins. First of all there are cards that you have to pay for when playing them such as Insurance Policy and Sexy Monkey Outfit. Secondly, there are Junk cards and Reinforcement cards that require you to pay an upkeep each turn if you want to keep them in your tower. Finally, you can buy extra cards in addition to the ones you draw as normal. The first card you buy during a turn costs 1 coin, the second 2 coins, the third 3 coins, etc.&#10;&#10;To be able to spend coins, you also have to earn coins. Luckily, some Junk cards such as the Oil Tower and the Bank Note Printing Press give you an income each turn as long as they are in your tower. You can also sell Junk cards from your hand. You may sell one Junk card each turn. A Junk card is worth its Strength in coins.&#10;&#10;Monkey Business also introduces a new category of Junk cards called Luxury. In this category you can find precious junk such as Limo, Spa and Inflatable Bouncing Castle.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Spank the Monkey&#10;&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.gigantoskop.se/games/monkeybusiness/&#10;&#10;",

To a certain extent, players are also able to manage their cars' condition as they choose whether to drive conservatively, competitively, or press.  Pressing will increase a car's speed, while also increasing the chance of mechanical problems cropping up in the car.&#10;&#10;Games last 5 - 24 hours, that's no joke, players schedule 24 hour games.

    "Description": "An abstract game played on two chessboards and with stackable reversible counters.  The boards are seen as flip-sides of each other (like sides of a coin), one player starts setup in the center of one side, the other in the center of the other side, with the goal being to have only your markers on the other player's side.  Pieces can move farther and jump more adjacent pieces if they are stacked (up to 3 high).  If pieces are jumped over they are either converted to the other color or eliminated, depending on how many pieces have been jumped over.&#10;&#10;Full rules at: https://web.archive.org/web/20070504174755/http://www.luchacabra.com/?p=24&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The first chapter is the game. It covers all aspects of naval warfare during the American Civil War. Ramming, mines,&#10;subs are also covered. The game is historical with one slight twist. It was written for what the ships were designed to do, not what they actually did. In this light two very powerful and equal fleets set sail. The players are the difference that decides the outcome.&#10;&#10;The other chapters provide historical data to enrich the game. The original game has grown to be a one stop info source for the vessels of the ACW. For those without ship models.&#10;110 different ships are provided on the cards on the CD. 90 vessels are drawn in black and white in Chapter 7. It also contains ACW photos of many of the ships. The game is design for all scales. Only four rules are different for the larger models, mainly distances.&#10;&#10;",

They are constantly watching you and will use every opportunity to get your money back, even with interest. For these cases, it is always useful to have a bribe or a well-guarded safe in your pocket.&#10;&#10;In each round, a player starts by buying cards. He can buy one or more cards from the supply pack, for which he pays with his gold. The first card costs one gold, if the player wants more cards, it is always more expensive. Gold used to buy cards creates a bank next to the supply deck. It is empty at the beginning of the game. If the card says &quot;remove&quot; the gold, it means to put it in the bank. After buying the cards, the player goes to loot.&#10;&#10;During the Loot phase, a player rolls the dice twice. The first roll determines how many gold he can loot that round. If no opponent reacts to this throw, the player throws a second time. The second roll determines who gets robbed that turn. The number of points rolled is the distance of the opponent to be robbed. The player whose turn it is decides whether to count to the left or to the right. If the roll equals the number of players, the roller, he cannot rob anyone.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player loses all their gold. The player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;",
