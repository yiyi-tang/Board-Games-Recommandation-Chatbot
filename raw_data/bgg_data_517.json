Mule and sailing vessel (for $100), bicycle and tramp steamer ($400), train and cruise ship ($700), and airplane and zeppelin ($1000).  Note that trans-continental zeppelin travel was a real possibility when the game was designed, just before the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.  Each mode gives you a multiplier on your die roll (times 1 through times 4) for movement.  Two decks of cards (blue ones for random benefits and red ones for random penalties) correspond to blue and red spaces on the board.  Don't just go to jail, go to Devil's Island or the fortification of Tokio (sp).  Numbered spaces offer the chance to answer trivia questions in two books (one for Globe Trotters, one for Young People) to win or lose $100.&#10;&#10;",

Tokens are placed in the locations indicated on the board, as are the shuffled surprise and destination cards. The first destination card is turned face up.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a turn by rolling the two dice and moving round the board with the object of being first to reach the destination address. A player rolling doubles is allowed to go directly to the destination and claim the card. Each destination card claimed requires a payment of $50. Extra money may be acquired by moving to indicated spaces at a rate of ten times a dice roll (doubled if doubles  are rolled). Spaces marked 'surprise' require a relevant card to be taken by a player and the text is acted upon. A player landing upon another's space may purchase a destination card for $25 from that player or take another turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has collected ten destination cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mare Bella is a children's game that takes place at the sea side. Players have to collect 5 hidden types of sea animals and avoid picking up rubbish such as tires and old boots that have been washed up by the tide. But if they do, they will have the opportunity to rid the beach of such litter, which brings its own reward.&#10;&#10;For the younger player, the game has a simple environmental message; for the older player it has a gameplay in which a certain amount of skill and memory is involved.&#10;&#10;Basic Rules:&#10;&#10;Each player has a 'lotto' board, with space for 5 sea animals: a fish, starfish, crab, sea urchin (type thing) and an octopus. The aim is to be the first to collect all 5 of these, from amongst the square tiles that are laid out over the playing area. Players receive the 'beach bag' from which they draw a round token (same idea as dipping into the Scrabble bag that holds the letters). This token has on it a particular fish type or a particular colour on it. The player then chooses a square tile from the playing area whose upside corresponds in colour or fish type to the round token. He/she flips over the square tile to reveal its underside (which is likely to be different). If the underside is a fish that he/she hasn't collected yet, then the player adds it to his 'lotto' board. If the underside shows a pollution, he/she must collect the pollution. Once a player has three, then he/she may remove them from the game and get a 'free dip'.&#10;&#10;Memorising the underside of certain tiles definitely helps, but is not essential, meaning that anyone can play from the age of 3 and up, although the game is certainly illustrated with kids in mind.&#10;&#10;The game is soon to be available in the UK, costing around &pound;18.

Players use Faith cards to bid for control of different nations. There are separate Faith decks for each player and a shared deck of Nations.
