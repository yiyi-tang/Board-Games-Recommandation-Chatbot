Crystalline rock formations levitate in mid-air, resulting in a great decrease in the gravity around them.The potential benefits are enormous and the seven days we have to study them won't be wasted, be sure of it.&#10;&#10;Gravity Stones is a development and optimization game with multiple choices in a brief playing time. The game plays over the course of seven rounds. Each round, a simultaneous first phase allows the players to play cards from their hand on the action side or on the resource side, also discarding one of them onto the central (company)&#10;&#10;The second phase is individual, and starts with the first player, who uses their actions and resources (if needed) to establish a camp on the mountain, to study the stones, or to construct ZeroG tools from them. Once your actions are spent, you can either recover one of the cards left by the players or leave them; you will be punished or rewarded based on your choice.&#10;&#10;With its intertwined actions and grant system, Gravity Stones allows you to augment your base actions with the stones you get back from the central board. The company that's hired you will also give you objectives to fulfill...or not.&#10;&#10;",

Each brings a unique ability that can alter the fate of your competition.&#10;&#10;Who will be the first to cross Mount Olympus?&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;Each player is provided 12 Gods of Olympus cards, light and dark.&#10;&#10;The gods and goddesses have individualized health points, movements, attacks and special abilities that match their characteristics, to deeply tie theme in with mechanics.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 9x9 diagonal board. The first space on both sides are the &quot;gates&quot; spaces. It will be your goal to either eliminate all the other player's characters, or move any of your characters onto your opponent's gate space.&#10;&#10;On your first turn, select a character to &quot;summon&quot; onto your gates space. On subsequent turns, you will choose to move, attack, or bring additional characters into play.&#10;&#10;All of the cards are balanced so that they are equal in power. Zeus has twice as much health as Hermes, Hermes has far more mobility and provides a &quot;Winged Sandals&quot; ability that increases the movement of other pieces. Athena has even less health, but a powerful &quot;Aegis Shield&quot; ability protects other pieces. All characters will be equally important to achieving your victory.&#10;&#10;Expansions will add deck building and asymmetric gameplay options.&#10;&#10;Try playing chess with each of the 12 Greek Gods as your pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Away from prying eyes&hellip;&#10;&#10;Museum is about the wonders of the archaeological world, the light, the colour, the textures of these wonders of history put on display for all to see!&#10;&#10;What some don&rsquo;t realise though is that there was a dark underworld that shadowed it. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Black Market, where anything is obtainable&hellip;if you can pay the price.&#10;&#10;Black Market is the fourth expansion for Museum and adds a market system to the game where you may purchase Objects and Notoriety cards to complete your collections and harass your adversaries. For those of you looking to put a more aggressive emphasis on the interaction between players in Museum, this is the one for you!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Objects:&#10;&#10;&#10;The 30 object cards featured in the expansion are all from civilisations outside of the ones present in the base game. You&rsquo;ll know them by their rather unique appearance (Images coming shortly) and the fact that they only have one attribute! For example, there&rsquo;s the Viking Longship that will only sport a Navigation Icon or maybe the Terracotta army, the famous guardians of emperor Qin Shi Huang which only counts as a Chinese card? These and many more are purchased exactly like any other object and can give your collections a much needed boost!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Notoriety Cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;Museum has always had a pleasant level of player interaction, with each player concentrating on building up their Museum. With these new cards though, you can throw many a wrench in your opponent&rsquo;s plans! Purchased like an object card, they follow exactly the same rules as a standard notoriety card except their effects are much more aggressive. Steal objects, create counterfeits, and steal prestige right out from underneath your opponent&rsquo;s noses! The ends justifies the means!&#10;&#10;All these new cards will be available on a separate market board . When cards first appear, they&rsquo;ll cost more but as they stick around for longer, their cost will go down. So, do you shell out right from the start or wait for a better price at the risk of having them stolen out from you?&#10;&#10;The Black Market expansion includes 60 new Contraband cards (objects and Notoriety cards) as well as new characters, events and Notoriety cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For example: The &ldquo;B.C.&rdquo; card awards players with the most BC dated cards in their museum.

    "Description": "Mi&#197;&#155; Wojtek &mdash; &quot;Wojtek the Bear&quot; in English &mdash; is a family board game with a rich historical background, telling the story of Poland's &quot;soldier bear&quot; Wojtek (pronounced like &quot;VOY-tek&quot;) who shared the complicated fate of Poles deported from Poland deep into Russia during World War II.&#10;&#10;In September 1939, Poland was attacked by its neighbors: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Poland was conquered and divided between the invaders. Many Poles were expelled and sent to forced labor camps or sent to remote areas of the Soviet Union. Then, in a surprise move in 1941, the German army invaded the USSR. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the USSR, agreed to create an army from the Polish soldiers who had been held in Soviet camps. Following the deterioration of Polish-Soviet relations in March 1942, these Polish soldiers and civilians left the USSR under the command of General Anders to support British allies in the fight against Germany.&#10;&#10;On their way from the Soviet Union to Iran, Polish soldiers bought a small, malnourished bear from a hungry Persian boy. They named the bear &quot;Wojtek&quot; and enlisted him in the army, complete with military papers and the rank of private.&#10;&#10;Wojtek remained with the soldiers throughout their difficult journey from Iran, through Palestine, Egypt, and Italy to Scotland. He shared their ups and downs, their joys and sorrows, giving them many opportunities to smile and helping them when in need. He guarded the equipment, and during the battle of Monte Cassino, he even carried heavy ammunition boxes.&#10;&#10;The players join Wojtek the bear and the Polish II Corps on their journey from the USSR to Edinburgh, Scotland. Along the way, they collect souvenirs related to the fate of General Anders's soldiers and their famous bear. The aim of the game is to collect the best set of memorabilia!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players receive five travel cards and a bear pawn. Players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, the active player plays a travel card with a truck and moves their pawn to the next (closest) empty space in the color of the card played. Then the player takes one bear card from the board, from the box with the same color as the color of the space to which their pawn moved. Finally, the player refills their travel card hand up to five cards, and ends their turn.&#10;&#10;To move their pawn, the players may also play wild cards with a walking bear (which allows them to move to a space of any color as long as they don't pass another pawn) or play three travel cards in the same color in order to name any color and move to the next (closest) empty space in the chosen color.&#10;&#10;At the moment when the first pawn reaches Edinburgh or any player has a complete set of bear cards (six different cards of the same type), the last round of the game begins.&#10;&#10;After ending the last round, players score their bear cards. Players sort their cards into sets. Each set must have the same type of cards, with no repeated cards. The largest possible set is a complete set of six different cards in one color. The player with the largest set wins.&#10;&#10;A note on language dependency: The game is almost fully bilingual: Some components (city cards, game board) are double-sided, with English on one side and Polish on the other side. Other game elements are language independent. Both English and Polish rulebooks are provided in the box.&#10;&#10;",

Then players must select a Means, Motive and Opportunity from cards in their hand. They then use these elements to tell the story of how the killer did the deed. Preferably this is delivered in the style of a Detective in the third act, revealing to the audience and assembled cast just how clever they were to figure it out. The stories are cross examined and picked for holes by the other players, before the Judge settles on the best, using whatever criteria they prefer.&#10;Noir is packed with a grim cast of Femme Fatales, gum shoe P.I.s, mean Mobsters and hardened Hit Men. The play throws up stories which are by turns dark, hilarious, inventive and always, always memorable. &#10;At the bitter end the best denouement of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Angels and Demons is the 5th deck to be added to the Ghost Hunter cannon. In this card game you must compete to capture the angelic and the diabolical a like.&#10;&#10;The cards feature gothic art of angels and daemons from holy lore as voted for by the backers. This theme is replicated in the special rules which sees each Angel matched with an opposing Demon.  You as a Ghost Hunter must choose which to specialize in capturing, for the best bonuses in your final score.&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter: Angels &amp; Demons is a card game for 2 &ndash; 6 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&#10;&#10;It is a standalone game but can be combined with the other Ghost Hunter decks for variation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card type beats one other card type but in turn is beaten by the other card type in a traditional &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; paradigm.  Players alternate turns attacking an opponent of their choice; selected card pairs are simultaneously revealed and resolved by card swapping and possible card elimination.  In addition, some cards have special powers that may be activated during resolution.  In the case of &quot;ties&quot;, resolution may require succeeding card plays.  Players who have all their sword cards eliminated are themselves eliminated from the game.

Enter a room, battle monsters of all types - skeletons, goblins and bears, oh my! (and dozens more) - and leverage your hero's skills to survive.  Loot your foes and move on to the next room.  If you can make it through seven rooms you're pretty good; if you can make it through ten rooms you can call yourself an epic hero, worthy of bards tales from here until the end of time.  But be warned - sometimes the best laid plans fall apart once you set foot in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are easy.  Flip over a room card which gives you bonuses/penalties/adjustments.  Deal out monster cards (the same number as the number of heroes who entered the dungeon).  Order them by their Initiative score.  Then fight.&#10;&#10;Fighting is dead simple - if you can do basic math you can play.  Take your hero's attack value, roll a 20-sided die (included) and add them together.  Subtract the monster's defense value and if what's left is more than 10 it's a hit.  Subtract your hero's damage from the monster's hit points (represented by cubes) then move to the next hero or monster in line.  Once you get to the end you start again until either all the heroes or all the monsters are defeated.&#10;&#10;But don't let that fool you - this isn't a &quot;beat level 1 monsters, then move to level 2&quot; kind of dungeon.  Sure, you might find a lowly kobold in the first room, but you might also find a brown bear.  Or a zombie.  Or a dragon.  Because let's face it - knowing what you're going to find is just plain boring.  And there's nothing boring when when there's a Battle In: The Dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

The fighting in 41 culminated in a fierce Soviet counter attack on the outskirts of Moscow, which saved the city. Entering 42 Hitler and his commanders shifted the offensive south towards Stalingrad, breaking through the Soviet lines and threatening to cut off the oil rich Caucuses from the main soviet industrial areas. Stalingrad was the lynch pin to the defense of the Soviet south and the place Stalin had demanded the Russian people make a stand at all costs. The result was the bloodiest battle of WWII.&#10;&#10;In Stalingrad the game begins with the German drive on Stalingrad itself. Both players begin the game getting a fixed assortment of troop reinforcements, which later shifts to troop purchases as decided by the players.

Players combine more than 12 different elements to interact with each other and win the game! Valence Plus expands on the elements and chemical reactions players can make from the original Valence game.&#10;&#10;Players draw Element cards from the deck in order to form Molecules. Each Element has a different Valence number that describes how many electrons it has to give (positive) or how many electrons it needs (negative) to have a full valence shell. If the Valence numbers add up to zero, they form a Molecule!&#10;&#10;Each Molecule is worth a certain point value. If your molecules add up to 16 points then you win the game! But beware&hellip; several molecules are vulnerable to attack from your opponents! Acids attack Bases (4 points) and turn them into Salt and Water (1 point each). Deadly Carbonyls (which have the special power of removing oxygen from the board) are vulnerable to attack by Water. Players interact with each other using real chemical reactions!&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle these tiles face down, then place five (still face down) around each of thee ten islands while the players start on the central, eleventh island. On a turn, a player first looks at any face-down tile on the board, then moves to any island adjacent to their current location except the one where they just looked at a tile, then they draw and reveal a tile from the island where they just arrived. If the tile shows a land animal, they keep it. (Exception: A player cannot have three tiles of the same type. If they would take one, they instead place it on any empty location on the game board.) If the tile shows a sea animal, they take the special action associated with that animal, then discard the tile.&#10;&#10;If you arrive on an island with another player and that player has a duplicate animal that you don't already have, you can give them an animal tile of your choice to take one of the duplicated animals.&#10;&#10;Collect six different types of land animals first, and you win! If multiple players complete their sextet the same round, then the player with the most overall animals wins.&#10;&#10;",

The rules are similar to &quot;Snakes &amp; Ladders&quot; with some minor twists.&#10;&#10;     No dice is used. Instead, participants of the event recieved a &quot;geocoin&quot;, which also could be used as a dice, with a spinning pointer.&#10;     Blue Symbols on the map allow the player to move forward.&#10;     Red Symbols on the map send the player backwards.&#10;     Green symbols allow the player to decide if s/he wants to go forward or backward.&#10;     A cog symbol lets you spin the counter/roll the dice a second time.&#10;     A magnet symbol lets you move another players pawn to your position.&#10;     Dice symbols lets you press your luck. You shall name a number between 1 and 9 and spin the counter. Depending on the result, you either move forward twice the called number, go back twice the called number or move forward even three-times your selected number.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;Mega Man Pixel Tactics: Kickstarter Promo Set features 5 characters from the Mega Man series which were given out as a surprise to Kickstarter backers.&#10;&#10;",

This print-to-play version is available so gamers can learn the game in advance of the tournament to be held at the next Game-o-Rama (February 2018).&#10;&#10;Game-o-Rama is a mancala-style game. Each player has their own board and on their turn they pick up all the pieces in a space and drop them one-per-space (in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction) and have an opportunity to score when the pieces in the last space match the icons on one of the cards each player gets. If they match exactly the player gets another turn.&#10;&#10;This is a relatively fast and simple to learn game that was called &quot;surprisingly tricky&quot; and &quot;not what we are looking for at this time&quot; by a major boardgame publisher. You will need the cards and player boards to play. Chips, meeples, or cubes can be used for the pieces. A recommended color chart for each icon type is included. More information about the tournament is at the event site.&#10;&#10;",

In the first phase, the Build Phase, players work to build a maze of cards in a 5 x 5 grid.&#10;&#10;After the maze is built, the Ingression Phase begins.  Players navigate the maze by creating new paths on the grid.  At the beginning of a turn, a play may draw a new tile and replace a tile already on the board, or turn a tile to create a new path. One of these actions must be taken each turn, and the player also must move if possible.&#10;&#10;To win, a player must move their pawn to the other side before their opponent reaches theirs.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 39 maze tiles and 2 home tiles, two movement cubes (blank red and blue colored dice), and a small full color instruction manual.  It is designed to be small, portable, and easy to learn.  Ingression can be taught to new players in as little as 5 minutes.  The game does not require much space to play, somewhere between 1 and 2 square feet depending on how the players lay it out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
