    "Description": "Menzacsata sends you back to a typical Hungarian school canteen. You like it or not you cannot leave anything on your plate to go to waste, you have to eat it. The overly nice kitchen ladies keep the extra portions coming and your evil school mates try to get rid of their collection by tossing it on your food pile.&#10;&#10;This is an easy to understand quick and fun card game. Each card has a color and a food on it. You start with three in your hand, no cards in your food pile, and one card in the common discard pile. The goal is to have less cards in your foodpile than the others when the deck runs out. In your turn you can play cards from your hand or your foodpile if the color or the food mathes the top card on the discard pile. You can continue playing cards until you don't have any that matches or you decide to stop. Kitchen staff, classmate and school pet action cards help you to get rid of your food pile, often by giving cards to other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Putting sheep in disguises to protect them from deadly predators seemed like a great idea... until we lost all the sheep. Now a new age is upon us! With demand soaring, sheep are worth their weight in gold! Build your Flock, build your fortune, and protect it all from predators and opponents alike. NSFW artwork on every card!&#10;&#10;Sheep in Disguise is a vibrant and strategic card game about protecting adorably-helpless Sheep from being devoured by the many outrageous and dangerous predators of the world. Collect Flocks of Sheep, keep them safe from Attacks, and use Action cards to destroy anyone that gets in your way!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards to collect matching sets of disguised Sheep and a variety of powerful Action cards. When a player has collected 3 Sheep of a kind, they must be placed face up on the table immediately. This set of 3 Sheep is called a Flock. In a 4 player game, the first person to collect 4 unique Flocks is the winner.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player may use as many Action cards as they like by playing them to the Discard. They may also make one trade with the Field per turn. The Field is a constantly changing group of cards in the middle of the table that players can exchange cards with to help them build a strong hand. The Field guarantees that the game isn&rsquo;t completely luck of the draw and allows the player to strategize and build combo moves in order to progress their game.&#10;&#10;Players can also target an opponent's Flock by placing an Expose card on top of it. This Action exposes the Flock's disguise, leaving them vulnerable to an Attack! Players must choose to take the risk of leaving their Flock exposed or pay to remove the Expose card, ensuring the Flock's identity remains a secret. When an Attack card is drawn, all Exposed Flocks are destroyed!&#10;&#10;Be strategic and be devious. If you play your cards right, you can turn the Attack card into an extremely powerful tool to help you get ahead... otherwise, you may end up as the victim.&#10;&#10;If you find yourself falling behind, don't worry! All players are in it until the very end and one big move is all it takes to flip the whole game on its head!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The more features around it, the greater the score. But beware, the abbot and the scoring of the Spanish Monastery will only happen once those features are fully complete. Should things not go as you hoped, don't worry, you will still get some points on end-game scoring.&#10;&#10;",

Do you have what it takes to win?&#10;&#10;Humans attempt to destroy the laboratory or find enough supplies to win. Zombies either attempt to kill all humans or overwhelm the safehouse to win. Depending on preference, players can engage in hectic real-time action or more strategic turn-based action. Both zombies and Humans take actions when 7's or doubles show on two rolled D6. Most real-time games play in less than 5 minutes. Turn-based games take about 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

His experiences with the Force Dynamic &ndash; the arcano-electric force he believes animates all things &ndash; led to his self-imposed exile from Shyish, where his brand of necromancy is taboo. In Harrowdeep, Deintalos found an ideal place to hide his grisly experiments, aided by his mortal apprentice in necromancy, Marcov. Deintalos animates recovered cadavers with arcane machinery and the Force Dynamic. These Arcwalkers, as Deintalos dubs them, act in eerie unison to tear apart their foes. With their mindless assistance, Deintalos means to dissect every secret of the abyssal labyrinth in which he dwells.&#10;&#10;The Exiled Dead are aggressive, but flexible enough to keep your opponents on their toes and play for objectives. Once you get your shambling fighters into a good position, they&rsquo;ll be tough to tackle. To this end, Deintalos has an ability that will keep them all moving, activating multiple Arcwalkers at once. This box includes a complete Rivals deck, plus loads of extra cards allowing you to try out a few tricks, as well as universal cards and Grand Alliance cards to use with your other warbands.&#10;&#10;This set contains:&#10;&#10;- 7x push-fit Exiled Dead miniatures &ndash; no glue required to assemble, cast in a cadaverous grey to stand out even when unpainted&#10;- 7x fighter cards, one for each warrior in the warband &ndash; Deintalos the Exile, the Prentice Markov, the Deadwalker Regulus, and the Arcwalkers Vlash, Bault, Coyl, and Ione.&#10;- 65 cards to enhance your fighters and provide new tactics and challenges for your games of Warhammer Underworlds: Harrowdeep, including:&#10;&ndash; 12x Exiled Dead objective cards&#10;&ndash; 10x Exiled Dead upgrade cards&#10;&ndash; 10x Exiled Dead gambit spell and ploy cards&#10;&ndash; 6x Universal objective cards, usable by any warband&#10;&ndash; 7x Universal upgrade cards, usable by any warband&#10;&ndash; 7x Universal gambit cards, usable by any warband&#10;&ndash; 12x Grand Alliance cards, usable by any warband belonging to the specified Grand Alliance&#10;&ndash; 1x Exiled Dead Warband Background / Rivals Deck Card&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Through competitive play, game players learn about taphonomy (i.e., processes that affect an organism as it fossilizes). They explore how the organism&rsquo;s biology, the environment it was deposited in, the physical and chemical changes during burial and decomposition, as well as discovery biases, can influence whether or not an organism is collected. Players attempt to preserve the best fossil collection by &ldquo;time traveling&rdquo; to the Jurassic; there they protect their specimens from taphonomic factors (either from random environmental events or other players) and learn what processes enhance or diminish preservation. Players then return to the present to recover their specimens and learn that collection issues can also bias sample recovery.&#10;&#10;Developed by former Ph.D. student, Anna Weiss, and Dr. Rowan Martindale at The Jackson School of Geosciences at The University of Texas at Austin, play this educational board game at your favorite game night or as an educational tool in your classroom! The game can be played with 2-4 people (or more if you playing teams) and is fun for ages 12+!&#10;&#10;Want to use this game in your high school or college classroom?

Players compete against each other to see who can guess the most slang words and phrases. The player or team to guess the most right wins!&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Players break up into teams and teams take turns, alternating players each round, with one player attempting to prompt his or her teammates to guess the slang word or phrase on the card. When your teammates guess the word or phrase you move on to the next card. The opposing team keeps a timer with each round lasting 1 minute. Each card is worth 1 point and the first team to 30 points wins.&#10;&#10;Cards are color coordinated by level of difficulty, green cards are easy, blue cards are moderate and red cards are hard. Each card comes with a definition that players can use but players can come up with other hints, clues and definitions to help prompt their teammates to guess the word or phrase on the card.&#10;&#10;Purpose: &#10;My ambition for WORD TO WHO IS to to promote social connectivity and build a sense of community across generations, cultures, communities, and cities. English is a language that is spoken all over the world and slang is a result of every place putting their own spin on it. My vision is to use slang as a way to forge ties of understanding, acceptance, and unity between people of different backgrounds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If the dragon consumes the constable, return the dragon to a volcanoe and end the current movement phase for the dragon (it has retired to its lair to licks its wounds). The constable is returned to the players stock and made be played again.&#10;&#10;A player cannot place the faerie in a tile containing her/his constable.&#10;&#10;As the constable is not a follower, you cannot place your builder on a road with your constable.&#10;&#10;Roads completed with a constable on them are not considered when determining the 'longest road'.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the constable scores VPs equal to the normal value of the road. If the road connects to one or more cities (complete or not) then the player scores one point for each tile that makes up that/those city(ies). If the road connects to a cloister, it scores an additional 5 points. (The tile with the well now becomes very valuable for the Constable, as it creates three endings and potentially more points).&#10;&#10;Roads with a constable on them do not count for a point toward the value of the Robber Captain.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Kickstarter edition has &quot;Kickstarter&quot; printed on one of the shorter sides of the box and contains 3 mini-expansions, not available in the retail edition.&#10;&#10;Autobahn: Wine Expansion:&#10;The Wine Expansion offers the players the option of importing wine into Germany from its southern neighbours.&#10;&#10;When trucks are loaded in France, Switzerland, Italy or Austria players get a destination card.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game players scoring the trade department and having a wine goods token in their possession can add Germany to their list of delivery destinations.&#10;&#10;Autobahn: Traffic Expansion:&#10;With the Traffic Expansion traffic tokens block single-carriageway road sections around busy cities so that trucks cannot stop on them.&#10;&#10;To remove the traffic tokens the players have to upgrade the jammed links to double-carriageway roads.&#10;&#10;For every three traffic token a player removed they are allowed to promote one employee.&#10;&#10;Autobahn: Services Expansion:&#10;With the Services Expansion players can improve their service stations on upgraded links for building bonuses.&#10;&#10;These upgraded stations grant their owners two bonuses instead of one when passing them with their own trucks and a higher money yield when their opponents' trucks are passing.&#10;&#10;&#10;Autobahn is an economic strategy game about the building of the German motorway system over three periods of time spanning from the end of World War II to the present day.&#10;&#10;At the end of the second period (in 1990), the Unification opens up opportunities to further extend the network into the eastern part of the country.&#10;&#10;As a director within the BundesAutobahn Organisation, you are responsible for managing and developing the German Federal Highway System.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Aside from building roads, you&rsquo;ll also be responsible for facilitating the transport of goods to neighbouring countries and constructing petrol stations to benefit from this new traffic.&#10;&#10;As you contribute to the development of the network, you gain seats at the administration boards of each highway, and they will increase your budget at the start of each period.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, your board members will eventually advance to more prestigious seats within the Bundesautobahn building, which instead will provide victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Plan ahead to optimize your efficiency: Each contribution you make builds your reputation and gains you access to new departments and scoring opportunities that better align with your chosen path to victory.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;The cards in your hand allows you to take actions on one of the 7 main Autobahns.&#10;You&rsquo;ll need to plan carefully and time your actions perfectly if you want to make the most of your hand before you need to collect your cards back.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter Edition:&#10;- Road Traffic Mini Expansion&#10;- Service Station Upgrades Mini Expansion&#10;- Wine Import Mini Expansion&#10;&#10;",

While the French were under the oversight of the Emperor Napoleon, their forces at Heilsberg were under the command of Marshal Joachim Murat and Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Both Marshals frontally assaulted the well-prepared defenses of the Fourth Coalition around the old Teutonic Knights town of Heilsberg in East Prussia. The commander of the Coalition forces was Graf von Bennigsen, a Hanoverian general in service to the Russians. Bennigsen had spent months fortifying the area around Heilsberg with redoubts; fleeches; and assorted abattises surrounding the old Teutonic Knights castle in Heilsberg itself. It was probably the best-fortified position of any Napoleonic battlefield. Napoleon had 85,000 troops in the immediate area on June 10 facing Bennigsen&rsquo;s 90,000 Russians and Prussians. The battle lasted nearly 12 hours and consisted of a series of cavalry charges and French frontal assaults on the well-defended Coalition positions. There were 20,000 casualties in the battle.&#10;&#10;The game will has two large maps; over 700 counters and assorted player aides, including a virtual 160-page rules and historical commentary book.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A group of adventurers has just left town after clearing out a nearby dungeon. The townsfolk have worked up the courage to go see what valuable loot they may have left behind.&#10;&#10;An asymmetric grid of cards featuring different types of loot is laid out. The first player splits the grid along any single straight line between cards, claiming one set of loot cards for themselves.&#10;&#10;Each successive player can choose to further divide any pile in play. If another player has laid claim to the pile you choose to split, that player is &quot;kicked off&quot; that pile of loot and will take another turn. If turn order returns to you without you having been kicked off your loot selection, you keep those cards.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has collected their loot, and organized it by color, players draft a merchant card, each with different scoring mechanisms.  Each merchant is assigned to a color of loot, with their scoring mechanism only counting towards the loot collected in that color.&#10;&#10;Players move to the next room in the dungeon (represented by a new loot card configuration being laid out) and repeat the process of cleverly splitting loot and looking to draft the most useful merchant.&#10;&#10;After 5 rooms of loot have been split, players score each color of loot based on the merchant assigned. Most points wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
