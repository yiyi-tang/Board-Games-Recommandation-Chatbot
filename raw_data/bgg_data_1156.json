A decade later, it evolved into Stern-Halma (Star Halma) in Germany; 26 years after that, it was rebranded in the US to [Hop Ching] Chinese Checkers. But the devil is in the details, and 89 years later still, the 6-pointed star is 5-pointed, and its routes and connections are no longer congruent: Satan&rsquo;s Checkers has reared its horned head!

    "Description": "The Sound Cypher is a game that was developed out of a love for good music. In its infancy, the game started off as a light hearted rivalry between two people to see who had deeper music knowledge and better taste. Over time the rivalry evolved into a living room game shared amongst friends &amp; family.  Now, it&rsquo;s coming out as a card game that people of all ages can enjoy.&#10;&#10;There are three editions ready for release including the Open format edition, R&amp;B/Soul edition, and the Hip-Hop edition. No matter the age or music preference of the players, The Sound Cypher is easy to play and fun for everyone in the room!&#10;&#10;To start the game, the first player picks a card from the deck then reads it out loud. They then have 90 seconds to play their first song. The second player has up to 2 minutes or until the end of the second verse to play their song, and so on.&#10;&#10;Voting is done in one of two ways. Players can vote for their favorite song by placing a card in the designated area at the end of each round; the player with the most votes wins. Live voting can also be employed via the audience as the game is in progress. At the end of any voting option, the best song wins. &#10;The Sound Cypher has rules that must the adhered to be eligible to win each round. Some of the rules include:&#10;&#10;     No use of search engines or online sources&#10;     Song played after time limit not eligible to win &#10;     All songs get to play for at least 1 minute&#10;     Players can only vote for themselves once&#10;     Ties are settled by the greatest number of YouTube views&#10;     Artists can only be used once per round&#10;     Songs can only be used once per game&#10;     The card dictates the type of music for each round &#10;&#10;&#10;So, whether you&rsquo;re 7 or 70, a casual music listener or a die hard music fan, a group of complete strangers or old friends The Sound Cypher is a great way for everyone to enjoy music in a way they never imagined. After playing The Sound Cypher you&rsquo;ll never listen to music the same way again!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If the sheep can tolerate the offered food without sneezing bubbles, the player may keep the food tile. If not, bubbles will blow in all directions and the tile will have to be returned.

    "Description": "Parcel o' Rogues (POR) has been designated the fifteenth volume in Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series. Technically speaking, the game should not be part of the series. It is a completely different animal, and no knowledge of the Lace Wars series is required. However, the package also contains a Charlie's Year module, The Jacobite Card (TJC), which is part of the series and completes the Jacobite 'saga'.&#10;&#10;POR is a game for 2-4 players that covers the political struggle to pass the Act of Union of 1707 which brought England and Scotland under a single government. For a hundred years the two countries had been ruled by the same monarch, but with separate governments and laws. The Union was in keeping with the centralizing trend that could be found all over Western Europe. As might be expected, it was not universally acclaimed, especially in Scotland. Coincidentally, a Jacobite rising was being planned in coordination with the French, who were (of course) at war with England and hoped to create a diversion that would draw enemy troops away from their frontier. This plot played into the widespread discontent with the Union, so that when a French expeditionary corps was dispatched to escort the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, to Scotland in March of 1708, the conspirators could count on a massive uprising in support of his claim to the Throne. Unfortunately for them, the plan quickly unravelled due to a variety of causes and the famous Rising of 1708 that restored Scotland's independence never happened.&#10;&#10;In POR the object is to gain influence over the key political figures and institutions who can sway the vote for Union, or, if necessary, provide resources for a rebellion. Influence is claimed by the placing of cubes on a board, at locations representing the various personalities and institutions involved. The players are limited in what they can do on their turn by card play, which stipulates how many cubes are available and what sort of locations will accept them. Cards may instead allow players to remove some of their opponents' cubes. Periodically, event cards must be played that affect everyone; these cards also act as a timer. There are two scoring rounds. In the first, the players compare their influence for the Act of Union. If there is no Union, the game will be over, but usually, the Union does occur and the game continues to the second scoring. This one determines who has won the subsqeuent Rebellion and uses different criteria (but the same game mechanic).&#10;&#10;If desired, the results of the game can also be used to generate a scenario for the attached Lace Wars module, The Jacobite Card. The final state of the POR board will dictate the resources each player receives for that scenario.&#10;&#10;Playing time averages 3 hours, regardless of the number of players.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;1) Play board showing the personalities and institutions involved in the events covered by the game.&#10;&#10;2) 120 die cut counters. Half are used as tokens and markers in POR. The other half are used in TJC.&#10;&#10;3) 121 playing cards. 90 are Action cards, used to make plays during the game. 20 are Season cards which provide special events and act as a timer. The remaining 11 cards are Aide Memoires.&#10;&#10;4) 400 8mm wooden cubes in 4 colours: red, blue, yellow, and black.&#10;&#10;3) Rules for both POR and TJC.&#10;&#10;4) An historical commentary.&#10;&#10;",

On the way they must overcome intricate traps and battle a dangerous dragon by gaining and playing crown chips - on the reverse these have chess pieces of varying value by type and they are stored on the player's shield panel. Players progress around and up the board, traversing the traps using the chips which serve to stop the marble held underneath their wooden knight from falling. Battles between Knights and the dragon compare the relative values of the white and black chess figures on the Knight and the Dragon, the latter represented by dragon chips. To win the battle the player must knock down the black figure with their white figure or figures of the same or a higher value. The game ends when no more dragon chips are left in the bank and the winner is the player with the most points value left on their shield panel.&#10;&#10;The game box also includes a colourful standard chess board and cardboard stand-up chess pieces.&#10;&#10;The game was developed by Alexandra Kosteniuk, the 12th Women's World Chess Champion, and includes a book of Chess Rules written by her that includes puzzles to work through and a glossary of chess terms. &quot;Let me welcome you to the exciting world of the Chess Kingdom!

    "Description": "Ticket to Ride Map Collection 7: Japan &amp; Italy includes a double-sided game board &mdash; the longest yet in the Map Collection series &mdash; that features Japan on one side and Italy on the other.&#10;&#10;In the Japan half of the expansion, some routes are reserved for the Bullet Train network, and once such a route is claimed, it can be used by all players to complete destination tickets. To claim such a route, discard a number of cards equal to the length of the route with all the card being the same color, then mark the route with a single Bullet Train miniature; instead of scoring points for such a route, advance your marker on the separate Bullet Train track as many spaces as the length of this route. At the end of the game, whoever has contributed the most to this shared project receives the largest bonus, with the player who contributes least being penalized.&#10;&#10;This game board also has a small inlay for the Tokyo subway system, so players are effectively working on two networks at once. You might have a ticket that lists a city outside Tokyo and a station with Tokyo, and you need to complete a route from that other city to Tokyo, then from the central Tokyo station to that particular subway station.&#10;&#10;In Italy, the game board is divided into regions, and players score bonus points based on how many regions they connect in their network, with three regions &mdash; Sardegna, Sicilia, and Puglia &mdash; counting as two regions in your tally. If you have separate networks, then you score each one separately.&#10;&#10;The board also introduces a new type of ferry route. On this game board, all gray routes are ferry routes, with these routes having 1-4 spaces marked with a wave symbol. To cover a wave symbol, you must play a locomotive or a ferry card from your hand (in addition to the other cards needed to claim this route); a ferry card is a special type of card that can be drafted on its own on your turn, and it contains two wave symbols, so it can be used on its own to cover two symbols on a route.&#10;&#10;The player trains and game cards from Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe are needed to play this expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the idiom was the prophecy&#10;unclear and therefore difficult to interpret.&#10;The King therefore gave magician Ilidor the order to speak a spell wards of protection to the Village to protect the kingdom from possible dangers.&#10;Dorntal was a small village where everyone knew each other. There was a nice market around the playhouse with delicacies from the entire kingdom. Down by the river lived the fishermen, carpenters, blacksmith and several other artisans. During the day, people in the village went to work and in the evening they met at the inn to dine and play together. The fire crackled in the fireplace of the tavern and the people told each other Candlelight stories, genuine and invented, exciting and funny. And everyone listened. It was a nice feeling to be a part of this village community&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, this inner and outer peace did not last long.&#10;&#10;Due to a failed magic experiment Ilidors in the black tower, this protective magic weakened. The magician Illidor could do nothing more. He turned away from Dorntal and left the black tower at dawn the next day. A note on the wooden door with the words &quot;Portals, Chaos, II-260, Save Yourselves !!!&quot; was the only one what he left behind. What did Ilidor want to say with that? Had Illidor been able to decode the prophecy? Would the protective magic completely collapse in the second age in 260?&#10;Even the dwarfs, elves, and other races now spoke in fear of the imminent end.&#10;&#10;In For the Kingdom, players assume the role of one of the backward houses in the village of Dorntal. By inserting the individual workers, different actions are played out. The mining of raw materials, the procurement of money, the improvement of the workers or the hiring of Heroes are dedicated solely to defending Dorntal and protecting the kingdom. In Farek's Forge, magnificent items can be forged to fight within and outside Dorntal. Face different Quests. Some Quests can be done alone, but others can be done together. The player with the most points wins. However, if the village is damaged / loses morality too much, you lose the game together. But beware: Humans, Orcs, Dragons or Goblins lurk dangerously around Dorntal. The sun sinks on the horizon with increasing speed, so hurry up! It is time: for the people, for the king, FOR THE KINGDOM!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But do you have a card from the fourth suit to play with it? Have a straight? Excellent! But do the four cards cross all four suits?

Players begin at the 'Bleak World' and by successfully answering a variety of challenges advance to the &quot;Better, Rainbow world. The game includes the board, writing pads, pencils, pencil sharpener, dice, 8 color pawn options, a deck of approximately 500 prompt cards, and a 90-second sand timer.  Two dice are included, a six-sided die for games without a time limit, and a 12-sided one for players needing to complete the game in 40 minutes or under.&#10;&#10;Each roll of the die determines which challenge players will face, and when successful, the player rolls again to advance on their next turn.  If they don't succeed, they remain where they are and try that challenge again.&#10;&#10;The 9 different spaces include 7 color-coded challenges, one challenge indicated by the 'lock and key' graphic, and one which includes all the colors so that players are free to choose which challenge they prefer.&#10;&#10;All players advance along the path of colored flags toward a better world. The the first to reach the 'better world' is presented with a challenge selected for them by the other players.  If they succeed, they win the game, if not, they move back the number of spaces shown on the die.&#10;&#10;The challenges include:&#10;Red: Freehand - The player selects a prompt card and must draw a picture of the prompt. If other players can guess what it is, they succeed and advance. The player who correctly guesses moves forward (For example, draw 'Stonewall.)&#10;Orange: You Can Quote Me - Another player selects the first Orange card in the deck and reads it aloud to the player being challenged.  It will be a quote from a public figure or celebrity, and the player must choose which of the two possible answers provided actually said those words. &#10;Yellow: You've Got Talent - the player selects the first yellow card in the deck and must do a charade of the prompt until someone calls out the correct answer before the timer runs out. (For example, do a charade to communicate &quot;Stonewall.&quot;&#10;Green: Just Between Us - The player selects the first green card and shares as much of a personal anecdote as they are comfortable doing.  For example, &quot;Have you ever had a crush on your health care provider.&quot;&#10;Blue: You Think You Know Me - the player selects the first blue card from the deck and reads the prompt question.  Other players must predict how that player will answer.&#10;Pink: Unpinkable - The player selects the first pink card from the deck and reads it aloud, following the instructions to advance or move back.  For example, &quot;You are out with friends and suggest that you all put your phones away.  Move ahead six spaces.&quot;&#10;Purple: Did You Know That? - Another player reads aloud the multiple-choice question, and selecting the correct answer allows the player to advance on their next turn.&#10;The Closet - Players landing in the closet must tell a coming out story before advancing.  They may 'come out' about whatever issue is safe and relevant to them, it does not have to be about sexual orientation. Some may come out about being vegan, agnostic, or straight.&#10;The Rainbow: Rainbow Choice - The player is allowed to select their preferred challenge.&#10;The Better World: In order to win the game, the player who lands here must succeed at the challenge selected by the other players. If they do, they win, if not, they must move back the number shown on their last toss of the die.&#10;&#10;",

After the first contact with the enemy on 14 October, a cavalry battle near Liebertwolkwitz, which ended with much luck in favor of the Allies, Bonaparte now seeks the decisive battle. With the guards and eight corps, he has 210,000 men at his disposal, including 14,000 horsemen and 700 guns.&#10;&#10;In the two-person game Battle of the Nations 1813, you take over the role of Napol&eacute;on and his opponent Prince Schwarzenberg. The aim of the game for Napol&eacute;on's French army is to occupy and successfully defend several towns around Leipzig. The allied troops under Prince Schwarzenberg try to prevent this in return.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, Napol&eacute;on receives face-down mission cards from different districts. These cards show him which towns he has to occupy. Depending on the level of difficulty, Napol&eacute;on receives different numbers of victory points for completed mission cards. The mission cards also show Napol&eacute;on how many points Prince Schwarzenberg wins if he does not complete the missions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pentagame is an abstract strategy game without chance element. It is played on a pentagram star that shows 100 round stops. The 5 corners and the 5 crossings in the pentagram are colored (white, blue, red, green, yellow). It can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. It looks a bit like a pentagonal ludo, but it is truly different. For example, there is no chance and pieces don't get beaten. Instead, it is all about moving, swapping, about paths and about areas.&#10;&#10;Every player plays 5 pieces of one shape, e.g. cats against pawns or whatever. Every player has one white, one blue, one red, one green and one yellow piece. All pieces start the race on the corners of their respective colors. The goal is to bring three of one's pieces from their corners to the crossing of matching color.&#10;&#10;There are five black blocks that are neutral pieces. At the beginning they are on the crossings in the center. There are five gray blocks that come into the game as pieces reach their goals.&#10;&#10;One can move in any direction on the star or the ring, as far as there is a free path. But one cannot jump. One can either (1) just move to an empty space, (2) beat a black block, taking its place and re-position it on another free stop somewhere, (3) swap two neighboring pieces, one of which must be one's own piece.&#10;&#10;As Ko-rule, immediate repetition of the same move is not allowed.&#10;&#10;A piece that reaches its destination crossing is removed from the board. A player thus moving a piece out successfully gains a gray block that she can position on any free stop. Such gray blocks are also neutral pieces, but when they get beaten, they are removed again rather than re-positioned.&#10;&#10;The game becomes very complex very soon. Nevertheless, a two player game takes often under 20 minutes, a 3-player maybe 45 minutes, a 4-player some 90 minutes. That of course depends on how long players think, or are allowed to think.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Every player starts with a hut (consisting of 5 parts), an empty garden, with 5 spaces for nice garden d&eacute;cor and 3 action cards, which can be: Build (d&eacute;cor), Move (the sleeping monkey), Wake (the monkey), Banana (for bad times).&#10;&#10;In the middle of the table, there are 20 &ldquo;BEAUTIFUL THINGS&rdquo; (garden d&eacute;cor standees), which players can build in their gardens. The first players, who has 5 &quot;BEAUTIFUL THINGS&quot; in his garden, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Sounds easy? There&rsquo;s a little snag. The snag is called Hugo, and is 3 meters high. This monkey is always hungry &hellip; when he&rsquo;s awake. Fortunately he sleeps most of the time. &#10;The game is played turn by turn. In his turn a player can play 1 action card, or discard 1 action card, and draw a new card (hand = 3 cards).&#10;As an action you can BUILD a beautiful thing into your garden - but only if the monkey is not in front of your hut. Another possible action is to MOVE the sleeping monkey to another players hut. Or, you can WAKE up the monkey, when he&rsquo;s at anothers players hut.&#10;If someone plays a WAKE card, he rolls the HUGO DICE, to see what the monkey will do. The dice has 4 sides with HOT HUNGER, which means, Hugo will eat one of your BEAUTIFUL THINGS. 1 other side shows a sleeping Hugo, which means, Hugo felt immediately back into his dreams, the guy in the hut is lucky, and nothing else happens in this turn. The last side of the dice is I SEE YOU, which means Hugo noticed the active player, while waking him up, and follows him to his hut. &#10;And what about the banana? You can keep these cards in your hand, to give it to Hugo in a HOT HUNGER Situation, so that he can eat it &hellip; instead of your garden d&eacute;cor. &#10;And so players will build d&eacute;cor, push the sleeping Hugo back and forth, collect bananas and hope not the have the monkey in front of their huts, when he awakes hungry. Every eaten thing comes out of the game, so the game ends, if someone has a full garden (5 beautiful things), or if no beautiful things are in stock (in the middle). In this case, the player with the most beautiful things wins. In case of a tie, the winner will be the one who&rsquo;s furthest away from Hugo.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cube It is a game of numbers. A player rolls two percentage dice to obtain a number between one and one hundred. Then, (s)he has three turns to equal that number exactly with five six sided dice using mathematical operations.&#10;&#10;The game contains two D10 and five D6. The D10 are the percentage dice as one has numbers 00 to 90 and the other 0 to 9. They roll these to get one number (called the Target Number) that must be matched exactly by rolling five D6 and using any mathematical operation among them. Players score points based on being able to do this with few throws of the D6, if the target is prime, or if some of the five D6 are not needed.&#10;&#10;The game works fine solo, and competitively can be played where everyone uses the same dice to come up with best and fastest answer or where each player rolls individually for the best total score.&#10;&#10;Game comes in small plastic bag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The designer says &quot;This game is customizable pinball, where you build the common board and launch balls of different materials (glass, wood, iron). Who earns best points?&quot;&#10;&#10;In the game, the players begin by placing the components of a wooden pinball machine. The device does not have paddles to keep the ball in play. Instead, the game more closely resembles a pachinko machine, which are very popular in Japan. The ball falls freely after it is fired.&#10;&#10;The flat area of the board has regular pinholes, and players start by placing pegs and barriers as they wish. Then they take turns firing a ball into the area. The base of the device has a series of slots with different scoring values. The players are trying to get the different types of pinball to fall to the more valuable slots to win.&#10;&#10;The game includes a metal, magnetised peg. When the steel ball is fired, if it strikes the peg, it might stick there.&#10;&#10;&#039;Corinth&#039; is the name in Japan for this style of children's toy, from which pachinko machines developed.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Build sails for speed and evasion, gather warriors to fight for your cause, and collect riches to improve your crew&rsquo;s morale in order to perform powerful feats. These attributes, along with a little luck, aid you through turn based gameplay where you play use feats and roll dice in an attempt to overcome encounters and collect treasure cards. Each phase that the players don&rsquo;t overcome the encounters, they will retaliate the players, potentially wreaking havoc to a player&rsquo;s hand of cards or the ship they captain.&#10;&#10;Upon reaching heroic milestones, you will be able to achieve glory (victory points) and make a name for yourself.

The object of the game is to be the first player successfully use all the cards in their Win Stack (usually 10 cards) to build Sequence Stacks in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;The game is broken into rallies, where all players are able to simultaneously place cards from their hand, discard, and Win Stack in piles on the table in sequential order from one to ten. A rally ends when the play reaches a stalemate because players are either unable to continue building on stacks or they choose not to.&#10;&#10;After a stalemate, the next player starts another rally by drawing cards for their hand until they reach 5 total cards and they play more cards. The standard deck comes with 3 nut card variations that spice up the game play.&#10;&#10;Wild nut- Can be played in place of any numeric card. &#10;Draw Two Nut(double nut)- Also can be played in place of any numeric card, but the player selects a victim that must immediately add two cards to their win stack from the draw deck. &#10;Swap Deck Nut- Also can be played in place of any numeric card, but the player selects a victim with whom they immediately exchange win stacks- for better or worse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players will move cards around in a field of nine, discover potential targets, position cards in their own hand, draw new cards, collect coins, and attempt to whack rival Clients to earn victory points.&#10;&#10;There are only 2 kinds of cards in Hit City Hustle: Clients and Hitmen. Clients are recruited and used to earn coins. Higher value Clients can earn more coins, but are also worth more victory points to rivals. Hitmen are recruited and then paid to eliminate rival Clients. Higher value Hitmen are stronger, but more expensive to activate.&#10;&#10;Cards remain facedown for most of the game. This allows plenty of opportunities to bluff about the value of a Client or a Hitman. Bluffing allows bold players to get a leg up on the competition. However, rivals can call anyone&rsquo;s bluff by paying a coin. Get caught bluffing and your action is forfeited. Special rules on unique cards also affect play!&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches 15 or more victory points, finish the round so all players have had the same number of turns. Finally, count all players' victory points and whacked clients to determine the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "January 19, 1919.  The Great War is over, the Kaiser has abdicated, and Germany is on its knees. After suffering a humiliating loss at the hands of the Allied nations, the former Great Power is now confronted not only with the death of millions of its citizens, but also with a severe economic crisis and a political turmoil that threatens to plunge the entire nation into civil war. The November Revolution of 1918 ushered in a new era of liberal democracy in a country traditionally ruled by noblemen warriors. The first democratic election has now been held, but democracy&rsquo;s enemies are numerous, and the future of the fledgling Republic appears grim. No one can tell whether the democratic Coalition will prevail or whether any of the extremist factions will rise out of the chaos and seize power.&#10; One thing is perfectly clear, however: the coming years will not be remembered for their peace and stability.&#10; The Weimar Republic is a Card Driven Game of political struggle in interwar Germany. Four factions compete for dominance: the democratic Coalition, the Soviet-backed Communist Party, Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialists, and the far-right Radical Conservatives.&#10;&#10;The game follows a timeline of 15 years (1919-1933) with two rounds in each year. During a round, players take turns using their faction-specific abilities to increase their influence in Germany&rsquo;s regions and major cities, to maneuver the political landscape of the Republic, and to dominate through a combination of propaganda, parliamentary elections, street violence, economic influence, and ideological zeal. Typical actions include agitation, reforms, recruitment and deployment of fighting men, strikes, uprisings, assassinations, and coups. General and regional elections are held at irregular intervals throughout the game, potentially shifting local power balances in sometimes radical ways. The timeline moves through three distinct eras, each with its own deck of event cards. There are also several special cards like Elections and Parliamentary Control Cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast-paced; initiative flows back and forth, and the direction of the game may change rapidly and unexpectedly. Although competition between the factions is fierce, some of the faction-specific mechanics overlap, and players can often take advantage of each other--including the making and unmaking of alliances.&#10; The Weimar Republic includes scenarios ranging in length from 3 to 8 hours and a special tutorial scenario that can be played by new players in only 90 minutes. Victory is absolute and generally achieved through &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo;; there is no final scoring or adding up of different objectives. Each faction can be replaced by a &quot;bot&quot; player, allowing 1-4 players to play with any combination of factions.&#10;&#10;",

Only after the blood and death that such an election as this can bring will a candidate be named Galactic President.&#10;&#10;Galactic Presidency is a complex strategy game that uses both cards and dice. In each round candidates (players) utilize an Alien Power and have up to three senators, each using a unique weapon, battle for supremacy in the GALACTIC ARENA. All senators start with the same amount of health for their &quot;head, body, and legs.&quot; A senator is killed when they no longer have health in one of these areas. Besides the use of Combat Cards there are also random events that can help or hurt all senators and will in some cases kill them. Candidates can win &quot;Electoral Votes&quot; but the vote value is kept hidden and is only revealed and counted if there is no clear victor at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 2 to 5 players, 12 years or older. The playing time is between 1.5 and 2.5 hours depending on your modifications to the rules - its easy enough to lengthen or shorten your game time. Our game is designed to promote &quot;enjoyment through creativity&quot; as well as keeping the potential to win the game even if the player had all of his senators killed.&#10;&#10;To win the game a candidate must win two of three rounds, which is when one candidate is left standing, or have the greatest number of Electoral Votes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They hide behind the Hellfire or the Copper Cauldron, waving their trident, but whenever a visitor gets four of them at once, the devils have to put out a red coin. Anyone who has captured the most coins at the end of the game may leave hell unpunished, while all other guests will be cooked in the kettle!&#10;&#10;In the memory game Teufelskreis (Devil's Circle), ten discs with hell motifs distributed on both sides are placed in a circle. A motif is revealed for the round, and players compete to reveal that same motif four times. Whoever turns the correct discs collects points, while those who are not careful will lose their profit quickly. Fortunately, a jackpot awaits, and you might have forgetful teammates as well...&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to be find the missing persons during your round, or the rescue mission, and save one of per round. There are a total of five rounds, each round you have the opportunity to save one missing person.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 18 cards to form a face-down draw deck. Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it. Each player draws one card from the deck. This is the player&rsquo;s hand, and is kept secret from the others. On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. You must apply any effect on the card you discarded. All discarded cards will remain in front of the player who discarded them, keeping them visible to all playing. Since this is a game of deduction and reasoning, this will help players try to count which cards are remaining. After applying the card&rsquo;s effect, the turn passes to the next player, this game is played clockwise. A round ends when the deck is empty at the end of the final turn, the player with the highest rank hand saves the hostage. If there is a tie, the player who discarded the highest total of cards is the winner, even if that player was previously eliminated. The winner of the round oversees the next investigation and will shuffle the cards and begin another round.&#10;&#10;Missing Persons is a Search and Rescue game that is similar in play style to other deceptive based games. Your goal is to rescue as many of the hostages in play as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is also speculated that Cahokia may have been larger than London at that time.&#10;&#10;Cahokia: Rise of the Mound Builders is a worker placement game that takes place in pre-Columbian North American. Players take on the role of influential families who help to cultivate the Cahokia and its earthen monuments.

In addition, the players will use their workers to craft jewelry, build buildings, and erect large earthen mounds.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to earn the most victory points. These points are earned in a number of ways, including mound and building construction, crafting jewelry, earning trade goods, and earning wealth.&#10;&#10;Monks mound is the largest of the earthen mounds at Cahokia. It will require all of the players to contribute to its construction. When Monks Mound is complete, the game ends.

Recently, things have taken a turn for the worse as a new boss has risen to power in the Lake City Mob, and the streets are running over with hooch-addled hooligans. In response, the government has established a special task force, dubbed the Prohibitionists, with the sole purpose of taking out the Boss and bringing the law back to Lake City.&#10;&#10;You and the other players are those Prohibitionists, working cooperatively to defeat the mob. Every turn, a new card will be dealt off the Obstacles deck, representing everything standing in your way, from hired goons to secret bases to devious schemes to tie up your resources. In response, you'll play a card from your Tactics deck to dispatch the problem via Bribery, Contacts, Investigation, Subterfuge, or good old-fashioned Violence.&#10;&#10;You won't be able to take out every Obstacle with one card, so it's essential to coordinate attacks; with a little luck and good planning you can take out multiple Obstacles in one blow. But watch out, because if you can't keep up with the Obstacles you'll be forced to discard cards straight from the Tactics deck, and if that deck ever runs out, you're kaputski, and the Mob will rule over Lake City.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
