It's up to your choice - if you gain a 1 or 5, to roll the remaining 2 dice again for all or nothing (early 'Can't Stop).&#10;&#10;Remarks:&#10;Due to (sometimes) small changes it's very difficult to track versions and define the publishing date of the first edition;&#10;there are (at least) 3 different Gr&auml;fe editions and from 1970 the Spika one; if you check the boards you can detect a (confused?) numbering system - see images. &#10;Some Sellers (e.g. on ebay) declare a publishing date mid 1935, but to my knowlegde those 'Bikini maids', printed on the early edition were not permitted/accepted by National Socialists. But even more confusing - one auction shows hand written notes (to replace (lost) rules) in S&uuml;tterlin writing.&#10; - feedback is highly appreciated -&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This painful affair threw disgrace and dishonour onto the Hare's clan and it would take many generations for the affront to be forgotten. Forgotten, did I say? Never! Hare is determined to restore his family's honor &ndash; but Tortoise will not give up without a fight.&#10;&#10;Woodland Race is an asymmetrical race game in which audacity and strategy will be your best assets! The players build the track over successive rounds, sometimes helping Hare and sometimes helping Tortoise.

The round ends when a player has found all the words. Then, each player gains one point for each word found. The player that has gained the most points after four rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The puzzles do not only contain each German word, but also the English translation, which makes it possible to use this game to learn English.&#10;&#10;",

When all the bets are placed, you flick a switch and the wheel will spin. As each bike goes past a connection, their colour light flashes on, so with a fast spinning wheel, the lights all flash, adding to the excitement. When the wheel stops, there will be one light on and that is the race winner. Winning punters collect their bets and another race can start. The winner must be the one who has the most money when the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An action cricket game.&#10;&#10;One player is the batsman, the other the bowler. The two, rather scary, figures have handles so that their arm can be pulled back and then released forward. The bowler's arm will launch a ball at the batsman. He, in reply, will try to swing his bat and connect with the ball.&#10;The player who scores the most runs (i.e. hits) will win.&#10;&#10;Sir John Berry &quot;Jack&quot; Hobbs (1882 - 1963) is widely regarded as one of the best opening batsmen of all time&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the 22nd century, the white mineral has become one of the most important resources. The material is a catalyst that enables many new production processes. Each player is a pilot of one of his company&rsquo;s spacecraft, on the way to the planet GH-328 in the Panajay system. This undeveloped planet has large deposits of the white mineral.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player in TF22 is to leave the planet with as much white mineral and as many units as possible. At the start of the game, each player lands on the planet with a landing craft and several units: a production unit, transporters, and combat units. The production unit can be used to create new units by consuming white mineral. The transports can be used to gather ore and bring it to the landing craft (though they can also carry some of the other units). The combat units can be used to capture or destroy enemy units. Each turn, players receive a number of action points to perform these actions.&#10;&#10;Players should not only watch out for the units of other players. They also need to keep an eye on the tide. This can change every round. Areas that were previously accessible only by naval units may suddenly become accessible to land units instead, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;",

One card from a deck of 20 is placed face-up next to each space. Whenever a player goes to one of these spaces with a buyer, he takes the card, and executes the action shown on the card: acquire 4-6 gold, buy one tower tile of the depicted type (top, middle or bottom), earn two prestige points, or choose one buyer from the deck. At the end of each year, each location receives a new card (in addition to the ones still there).&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, one of the spaces in the &quot;House of the Lighted Windows&quot; is marked with a treasure chest marker as well, and also receives cards with bonus actions. In addition, four cards are added to the deck which force a player to buy a lighted window at a cost of four gold when he visits the space.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "So You Want to Teach is a card driven game for two to four players on the issues and events many beginning teachers must deal with in the course of becoming a professional educator. The game is meant to serve as an entertaining vehicle by which students and practitioners in education can discuss and evaluate issues, trends, as well as their individual motivations, in K-12 education.&#10;&#10;Each &ldquo;turn&rdquo; players deal five cards and then take turns drawing a card from those that remain. The drawn card&rsquo;s Event is revealed/ read aloud to the others after which players can bid for the event by playing cards from their deck. The winner of the bidding will then take procession of the card, adding it to their &ldquo;Portfolio&rdquo;. A card that is not claimed will go into the discard pile. Instead of drawing a card a player can also &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; and exchange any or all of the cards in their hand for new cards from the deck, or to &ldquo;cash in&rdquo; the point values of their cards to advance their &ldquo;Epistemology, Axiology or Political&rdquo; track markers. Players can also exchange cards in their deck for &ldquo;Mentor&rdquo; cards that can be used for various game functions.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to acquire a portfolio of Challenge and Opportunity event cards, as well as a number of sufficient Axiology, Epistemology and Political points to pass the Praxis III (professional licensing) exam and win the game. It is possible for all, some or none of the players to win the game by the last turn.&#10;&#10;So you want to teach?

    "Description": "Produced by www.GreenBusinessOwner.com, this game makes sustainability come to life in a fun, interactive way. Players are investors looking to make more than just financial returns by helping local entrepreneurs in Hawai'i develop sustainability-oriented businesses like organic farms, geothermal plants, green building companies, solar installers, and bike shops. The game is ideal for those who are interested in sustainability as a better way to do business, and can be played by 2-4 players ages 13+. It's also a great learning tool, and the parent company has produced free downloadable lesson planning materials for teachers! Check out www.GBOHawaii.com for more info on that.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a beautiful board with the map of Hawai'i, several decks of playing cards used in the game, a green business property deck of businesses you can invest in, dice, player pieces, and a stack of money.&#10;&#10;The game is set in Hawai'i, and players act as impact investors. Their goal is to start businesses that have a triple bottom line effect: make money, create good paying green jobs, and deal with three main environmental challenges of energy, food, and waste. To establish businesses, players must obtain certain resources like human resources (entrepreneurs, green collar workers, and the wild card--green MBA's). Some businesses require permits, mostly for larger developments and energy projects, and it's a humorous twist on permitting processes in local governments--full of possibilities and potential frustrations. Players must also navigate public policy and chance events that may or may not be helpful in achieving the goal of a sustainable economy in Hawai'i.&#10;&#10;The player with the best Triple Bottom Line (people, planet, profit) score wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

In order to succeed, you&rsquo;ll make Moves, collaborate with Allies, put on Shows, employ Crew, experiment with Venture strategies, and buy Shine. As your Hype and Cash grow, your Career will evolve with your Opportunities, and you&rsquo;ll learn to count your Bars as you kick your rhymes in a cycle of Ciphers and Battles that lead to the acquisition of skills, wisdom, and respect. Strategic deckbuilding and card play gives rise to multiple lyrical Battles and Ciphers in a revolutionary game that concisely emulates the reality of hip hop today... ALL of hip hop.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Summary&#10;&#10;Legend of the Cipher is a deckbuilding game, where players start with a basic deck that produces Bars and Cash, which they will use to acquire Opportunity cards each turn to add to their deck. Each turn, players must also perform at Shows, using their Bars to attempt to out-rap the other players. This involves actual rapping, although one can easily play the included variant without raps. Successful raps will be rewarded with Hype, which is used to level up your rapper, in turn increasing both your hand size and production of Bars. The objective of LOC is to be the first player to level up enough to become a Legend of the Cipher.&#10;&#10;",

Many efforts have been made to turn Sudoku into a board game, but the integrity of the puzzle always ended up being compromised. It was always a pain to setup and the truth be told not a real fun board game - with no real advantage for you the player.&#10;&#10;So here comes Du-KO taking the concept of Sudoku to a whole new level, allowing for multi-players but still respecting the integrity of the solitaire player too. From 1- 9 players of all ages from 8 to 88 can easily and happily play Du-KO for a guaranteed good time.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to finish your section of the Sudoku grid first before your opponent(s). Each player takes their turn placing a peg in an open space within their designated portion of the puzzle. You'll go from clueless to competent your first game, and by your second game you'll have advanced from competent to competitive. Here's where it gets cut-throat and smokin' hot! You've been warned.&#10;&#10;The amazing part about Du-KO is that it is self-checking! When you play, the game will tell you instantly that whether you&rsquo;re wrong or right. If the peg is correct it will set all the way down, if incorrect it will remain slightly elevated and then must be removed and replayed on your next turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dinosaur Cowboys is a fast playing (45 to 60 minutes) skirmish game of competing posses composed of up to 5 members and 1 dinosaur. Each character in the posse can be customized to fulfill a different role and purchase weapons and equipment from the many options available. Combat takes place in the futuristic landscape of the year 2285, where a supervolcano erupted and changed the course of mankind forever.&#10;&#10;In the general the game is built around D12s and is meant to be light, thematic, and fast playing. Players build a Posse containing a Leader, 2-4 Members, and up to 1 Dinosaur, all of which benefit from some unique mechanics. Each Member has an Allegiance such as Duster or Neotechnoist which helps differentiate them (both thematically and statistically). Otherwise there are fairly standard statistics (Speed, Defense, Hitpoints, etc.) which can be customized by spending Improvement Points to really help define a role for each character. Furthermore Active and Passive Traits are selected to let characters do cool things like Crippling Shot, Speed Reload, Go For the Eyes, etc. Weapons and equipment are then purchased from a list of over 75 items ranging from laser Six-Shooters to plasma Shotguns.&#10;&#10;A standard game takes place on a tabletop covered in terrain and uses 28mm miniatures and plastic dinosaur toys. Activation of entities is done on a model-by-model basis instead of the entire Posse at once, so the battles are very fluid with plenty of time to react to the enemy. This is especially true as Initiative is rolled at the start of each Activation &quot;set&quot; instead of staying the same for the whole turn.&#10;&#10;Posses battle each other in one-off standalone games or in a linked campaign where further Improvement Points and Neodollars can be used to build and grow the group. Likewise injuries can accrue on characters that were taken out of action during an encounter. Deployment, objectives, and features can be used to add depth and variety to each battle beyond &quot;kill everything&quot;.&#10;&#10;The full rules are free to download and can be used with any range of miniatures. There is also a free &quot;beginner version&quot; (called Quickdraw) which condenses the core mechanics to under 10 pages, so players can jump into the game very easily.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Many millions of years ago, on the planet Cybertron, life existed, but not life as we know it today. Intelligent robots that could think and feel inhabited the cities. They were called Autobots and Decepticons. But the brutal Decepticons were driven by a single goal: total domination. They set out to destroy the peace-loving Autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across Cybertron, devastating all in its path, draining the planet's once rich sources of energy. The Autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive.&quot; - The Opening Narration from &quot;More Than Meets the Eye, Part I&#10;&#10;When an elite team of Autobots left Cybertron in search of energon, they were pursued by Megatron and his Decepticons. They crashed on Earth four million years ago and fell into a state of involuntary hibernation. Then, in 1984 they awakened, making Earth into a battlefield, with energon as the prize. Now the heroic Optimus Prime and his valiant Autobots must stop Megatron and the cruel Decepticons from plundering the Earth and fueling a war of galactic conquest.&#10;&#10;Transformers: Heavy Metal War is a card game that allows players to command their favorite Transformers from the first two seasons of the classic 1984 cartoon show. Each player must manage their hand and deploy Transformers with a variety of powers in order to complete missions, each giving the victor a unique reward. You will not only have the likes of Wheeljack, Jazz, Starscream, and Soundwave at your command, but also a host of lesser known Transformers, including Tracks and Reflector, as well as cards for human allies and unforeseen events.&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for? &quot;Transform and roll out!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game - an action-packed game of survival and Zombie combat.&#10;&#10;Can your band of survivors escape the Zombie-infested village of Endicott before the town falls victim to an eradicating nuclear purge? Or will you become infected by the Undead and turn on your allies? The possibilities are endless in a game that utilizes randomization and custom structure mechanics that immerse players in a completely fresh scenario with every new round of play.&#10;&#10;Based on the ENDICOTT EPIDEMIC multi-media series created by filmmaker and author Douglas Harvey, Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game is the first full board game that accompanies the Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion card game.  While Infectious Contagion was the condensed, &quot;lite&quot; version of the main game, EE:TBG is an epic battle for survival that offers all of the insane mechanics and suspenseful buildup to destruction that the card game couldn't bring to the table (literally).&#10;&#10;Utilizing game boards acting as maps based on primary areas of the Endicott Epidemic story (with fully functional expansion &quot;connections&quot; to mix and match your favorite ares as the game expands), players will drop their chosen characters (each with their own unique abilities that can be used strategically) into the heart of the epidemic and begin battling the Undead using classic roll-and-move mechanics as well as a series of unique &quot;Intrique&quot; cubes that modify gameplay with every roll.  A deck of Inquest cards act as side-missions that can be ignored or completed to gain resources used to fight and survive, or to gain special tokens that can be used in many different combinations to unlock new areas of play as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Combat is as simple as choosing your weapon (or brawling unarmed, if you so choose) and rolling the Combat Cubes.  Each face of each cube means a different value, giving you numerous combinations of attack to dish out against your chosen enemy.  But while rolling the cubes is the simple part, bear in mind that your enemies can (and most of the time *will*) fight back or dodge your attack entirely.  Strategize your plan of action before engaging the enemy to give you the best course through the hordes of Undead.  Or, if you think you have the stealth abilities to do so, roll the dice to try to evade the groups of enemies and slip through unnoticed and live to fight another turn.&#10;&#10;But beware - hidden with the game's deck of cards lay numerous deadly obstacles ranging from stronger than average 'Boss' Zombies, Black Ops agents, and even a handful of mutant Hazard Zombies, which spread MBI's toxic plume everywhere they go.  Once these villains begin to appear, the spreading plume is something the Survivors must be extremely wary of.  Plume markers begin to build in each area and once they reach their critical mass, deadly chain reactions are caused that could potentially wipe out every living thing on the board.  The biggest and most brutal enemy within the deck, however, is the Countdown - eight cards that constantly remind players of the impending nuclear purge.  Once the eighth and final card is drawn, the game is over - regardless of whether or not the survivors have completed their mission to find the Hermit, his critical intel, and his escape route.&#10;&#10;With all of the chaos going on as each Survivor makes their way through the town to complete their mission, the gameplay could get a little too intense for some people's liking.  Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game utilizes a completely customizable experience so that players can create the best scenario that is tailored to how they want to enjoy their game.  Removing certain aspects of the game like Hazard Zombies or Plume counters can greatly reduce the amount of suspenseful buildup that could turn players off from a game that could potentially be nearly impossible to win.  Inventory management and play deck building are also ways a group of players can ease the difficulty and ensure that the game, if played with all the right moves and strategic plans, can indeed be won without laying at the mercy of the Countdown or the roll of a die.&#10;&#10;The board game, at its core, is designed for 2-8 players.  However, like Infectious Contagion, the board game also allows a single player to enjoy the game experience as the lone survivor of Endicott&rsquo;s shift from living to undead.  Other game modes include a point-based Survivor mode that removes the Countdown and many other aspects of the game to allow players (or factions/teams of players) to battle waves of Undead, tallying up points at the end of each round and crowning a winner after a set amount of battles.  Or, players (or teams) can simply battle each other without the inclusion of Zombies (but with a Countdown) in a vastly customizable VS mode.&#10;&#10;A ticking time-bomb's clock, swarms of Undead that will chain themselves together to create deadly hordes, an ever-spreading toxic plume beneath your feet, stealthy Black Ops agents that mark you for execution when you fall within their sights, a limited number of resources that must be used in conjunction with an even more limited inventory system, a constant surge of adrenaline with every roll of the Intrigue cubes, making allies with your fellow Survivors only to find your group surrounded by Zombies with only two bullets and a grenade...all of this and more is what builds your game up from a simple beginning to an all-out epic battle for survival.  Think you can handle it?&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to spend all your earned money, accumulate 8 hours of time cards, and go to your apartment.&#10;&#10;The game is played by moving your pawn over a mapboard, showing the city of Vienna, overlayed with a grid. On your turn, you may move your pawn one or two spaces by foot, or three or four spaces by taxi, the latter costs money. You try to visit event locations (like Rosie's Caf&eacute;, your band's rehearsal room, a hot dog booth and various others). On most spaces you have to draw cards, which will help you to spend money and acquire time cards.&#10;&#10;The trick is to keep the right balance between spending money and acquiring time cards. You need at least 8 hours worth of time cards, then you can try to get to your apartment and win the game - but only if you have no money left.&#10;&#10;This game's pawns represent members of a locally known band in Austria; the title is Viennese slang and translates to &quot;night shift&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The cards come with rules for games with players being encouraged to create their own.&#10;&#10;The cards feature a single word or phrase detailing how a person can die: for instance, OLD AGE or TRAGIC FLAW or FED UP BARISTA. These predictions can be used in party games ala Apples to Apples: one player names a weapon and the rest submit a card from their hand that they feel could have been given to a person killed with that weapon. They can be used in storytelling games, where each player gets a card and the group must construct a series of events in which everyone dies. The rules also include an RPG of sorts, where players must buy items to kill targets with the deaths dealt from the deck.&#10;&#10;",

Five board spaces direct the player to draw a tile give them the choice between the word beginning or ending piles.  Nineteen spaces specify from which pile the player should draw.  Those spaces also direct the player to define the word played, rhyme it, use it in a sentence or use it in a question.  Four spaces direct the player to read all the words already on the board, awarding four points for doing so.  Landing on one of the four corners allows the player to move a tile already on the board.&#10;&#10;Tiles drawn or moved are placed on one of 61 spaces in the middle of the board which have either word beginnings or endings.  Harder-to-match tiles or spaces are worth more points than easy ones.  Points values range from one to six.  Play ends after one player reaches a predetermined number of points.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes statistical data for every circuit raced in 1984, and for all classes of motorcycles, like 80, 125, 250, 500c.c. as well as sidecars.&#10;&#10;After you have decided which race to run, you set up all the drivers (represented by cardboard figures). For every racer you turn up a card from a deck of race cards and compare the individual driver's rating with a table printed on each card. The card now tells you if the racers stay in the group of motorcycles they are currently in, if they fall back to the previous group, overtake other drivers within their group, or even catch up with the group in front of them. Mechanical troubles as well as possible accidents are also covered by the results of the card.&#10;&#10;After a number of draws, depending on the racing course and class of motorcycles chosen, the race is over.&#10;&#10;The game lets you replay any single race from the 1984 season or even the whole championship.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A book of variants for the game Lexicon, published by Waddingtons in 1935 or so. They had had great success with selling the original game, so they decided the market would like more variety. In effect, in modern terms, this book is an expansion as it adds lots of new rules that will need different strategy.&#10;&#10;The 64-page booklet sold separately (red cover for one shilling) and advertised 25 variants. The pale blue/green version was included for free in first edition blue books sold in 1935, but has rules for only 23 variant games with the Lexicon deck: Bridge; Whist; Scramble; Dominoes; Cribbage; Poker; Stud Poker; Eights; Clock Patience; Brighton Patience; Dictionary; Riddance; Donkey; Criss Cross; Twister; One Better; Jumble; Tap and Grab; Mine; Don't Forget; Demon; Pay Up; and Teasers. (The red cover edition also includes Lexicon Newmarket and Lexicon Duplexicon.)&#10;&#10;",
