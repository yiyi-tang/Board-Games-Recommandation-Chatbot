    "Description": "It is a very high quality &ldquo;word find&rdquo; board game, and appeals to a very large audience, ages 8 to adult.  It is designed to entertain a wide range of audiences and age groups.  Keesdrow is ideal to play at family gatherings, an evening with friends, or any time of day when people just need a break.  The game consists of 64 double-sided wood tiles (each tile consisting of four letters with number values assigned to each letter along with a hole for the placing of a colored peg)&#10;&#10;The object of the game is simple.  Players compete for high score by identifying words within a maze of letters and scoring points based on the letters they use.  As players identify words, they insert a colored peg in the hole of each letter used to form the word.  Adjoining letters may be up, down, left, right or diagonal.  The letters must be joined in sequence, and may be used more than once within the same word.  Letters have varying point values, and may be used a maximum of three times during the game.&#10;&#10;The first time a letter is used, it counts as a single point value, and a green peg is inserted in the hole of the letter.  The second time a letter is used, the point value is doubled and a yellow peg replaces the green peg.  The third and final time a letter is used, the point value is tripled, and a red peg replaces the yellow peg.  Once a letter has been used three times, it is expired and may not be used again for the remainder of the game.  (While playing the game, think of a stoplight &ndash; first play the green, then the yellow, and finally the red at which time play is stopped for that letter.)&#10;&#10;The key to making this game so enjoyable is the ability to use the same letter multiple times within the same word, to move in any direction to connect letters and to limit the use of individual letters to a maximum of three times.&#10;&#10;Game contents include a game board, sixty-four wood double-sided tiles (each side contains four letters, numbers and holes), 300 colored pegs, plastic case for the pegs, blue organization bag for the tiles, two-minute sand timer, very descriptive game instructions with color illustrations of the first twelve turns, and score pad.&#10;&#10;2006 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns to trade shares in 6 UK companies using information on share price movements available only to you. But every player has different information, hence decisions will be based not only on your cards, but also on the actions of the other players. This calls for guessing and bluffing. &#10;The game is played in a series of trading periods (called Bargain Periods). At the end of each, all players 'pool' their information and this forms the basis of the actual market price movements on each share. By gaining a larger percentage of a company's shares, a player can become Company Director or even Chairman and exert some personal influence on that company's share price. At the end of up to 10 trading periods, players calculate their total value to find the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Kaiser&rsquo;s War (KW), is an intermediate-complexity, strategic-level simulation of the last year of World War I in Europe, including an optional what-if extension into 1919. As 1918&rsquo;s campaign season opened, the Central Powers had defeated the Russian Empire and dominated much of Europe, yet less than a year later the Western Allies were triumphant.&#10;&#10;The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of VP. They may expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out certain actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play is a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game: one player controls the Central Powers; the other player controls the Allies. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. The map shows all of Europe from London to Moscow and south to Italy and Greece. Each game turn represents two months. Units of maneuver are mostly armies, along with certain elite and specialized corps. There are 17,500 words in the rules. Two experienced players can finish the shorter (historical) scenario in about four hours. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;The rules cover such things as: mobilization, replacements, unit conversions, trenches, fortified zones, fog of war, railroads, headquarters, air bases, naval bombardment, seasons, neutrals, Bolshevik and nationalist forces, critical cities, psychological warfare, morale, stand-fast orders, shock troops, proto-mechanized warfare, the Poles, the Allied Blockade, alpine units, the USMC, guerrillas, the Arab Legion, and much more.&#10;&#10;S&amp;T issue 261&#10;Reprinted in Command Magazine Japan #140 in April 2018.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Band of Brothers: Old Breed South Pacific is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the U.S. First Marine Division in the battles for Guadalcanal. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;Old Breed South Pacific is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also part of a growing series of tactical games.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles is the first in the series and follows the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is the second in the series and follows the German 11th Panzer Division.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Texas Arrows is a dependant expansion that follows the U.S. 36th Infantry Division.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Risk Balance of Power is a two-player version of Risk on a map covering a large part of Europe (Iberia and the Balkans do not partake). The map is divided into 6 regions consisting of 30 territories. Some of the territories contain rough terrain and are harder to attack.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different basic starting setups for the 2 players. All of them include a neutral player. To win, a player must keep his capital and achieve 3 goals. All goals are public. For each setup a different combination of 8 of the available 12 goals is used.&#10;&#10;In the Command Centre version, one player sets up both sides and the neutrals then the other choses which one to play and who starts. Each side is able to add support to the neutral player, and your defeated armies can be used to gain special bonuses. One of the bonuses even allows you to attack with (some) neutral armies.&#10;&#10;Armies are still raised based on the number of territories and any regions you own, but also on the number of cities. As in standard risk, area cards are still gained upon conquering a territory, and can still be used to raise additional armies. The army units are in the shape of small (flat) arrows.&#10;&#10;Manufacturer's description (translated from the Dutch edition):&#10;RISK for 2 players. Battle man-to-man in this strategic battle of epic proportions. In this exciting strategy game everything revolves around the conquest and domination of Europe. For 12 years and up.&#10;&#10;Two distinct ways to play the game:&#10;Base training - an introductory game which you can play within a few minutes.&#10;Command centre - a fast and exciting strategy game in which everything revolves around conquest and domination.&#10;&#10;",

Fortunately, there are many mirrors that can be used to find these things without him having to move in all there rooms.&#10;&#10;The game box with a coverage forms the castle. On each side, there are three windows. One stays open, the others are filled with images of the items to find - but visible only from the inside of the box. There are also 4 mirrors which can be stuck into the box (at 45 degree angles), which make it possible to see any of the items when looking through the one open window into the castle. There's also a door (used with the advanced rules) that can block the view.&#10;&#10;Players in turn roll a die, and move Victor along a track at the top of the box. The space he's landing on show what item he now has to find. He may move up to 3 mirrors, then peek through the open window. If the wrong item shows up, it's the next players turn. But when the correct item is seen, he gains one blood token; afterward, that item and the open window switch places.&#10;&#10;The other players may gain a blood token, too. After the active player has set up the mirrors, but before he looks to the window, they may predict whether the correct item shows up. If they guess right, they gain a drop.&#10;&#10;The player that first collects a set number of blood tokens (depending on number of players) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Darkness is a strategy card game set in ancient Northern Europe where druids vie for control of powerful artifacts.  It's a simultaneous action game where players play a progressing amount of colored cards in order to acquire unclaimed artifacts and relics, in a complex, and fun game of prediction, observation, and thought.&#10;&#10;Game play takes place over the course of six rounds.  In each round player try to acquire cards that give them end game points, and special abilities.  The objective of the game is to score the most points at the end.&#10;&#10;Each round is separated into four phases.  In the first phase, players place three of their colored cards from their hand in front of them, face down.  Then everybody reveals their cards.&#10;&#10;Next, everybody places two cards down in front of them, and then reveals those.  Then players play one final card face down and reveal that one, for a total of six revealed cards.  Finally, there is a resolution phase where the players determine who has the largest amount of dominant, and sub-dominant colors for each of the available artifacts, and they are divided up accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players have the same hand of 15 cards throughout the course of the game, thus limited luck.  The 15 cards a comprised of five colors, with three cards of each color.  Once a card is played during a round, it is put back in a player's hand at the end of the round and can be played again.&#10;&#10;On each artifact card this is a dominant, and sub-dominant color.  The card goes to the player that has played the most color cards that match the dominant color.  In the case of a tie, the player with the largest number of color cards played that match the sub-dominant color gets the card.  The reason the game is complex and fun is, there are many different dominant and sub colors on the board at the same time, and people have to predict what other people are going for based on set collection, and the optimization of color specialization.&#10;&#10;The game ends after six rounds.  The person who wins is the person with the most number of points, which is determined by how much of a type a player has in each of their sets, and how many gem relics they have.&#10;&#10;",

No two games will play the same as changing Fate and Rune cards are introduced to create a variable game board offering phenomenal replayability. Players will be executing exciting combinations and managing valuable resources, all while cautiously engaging other players.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, the game board is seeded with five Starting Rune cards, six Rune cards at random, and one randomly-drawn Fate card. Once the first player is determined, they gain the powerful Primus Token and randomly determine the placement of the starting &quot;Round 1&quot; card, while all other players receive one Skill card or one gem.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns placing or socketing one die at a time onto a Rune card of their choice, yielding Skill and Power cards, gems or victory points, and they can even attack other players.&nbsp;After all dice have been placed, the cards on the board are resolved in sequential order. As each die is removed, the effect of that placement is resolved. This sequence makes for exciting combinations and rewards strategic play.&#10;&#10;All resources of the game are finite, so players need to play carefully in order to avoid wasting placements. The game ends after five rounds or immediately if any player reaches  Victory on the Score Track.&#10;&#10;",

They each choose two cards to set aside face down.&#10;&#10;The lead player starts the first trick by laying down a single card, a pair of the same number, or two or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The next players in turn must play a higher matching combination of cards or pass, although a player who passes can re-enter the trick later. Once everyone passes, the player who won the trick leads again. (Note that all played cards stay in front of who played them.)&#10;&#10;If a player lays down an 8, whether alone or in combination, everyone else must pass, then this player leads a new trick. If a player runs out of cards, they score points based on how many players still have cards in hand, and play continues until all but one player goes out.&#10;&#10;The last player then takes over a player's seat: first in a two-player game, second in a three-player game, and first or second in a four-player game (with the third player then taking the other option). After moving to their new locations, players then take the eleven cards in front of them, discard two, then play the round again. If the player in the fourth seat can do better than fourth, they score points &mdash; lots of points if they come in first. Along the same lines, if the player in the first seat does poorly, they lose points.&#10;&#10;If a player has set aside an 8 in their two cards, they can declare &quot;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#147;&quot; (donden = revolution) by revealing the card on their turn.

Many of these well-intentioned actions can damage &quot;New Eden&quot;, however. Will the station withstand this damage, or will it collapse in on itself?

Whoever has built the most points and thus the safest and most livable station wins &quot;New Eden&quot;.&#10;&#10;In more detail, New Eden lasts three rounds. Each round, first reveal the module cards and place them in four rows. Players take turns buying a card from the display, using oxygen to take an action with a diver on a module, or passing. When you buy a card, the cost can vary from 10 coins + 3 repaired damage to 1 coin + 1 damage. When a row is empty, all cards drop down one level, making them cheaper, but potentially damaging. Discard all cards on display once everyone has passed.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, enter the black market phase. Each player takes three cards from the black market deck, with remaining cards placed in rows on the display. Pay for any cards with coins and damage, then place the remaining cards in a row of the display.&#10;&#10;Players then bid on a row in the display, with each row having a combination of discard black market cards and empty spaces, which allow you to move a diver and activate a module. Once all four rows have been auctioned, players have a brief scoring and clean-up before the next round.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, if your level of damage exceeds the meter on your board, you score no endgame points, keeping only those points scored during play. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players play the role of opposing Sheepie generals in the grand tournament of cakes.&#10;&#10;Players start a round with several cake tokens each and take turns playing Sheepie cards to steal cakes from the other player. The first player to take all the cakes wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins the duel. The catch is that all cards are played face down, so any card can be bluffed as any other card, and all plays can be challenged, instantly ending the round. Each round comes with new opportunities to make tricky plays and mind game the other player. Experienced players can also keep track of which cards have been played and bluff strategically to strengthen their attacks.&#10;&#10;The basic deck contains 20 cards: 12 attackers, 7 blockers, and a Wolf which can only be played by bluffing. There are also 10 special cards, two of which are randomly added to the basic deck at the beginning of each duel. These special cards all change up the basic game in their own way, either by adding special mechanics, or altering the balance of power. Players discover which special cards are in the deck over the course of the duel, and can use this information to make more believable plays and deduce which of their opponent's plays are likely to be bluffs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In an age when poetry and the arts reigned supreme, the nights of Kyoto were filled with romance. Gentlemen of the Imperial court, ordinary clerks and functionaries by day, went out at night to meet their secret lovers in furtive trysts. Writing by the light of the moon, each tried to craft the finest and most moving poetry in the form of the Tanka, a short verse composed of only five lines. The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court. By far, the most successful such lover was a fictional one named Hikaru Genji, the Shining Prince. Genji was, for the ladies of the court, the symbol of the perfect lover. For the men of the court, he was the perfect example to emulate. &#10;In GENJI, players take the roles of courtiers out to woo fair princesses. Players score points for writing the finest poetry, or winning the most hearts. But beware: other courtiers will be waiting in the wings to steal those hearts away! Take your brush in hand, and set out on the night streets of Kyoto. The romance of the height of the Heian Period awaits you in GENJI.&#10;&#10;From BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;&quot;Players in Genji try to learn from the historical figure of Genji and woo the ladies of the Imperial Court with their poetry. Twelve ladies, each bearing a symbol of one of the four seasons as well as one of three fashions &ndash; melancholy, nature, romance &ndash; are laid out in a circle, with a fashion card chosen at random to show players what type of poetry is in style.&#10;&#10;&quot;In each of the four seasons, each player will travel from his &ldquo;home&rdquo; &ndash; a lady chosen at the start of the game that bears his marker &ndash; around the circle in either direction. A player moves 1-3 spaces each turn, then either studies new material (discards poetry cards and draws new ones) or woos the lady he is currently visiting. If he has no rivals who have previously presented her with poems, he can present her with a poem on one or two cards. &ldquo;Each poem card has the top or the bottom of a classic Tanka poem (5 lines, 5,7,5,7,7 syllables each, respectively),&rdquo; says Kirk. &ldquo;A poem can be considered either a top, a bottom, or a match of the two cards.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&quot;If another player has already presented a poem, then he can either complete the poem (assuming only a single card was played) or challenge it (by playing a poem card that increases the beauty of the poem, thus revealing the other player for the poser he is). In the latter case, you discard your contribution and the matching half, then add the remaining half poem to your hand to be used later. &#10;...&#10;&quot;The round ends once a player returns home and makes a final study or woo action. Players then score points if they have the most poems on the board for that season, have presented the most beautiful poem of the season, or pitched woo at the home of another player. Yes, being a scoundrel can pay off.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Chrome comes in the form of spies, gendarmes, multi-national forces (and associated cooperation issues), reconnaissance, variable reinforcements and much more. The game covers an area from Ollioules in the West to Sollies in the East and from Mount Farron in the North to Cap Cepet in the South.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Xactika is an original card game that challenges players' ability to estimate the outcome of playing eight cards. You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &ndash; hence the name Xactika &ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.&#10;&#10;To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn has 3&#10;Rounds where victory condition varies.&#10;&#10;- Round 1: The highest card wins.&#10;- Round 2: The lowest card wins.&#10;- Round 3: The intermediate cards win.&#10;&#10;Each Round can be won by more than one player, if they match the score or&#10;victory condition. For example, in a 5-player game, up to 3 of them could have&#10;the intermediate card that gives the victory in Round 3.&#10;&#10;When all 3 Rounds have been played, the starting player becomes Dealer.&#10;Thereby, all players will be Dealer once throughout the game.&#10;In each Round -in order, beginning with the starting player- players secretly&#10;choose a card from their hand and place it in their playing area face down&#10;They must choose between:&#10;- Exchange your card with the player on the left (they cannot refuse). The&#10;Dealer player has no players on their left. If you&rsquo;re Dealer and want to&#10;exchange your card, you can do it with the deck, first declaring it aloud. To&#10;do this, you must lift one or more cards at a time without looking. The card&#10;revealed after this cut is your new card.&#10;- To fold, that is, to keep the card that you&rsquo;ve chosen or that&rsquo;s been given to&#10;you after a previous exchange.&#10;- Use the ability of the card, if possible (Merchant, Thief, Juggler and Dragon).&#10;- If you have cards in hand, change the card with one of your hand.&#10;Once all the players have played, reveal players&acute;cards to activate the abilities&#10;&ldquo;At the end of the Round...&rdquo; of the cards that have this ability (Innkeeper,&#10;Jester, Monk, Sorceress, Knight, Princess and Queen).&#10;&#10;The winners of each Round score a point. To indicate that they take the score&#10;markers and place them in their playing area according to their points value.&#10;Once the 3 Rounds have been played, the deck is formed and shuffled again,&#10;and a new turn begins.&#10;When the last Dealer player&rsquo;s turn is finished, the points are counted. The&#10;SECOND player with the most victory points is declared an absolute winner&#10;of Death Over The Kingdom until the next game!&#10;In case all players are tied in highest and lowest points, no player wins this&#10;game. You will have to play again!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hardest Days, designed by John Butterfield, is a purpose-designed solitaire wargame of intermediate complexity covering five critical days in the Battle of Britain, the five days that saw the heaviest air action in the sky over England in the summer of 1940. Each of those days is presented as its own scenario. THD puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to air raids launched by the Luftwaffe, which is controlled by the game system.&#10;&#10;Each one-day scenario represents up to 14 hours during which the Luftwaffe launches raids against targets in southern England, defended by the squadrons of RAF Fighter Command. German raids include bomber Gruppen (groups), attempting to hit specific targets, and fighter groups protecting those bombers and attacking British fighter squadrons. The German goal is twofold: inflict damage on targets and destroy squadrons to gain air superiority in preparation for the invasion of England.&#10;&#10;The game system controls German strategy and tactics. You use your fighter squadrons to respond to the raids in an attempt to destroy or turn back the raiders and prevent their effective bombing of their targets, while minimizing your own fighter losses. Your fighter squadrons and German fighter groups may participate in several raids in a given day, while German bombers, flying from distant bases, participate in only one raid per day. To track the passage of time, as measured by the sequencing of raids and the turnaround of squadrons and groups during each &ldquo;Raid Day,&rdquo; the action is divided into seven two-hour time segments, from 0600 to 1800 hours, inclusive.&#10;&#10;One inch on the area map equals 10 miles. British squadrons are composed of 10 to 15 aircraft. German groups possess 20 to 30 aircraft.  Each time segment represents two hours. Each Air Action Phase represents 10 minutes. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. Raid Approach Phase&#10; 1. Raid Region Determination&#10; 2. RAF Patrol&#10; 3. Raid Effort &amp; Coast Crossing&#10; 4. British Detection&#10;II. Air Action Phase&#10; 1. Interception &amp; Combat&#10; 2. Targeting &amp; Bombing&#10; 3. Raid Movement&#10; 4. Squadron Movement&#10;III. Airfield Operations Phase&#10; 1. German Recovery&#10; 2.

Stones enjoy the freedom of chess Queens, except that with every move they must come to rest on a band closer to the Throne. A stone flanked by two adverse stones (either orthogonally or diagonally) is captured and defects to the other player. The aim is to capture the Throne for one's own King by completing a 'frame' (i.e., a rotationally-symmetrical arrangement of four stones) around it at any distance. The Throne may change hands any number of times in the course of play, but whichever side's King is in occupation at game's end (i.e. when one player, on his turn, has no available move) is the winner. If the Throne remains neutral throughout, the game is drawn.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;      Boardspace.net Real time or turn based, against humans or robots&#10;      Littlegolem.net Turn-based&#10;      Mindsports.nl Turn-based&#10;     Against Stephen Tavener's AI at http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/ (Java 8 required)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;Similar to: &#10;&#10;     Ming Mang played on NxN board (8x8 for ToyToyToy version)&#10;     Othello different setup and play, but same type of conversion capture.&#10;     (Designer clarification) Neither Ming Mang nor Othello.  That's to say: one can see (sort of) why these supposed similarities were posted - initial board set-up resembling Ming Mang (though not really any longer since the May 2015 update), custodial capture as in Othello (though even then with major differences) - but actually these analogies are not very different from saying that soccer = American football = hockey because all are ball games played by teams of 11 on rectangular fields of similar size.  You may or may not be a fan of Morelli, but either way there's no escaping the fact that in its gameplay it's just about as unlike any other Abstract as you can get.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Napoleon Retreats - Campaign in France II&#10;&#10;Winter 1814: Hope Against Hope&#10;&#10;After dispatching Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Army of Silesia at Vauchamps, Napoleon diverted temporarily toward the Seine at Montereau, for an inconclusive brush with Schwarzenberg&rsquo;s Army of Bohemia. His inveterate foe Bl&uuml;cher apparently had learned no lessons and threatened to move again on Paris. By March 3rd Napoleon was returning northward along the bank of the Ourcq River. The fall of Soissons, cheaply surrendered by General Moreau, saw the quarry escape over the Aisne River to link-up with 43,000 reinforcements near Laon, raising his strength to over 100,000. While the Emperor concentrated between Fismes and Berry au Bac, Bl&uuml;cher continued to retreat on Laon. Reaching Craonne, the Emperor decided to advance along the chemin des dames to test Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s position on the plateau, and clear the flank of his advance on Laon.&#10;&#10;The next game of the TLNB-Series covers the Campaign in France, Part II: &#10;6 March to 13 March 1814. &#10;The major battle was Laon, on 9-10 March, when Napoleon, with 37,000, went up against Bl&uuml;cher's position, on the hill of Laon, with 85,000. (Marshal Marmont with a separate VI Corps was supposed to support the attack, but he was dispersed in a night combat.) Bl&uuml;cher wasn't feeling well and failed to pursue. One more battle was to follow (after two days for R&amp;R) and Napoleon won that battle: Reims, against St. Priest. So actually, he won two out of three.&#10;&#10;Battles Simulated&#10; Craonne, Struggle for the plateau des dames, 7 March &#10;The chemin des dames runs the length of a continuous ridge from the N2 to the N44, the two main highways leading north to Laon. Bl&uuml;cher stationed Sacken and Woronzoff&rsquo;s infantry on the plateau just west of Craonne. Napoleon decided on a frontal attack up the chemin on what he believed to be no more than a 20,000-man rearguard. The Russians begrudgingly gave ground, gaining it back in a counterattack, and throwing Ney off the Plateau. Once the French Guard cavalry had stabilized the situation, the Russian right flank began to give way under combined pressure of infantry and cavalry. Napoleon directed 88 guns from the Guard artillery to destroy the Russian center and sent the Guard infantry to attack along the chemin to complete the victory. The Russians withdrew in good order.&#10;&#10;Laon, Beginning of the End, 9-10 March &#10;Marshal Ney advanced on Laon in the morning snow. B&uuml;low with 17,000 men held the suburbs of Semilly and Ardon. On the plain west of Laon, Winzingerode was posted with 25,000 men; east of Laon at Athies, Yorck and Kleist held another 25,000 men; Langeron and Sacken were in reserve with 36,000; Napoleon attacked with fewer than 40,000. As the southern suburbs traded hands, Bl&uuml;cher thought that he was being attacked just by an advanced guard, but Napoleon threw everything into Ney&rsquo;s attack up until 6 PM. Marmont commanded a separate force of 10,000 which had managed to fight their way to Athies by 5 PM, camping for the night. At 7:30, the Prussian Yorck launched a combined arms attack that routed Marmont&rsquo;s entire camp. A small group of French Guardsmen managed to halt the pursuit. Marmont lost 45 guns, all his wagons, and 3,500 men. Bl&uuml;cher lost a chance to destroy his foe&rsquo;s small army.&#10;&#10;Reims, A Quick Success en passant, 13 March &#10;On March 12th the Russian General St. Priest snatched Reims from its small French garrison. Hearing of this, Napoleon and his small force moved east on the 13th, beginning their attack at 4 PM, quickly driving out the enemy, and cutting communications between Bl&uuml;cher and Schwarzenberg at the same time. Only 10,000 French troops were actually engaged against 15,000 of St. Priest. St. Priest was killed along with 3,000 men while losing 23 guns.&#10;&#10;Campaign Game, 6 -13 March&#10;&#10;All three maps fit together to create an irregular playing area 44&quot;x68&quot; and covering an entire week of fighting.&#10;&#10;&bull; Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps &#10;&bull; 560 die-cut units &#10;&bull; 100 playing cards &#10;&bull; Two rulebooks&#10;&bull; 15 player aid cards &#10;&bull; Game Box&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;STANDARD TLNB-GAME SYSTEM:&#10;&#10;&bull; scale: 480m (525 yards)/ hex;&#10;&bull; strength: 500-800 men/SP;&#10;&bull; turn-duration: 1 hour/turn&#10;&#10;",

A tile consists of island and water bodies, natural features (Corals, Forests) and man-made features (Houses, Hotels, Ports and Fisheries) of both player colors.&#10;&#10;Placing more forests as well as completing an island triggers bonuses, that enables players to pick bonus tokens and improve their scores! But there are only a limited number of them, and all of them are unique.&#10;&#10;Each feature has a unique way of accruing points based on their placement. The game ends when the last tile is placed and the player with the highest score wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Col. George Armstrong Custer. The battle was the most famous event in the Indian Wars and was a crushing victory for the Indians. Custer, already famous for his Civil War exploits, became an American folk legend. Little Bighorn was the last great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne. Defiant and proud, they were determined to preserve their way of life, but within a year, they were broken and defeated by a nation swept up in the emotions of the Centennial and bent on revenge for the death of an American hero.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Little Bighorn is the third game in the Indian Wars of the American West series.  This game also includes the Montana column led by Col. Gibbons.  This column was the third column in the field within General Terry&rsquo;s campaign plan.  Crook&rsquo;s Wyoming column was the other part of this campaign, and included in Volume II of the series, The Battle of Rosebud Creek.&#10;The Montana column includes Col. Gibbon, the 7th Infantry, 2nd Cavalry, and Low&rsquo;s Artillery Battery of Gatling guns(?) and a 12 lb howitzer.  Players may now explore the possibilities and capabilities of these guns, and what effect these forces could have had on the outcome of the battle.  Scenarios included the historical game, the Montana columns arrival, assigning the Gatling guns or the 2nd cavalry with Custer. Is this last line correct?&#10;The new expanded maps (from the original DTP version), allows for the relocation of the Indian village, the arrival of the Montana column, and if Custer had waited for Terry or was delayed because he took the Gatling guns.&#10;&#10;",

To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.&#10;&#10;Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location. Support cards provide different abilities, such as enlarging your bank or providing time points (which can be used to draw additional cards). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

During colonization phases, all cards in play are revealed, the placement of influence is resolved, and conflict occurs.&#10;&#10;Whenever all native influence is eliminated from a region, that region's resources are collected. The amount of resources collected by each player depends on each players' influence in the region. At the end of the game, the player who collects the most resources wins.&#10;&#10;The main items in this new edition are the 6 new cards, five of them being Upgrade cards.

    "Description": "Foragers is a strategy game in which players take on the role of ancient foragers competing to be the most respected member of the tribe. In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently.  Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool.&#10;&#10;When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food's freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track).  As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten.  Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils.  In this sense, the players are racing not only against each other, but against nature.&#10;&#10;",

The dwarf who manages to collect the most money will have the mine all to himself.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into six rounds. On their turn each player must:&#10;1. Mine a crystal:&#10;The player draws a crystal from the bag and places it on his cart.&#10;If the mined crystal is an unstable crystal, the player receives a&#10;reroll marker. There is no limit to the number of reroll tokens a player can have.&#10;2. Roll the dice:&#10;Each player has up to three dice rolls per turn. In the first, all 5 dice must be rolled. In the second and third they can reroll as many dice as they want. If it has a Reroll Marker, the player can discard it to perform an extra reroll.&#10;3. Perform actions:&#10;According to the result of the dice the player will be able to perform one or more actions. The more faces of the same action are available, the more efficient that action will be. Actions allow the player to mine more crystals, steal crystals, store crystals in the chest, or transfer unstable crystals to opponents.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game everyone receives points according to the value of the crystals they have, being entitled to bonus points for collections of equal crystals. Each unstable crystal will penalize its owner 3 points less and the player with the fewest crystals in the chest loses 5 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Defending America is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of an actual or experimental interceptor aircraft during a frightening look at what might have been in World War II. Each turn consists of one sortie, during which the player will fly a mission to intercept Amerika Bombers which are en route to bomb the mainland of the United States.  As the player progresses, he may choose to upgrade to even more advanced interceptors in this alternate history game.  It builds a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to earn skills, rise in rank through promotion, receive awards and survive a dangerous year above the Atlantic Ocean and America.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a interceptor pilot and rack up as many bomber kills as possible, with a special emphasis on preparing to stop atomic attacks. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. Awards and technological advances via use of the technology track help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the &ldquo;Scourge of the Amerika Bombers&rdquo; and end the threat to the United States from the air.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot along with your assignment, play proceeds by taking off when the enemy bomber force nears, then checking to intercept them before they get a chance to bomb a multitude of targets on the mainland United States. Combat consists of interception from your U.S. carrier or land-based aircraft, depending on where the player is currently located, then intercepting one of six historically modelled (albeit hypothetical) Amerika Bombers. After interception, landing operations occur, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain if any awards have been earned or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Experience points if desired to gain skills and may request a new interceptor type if one is available. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until the end of March 1948, should you make it through unscathed.&#10;&#10;While Defending Amerika is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions, and an option to link the game with Amerika Bomber: Evil Queen of the Skies&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;    Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: Weekly turns (individual sorties, 4 per month)&#10;    Map Scale: Abstract&#10;    Unit Scale: Individual aircraft, weapon systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds&#10;    Players: One (with option for two or more)&#10;    Playing Time: 60-90 minutes&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;    One Counter Sheet of 9/16&quot; unit-counters&#10;    Eight Aircraft Display Mats&#10;    Nine Player Aid Cards&#10;    One Combat Display Mat&#10;    One Pilot Awards Display Mat&#10;    One Air Operations Mat&#10;    Rules Booklet&#10;    One Logsheet&#10;    Two 6-sided, and one 10-sided die&#10;    Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Just turn over a card, and you'll know who the start player is.&#10;&#10;That was a wonderful solution...for 2006. But we're clearly living in the future now, and there's no time for getting out the box, shuffling cards, and finally turning a card over. It's time for something better, faster, and a whole lot more technologically advanced. It's time for Start Player Express.&#10;&#10;Start Player Express consists of four custom dice. There's no shuffling, there's a whole lot less reading, and there's no messing with a box. (You're not a Neanderthal, are you?) Just roll the dice and BOOM! You know who goes first.&#10;&#10;",

Players will represent the Israeli and Arab high commands and maneuver their units and conduct combat in an attempt to attain the objectives of their respective nations. Because of the two front nature of the war, Bar Lev is uniquely suited to a multi-player game, with one player commanding the Israelis, one the Egyptians, and one the Syrians. Additional players can also be added to allow one commander for each front for the Israelis, air force commanders, or commanders for the various Arab allies. The ground game can be played without the air game, but it is recommended that the air game be incorporated into play as soon as the players are familiar with the ground rules, after two or three games, for instance.&#10;&#10;(from rulebook introduction)&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale: Operational, Battalion-Regiment, 1 Day per turn, 3-6 Km/hex&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence: 1.
