    "Description": "From the box:&#10;&quot;A truly classic board game that is as old as Rome.  This game was probably played in the very first Roman tavern.  It has remained an Italian favorite to this day.&#10;&#10;Object: Most throws of the dice have a price, and players pay the board until someone throws the lucky combination that wins all.&#10;&#10;The games in this series are from our favorite &quot;watering holes&quot; on four different continents.  We are proud to present them to our friends here at home, and have forced ourselves to consume a lot of memorable local brews in the fulfillment of this endeavor.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take turns to roll two dice.  Any number other than 7, 2 or 12 requires placing the stake (or stone from the set) on the number rolled on the supplied board.&#10;&#10;Roll 2 and take the stakes from 8-12, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 12 and take the stakes from 2-6, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 7 and you take ALL the stakes, or place one stake on 7 if the board is empty.&#10;&#10;Play continues until agreed, or all but one of the players is out of money (or stones).  A Neapolitan version ignores the rules for 2 and 12, and treats them as any other non-7 roll.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the boards from the main game has a corresponding battlefield, and players maneuver heroes and villains on these battlefields to improve their position in the fully integrated main game.&#10;&#10;From the ancient ruins of Weathertop to the conflict at the Black Gate of Mordor, the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring is marked with battle. The armies of Sauron are on the march, and unless the courage and faith of the Fellowship can hold, the Shadow will be victorious.&#10;&#10;The new Battlefields expansion for Reiner Knizia's acclaimed The Lord of the Rings board game focuses on the deadly combats that the Fellowship must survive on its quest to destroy the One Ring. Now in addition to guiding the Fellowship through its many perils, the players also help to hinder or defeat Sauron's powerful armies, because the farther enemies march on the battlefield board, the more destruction they cause and the closer Sauron comes to recovering the One Ring!&#10;&#10;Will Aragorn arrive in time to defend against the Witch King at Weathertop? Will Boromir's courage hold against the savage Uruk-Hai? Will Gimli's axe be enough to withstand a horde of orcs at the Chamber of Mazarbul?

Phase A is the investigation phase, where the heroes move through the town of Sunnydale to find 5 pieces of evidence about the boss monster while battling hordes of minor monsters. Battles are fought with rolling dice and comparing strength and stamina. When the heroes have found who the opponent is and where he lives, phase B - the confrontation phase- starts, which is played on the backside of the board and consists of one battle between the heroes and the boss monster and his surviving  adjutants.&#10;&#10;",

The key here is that each pair of dice is always rolled together.&#10;&#10;For example, if you have 3 of a Kind with your blue dice, and a Pair with your red dice, you might choose to roll two sets of dice (i.e., a blue die and a red one, twice, but ALWAYS rolling the same two dice of each set together throughout the game), hoping for a 4 or 5 of a Kind.  Continuing the example, you might not add to your 3 of a Kind with the blue dice, but maybe you'll pick up a Full House with the red.  No problem -- now you're betting on a Full House.  You can switch back and forth on the hand you're rolling on (blue dice or red), but you must always keep the individual pairs of dice together.&#10;&#10;",

The game pad lists the training goals of each horse type; for example, the Arabian's most important training is pleasure, then, in sequence, halter, endurance, dressage, reining, driving, racing, trick riding, jumping, and barrels. Other horses emphasize different training schedules.&#10;Players roll and move around the board, attempting to participate in the training most important to their horses. They also gather bonuses for proper care of their horses; for example, a stop at the vet scores points. The winner isn't necessarily the one to get to the end of the game board first, but to have accumulated the most points for training and care.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taken from the games website:&#10;Venturers in Argent is a fantasy boardgame set in the World of Argent.  It is a cooperative game in which as many as five players can participate, or as few as one (thus it is suitable for solitaire play).  The players take on the parts of venturers, who set out to find treasure on a dangerous enterprise called a venture.  The game can be played as a single venture in one session, or as a campaign of several ventures, with the power and abilities of the venturers increasing as they prepare for their final objective: the stronghold of the Silent Mountain &hellip; and the One Who Waits.&#10;&#10;",

Super Tank is more than just an expansion of SPI's game, however, it is a complete revision of the infantry rules.  Armored Vehicle rules are mostly in SPIs's rules folders for Tank.  The infantry in Super Tank are played sequentially while the vehicle and gun units remain simultaneous.  This makes large numbers of infantry easier to game...&#10;&#10;The hexes on the large map are one inch to allow play with 1/285 miniatures.&#10;&#10;The player will find that he has all the units he needs for all WWII types of attack and defense, including cavalry, machine guns, mortars, bridge laying AFV, rocket launchers and many other new types of units.  Super tank is truly a combined arms game.&#10;&#10;Game components include one 34&quot; by 54&quot; map (!) two mini 11&quot; by 17&quot; plotting maps, two Terrain and combat tables, eight (!) 11&quot; by 14&quot; die cut counter sheets (448 infantry, 960 Armored Vehicles) one booklet of rules, and three zip Lock bags.&#10;&#10;Game includes just about every tank made by anyone in WWII, each unit rated for Front, Side and Rear armor, as well as AP/HE factors, Range and Movement.
