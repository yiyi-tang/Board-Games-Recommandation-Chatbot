This gives the board the appearance of a Greek cross.  The other side of the board is printed with a standard checkerboard so it can be used for traditional checkers.&#10;&#10;There are 4 sets of pieces: red, black, ivory and gold.  Red and black are usually placed opposite each other, as are ivory and gold.&#10;&#10;Play is similar to traditional checkers, and has two possible methods of kinging (to be chosen by the players in advance).   The first is the traditional method, in which a piece has to cross to the final row on the opposite side of the board.   The second requires a piece to merely reach any edge, left, right or opposite.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players.   2 players can play using two sets of pieces, either side-by-side or on opposite ends.&#10;&#10;",

Cards range from an Ace up to the dreaded Snowman (an 8). Play nine holes or eighteen, it's up to you. Whether you're a scratch golfer, a hacker or have never picked up a golf club you'll love Shiperio. Just like on the course players will succeed with skill, strategy, and a little luck!&#10;&#10;In golf, the term Shiperio is similar to a Mulligan where a player is allowed a second shot without penalty. The nice thing about a Shiperio is that, unlike a Mulligan, the golfer gets to choose which ball to play. In our game we have a card called the Shiperio Card . It's played quite similar to a Shiperio on the course. We liked the name so much we decided to name the game after it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Step into the castle and you'll step into adventure - an adventure the kind of you certainly haven't experienced yet!&quot;&#10;&#10;Carrying on the age-old 'damsel in distress' theme, the players in The Prisoner of the Tower are knights on a quest to rescue a fair maiden from whatever unnamed evil (the game is surprisingly lacking/vague in backstory and flavour text) has imprisoned her in the magical castle. To do so, they must collect keys that open doors, gear that will help them on the way - for example, a rope will allow a player to use routes otherwise not accessible, a shield will protect them in combat, etc. - and face various dangers and creatures, many of which can be defeated with the correct gear. And, since this is cutthroat rather than co-op, they can of course battle each other too for the possession of keys or maiden chits - the real maiden will be in one of the six maiden chits randomly distributed in the castle's six towers, and the one who manages to bring her safely back to square one will be the winner. Good luck and - &quot;Courage and strength!&quot;&#10;&#10;Note: There is a typo in this game's contents list. Trap and Ghost cards are listed as 15 each, but so far three completely separate copies have been observed that only have the same 14 cards in each deck.&#10;&#10;",

The chits are DIY style (cut out and stick on cardboard) and features familiar unit with Speed, Armour and Firepower attributes. The magazine comes with a plain white hexed folded map.&#10;&#10;There are 3 scenarios of varying complexity. Each turn, players roll 2 dice and use the higher roll as command points to activate the corresponding amount of Unit.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by rolling a D6 equivalent to the unit's firepower. A hit results in a 4, 5, 6 roll unless there are penalties or bonuses applied (for terrain or units).&#10;&#10;A good fairly quick game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Make-Shift / Clou is an abstract game that looks a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe. The board is a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles that can slide inside the board with spaces on top for player pieces, which are colored plastic disks.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to complete a row, column or diagonal of three of your own pieces. However each player only has 3 pieces and the 3 x 3 grid is occupied by only 8 sliding tiles where player pieces can be played. So, although it looks like Tic-Tac-Toe, the game play is completely different.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can either play a piece onto an empty tile, move a piece from one tile onto an empty tile, or slide a tile into the empty space. The other player is not allowed to slide a just-moved tile back to where it came from, thus preventing game lock up.&#10;&#10;If you get 3 in a row, you win the round and the first player to win 6 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Who knows what you might need on vacation! The gameboard set-up is simple: place the twenty-four colored counters in a circle and arrange the thirty printed tiles face down within the circle. Players choose their playing piece and a suitcase. On his or her turn, a player rolls the die and moves to color counter shown. If the counter has a picture of an open suitcase on it, the player must turn over two tiles. If the color printed on the tiles match, the player keeps the tiles and places them in the suitcase-a slight twist on the classic memory game. If not, the tiles are placed face down in their original positions. Players must remember where the tiles are. The player who collects the most matches wins - and packs the suitcase for a visit to Grandma's.&#10;&#10;Contents: 24 counters, 32 game chips, 4 bamboo figures, 4 bamboo suitcases and 1 colored dice.&#10;&#10;Age group: 4 to 8 years&#10;&#10;Awards: Parents' Choice Foundation Approved Award 2005&#10;&#10;",

Elements of the game are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A large number of marbles in solid colors including red, blue, yellow, green and purple.&#10;     A yellow plastic &quot;mountain&quot; in a volcano shape with a small rim at the bottom to catch fallen marbles.&#10;     A matching plastic cone that marbles are poured into and that the mountain is then fitted into.  The combination is inverted so that the mountain then rests on its base and the plastic cone is carefully lifted off, leaving the mountain evenly covered with a variety of solid colored marbles.&#10;     A set (I think there were 6 of these but am not positive; it might have been 4) of black cardboard playing fields cut into the profile of a mountain.  Approximately a dozen circular depressions are cut into each playing field, and these have a random distribution of colors matching the marble colors painted on them.&#10;     Several sets of oversized, blue plastic tweezers with blunt tips.&#10;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the player who fills the most circles on his playing field by picking the appropriate color marbles off of the plastic mountain with the tweezers and setting them into the matching circles on his board, without causing an avalanche of marbles to cascade down the sides of the plastic mountain, and also without knocking any marbles out of their depressions on his playing field.  The first child to cause an avalanche or knock over her marbles loses.  In the event that none of the players create an avalanche or knock off marbles, then the first player to fill up all of the circles on her board wins.&#10;&#10;Players must start at the base of their own mountain playing field and fill in the entire bottom row with marbles before ascending to the next row up.  Since each playing field has a unique distribution of colors, players will need different colors of marbles at different points in the game.  This means a layer of strategy can be added by trying to remove not only the color of marble you need next, but by selecting a specific marble of that color from the marble mountain that leaves your opponent with more difficult and avalanche-prone choices.&#10;&#10;",

You lay it down flat on its side on the table. On the top side are six spaces, each labeled both 1-6 and with a color. Space number two is the hole.&#10;&#10;Apart from the &quot;bank&quot; itself, the game comes with two six-sided dice (one regular and one with colors matching the spaces on the box) and a number of yellow marbles (about 25).&#10;&#10;To play, divide the marbles evenly to all players and put any remainders into the bank. Select one of the dies to play with. Each player then rolls the die. If the space indicated is free he puts a marble there. If there is a marble there he gets to pick it up instead.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to lose all your marbles. If your children want to play the game too often, this may be accomplished in more than one way.&#10;&#10;Children tend to like this game and are able to play it from an early age (as soon as they can recognize colors and sit still long enough). To make the game slightly more educational, use the die with numbers instead. There is absolutely no skill or strategy element, so your age or previous experience with the game has no bearing on who will win. This may be considered a bug or a feature depending on your viewpoint.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Belongs to the Runebound Series.&#10;&#10;From the Fantasy Flight Games Website:&#10;&quot;In the tales told in Terrinoth, there is a legendary land, a place long lost. Many have attempted to find it once more, but like a mirage in the desert, it has forever eluded them, remaining tantalizingly on the horizon. It is a harsh place of blowing sands and dangerous creatures, of beautiful cities and alien magics. It is the land of Al-Kalim!&#10;&#10;In this expansion to the Runebound fantasy adventure board game, the players have found the key to this hidden place. Their goal is to forge their own entry in the Ninety-Nine Tales of Al-Kalim. Sands of Al-Kalim differs from most Runebound adventures in that it does not include Encounter and Event cards that describe a set story. Rather, the players tell the story! They will face legendary challenges and gain legendary rewards, including mighty mounts, forgotten runes, and magical artifacts. He who completes his tale first is immortalized in song and legend, and wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Runebound: Sands of Al-Kalim is the third Big Box Expansion for Runebound: Second Edition. It replaces some elements of the original game - including the map and playable characters - to provide a new and different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;You must own the Runebound basic game to play this expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Can you be the first with the solution, hit your button and leave your opponent in a confusion of letters?  But be clever, next time he may turn the tables on you!&quot;&#10;&#10;A simple anagram solving game with a twist, the board spins 180 degrees at the press of a button.&#10;&#10;The main game component is a large and sturdy plastic board with a rotating central section triggered by either of two chunky red buttons in the corner of each side.  Also included are two plastic trays containing an assortment of letters in two colors, in my edition (blue on white / white on blue and red on white / white on red).  German umlauted versions of A,O and U are also included.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly composes a word of up to 10 letters in their home rack on the stationery part of the board, then transposes the word into the upper rack of the yellow turntable.  The turntable is then rotated and each player races to place their other colored letters in the middle rack to try to solve the anagram.  The first player to solve the anagram presses their red button and presents their answer to their opponent.  If correct they win if wrong they lose.  The winning player claims the tiles used by the loser at the end of each round.  Play continues until a player is unable to solve a word with their available letter tiles.&#10;&#10;A good educational game designed to expand your child's vocabulary and improve their mental agility with a tiny amount of strategy in word selection.&#10;&#10;The only flaw with the game is the overly enthusiastic rubber band powered mechanism, which when activated, scatters both sets of tiles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game, the players try to build a contiguous path across a hexagonal grid.   Each turn, a player rolls a pair of d10s;  every cell in the grid is numbered, and a token may be played in a cell only when the number is rolled on one of the dice, their sum, or their difference.  If one occupies two of the adjoining cells, it is possible to attack (by a risk-like 1-1 die comparison) a token belonging to another player:  a successful attack replaces the token; an unsuccessful attack permits the defender to play an extra token using the two die rolls used during the attack.  Dice that show a zero, or combine to zero or ten permit a placement anywhere; doubles may be additionally employed for additional turns.&#10;&#10;The manufacturer says:&#10;&quot;Family fun for ages 8 through adult.  Anyone can successfully play this game. And anyone can win, regardless of age, experience, or skill.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A four-player Chines Checkers variant that uses four-sided dice (most famous for use in some role-playing games) as pieces.  The number indicated by a dice shows how far it can move or jump.&#10;&#10;Whoever moves all of their pieces to the corner opposite to where they started wins.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;What you&rsquo;ll need&#10;&bull; A chess board&#10;&bull; Each player needs ten 4-sided dice. (Preferably the kind with the numbers located at the corners so they are easily viewed when surrounded by other dice.)&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;The game begins with the board in the formation shown in the image in the gallery here.&#10;&#10;Each player has their dice arranged in the corners of the game board. On your turn, you can use one piece. That piece can either MOVE or JUMP.&#10;&#10;Moving&#10;Move a piece either vertically or horizontally. No diagonal movement. A 4 can move four spaces, a 3 three spaces, 2 two spaces and 1 one space.&#10;&#10;Jumping&#10;Alternately, you can jump over an adjacent piece vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, as long as the landing space is empty.&#10;&#10;You can jump over a number of pieces up to the digit on the jumping piece. (A 4 can jump over up to four pieces, 3 up to three pieces, 2 up to two pieces and 1 over one piece.) If you&rsquo;re jumping over multiple pieces, they must be in a straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.&#10;&#10;You can jump as many times as you wish in this manner as long as you don&rsquo;t land on the same space twice.&#10;&#10;Finally, a piece cannot jump over a piece of higher value. A 1 can&rsquo;t jump over a 2, 3, or 4. A 2 can&rsquo;t jump a 3 or 4. A 3 can&rsquo;t jump a 4. However, a 4 can jump over anything.&#10;&#10;Victory&#10;Whoever moves all of their pieces to the 10 starting locations on the opposite corner of the board wins.

The cards (total 96) refer to that segments (to where the ball is played) and the opponent has to be with his 'player' (figure) in an adjacent segment to hit the ball. During play, the figure is able to move 1 segment before the action card is played. Some cards are marked as 'stop-ball' or 'Net-roller', that means, the player has to reach the named segment to be able to hit the ball. &#10;Tennmac is a strategic tennis simulation.&#10;&#10;",

You might want to say, &quot;This animal lives in the Arctic,&quot; but instead would have to say, &quot;Bis Banimal Bivs Bin Be Barctic.&quot; If you spin the letter combination &quot;SH,&quot; it would be, &quot;Shis Shanimal Shivs Shin She Sharctic.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can pass if your team gets stuck, but then you risk losing the Blibber chip to your opponents. Also, if you blab using an incorrect sound, the other team gets your chip. Continue collecting Blibber chips and describing words to your teammates until the 60-second timer runs out.

    "Description": "As players move around the board they come into contact with statements and questions which stimulate discussion and reinforce or elicit teacher input.&#10;&#10;Playing CONTRACEPTION&reg; highlights areas where understanding may be lacking.&#10;&#10;*The game looks at the mechanics of contraception through questions and true / false statements.&#10;&#10;*Through these statements clear distinction is made between safe and risky sexual behavior.&#10;&#10;*Advancing around the board brings players into contact with various advice centers and resources where contraceptive and sexual health services can be accessed: e.g. Young Persons Sexual Health Services, pharmacy, condom machines, GP's, Family Planning Clinics and Accident and Emergency Units.&#10;&#10;Players are also directed at various intervals during the game to make an assertive statement which strengthens their ability to express their own needs and decline unwanted pressure.&#10;&#10;Peer education is a key feature of the game. At certain stages a question card will present two options, for example (1) Using the condom demonstrator (included in the game) show the group how to put on a condom. OR (2) Answer a question. The game therefore offers the group peer education opportunities in a safe environment, practicing use of language relating to safe sex, whilst building confidence.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is set on a grand strategic level with each player controlling a civilization.  There are six civs supplied, all with the same basic units, and each culture has &quot;secret weapons&quot; which give the ships some differences.&#10;&#10;The starships come in various classes which are similar to the various naval ship classifications but on a much larger scale.&#10;&#10;The turns consist of 14 phases covering the movement and combat for non-mobile unit, major mobile units and minor mobile units.  There is also an Industrial inter-phase every third turn which is used to adjust the amount of resources available to each player.&#10;&#10;The rules contain many special cases and details but with no index looking up any specific clause is difficult.&#10;&#10;According to a Galaxy-Foundation Games catalog, they licensed Taurus to produce an initial print run of 6,000 copies of this game. It is not known if GFG did any further print runs.&#10;&#10;There were further games in GFG's strategic series: Deliverance From Beyond the Stars, The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords, and The Collodian Conspiracy: Science Against Chaos Unleashed. These games used Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual, which is a slightly changed version of the Battle for Andromeda rules, as the series rulebook.&#10;&#10;There was a companion tactical series of games beginning with Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars.&#10;&#10;From the GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&#10;&#10;&#10;        The Battle For Andromeda - Conflict for a Trillion Suns, is the title of the over-all Strategic Series. It is on these boards that the history, the fleets, the hundreds of worlds, star systems, space armies, etc., are covered. The player handles FLEETS, LARGE SCALE DECISIONS as a RULER-COMMANDER of an ENTIRE CULTURE. He is concerned with over-all scientific Progress, the Huge Wars, and their effects and the mass movements so shown in the &quot;BFA&quot; Scale.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each ship counter represents a single ship.  Each aircraft counter, from one to five aircraft.  A ground unit counter can be anything from a platoon to a battalion.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:  &quot;Each player moves his units and executes attacks on enemy units in turn during each of the air, sea, and land phases [...]  Units expend movement points to move from one hexagon to another.  All air and sea combat is resolved during the movement portions of the turn while land combat is resolved at the end of the movement phase.  To simulate the randomness of combat results, a die roll is used to resolve attacks [...]  As turns are completed, aircraft will cycle through various stages of readiness, ships will run low on fuel and ammunition, and the weather will play havoc with commanders' plans.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

To do this, you are employing the best animators (as well as the cheapest) you can find.  These animators churn out image after image, but with one problem.  They don't have a script!  Luckily the inventors working (slaving) for you have developed the first and only Anime Plotting Device(TM).&#10;&#10;As the characters of your various anime are added to your highly advanced, computerized environment, they appear in a fully constructed three-dimensional holographic matrix, awaiting your every whim!  Unfortunately, this same system was also sold to your competitors (Your poor scientists were immediately executed, of course), and you are now forced (by contract, naturally) to share the warehouse-sized holographic matrix with your sworn enemies...&#10;&#10;Being the sleazy MegaCorp president that you are, you decide to sabotage your competitor by slipping strange plots into their episodes, as well as trying to advertise your own shows by adding your characters in to kick some anime butt.  Your competitors waste no time in retaliating.  Soon, a malfunction in the Anime Plotting Device(TM) leads to a startling discovery:  the anime has become tangible, physical.  The anime is real!&#10;&#10;Desperately, both you and your competitors hire insanely overpriced engineers to fix the problem.  The characters themselves, luckily, do not realize that they are real, and continue to do your bidding.  They still appear in the matrix as normal - through the scanning of the animators drawings.  They just do real property damage now.  Your competitors, never to be out done, do the same.  In a fit of desperation, you find yourself forced to bring occasional live humans into the unstable matrix to help, fight, and eventually to die.  They die only because, once something has entered the matrix, it's in there until it's dead.  Your best director found this out a little late for your liking.  After tangling with a 20mm anti-tank cannon wielding BU-11 Model Combat Boomer with a troubled past, he became but a memory.&#10;&#10;...&#10;&#10;Object of the game...&#10;Anime Madness(TM) is a game for two or more players, with plenty of room for house variants.  The object of Anime Madness(TM) is to become the reigning MegaCorp by doing one of two things.  You may either drive your opponent from 20 Ratings Points down to 0, becoming the only thing on television, or you may raise your Ratings Points up to 40, becoming the coolest thing on television.&#10;&#10;",

This is the artwork you hope to pass off as your own after your looming death.  However, since all the talented artists are still young and idealistic, they care little for your so-called &quot;money&quot;.  In fact, the less money you offer them, the better art you will get!&#10;&#10;The game is scored over multiple rounds.  Each round consists of 3 tricks.  Every player starts each round with exactly $20 in chips.  To start the round, deal 3 cards to each player... and start buying (cheap) art!  There are &quot;Penniless Bonuses&quot; and &quot;Insane Bonuses&quot; awarded after each round.
