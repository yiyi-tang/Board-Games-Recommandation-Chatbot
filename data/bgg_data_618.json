They place black cardboard pieces according to the model from the booklet. Next each player chooses the colour of the cardboards pieces he is going to use on the board.&#10;&#10;The oldest player starts the game, then other player follow clockwise. The player whose turn this is places the cardboard piece he is holding in his hand on an empty square. He/she must apply to the SUDOKU rule that inside each row, each column and each block a digit may appear only once. When the first player made his/her move, the next player places his/her cardboard piece on the board - of course, remembering about sudoku rule. The hourglass limits the length of turn. If the hourglass becomes empty and the player has not placed his/her cardboard piece yet, he/she misses his/her chance and it is the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;The game stops when no player can place a cardboard piece on the board.&#10;Then the players check the position of the cardboard pieces on the board in the answer booklet. If on the board there are misplaced cardboard pieces, we put them aside and each player counts his/her cardboard pieces that are on the board. The winner is the person who scores the biggest number of points.&#10;&#10;",

American game players will recognize elements of pool and shuffleboard.  The game is played on a handmade wooden board 28 square inches with pockets in each corner.  There are Canadian and American rules variations, but all games involve flicking wooden disk &quot;shooters&quot; into lighter wooden disks such that the lighter disks land in one of the four pockets.&#10;&#10;",

The more answers the player is asking for (the more difficult it is for the others) the less improvement he can make on the board - the easier he is challenging the others, the further he can move forward on the board, when the team can't reach the demanded number of answers.&#10;All other players (the team) are now challenged to find as many possible answers within 1 minute and try to fulfill his presettings. If they can do so, the team has won this round and each team member can move forward and also has the chance to &quot;beat&quot; the questioner and send him back home.&#10;&#10;It is the next players turn to pull a Laterali card and challenging the others by betting a requested number of answers...&#10;As soon a player has reached the finish line he has won the game.&#10;&#10;The questions are very difficult, although there are always many answers possible - it is not a trivial quiz game &quot;one question - one answer&quot; and matching answers can only be found by extraordinary methods of resulution. Therefor Laterali can be used as training-tool for lateral thinking methods.&#10;&#10;Laterali is available in 2 different game versions, Laterali Light with 432 question-cards or Laterali DeLuxe with 648 Laterali-cards. Both versions include a game board and 12 3D-figurines and a timer.&#10;&#10;Laterali is available in German and will be presented at the Nuernberg Toy Fair 2010 the first time.&#10;For 2011/2012 an English Version will be available.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Israeli Whist is a trick taking standard deck playing card game. In Israel, the game is simply called Whist but differs from classical Whist in significant ways. There are no partnerships, trump is determined by a Bridge-like auction rather than last card dealt, and each player makes an Oh Hell!-like forecast of number of tricks to take.&#10;&#10;Each hand of Israeli Whist includes an auction round to determine trump, a bidding round to specify number of tricks to take, and finally a card play round to determine who made their bid.&#10;&#10;Players who missed their bid, score -10 points for each trick over or under their bid. Players who made their bid exactly, score 10 points plus a bonus of the number of tricks taken squared.  See variants for non-exponential scoring systems to reduce the likelihood of a runaway leader.&#10;&#10;One appeal of Israeli Whist is that the ability to judge a hand's strength is more important than relying on luck to get a good hand. For example, consistently making your bid outweighs consistently winning the auction to name trump.&#10;&#10;Although the standard game is for exactly four players, see the variant section for ways to accommodate 3-7 players.&#10;&#10;",

O jogo &eacute; para jogadores de wargame iniciantes com regras f&aacute;ceis de asimilar e que permite o entendimento e a entrada neste estilo de jogo. Composto por um livreto de regras, mapa, tabelas e pe&ccedil;as de jogo, inaugura nossa s&eacute;rie Bellum Brasilis.&#10;&#10;English : Tracunhaen&acute;s Slaughter is a tactic wargame (platoon level), for 2 players. The game recreates the slaughter what 2000 potiguares indians attacks the &quot;Tracunhaem&acute;s Engenho&quot; (Tracunhaem&acute;s Sugarmill) and kill all Portuguese colonists and slaves. The main objective for Portuguese player is resist for 8 turns against the indians. The objective for indian player is kill all colonists and slaves.  The game is for novice wargamers, easy rules and short time of play.&#10;&#10;During the period of colonization of Brazil, in the year 1534, there was an incident known as Trag&eacute;dia de Tracunha&eacute;m, in which Indians killed all the residents of a mill called Tracunha&eacute;m in Pernambuco. The justification for this attack was due to the kidnapping, followed by the disappearance of the chief Iniguassu&rsquo;s daughter, after marrying a Mamluk adventurer. It was a requirement that both of them, after the wedding, remains in the Indian village, but this did not happen. Iniguassu&rsquo;s first step was to send two of his sons to Olinda, in Pernambuco, to claim justice. Fortunately, they met on a visit to Pernambuco, the governor of Brazil, Ant&ocirc;nio Salema, who ordered the beautiful Indian to return to her father&rsquo;s house immediately. On the way back, they had to spend the night at Engenho Tracunha&eacute;m, by Diogo Dias. When dawn dawned, India disappeared, possibly hidden by Diogo Dias. His brothers complained a lot but did nothing and returned home without his sister.&#10;&#10;Taking advantage of this, the French stationed in Para&iacute;ba instigated the Potiguares to revenge, and soon a contingent two thousand Indians of diverse Potiguares tribes marched against the mill. The Indians surrounded the fortified mill and used an unusual tactic: only a few Indians let themselves be seen to make it believe that it was the action of a small group. When the plantation&rsquo;s defenders went out to counterattack, they were attacked by a crowd of Indians. The mill was burned, and it appears that only two family members survived because they were not at the mill. After this episode, other Itamarac&aacute; mills were also attacked, resulting in 614 deaths. This episode generalized the fear in the Portuguese settlers of the region.&#10;&#10;It caused the king of Portugal to extinguish the captaincy of Itamarac&aacute; and create the captaincy of Para&iacute;ba, with limits from the mouth of the Popoca river to the Bay of Trai&ccedil;&atilde;o. In this way, it would protect the sugar industry, expelling the French, and expand the domain to the north of the Northeast region.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Bellum Brasilis series was originally produced by the extinct Riachuelo Games and was directed to games at the tactical level, covering several episodes in the history of Brazil. This wargame is the first in the Voxelhouse Old School Wargames series.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond the Wall is the second installment in the &quot;Defenders of the North&quot; series of Chapter Packs, and it features exciting new deckbuilding possibilities for both the Night's Watch and the Wildlings, including a new The North agenda, as well as powerful new cards for all of the great Houses of Westeros. Beyond the Wall features Night's Watch like the stealthy Stonesnake and Wildlings like gargantuan Mammoth Riders. Westeros' other Houses benefit from characters like House Greyjoy's Nute the Barber and a new version of House Stark's Benjen Stark.&#10;&#10;The North is filled with danger with every reason to fear the coming Long Winter, but the time is now, whether invading or defending, to go beyond the wall.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2011 edition of Beyond the Wall has been updated to the sixty-card format (three copies each of twenty unique cards). The included cards are updated with rules text based on the most recent FAQ and Errata.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pick-A-Part is memory with more to it. There are two sets of cards; large cards that show full drawings, and smaller cards that show individual parts of the full drawings. Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.&#10;&#10;Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.&#10;&#10;In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.&#10;&#10;If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.&#10;&#10;A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.&#10;&#10;Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.&#10;A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!&#10;&#10;If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.&#10;Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 point for each small card&#10;     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)&#10;     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)&#10;&#10;&#10;The player that gets the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It was a small fight, but very significant for the heroic charge made by the Carabinieri (King's guards), immortalized every year during the parade made before the major Italian authorities. &#10;The game is straightforward, with a system first pionereed in Montebello (another TCS games from 2003), and have only a few units on the map (around a dozen for each player), but takes in account fire combat, melee combat, morale, command range, initiative, and an order system that makes this game a little more complex than the usual productions of this small print &amp; play company.&#10;&#10;",

You can play either of those two words on either of the two words that are currently displayed on the deck (like &quot;Drink&quot; / &quot;Angel&quot;).&#10;&#10;Sure, the first few rounds are simple, since you have lots of different ways to play out the possibilities in your hand, but you had better plan ahead and pay attention to what cards your opponents have, because the game gets trickier in the final few rounds.  Don't get caught drawing a fist full of cards when your opponents are almost out!&#10;&#10;To make the game even more challenging, your opponent might zing you at any time by slapping you with a &quot;Double Joker&quot; or a &quot;Double Angel&quot; card that contains the same word in both directions, doubling the chances that you'll have to draw!&#10;&#10;Of course, you could plan to zing them back with a &quot;Double Siren&quot;, but don't get caught holding that card in your hand for long, because not only is it twice as hard for your opponent to play on, it's also twice as hard for you to get rid of!  You had better plan ahead, or your scheme to attack at the end when it can hurt the most might come back to bite YOU!&#10;&#10;Simple to learn, but filled with plenty of twists (literally), Ambigram! the game provides hours of fun for the whole family.&#10;&#10;About the Playing Cards&#10;&#10;The Ambigram deck itself is a wonder of modern technology that no human being could have designed alone, even if they possessed several lifetimes to work on the problem.&#10;&#10;Instead, a computer was given the task of finding the words to use for the cards.  It was programmed to go through the entire English Dictionary, word by word, and locate 7 words that could all form an ambigram with themselves, and also form an ambigram with every one of the other 7 words that were being located - a total of 49 ambigrams in all.&#10;&#10;It took the computer 16 days to go through the Dictionary and return the answer: Angel, Drink, Finger, Joker, Killer, Learn and Siren - the amazing set of words that make up all of the 49 cards for Ambigram! the Game.  Those 49 ambigram cards are joined by a single Wild card, for a total of 50 spinnable round cards that play out differently every time!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Frog's Banquet is a fast, fun, frog filled game of eating dragonflies and dodging dangers. Choose a play board to jump around, choose a frog and jump to it!&#10;&#10;2-4 frogs may compete, or go it alone with the single player variant.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a frog: Flecks, Springs, Grublic or Bubbly. The frogs each have a default 'jump' that they can use during their turn.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of five cards from the event deck and may play any of them face down, adding to a line at the edge of the board. The majority of these cards are Dragonfly cards that dictate where the dragonflies will appear and where they will move to. Dragonflies are worth points depending on which turn they are caught by the frogs (first turn they appear, second turn they move, third turn they move and then fourth turn they are gone)&#10;&#10;There can only ever be one dragonfly of each colour on the board at any one time, so players need to plot carefully to get their frogs in the right place at the right time.&#10;&#10;In the deck is also a series of Dangers - Turtle, Heron, Snake, Toad and the dreaded Bunyip! These dangers are added to the board when played and will act according to their own rules (they are played by the game). Avoid them at all costs!&#10;&#10;The game can be played to a certain number of points, depending on the length of game you are after.&#10;&#10;Play boards depict different environments that the frogs may inhabit, for example wetlands and rainforests. Theses are presented both horizontally and vertically. They contain their own special rules - for example, don't get caught in the waterfall!&#10;&#10;It's easy to pick up and play with people of all ages, but with careful tactics and clever use of your jumping resources, the better player gets the most dragonflies.&#10;&#10;",

However, after eating one of each of the chocolates, the Duc falls to the floor - dead.&#10;&#10;The renowned detective, Sherlock Truffle, is called in to investigate.

Your task is to taste each one and refer to the background research of the Duc's life to determine who is the guilty party.&#10;&#10;The game includes chocolates (six of each - and all absolutely gorgeous); notes of each chocolatier; a brief history of the Duc; and a CD which includes interviews with each of the chocolatiers.

There are no German soldier figures - just American landing craft and soldiers versus German bunkers, artillery, and obstacles.&#10;&#10;",

Print and play paper miniatures designed specifically for the game are available for download at the Junior General website. Ship units represent individual ships and aircraft units represent two to four aircraft.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;November 1941. War clouds are gathering in the Pacific.  Tensions have been increasing between Japan and the US since Japan&rsquo;s invasion of China in 1931.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Anticipating hostilities, the Imperial Japanese Navy has planned a surprise attack against US forces at Pearl Harbor, HI.  US intelligence has intercepted coded Japanese messages and has concluded that an attack is likely somewhere in the Pacific, most likely in the Philippines, between December 1st and 10th.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As a precaution, the Alert Status on the Hawaiian island of Oahu has been raised from peacetime Alert Level 0 to Alert Level 1.  Limited resources are available to selectively increase the Alert Level to 2 or 3, but extended increases in alert levels will unnecessarily tire men and consume limited supplies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora! is a game played in two parts - a strategic planning phase followed by a tactical attack phase. US players must decide how to employ limited forces in and around Pearl Harbor over the 10 day vulnerability period. Japanese players must select the timing, direction, and composition of the attack in order to inflict enough damage to prevent the US Pacific Fleet from interfering with future Japanese war plans in Southeast Asia.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game map is an abstracted depiction of the battle area divided into four quadrants, allowing for simultaneous games to be played in each quadrant by different groups of players. The areas depicted on the map are divided into concentric zones - Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Oahu, and the Pacific Ocean. The map also specifies the position of naval installations, airfields, and anti-aircraft batteries.&#10;&#10;",

The game takes place in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Kokkola was one of the most significant maritime towns in Finland and a major export hub, especially of tar and timber - essential commodities for the large navies of the major European powers of the time.&#10;&#10;In the beginning each player has a small ship which can carry one unit of cargo (initially, tar). Cargoes have a fixed buying price and profit depends on which port they are sold in. Each port provides 1 or 2 types of cargo, roughly historical - London wants tar and timber, provides luxuries and salt - and by trading in this way, players try to amass the biggest fortune before the cargoes run out.&#10;&#10;Each round a player can sell or buy cargo and buy a bigger ship (carries 2 units) or cannon, which protects from pirates. Movement is by dice rolling, and before sailing a player takes a 'sea-card' with varying results - a pilot who helps in reaching the next port, pirates who steal the cargo, favourable or adverse winds or a special price event. The latter are also historical, such as the unrest following the French Revolution causing increased demand for grain in Amsterdam, or events of the Crimean War.&#10;&#10;When the last cargo is bought, the game ends and the player with most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

In the affective domain, the students will have fun learning what it often considered a difficult subject.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get two runs of three and four cards representing the sequential (deep to superficial) order of the five main anatomical components composing each suit. The dealer deals seven cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed face down and the top card is turned over to begin the discard stack. Moving clockwise from the dealer, the first player chooses either the discarded card or a card from the face down pile. The player determines which cards to keep and discards the extra card. The first player to create two runs of three and four cards places the cards down and must name three structures (e.g., three bones, three muscles) represented on each card. The other players refer to a reference sheet that indicates all the structures on each card to ascertain whether the player is correct. If the player cannot name at least three structures on each card, the player subtracts 1 point from his or her score for each card on which he or she failed to name three structures. The player with the winning hand adds the value of the cards laid down, subtracts the points for any unnamed structures and adds the total to his or her score. The players with the losing hands add the value of their cards and subtract it from their scores. The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score. If a time limit is set instead, the winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the period.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;40 cards&#10;&#10;",
