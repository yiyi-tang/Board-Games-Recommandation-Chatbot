Just your luck, though, that someone else has the exact same idea. Two water parks! What a world. Guess you&rsquo;ll just have to build a bigger and better one. Welcome to Seven Waters!&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Seven Waters is a two-player card-drafting and placement game that can be played with a traditional deck of cards (jokers included). Snag cards from a shared tableau as you attempt to create the most appealing water park, filled with four slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you may either (1) draft an available card from a shared pyramid, or (2) play a card from your hand into your water park.  Build water slides by matching the ride value to the rope line value, build a wave pool with matching suits, build a lazy river with straight runs, and theme your park by choosing a bonus value suit.  Best park wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Close your eyes.&rdquo; (If there is more than one Werewolf, they will silently come to an agreement on ONE victim.) &ldquo;Prophet, open your eyes and point at one person to see their identity.

The kit includes a mix of heavily armoured elite warriors that will carve through even the toughest fighters, along with loads of archers.

(no player elimination)&#10;&#10;Stinger must complete 3 hit's and escape the city to win, but if he runs out of health, it's victory for SFPD!&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the team ratings, we also provide you with a quick and simple method for normalizing teams across eras.  So, you can effortlessly determine the best team of all time if you choose, without worrying about any biases.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With the Lord of the heavens and the earth echoing the commands to the Holy Prophet (PBUH), a divine revelation came about 1400 years ago. This advent had been promised in the Abrahamic religions, including Christianity. His name was &quot;the Chosen One&quot; and has been narrated in various languages throughout history. The name commenced its journey from the ancient Syriac language with Munahhemana (&#220;&#161;&#220;&#162;&#220;&#154;&#220;&#161;&#220;&#162;&#220;&#144;), passed by Greek with Periclutos (&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&lambda;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;) and then landed in the Gospel of John with Paraclete. This name has since remained in the hearts and minds of generations to come. In the Gospel of John, the Prophet Jesus (PBUH) said, &quot;I am announcing the coming of someone who, if I do not leave you, will not come&hellip; &ldquo;He will teach you everything and recollect what I have told you&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;When he comes he will bring justice and equity to the world&quot;. Ultimately, the Chosen One, named Muhammad (PBUH), appeared in the Arabian Peninsula. He, along with his companions, migrated to Medina to build the Abrahamic civilization.&#10;&#10;Munahhemana needs citizens who will help him build the new civilization with their production and economics, dedication and obedience, intelligence and politics, and science and wisdom. In the Game of Munahhemana, various challenging events and important missions occur. Herein, only tribes with specific characteristics can support Munahhemana. They must find the balance between the strengthening of their tribes&rsquo; power and carrying out missions assigned to them.&#10;&#10;ROUTINE, CO-OP or SOLO. You can choose and play any of these three modes. In routine mode, you compete with other players, while in co-op mode, you collectively work together, and finally, in solo mode, you work alone to play the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players might use their cards to help get the right amount of fuel Scott needs for a rescue or to deliver the tools and gadgets needed by Lady Penelope to chase The Hood. Only Jeff can make the changes needed to ensure success. Every moment counts and if the numbers don't add up vital time will be lost. Can you work as a member of the International Rescue Team, save those in peril and bring everyone home safely?&#10;&#10;Components: 110 cards, 90 tokens, game rules&#10;Box size: 180 x 130 x 40 mm&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two armies march to the relief of the fortress and its exhausted garrison. One from the East, and one from the North, converging on the outnumbered enemy. That enemy was the Army of Italy, the first field command of Napoleon Bonaparte. The fifteen days that followed would make him a legend.&#10;&#10;Taking as its subject Bonaparte's famous Arcole campaign, Siege of Mantua is a game of operational maneuver and tactical daring. Players move blocks on the mapsheet to threaten and deceive their opponent, with the object of bringing them to a decisive battle. These are fought on a battle display with counters drawn randomly from your unit pool. The quality of your pool improves with every victory; suffering losses will damage morale, degrading unit quality.&#10;&#10;You must master both of these spheres if you wish to be victorious. Though outnumbered, the French player has the benefit of moving along interior lines, allowing greater coordination of forces. But those men are stretched thin to deal with two distinct lines of enemy advance. The Austrian player can use this to their advantage, bringing superior forces to bear at weak points in the enemy line. What results is a desperate battle of wits and nerve, and a novel take on the &quot;block game&quot; genre.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players then take it in turns to move their pieces on the board, aiming to line them up with all the letters in their word and declare &quot;Spell Out!&quot; before their opponents can do the same.&#10;&#10;Letters on the outer ring win you a bonus token if you can get them into a word, and you can exchange it later for an extra turn, but beware! Spent tokens are claimed by opponents, potentially handing them a very useful extra move!&#10;&#10;With bounce spaces for advanced movement strategies, randomised start positions and two difficulty levels of cards, Spell Out is the always-fresh word game for families and groups of all ages, skilful wordsmiths and seasoned gamers alike.&#10;&#10;Spell Out also includes a Solo Challenge Mode and multiple optional play variants.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The assault on the Raveneye Orbital Complex, a defensive military compound disguised as a communications relay station, has been the key to opening the way for the Morat Aggression Forces&rsquo; deployment in the Durgama region, and has furthered the Combined Army&rsquo;s conquests on Concilium Prima, the political heart of the Human Sphere. What could possibly be so important to the almighty leader of the Combined Army? Or could it be just another smokescreen to divert the attention of the Concilium Coordinated Command?&#10;&#10;The book &ldquo;Infinity: Raveneye&rdquo; is an expansion for Infinity that broadens its universe and background, focusing on the Military Orders of PanOceania, Ariadna&rsquo;s Kosmoflot and its new territory of Khurland, the Nomad mothership Corregidor, and the Morat Aggression Forces of the Combined Army, as well as mercenaries for NA2. It also includes three narrative scenarios that recreate the assault on this orbital station, which can be played as a campaign or independently, in addition to painting tutorials for the Military Orders&rsquo; Crosiers, Corregidor&rsquo;s Intruders, Kosmoflot&rsquo;s Para-Commandos, and Morat&rsquo;s Vanguard Infantry.

Public panic is high but arrests are still low, so you and your fellow investigators (or just a bunch of friends) have been tasked with solving these heinous crimes.&#10;&#10;Crimewave: California is a hidden movement co-op game. Players choose to play as one of the investigator roles or take on the task of controlling the three criminals.&#10;&#10;One player operates as all three killers, who reside in secret locations across the board. On each turn, that player places down crime scenes to try and increase public panic and outsmart the investigators.&#10;&#10;On their turn, investigators will move around the board in an effort to locate the killers' residences. Their goal is to work together to find out where the killers are residing by piecing together crime scenes. Investigators also roll dice to try and verify evidence at different crime scenes, which they'll use during the trial phase.&#10;&#10;When the investigators successfully take the killers to trial, they go into a courtroom face-off and play defense and prosecution cards to try and increase and decrease their own score.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the highest card score at the end of the trial. For the investigators, the way to win the game is to jail all three killers. Alternatively, if the public panic marker reaches 10 before the killers are jailed, the player controlling all three killers wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deep in the Amazon rainforest, a small people live on a rocky plateau, far from any civilisation.&#10;&#10;Only a huge climbing vine - called Pi`i Pua by the inhabitants, the &quot;climbing flower&quot; - connects their village to the ground.&#10;&#10;Every year, a group of young hunters is sent into the jungle to hunt. Who will be the first to climb the climbing vine that leads back to the village and thus receive the honour of asking for the hand of the chief's daughter?&#10;&#10;The aim is to play the cards as well as possible in each round and to reach the home village as quickly as possible. In the process, however, attention must also be paid to other people, because everyone wants to climb the mighty climbing flower first.&#10;&#10;How do you climb the vine?&#10;&#10;Everyone gets a certain number of cards in their hand at the beginning. The rest become the draw pile. The starting card is placed in the middle of the table, the target card four edges above it.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, you choose from one of three possible actions:&#10;&#10;When climbing, you place a card from your hand on edge against the vine and move up as many spaces as indicated on the card (or even less).&#10;&#10;You can jump over your climbing opponents, but you must never be on the same field.&#10;&#10;Make sure that at least one transition fits, otherwise you might have taken the wrong turn ...&#10;&#10;If you decide with the second option that you would rather just explore the area, draw a card from the draw pile and move one space further.&#10;&#10;As a last option, you can also cut the vine. To do this, you take a card from the draw pile into your hand. Of course, you only do this if there is no one on the card at the time. In addition, another card must not completely lose the connection.&#10;&#10;If you are on a card with a flower during the game, you can perform two actions in your turn.&#10;&#10;You can use a beetle card to replace a card that is already on the table, which then goes under the draw pile.&#10;&#10;You cannot cross over beetle cards, so use them cleverly to block each other's way. By capping them, you can always use them somewhere else.&#10;&#10;The first of you to reach one of the target fields has not only earned the respect of the entire tribe, but may also ask for the hand of the chief's daughter.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

The first date marks the German entry into the Crimea via the Perekop Isthmus, while the second marks the end of organized Soviet resistance across the whole peninsula. Those nine calendar months are divided into chronologically varied and unequal numbers of turns. That approach allows for the convenient simulation of the ebbs and flows in the action that took place due to bad weather and logistical and command-control constraints.&#10;&#10;The Perekop Isthmus fight, which took place from 24 September through 27 October, just off-map to the north, is not included in the game because it took place across terrain too restrictive to allow for maneuver by either side. At this scale it would have come down to how lucky the German player got in rolling his inescapably low-range and mid-range initial frontal attacks. So that episode is considered to have taken place as the last act of the Dniepr River campaign rather than the first act in the Crimean campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Instead, the Axis goes over to a naval-air offensive against the British with additional operations in North Africa and the Middle East, while waiting for America to enter the war and keeping a watchful eye on Stalin who may intervene.&#10;&#10;The game assumes that the Western Allies decide on a Europe First Strategy, diverting forces and logistics from the Pacific. The Axis is under pressure to win the war before economic collapse sets in, the Allies to win before the Japanese seize too much of the Pacific. Given the shift in Axis logistics and planning against the British Empire and the US. only the westernmost Soviet Union is shown on the map, but there is emphasis on North Africa and the Middle East.&#10;&#10;There are two players: Axis and Allied (to include the Western Allies and the Soviet Union). Both players can develop orders of battle by expending Mobilization Points. The game shows the war in Europe during the early and mid-war years before the full Allied buildup. Both sides will be fighting a war which is markedly different from that fought in the historical event. The game ends in 1943, the time when the Western Allies originally planned to return to Europe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players choose from the 6 minion characters each with their own advantages and natural skills.&#10;The game begins with the Minion Working Phase which is divided in rounds. Each round is split into a series of  steps for each minion to complete: assign tasks, initialize time, demonstrate skills, complete tasks and refresh hands to earn points, skills and reputation. One player acts as the MIC (Minion in Charge) and uses the task deck to indicate status. This is the time to demonstrate delegation and negotiation skills to curry favor with the Evil Overlord (EO).&#10;&#10;The MIC draws a number of tasks equal to the number of minions under their delegation. The MIC then hands out these tasks to minions as they see fit for them to complete, managing time. Any tasks not completed will an increase to the Evil Overlord Annoyance tracker (the EO has no tolerance for minions who cannot complete simple tasks!) Any tasks the MIC chooses not to complete will cost them time and points as will any failed tasks by minions. Be careful your minions could choose to strategize against you to become the next MIC. Minions complete tasks to demonstrate skills, gain abilities, points and reputation in attempt to take over as the next MIC to get their chance to please the EO and become the henchman.&#10;&#10;The game ends if there are not enough tasks to assign to  minions including reshuffled tasks. The minion that has gained the most reputation points earns the respect of the Evil Overlord and is declared the Henchman and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",
