Compete against your neighbors to earn prestige and the favor of the Empress, Catherine the Great.&#10;&#10;Acquire new lands, perform tasks at the bidding of the Empress and contribute tithing towards the construction of the Empresses Palace.&#10;&#10;Catherine the Great was the Empress of Russia from 1762 until 1796, the countries longest ruling female leader. She came to power following a coup d&rsquo;etat that she organised, resulting in Peter III, her husband, being overthrown. Under her reign Russia was revitalized, growing larger and stronger than ever, recognized as one of the great powers of Europe.&#10;&#10;Clandestinely bid on new lands as you manage your fiefdom&rsquo;s economy behind its great walls. After the big reveal see if you&rsquo;ve built the best engine, won glorious battles, fulfilled the Empress's graceful command and provided the greatest contributions to the Catherine Palace!&#10;&#10;Most actions are taken simultaneously, as such the game moves quickly at approximately 10 minutes per player!&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 5 phases;&#10;&#10;Bidding and Land Management&#10;Income&#10;Auction&#10;Fulfilling the Empress's Bidding or Tithing to the Palace&#10;Restock&#10;&#10;The majority of decisions are made during the first phase, pre-determining much of the actions you may take in the following phases, with a dose of subterfuge and press your luck.&#10;&#10;The game ends following the Empress's Bidding phase of the round in which any player has filled all open land deed slots within their fiefdom (player board) OR the Land Deeds deck has been fully depleted, leaving no deeds available for the restock phase. At this point you will calculate your total prestige (Victory points) and the player with the most prestige wins.&#10;&#10;Prestige (Victory Points) is earned through the placement of a variety of Land Deeds within your fiefdom, Empress's Bidding&rsquo;s you have fulfilled, palace tithing and remaining resources.&#10;&#10;Prestige is lost for land deed slots that have not been filled in your fiefdom at the end of the game. Prestige may also be stolen by players during the game through Special Use Act of War cards.&#10;&#10;MECHANISMS:&#10;&#10;- Hidden Bidding/Auction&#10;- Resource Management&#10;- Set Collection&#10;- Tableau Building&#10;&#10;",

There are both competitive and co-operative variants that plays in about 20 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Complete with other players to build the most and the best roller race, lever linkage, water wash, and gear contraptions in the caves.  The cave is laid out in a 5x5 grid and has build cards (systems such as gears) laid out in it.  The build cards come in 4 system types, four connection types, and have systems on either side.  There are four types of schematics for things to build: Doohickeys, Whatsits, Thingamajigs, and Combobulations.  Use teams of gnomes to shove, flip, replan, and swap build cards to create systems that will meet the requirements of the schematics.  Earn victory points and build your support to get more gnomes to help you in future turns.  Keep building until one schematic deck runs out and the then the highest point total at the end of the round is the winner.&#10;&#10;For a co-operative challenge, play the Gremlin Invasion variant.  The gremlins are invading the Caves of Neverwhere and getting in the way of your building plans.  Every turn, a new gremlin is added to the caves and the ones already there stir up more mischief.  Contend with over a dozen different gremlins like Masher Trasher, Fiendish Fil, Jammin' Sammy, and Head Dread.  All with unique and mischievous powers.  If you don't do anything about them they will overrun the caves.  Recruit gremlin hunters to chase the gremlins out of the cave, but be careful, chasing gremlins eats up valuable time and resources.&#10;&#10;Plays essentially the same as the competitive game, but the goal is for the team to get to 100 points before time runs out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the Age of the Goremageddon and GRAXX is in a new wave of absolute carnage, brutality and ultra-violence. Along the highways, in hidden territories and throughout the wastelands, abandoned outposts sit, just waiting to be pillaged for everything that sits within. Thrashers engage these outposts, unsure of what awaits them inside: resources, weaponry, relics or even hordes of endless mutants, just lurking in every corner, waiting to feast on the flesh of those who wander within...&#10;&#10;Mutant Outpost Massacre is a solitaire game of outpost-raiding in the post apocalyptic universe of Goremageddon (CPOP's flagship tabletop miniatures game; the third edition debuts soon). Players take the roles of 'thrashers' who raid outposts throughout the planet of GRAXX in the hopes of coming across rare items, resources, weapons and engage enemies in a non-stop massacre.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in a single session, however, thrashers can continue their exploits in an ongoing career; the game only truly ends when your thrasher perishes. After a successful raid, thrashers gain experience, which is used to purchase new weapons, items and add skills, making them more powerful as they head into raid after raid after raid. Upon the final encounter of their raid, thrashers will face bosses, who will attempt to thwart their efforts to escape. Future expansions (coming soon) will add new encounters, new outposts, new enemies, new traps, bosses and so much more, making the game something players will want to come back to, time and time again.&#10;&#10;We welcome you to the Mutant Outpost Massacre. May you live, die and thrash.&#10;&#10;Goremageddon is heavily inspired by over-the-top violence, exploitation, gore, horror, humor and post apocalyptic films on the 1980s, as well as RetroWave and Thrash Metal music. Goremageddon is also CPOP's flagship project, made popular by a cult following and already headed into a third edition, due to release soon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But accomplishing this mission won't be easy, as the path is riddled with traps and other heroes who won't hesitate to get on your way to avoid you reaching your goal.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to get ten Honour or be the player with the most Honour after defeating all Creatures. There are several ways to earn Honour, such as defeating creatures, with Offerings, or special cards, but you can only reach Honour 10 after winning a fight.&#10;&#10;To defeat a creature, you have to compare its strength to the hero&rsquo;s strength. The hero&rsquo;s strength is the result of adding the strength of the cards in your inventory with the temporary modifiers of consumables or certain actions. Another player can join the combat as an ally and his strength will also be added to the active hero.&#10;&#10;During combat all players can play cards as Instants from their hand, Equipment from their Inventory or Consumables from their Backpack to tip the scales in favour or against heroes in combat.&#10;&#10;If players win the fight, they will have to put the Creature in the graveyard, earn Honour and draw the amount of Rewards of the creature. The ally does not earn Honour, but draws an Order or Chaos card according to the Creature's alignment.&#10;&#10;Heroes have to complete an equipment set to gain permanent skills, but there are powerful temporary actions that can be obtained when they do something good, drawing an order card or  something evil, drawing a chaos card.&#10;&#10;",

Players on the dark (criminal) side must defeat the infiltrating investigators. Players on the security (public) side must defeat two dark members or one dark boss. But if a public agent defeats a public boss, they switch to the dark side. Players have open roles and secret roles and maybe a third face too.&#10;&#10;Players have roles which give them special powers (not secret, open play):&#10;Private detectives: You can see someone's main position, but you cannot make a call.&#10;Sniper: You can eliminate an enemy by pointing out their ID number. (Player is removed from the game).&#10;Youtuber: Information can be diffused. It can be a lie or a real one.&#10;Cafe staff: You can disclose one level of a player's ID number.&#10;Public Security Police: You can defeat an opponent if you can get their ID number.&#10;Kaito (phantom thief): You can select two cards by looking at them.&#10;&#10;The game turns on the use of special ID numbers which are produced during the gameplay. The ID numbers are LED displays, with some light and dark sections. The player's card lies on top of their number. During the game, players get to move other players' cards slightly, revealing small sections of the LED display. Gradually they can deduce the secret ID number of the agent and use it against them.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to trade with the loot achieved in your adventures. You must use object cards, action, along with your character's ability to be the one who gets the most gold coins (represented on the object cards) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During each round, players draw 2 cards and can play any number of Object cards, but only one of Action cards, if an Event card is drawn at the time of drawing cards, it is resolved immediately.&#10;&#10;The object cards have different values of gold coins, but it is necessary to discard some of these during the game in order to make moves that grant more Object cards, hence more gold coins. So you should save some of these to score at the end of the game. The Action cards modify the dynamics of the player who plays them in favor of him. Event cards must be played before the start of the turn, they never remain in the player's hand, they modify the game of all the players involved. The players also have a character card with a respective ability in favor of these, In addition there is a card from The Market has Closed that is put into play after the third round and being stolen ends the game, then the points represented in gold coins that each player has in his hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;We must move that ore, and keep it moving!&rdquo; &ndash;Spokesman for the United States Army Engineers, Detroit Free Press, March 8, 1942.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;There is going to be a tremendous movement of iron ore in the Great Lakes regions.&rdquo; U.S Interior Secretary, Harold Ickes to the Solid Fuels Advisory War Council, Toronto Evening Telegram, March 11, 1942.&#10;&#10;Following the attack on Pearl Harbor the US was suddenly thrust into World War II. Every manufacturing concern was now faced with the daunting tasks of converting production facilities to wartime goods at levels never before seen during peacetime. The focus on the US steel industry was of particular concern, as nearly all weapons and wartime support derived from their factories and workers. However, nearly all of the leaders and owners of the US steel industry were either very dismissive or even obstructionist of the prospects the US would become involved in the war, and President Roosevelt&rsquo;s attempts to ready the country for war.&#10;&#10;Nearly all of the iron ore, as well as much of the limestone, needed for the steel industries were shipped over the Great Lakes from the iron ore fields in Minnesota to the ports at Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Buffalo in the US and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada. From those ports the iron ore was shipped by rail to the steel mill complexes in Gary, Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Hamilton. The massive ore carriers that plied the waters of the Great Lakes sailed from mid-April to late November when weather and water conditions permitted. However, it soon became apparent that the amount of iron ore laid up in late November 1941 for use during the winter and spring was totally inadequate for the war effort. The US &ldquo;arsenal of democracy&rdquo; would be essentially shooting blanks due to shortages of steel and idle plants if the shortfalls of iron ore and limestone were not quickly addressed. In a bold decision it was decided to mobilize at least part of the Great Lakes ore carrier fleet to allow it to begin loading and delivering the badly needed iron and limestone ores a month ahead of the regular start of the sailing season. Besides the severe challenges of the late winter weather, with severe storms, ice bergs and jams and frigid waters, finding officers, crew, and dock workers to work at the loading and unloading ports would be difficult as wartime drafts and the demands for materials and men from other wartime challenges were encountered. Historically, the &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo; led to 1942 setting all-time new records in the delivery of ore via the Great Lakes, as well as production of steel. But the risks and costs were high.&#10;&#10;Breaking the Ice is a solitaire play game on the Great Lakes &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo;. The player will have to allocate valuable resources and deploy the car ferry ice breakers to support the ore fleet in the mission of delivering the most ore to the production ports as possible, with a minimal amount of damage to the fleet as possible. Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

New tiles can be added to the game board on either end, and into any of the rows. Each time a new tile is added to the game board a tile is ejected from the other end of the same row.&#10;&#10;The tiles display either a body part (nose, forehead, ear, shoulder, elbow, belly button, back, knee or foot) or &quot;Bent Out of Shape.&quot;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn (or the team's turn if playing in teams), the player rolls the die and takes the corresponding number of tiles from the facedown pile next to the board. The player then inserts the tiles into the game board, from either side and into any row. After they have inserted the new tile, the display of the 9 tiles at the centre of the board will have changed. The player will then attempt to score the body part that is displayed in the very centre of the board.&#10;&#10;To score the body part in the centre of the board, the other player(s) will announced the eight body parts surrounding the centre square, two at a time, starting from any corner and moving clockwise around the square of eight body parts. As the other player(s) announces the body parts, the playing player/team must connect the two body parts together by connecting the parts on each other's body or by using their hands. While holding this position, the next two body parts are announced and must be added to the current pose.&#10;&#10;If the team is successful at connecting all the body parts at once, they score the body part in the centre square. If the team is unsuccessful at connecting together all of the body parts, or fails to hold the pose throughout the turn, they score nothing. Players/teams are given two chances to complete the pose.&#10;&#10;If any of the 9 tiles displayed in the game board displays &quot;Bent out of Shape&quot; instead of a body part, then one member of the team must try to link all of the body parts by himself/herself. Because this task is more difficult, if they succeed they can score any body they wish.&#10;&#10;The first team to score all nine different body parts wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Afterwards they fight, following the intuitive battle system of fixed attack and defense stats combined with the rolling of D3 dice.&#10;In case of success, the Players get to loot the village for treasures by drawing one of 35 unique loot cards, this is the main income the Players have throughout the &quot;year&quot;.&#10;&#10;Back home in their Viking Settlement, the Players make use of their new gained fortune, recruiting more warriors, bringing sacrifices to the Gods and starting to construct more ships and buildings to extend their settlement.&#10;From now on every season will start with the drawing of an event card, there are 60 different ones, and each one of them may bring you joy or pain, or something in between. Every card has it's own story, many of them are inspired by actual mythic stories and events of the viking ages.&#10;Another important part of the game are the ways of the northern Gods. Their will is represented by 60 cards. By bringing sacrifices and certain events, the Gods will grant you their Benevolence. Other events or hostile fellow Players may force you to draw Wrath of the Gods cards. As in the event cards, every single &bdquo;Card of the Gods&ldquo; tells a story, many of them following real Norse mythology. Each card has its unique effect.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when one of the Players has collected 7 &bdquo;Favour of the Gods&ldquo; points and therefore reaches the Golden Gates of VALHAL.&#10;&#10;About the second print.&#10;&#10;The second print features high quality dice and plastic coins instead of cardboard tokens.&#10;The rulebook as well as the cards have been revised and cleaned up. The new rulebook also includes alternative rulesets to fit the game more towards your needs (making it quicker or more streamlined).&#10;Bigger markers (8mm) as well as a new battle tableau replace the old battle-cards and small markers (5mm). The markers are now also made from plastic instead of wood.&#10;With Yggdrasil the achievement tokens received their own game element.&#10;Optical changes allowed for bigger fonts on cards (especially town cards) and overall improved readability as well as better distinction between certain tokens and game elements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MacGuffin is a cooperative story improvisation game for 3 to 6 players. It provides a framework to guide you in creating a story with a real plot and character development. It is hysterical at times, tragic at others.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;One person, the Game Master, takes on the role of a busybody, or &ldquo;Quidnunc&rdquo;. The Quidnunc craves all the latest news and gossip about a previous escapade involving the protagonists of the story, known as the &ldquo;Hounds&rdquo;. The players other than the Quidnunc assume the roles of the Hounds. In this adventure, the Hounds doggedly chase down an object of vital interest, known as the &ldquo;MacGuffin&rdquo;. The Quidnunc drives the storytelling process by asking questions, making observations, prodding, and generally creating a nuisance of himself to extract every last detail of the Hounds' quest.&#10;&#10;The great director Alfred Hitchcock coined the term &ldquo;MacGuffin&rdquo;. A MacGuffin is something that the major characters of a story, both protagonists and antagonists, are chasing. Seemingly, the MacGuffin is what the story is about. However, it is actually irrelevant to the story, which is really all about character interaction and development. The MacGuffin&rsquo;s only real purpose is to bring the characters together and push them into action and competition with each other.&#10;&#10;The movies are replete with MacGuffins. The One Ring is the coveted MacGuffin in Tolkein's &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo;. Ahab relentlessly pursues his White Whale to everyone's detriment in Melville's &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo;. In &ldquo;Raiders of the Lost Ark&rdquo;, the Nazis hunt the magical Ark of the Covenant as a weapon of ultimate power while Indiana Jones seeks it as an artifact of tremendous historical merit.&#10;&#10;In this game, as in the movies, MacGuffins take on many forms. Whatever its nature, the MacGuffin primarily serves as a means to link the major characters, the Hounds and their enemies, in some way. Since the characters all run toward the MacGuffin, they will invariably interact, and plots involving them can be woven into a single coherent tale whose sum is greater than their individual contributions.&#10;&#10;Each player has final say over a single major character in the story and shares control of the other characters with his or her fellow players. When conflicts arise between participants, they bid on the right to narrate the result. So, this game only provides a framework for collaborative storytelling; the actual story is created by the players. Even though MacGuffin is a &ldquo;game&rdquo;, it is the process of telling a collaborative story that matters. So, unlike most games, the point of a MacGuffin session is not really the declaration of who won or lost, but the creation of an entirely new story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the introduction&#10;&#10;The print-and-play version is available as a free download, comprised of three PDF documents (totaling 88 pages) and one large ZIP archive of numerous print-and-play game components in PNG format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A witch has kidnapped a princess and locked her in a pavilion, bound by magic. The players must complete magic spells to get into the pavilion and rescue her. The full title is &quot;The Princess and Magic Tiles - She Turns Out to Be Amazingly Heavy -&quot;. In the game, as you carry the Princess away to safety, she grows heavier and heavier, cursed by the witch.&#10;&#10;During the game, players place tiles in front of themselves to build a tableau. Players are trying to build certain patterns to match spell cards, open to any player. A pattern works either by have the same symbols on the tile match up, or by having the same background on the tiles match. So a diagonal line of purple stars might fit one spell card, whilst the same tableau also has a crossway pattern with a gold background. Building combos like this helps the player advance quickly.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the Princess, they carry her away. The player puts the princess token on top of their piece. But the Princess is cursed and weighs too much, slower the player down. In this way, the other players can catch up and carry her away.&#10;&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#138;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#189;&#156;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#155;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#188;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

The card you select will guide you in which three artist cards you will play face up to the table. Award cards include parameters such as, &quot;My favorite.&quot;, &quot;A guilty pleasure.&quot;, &quot;The most influential.&quot;, &quot;Worst vocals.&quot;, &quot;Best lyrics.&quot;, &quot;Most likely to be a Star Trek fan.&quot;, &quot;Will be forgotten the quickest.&quot;, &quot;The biggest sellout.&quot;, &quot;Best dynamics.&quot;, &quot;Best bass playing.&quot;, &quot;Best vocal harmonies.&quot; and many more. There are plans to have around 130 Award Cards in the base game.&#10;&#10;After the active player selects an Award Card, they place three Artist Cards from their hand face up on the table marked #1, #2, and #3, each other player, and the active player then places a 1, 2, or 3 marker face down on the table in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;When all players have made their selection, all players reveal. Each player that matches the active player's selection gets 1 point. If ALL player select the active players pick, the active player gets points listed on the Award card (2 to 4 points depending on the difficulty of the Award Card).&#10;&#10;The game is built for musicians, and rabid music fans who really love music and enjoy debating subjective creative musical talent.&#10;&#10;There is a game variant that has the active player selecting an Award Card and all other players throwing in an answer from their hand of 5 Artist Cards. The active player then picks their favorite, giving 1 point to the player whose card was selected.&#10;&#10;Example rounds:&#10;&#10;Pick a guilty pleasure.&#10;&#10;     Ambrosia&#10;     Air Supply&#10;     Justin Timberlake&#10;&#10;&#10;Best background vocals.&#10;&#10;     The Beatles&#10;     The Staple Singers&#10;     Sly &amp; The Family Stone&#10;&#10;&#10;Most likely to go to hell.&#10;&#10;     Slayer&#10;     50 Cent&#10;     Madonna&#10;&#10;&#10;Best Lyrics.&#10;&#10;     Tom Waits&#10;     Bob Dylan&#10;     Rush&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Kreuz und quer (Criss-cross)&#10;The players have to get their 8 numbered pawns from their starting spaces to their destination spaces of the same numbers at the opposite side of the game board.&#10;Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each die has two large different colored dots and 4 numbered sides&#10;(1-4), each in one of the four colors. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results.&#10;The pawns move forward according to the rolled numbers. The roll of a dot allows for a side-wards move. Instead of moving straight ahead, the pawns have to jump &#10;diagonaly over oppenent pawns to a free space, whenever it is possible. If a pawn lands on a spot, already occupied by an opponent pawn, the later is eliminated from &#10;the game.&#10;&#10;2. Im Kreise hin und der (In circles back and forth)&#10;The players use 4 pawns, which the have to move to space 50 of their color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice.&#10;Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. The roll of a number moves a pawn accordingly forward. The roll of a dot moves a pawn &#10;sideways between the red and green tracks or between the blue and yellow tracks. If a pawn reaches space 44 on the neighboring track, it continues at space 1 of it's own &#10;track for another round.&#10;&#10;3. Wer ist der Erste? (Who ist the first?)&#10;Each player uses 1 pawn, which he has to move from space 1 to space 36 of it's own color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Results of one's own color allows &#10;the pawn to move forward accordingly. Results of another color are deducted from the results of one's own color. The difference determines how much coins the player &#10;gets from the cash box or has to pay into the cash box. The first player to reach space 36 wins the contents of the cash box. On spaces 12, 17, 24 and 34 positive &#10;or negative points are multiplied.&#10;&#10;4. Wer ist der Letzte? (Who is the last?)&#10;Each player uses 4 numbered pawns. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. First each player &#10;has to get his pawns onto the spaces 1-4 of his color according to the number of each pawn, so when a green 4 is rolled, the green pawn 4 is put on the green space 4. &#10;Only when all four pawns are on the board, they are allowed to move. A pawn occupying the center space may be thrown out by an opponent's pawn. If a player may move more &#10;than one pawn the numbers must be used in ascending order. For each rolled number has to be uses by another pawn, so when 3 red numbers are rolled, three red pawns have &#10;to be moved, if this is not possible the move is forfeit. If two dots of one are rolled, the player may return one of his pawns to its starting position (spaces 1-4), &#10;as long as non of his pawns has reached space 12. The last player to occupy the center space wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
