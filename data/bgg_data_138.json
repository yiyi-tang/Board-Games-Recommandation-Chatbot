You and the other players will bid on those attractions. The winners take those attractions and add them to their park, increasing the park's allure, profitability, and/or satisfaction. Then you use those attractions to attempt to lure an interesting mix of Parkies to your park. The park with the happiest Parkies at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The planet of Arcfall has become overrun with dangerous creatures. Malfunctioning robots and savage beasts wreak havoc across the planet. Locals have taken to the services of anyone who will help &ndash; for a price of course. You are a bounty hunter seeking fame and fortune, but beware as other hunters will try to swoop in and claim your target as their own! Press your luck against other hunters in search of fame and fortune!&#10;&#10;Hunters of Arcfall is a quick-playing dice and card game for 2-6 players. You start the game with players choosing a bounty hunter to play as. Players then take turns rolling dice to capture bounties; these bounties are shared amongst hunters so only the hunter who deals the final hit will capture the bounty. Only bounties that have been claimed are worth any points. You can claim bounties by ending your turn or continue the hunt and try to capture even more at the risk of losing anything you've earned. Each bounty is worth Fame and Fortune. You need Fame to win the game, but fortune will net you currency to purchase much needed Item Cards that help you manipulate the odds in your favor. Use your hunter's special ability to gain an extra advantage and press your luck if you think it's safe &ndash; you never know what lurks around the next corner.&#10;&#10;A typical game of Hunters of Arcfall lasts between 20-30 minutes depending on the number of players and the point limit.&#10;&#10;The expansion Tools of the Trade was initially planned as a separate item, but through Kickstarter funding, every copy of the game now includes this expansion. With Tools of the Trade, Hunters can purchase tools and items to help capture bounties or hinder their competitors.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note: All copies of the game display 1-6 players on the box, however this is a printing error and the game only supports 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It was the beginning of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, one of the most brutal campaigns in the history of warfare. Four years later, the victorious Red Army has suffered a loss of seven million lives. &#10;The Barbarossa campaign included some of the greatest episodes in military history: the futile attack on Moscow in the winter of 1941-42, the siege of Stalingrad, the great Russian offensive beginning in 1944 that would lead the Red Army to the historic meeting with the Americans at the Elbe and on to victory in Berlin.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa is not simply one game but it is composed of three different types of games.&#10;1) The Standard Games: There are four of these games. They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war&#10;2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence&#10;3)The Variable situations: Several &quot;what if&quot; historical effects are examined when added to the above games.&#10;&#10;The Game includes a 23&quot; by 29&quot; map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.&#10;A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.&#10;The combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)&#10;There are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Each player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.&#10;The combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)&#10;After the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.&#10;Barbarossa is played in turns.&#10;Each Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;",

In 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new &quot;King of the World&quot;. A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far. In the West, an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere? In the North. the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders. In the South,  Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him. In the East, the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished! Will you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?&#10;&#10;The Assyrians were the innovators of siege warfare. All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.  Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.&#10;&#10;Assyrian Wars is a multi player, point to point game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well. Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.&#10;&#10;Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them. Can you overcome the massive city walls and water your horses at the Rivers of Babylon? The decision is yours to make. For the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.&#10;&#10;",

Regnum Angelica is a two-player strategic card/board game pitting Gabriel and his army of archangels against Beelzebub and the dark forces of the fallen. Wield the three elements of fire, earth and water in angelic combat, use ancient angelic scripts to gain an advantage over your opponent, or deploy pillars to protect your troops in an attempt to infiltrate the enemy's realm.&#10;&#10;Regnum Angelica is played with one player having the white deck to represent the archangels of Gabriel, and the other the black deck to represent Beelzebub and his army of fallen angels. Each deck consists of three types of cards: Angels, which are your main combat units; Angelic Scripts, written in the ancient celestial alphabet (Malachim) and granting the angels special abilities to assist them in infiltrating the enemy realm; and Pillars, which call up the elements of earth, fire, or water to protect them from enemy attacks.&#10;&#10;Each army has a power meter which is charged when either side's angels visit earth. The power meter must be carefully managed if you hope to crush your opponent as your power meter determines your movement and your ability to execute the Malachim. If too many Angelic scripts are played, then your mobility on the board suffers; if, on the other hand, you use your power for movement, then your ability to harness the powers of the angelic scripts wanes.&#10;&#10;Mobility or Angelic Scripts? Have your angels protect your realm, or go on the full offensive to penetrate your enemies kingdom? Execute your scripts now, burn them for precious power, or save them to use with other scripts to pull off powerful combinations? Many of these tactical decisions await you as you control the most powerful beings in the universe of Regnum Angelica!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A comprehensive, well-presented set of skirmish rules for WWII, resolving action at the individual soldier and vehicle crew member level. The designers' intent is to provide fast-playing rules which capture the spirit of ground combat.&#10;Units of both sides move in random order (determined by playing of cards), with each person able to perform two Actions per turn. Morale rules allow for fanatics, cowards and heroes, and Gut Checks are required before characters can perform highly risky acts. Rules cover artillery, engineers, armored and infantry combat.&#10;A generic squad organization is provided, and generic hit locations for tanks and halftracks. Seven scenarios are designed to allow players to gradually learn the rules.  Later supplements added new unit types, nationalities, and scenarios.&#10;The rules are written to use Easy Eight's 28mm miniature line, but conversion charts are included for playing with 20mm and 15mm figures.&#10;&#10;",

Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent. The game is expandable to large team or free-for-all games.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to uncover and attack your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card with one of your own cards. Each player places 5 piles of 5 cards each face down in front of them. The crown card should be hidden on the bottom of one of the 5 piles. The rest of the cards may be arranged however you like, but choose carefully. A bad setup can quickly give your opponent the upper hand.&#10;&#10;Game play: Players take turns attacking by selecting the top Card from one of their Piles and laying that Card face up in front of one of their opponent&rsquo;s Piles. The defending player must then reveal the top Card of the Pile that was attacked. The Card with the lowest number value loses and is discarded. The winning Card must be returned face down to the top of the original Pile it was drawn from. If the two Cards have the same number value, both Cards are discarded. Play continues until one of the players attacks their opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card, winning the game.&#10;&#10;Special cards:&#10;Archer Card: If you attack with an Archer Card, it always wins. If your Archer Card is attacked, it always loses. Shield Card: Shield Cards cannot be used to attack. If your Shield Card is attacked, both your Shield Card and your opponent&rsquo;s attacking Card are discarded (except for Archer Cards - see Additional Rules. Crown Card: You can attack with your Crown Card. If you attack your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card, you win. Otherwise, you lose the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Genesia is a quick-playing game of placement and civilization that includes a card-drafting system and a lot of interaction between players.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game is played over three ages, which roughly correspond to ancient times, medieval times, and the modern era. At the start of each age, players receive six cards from that age, then draft a hand of five cards for use in the current age. Each age has four phases &mdash; growth, expansion, attack, end &mdash; and the cards include icons that show when they can be played and when their powers take effect. You also receive 15 coins at the start of an age. Within each phase, players take all the actions they want in player order, eventually passing, and once all players have passed, the next phase begins. At any time during your turn, you can discard a card from your hand and take 4 coins from the reserve. The phases are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Growth: Play cards that show this phase's icon (paying their cost, if required) and recruit as many clans as you wish, paying 2 coins for each and placing it in your homeland or (in later ages) in one of your cities. Each player has their own game board, with all player boards surrounding a shared &quot;Genesia&quot; board.&#10;&#10;&bull; Expansion: As before, play cards with the proper icon, recruit clans for 2 coins each, or move your clans as much as you wish, paying 1 coin for each space than an individual clan moves (although in age III you can move a stack of clan tokens for 1 coin per space); when moving, you can pass through occupied regions, paying that player an additional toll of 1 coin, but you cannot stop on those regions, except for a player's homeland, which can house any number of clans from any number of players.&#10;&#10;&bull; Attack: Simultaneously reveal your war/peace token with all other players. If everyone has chosen peace, this phase ends; otherwise, each player who has chosen war performs exactly one attack, choosing a region that contains your clans and an adjacent region controlled by an opponent that contains fewer clans. Choose a number from 1 up to the number of clans in your attacking region, then remove that many clans from each region. If the defending region has a city and no more clans, you can remove one of your clans to besiege the city and replace it with one of your own. If the opponent has now been removed from that region, you can move any number of clans from the attacking region to this space.&#10;&#10;Once each &quot;war&quot; player has attacked once, players once again simultaneously reveal their war/peace token, repeating the process above until all players reveal peace.&#10;&#10;&bull; End: If you have at least two clans in a region without a city, you now place one of your cities in that region. Then you play any cards you wish with an &quot;End of Age&quot; icon, discarding all other cards for 4 coins each. Score progress points for this round's &quot;End of Age&quot; cards as well as all invention cards you've played to date.&#10;&#10;After three ages, you sum progress points, score 2 points for each region on a foreign continent you occupy, score points for every region you occupy (1-15, with the central Genesia regions being most valuable), and score points if you achieved your secret objective. Whoever scored the most total points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.&#10;&#10;As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   &#10;The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.&#10;&#10;Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.&#10;&#10;Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.&#10;&#10;Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.&#10;&#10;The first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.&#10;&#10;In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.&#10;&#10;To attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...&#10;&#10;There can be only one.&#10;&#10;Highlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There is a collection of books handwritten by the survivors of the first war against the demons where it&rsquo;s narrated that under the island of Jiin there are two forged doors that enclose the infernal forces expelled by Arashi &quot;the Exiled&quot;. A hero disowned by the false emperor, who has plunged the country into a punishing civil war facing a population that awaits the return of his hero to rid them of the tyranny of a mad throne and the rumors of demons returning to win back with blood what they once lost.&#10;&#10;Yohei is born from the combination of the mysticism of Japanese folklore with a fantasy universe created for a wargame that faces asymmetrical clans in modular boards with numerous and different game modes. It combines mechanics such as dice rolling, grid movement, variable players powers, modular boards and card management to develop our strategy during the battle by acquiring warriors, invoking powerful event cards, legendary weapons and the construction of buildings that lead us to victory in exciting games of 60 to 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Existe una colecci&oacute;n de libros manuscritos por los supervivientes de la primera guerra contra los demonios donde se asegura que bajo la isla de Jiin, dos puertas forjadas hace milenios contienen a las fuerzas infernales expulsadas por Arashi &ldquo;el exiliado&rdquo;. Un h&eacute;roe repudiado por el falso emperador que ha sumido al pa&iacute;s en una agotadora guerra civil enfrentando a una poblaci&oacute;n que espera ansiosa el regreso de un h&eacute;roe que los libere de la tiran&iacute;a de un trono enloquecido y de los rumores de monstruos que acechan pacientes para reconquistar con sangre lo que una vez perdieron.&#10;&#10;Yohei nace de la combinaci&oacute;n del misticismo del folklore japon&eacute;s con un universo de fantas&iacute;a creado para ofrecer un wargame que enfrenta a clanes asim&eacute;tricos en tableros modulares con numerosos modos de juego diferentes. Combina mec&aacute;nicas como el dice rolling, grid movement, tropas asim&eacute;tricas, tableros modulares y gesti&oacute;n de cartas para librar batallas mediante la adquisici&oacute;n de guerreros, construcci&oacute;n de edificios y la invocaci&oacute;n de poderosos eventos y armas legendarias que conduzcan los jugadores a la victoria en apasionantes partidas de 60 a 90 minutos de duraci&oacute;n.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Visby is a short, but challenging game. Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals. All players choose one card from their hand simultaneously and place it face down in front of them (two cards in a two- or three-player game). Then the cards are revealed and the effects become active:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Knights and Troops take victory points;&#10;     Blacksmith gets wares for each Knight/Troops played by other players;&#10;     Ships and Fleets get wares; Tollkeeper gets seals for ships and fleets;&#10;     Merchant changes wares into seals;&#10;     Monk gets wares for merchants and number of cards already played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players with a monk take all cards back to their hand, while others proceed with their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;The specific issue is that the more efficient cards become effective only after those which are not that strong. For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do &mdash; but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously. Perhaps, though, you remember which cards the others have already played...&#10;&#10;Visby comes in a basic set for two players and can be enlarged with one or two expansion packs that contain material for two additional players each (to the maximum of six players).&#10;&#10;",

It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield, A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;One of four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system.&#10;&#10;",

Two to seven players each manage the economics and conduct the political and military operations of one or more of the Major Powers involved.&#10;&#10;Days of Decision consists of 2 games in 1. The standard 1936-1939 game requires not other components than those provided in this game. It is played on the map of Europe and the Pacific and uses an abstract combat system to represent the conflicts occurring in this period. The 1936-1946 Grand Campaign Game require World in Flames to be used in conjunction with Days of Decision to resolve the military conflicts. Finally, there is also a World in Flames mini scenario of the Spanish Civil War which requires some components from World in Flames.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game can be played alone or as a pre-game of 1930s politics for World in Flames also by ADG.&#10;&#10;The game is about who will (if any) declare the Second World War, how the production of the Major Powers are at the time of war  and how the many small nations will align (Axis or Allied). It has been replaced by DoDII, which adds the Communist alignment. DoDII has recently been replaced by DoDIII.&#10;&#10;",

The last line of the song: &quot;He cried and the loach didn't know what to do.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a few chips, each worth a point. The 16-card deck &ndash; which consists of two loaches (worth 0), four ponds (worth -1 or -2) and ten acorns (worth 1-5) &ndash; is shuffled, then a number of cards equal to the number of players are laid face-up. Each player receives a hand of 3-4 cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places a card from his hand into one of the columns or claims one of the columns. When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.&#10;&#10;After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank. This player is then out of the round, while the others continue to play cards or take columns.&#10;&#10;A round ends when no columns remain, columns with only one card remain, or someone scores 6 chips from a column; in the latter case, the round ends immediately, and no one else scores anything. Players then start a new round. When the bank empties or a player has 20 or more chips, players complete the current round, then the player with the most chips wins!&#10;&#10;",

From the schools to the sidewalks, everything will be owned and run by HappyCorp, and every resident will become a HappyCorp employee. There will be no more minimum wage, no more public services, and no more unions. HappyCorp has already begun unleashing its Smile Drones to convert the city&rsquo;s infrastructure, crush protests, and ensure every resident watches its Commercial Breaks.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of the Strike Council to lead a city-wide rebellion of workers against HappyCorp&rsquo;s take over, while also fighting for better livelihoods for all. Players will grow their ranks, mobilize their workers, and launch strikes around Mercury City. As the Strike Council scores victories for workers, they will gain the support of more allies, from the dockworkers to the teachers, and build new bases of support from the manufacturing district to the university.&#10;&#10;Players takes on one of eight unique characters, such as Valentina the Factory Worker and Candace the Firefighter, each who has their own stats and two unique combination of powers. On their turn, players will add four actions to their character boards in order to add new Strikers to the board, stop HappyCrop, and complete &quot;STRIKE!&quot; cards in their hands, such as &quot;Take over the Bridge&quot; and &quot;Block HappyCorp Delivery Trucks.&quot; They will also play Ally Cards, which will give them more energy to defend themselves from HappyCorp and aid other players' efforts.  At the end of each players' turn, however, they will have to draw a Commercial Break card - which will cause them to remove Strikers, lose resources, and add new drones to the board.&#10;&#10;Players win collectively if they score 15 points, thereby abolishing HappyCorp from Mercury City. HappyCorp wins if it reaches 15 points of its own, or if it gets 5 of its feared MegaDrones on the board.&#10;&#10;The core gameplay is centered around collaboration: figuring out how and when to best work together to stop HappyCorp and build your city-wide strike. Do you work towards completing the Striker cards in your own hand, or do you set up a teammate to make a big move on their turn? Do you want to disassemble that MegaDrone so another player can strike, or do you want to increase your own character&rsquo;s energy? Either way, HappyCorp will be constantly deploying its drones and playing Commercial Breaks - so act quickly!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to lead the worker rebellion to defeat HappyCorp?

Everyone simultaneously tries to &quot;connect&quot; seven of their nine cards. Two cards are connected when they lay adjacent to one another with a pair of symbols on one card touching a matching pair of symbols on the adjacent card.&#10;&#10;The first person to lay down seven cards in that manner shouts &quot;Ubongo&quot; and earns 10 points, while everybody else scores as many points as they have connected cards on the table. (If any player has made a mistake while placing cards, including the player who ended the round, that player scores zero points for the round.)&#10;&#10;For the second round, players flip over their nine cards and use them. For rounds 3-6, players receive cards from two new decks. After six rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

That's when you get to use wooden bilding blocks to bild something as the other players guess.&#10;&#10;First, you draw a What card. The 'What' card gives you 2 choices of things to bild, could be anything. The letters and colors represent the category. There are six in total: &#10;&#10;     Category Beings is for biological bodies, be it human being, beast, or botanical. Examples could be a lumberjack, or conjoined twins.&#10;     Category Imagined indicates invented ideas and implausible imaginings, including Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster or the Tooth fairy&#10;     Category Locations lists lots of places and landmarks, local or less closeby,  like the Berlin Wall or the Garden of Eden.&#10;     Category Devices designates doodads and doohickeys. The domain of designed objects, like a jetpack or a game boy.&#10;     Category Events entails epic or everyday encounters and experiences, for example a rocket launch or an alien abduction&#10;     Category rest is a random ragbag of everything that remains outside the reach of previous categories, like Wheel of Fortune or a witch burning.&#10;&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect all 6 letters, which conveniently spell out B-I-L-D-E-R.&#10;&#10;You earn cards by guessing whatever the bilder is bilding. The Bilder, however, can only score a letter by choosing one of 3 revealed HOW cards. &#10;&#10;     Most HOW cards make bilding harder by adding an extra rule&#10;     Some HOW cards make it easier, by allowing extra hints&#10;&#10;&#10;Challenges are wildcards that change the game rules. Not just bilding something, but a test of skill that you must pass to earn this card. It&rsquo;s also a joker that can be used as any letter.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card displays two of those colors: a colored frame surrounding a differently-colored circle in the center of the card. As part of the setup three cards are placed in the middle of the table face-up. If the frame color of your card matches the circle color of one of the cards in the middle of the table, you can place your card on top of it. Sounds easy, right? Wait until you try out yourself!&#10;&#10;The colors used in Nimble were selected in a way that the vast majority of the people with color vision deficiencies can distinguish the colors. If you are affected by any type of color vision deficiency, you can easily check if the colors work for you by looking at the six differently colored tiles on the box making up the title of the game.&#10;&#10;Each color represents a piece of classical world literature: Around the World in Eighty Days, Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Don Quixote, War of the Worlds and Moby-Dick. The artwork on the cards is rich and detailed without it being distracting during the fast gameplay. So, it really pays off to take a break between the matches and marvel at the art.&#10;&#10;",

A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.&#10;&#10;The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.&#10;&#10;The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution. Thus the game moves fast, but does not sacrifice battle and movement detail(s).&#10;&#10;Copyright (c) 1973 RGI - Research Games, Inc and ATHOL Game Co., 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010&#10;&#10;Also see: Major Campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur&#10;&#10;",

The Storm's fleet wields incredible firepower, are very manoeuvrable, and their shield generators are more resilient than our own. Though they are generally weaker in defence and tend to swoop in to attack before retreating to a safe distance. Flick your ships into position and then flick dice from them at your opponents' ships to damage them and degrade their systems.&#10;&#10;As with the base game and previous expansions, there is a deluxe and standard version.

    "Description": "Coffee is a two-player abstract board game designed by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s. The goal of the game is to create a line of stones of your color, or to prevent your opponent from making a legal placement of the white rod.&#10;&#10;When placing the rod in a black or orange stone, it looks like a coffee seed. Hence the name Coffee.&#10;&#10;This is what you need in order to play Coffee:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A hexagonal board with more than 3 cells per side or a square board with more than 4 cells per side (NESTORGAMES version has up to 5 cells per side for the hexagonal board and up to 7 cells per side for the square board).&#10;     A supply of black and orange stones.&#10;     A small white rod.&#10;&#10;&#10;Black starts by placing a stone in an empty cell, and then placing the white rod on it, pointing in any direction (3 directions for a hexhex board, or 4 for a square board).&#10;&#10;From now on, starting with Orange, players alternate turns first placing a stone in an empty cell in the direction indicated by the rod, and then placing the rod on it, pointing in any direction.&#10;&#10;It is illegal to place the rod so that the next player has no free spaces available.&#10;&#10;The game ends in one of the following cases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     One player wins the game by making a line of &lsquo;n&rsquo; stones of his color (with &lsquo;n&rsquo; being the victory condition).&#10;     One player loses the game because he cannot place the rod in a legal position.&#10;&#10;&#10;If both cases happen on the same turn, the first case prevails.&#10;&#10;Notice that ties are not possible.&#10;&#10;The set includes one extra white rod so that 2 couples can play at the same time on the smallest boards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GAME IDEA&#10;The game is played in 12 rounds in which the dice fall anew each time. All see the same result but everybody from another perspective. Each player always tries to find the best scoring category for him. &#10;But attention: &#10;Each category is available only once per game! So far so easy, if only the dice would not always disappear under the cup again so fast &hellip; Who has grasped the best result in the short term? And in which category would eventually have been more to achieve?&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;The player with the highest total score in the end wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!&#10;&#10;PREPARATION&#10;Put the dice in the cup. Each player gets a scoring sheet and a pen &ndash; and writes down his name on the up right line intended for it. Now a starting player is chosen and off we go!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;The starting player starts rolling the dice but still everybody plays always simultaneously.&#10;Each round consists of 8 steps:&#10;&#10;     Put all dice in the cup.&#10;     Your hand above it and shake it well.&#10;     Turn around the cup with the dice and overthrow it on the table so all dice are hidden underneath the cup.&#10;     Lift up the cup for about 3 seconds (to measure the time, slowly say the following slogan: &bdquo;Lift the cup &ndash; eyes up&ldquo;). The dice must be clearly visible for everybody for the same amount of time.&#10;     Then the cup is put over the dice again carefully so that they are not turned over accidentally.&#10;     Now each player sets a cross in the little circle of the box in the category he wants to value. You can use your hand as a sight screen. Once the cross is set it may not be changed anymore.&#10;     When everybody is ready the player lifts the cup again and puts it aside so the dice result is visible for all players again.&#10;     Now everybody values his result and writes the points in the corresponding field (Example Kim see valuation). Pass the cup on in clockwise direction. The next round starts. Important: Sometimes the dice lie on top of each other. Then the dice roll must be repeated immediately!&#10;&#10;&#10;VALUATION AND EXAMPLES&#10;&#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;count fours only&ldquo; in the upper part, multiplies the number of fours with 4 (of fives with 5, of sixes with 6). E.g. three time 4: 3 x 4 = 12 points &#10;     Who has set a cross for a colour, e.g. &bdquo;blue&ldquo;, in the middle part, only counts the eyes of the two dice in this colour and notes down the sum. Scoring of Kim 5 + 6 = 11 points &#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;double&ldquo;, may note down 10 points for each &bdquo;double&ldquo; of the same colour. E.g. one &bdquo;double&ldquo; (red) = 10 points&#10;     Who has marked &bdquo;all ones, twos and threes&ldquo;, adds all dice pips which show ones, twos and threes. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13 points &#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;DICE CUP&ldquo;, adds the pips of all dice and&#10;&#10;&#10;notes down the sum. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 +5 + 6 = 36 points After each valuation the respective selected category * The dot next to the red square is used for better is of course dropped for the current game.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends after 12 played rounds. In the last round the cup can be left aside after the third playing step, and the last valuation (for the respective individual last category) is done at once. Afterwards every player adds the points of the three parts on his scoring sheet, transmits the sum into the fields provided for this purpose and calculates the total amount.&#10;The player with the highest total amount wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!&#10;&#10;VARIATIONS:&#10;The &bdquo;Eyes up time&ldquo; may vary as the players like or by experience. Pro players can shorten the time to 2 seconds, for example. Beginners and younger players may extend it. All players always have the same length of time available &hellip; It is also much fun to play several games simultaneously. The players have two or more columns in each category to fill in and value.&#10;&#10;Have fun playing!&#10;&#10;",
