Here is the list of the new weapons and tactics now at your disposal: 2 Exocet missiles fired from your aircraft carrier; 1 Tomahawk missile with a massive footprint fired from your battleship; 2 Apache missiles fired from your destroyer; 2 torpedoes fired from your sub; two recce airplanes for surveillance; and sonar imaging from your sub!  While the older version of this game had some strategy, it was still a mostly guessing game, but with the Advanced Mission you really have to plan your attack and keep track of your available assets.&#10;&#10;",

Above all, the S.E.E.K.E.R. program has fueled a revolution in science, through the use of specialized machines that empower research. However, this invention has merely reinforced the growing need for a deeper understanding of our universe. To meet this need, a new groundbreaking sport has emerged:&#10;&#10;You are an elite scientist, leading a team of Seekers in a high-stakes competition to achieve new breakthroughs. Step into the arena and face off in an epic race to expand the human knowledge.&#10;&#10;Besides its theme, what makes Seeker Chronicles so special is its resource management system, where every card is a resource but only until you use its powers. To win the game, you will need to find the best balance between how much you can do and how strong you are on the board. This gives rise to a wealth of strategy that is unique to this game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world of Disserei has grown a little too small for all its inhabitants to coexist peacefully. The tentative treaty between the five clans has all but dissolved, and tensions are rising as the chaos of war approaches. Players enter the picture as potential leaders of a new era, and attempt to build a nation that will become the center of civilization. That nation can be warlike or peaceful.&#10;&#10;Unition is a deckbuilding combat free-for-all with two ways to win. Players have the choice of an aggressive approach where they reduce every other player&rsquo;s health to zero, or playing defensively and winning by points. Health and points are kept secret behind player screens, and so social dynamics play a part in overall strategy as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a low-value starter deck from which they draw a hand of five cards to play on their turn. These played cards give resources like currency to recruit stronger clan cards, attack to direct at other players, and points to collect. Recruited clan cards bring new abilities and stronger elements into player's decks, and each clan has a specialty. Two cards of the same clan gain bonuses when played together, with a large bonus occurring if a member from each clan is played in a single hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends in one of two ways: when only one player has health left, making them the last player standing, or when one player has gained 50 points. Each player starts with 50 health tokens, and when they reach zero, they are eliminated while other players continue. However, the instant any player gains their 50th point token, the game immediately ends for everyone and that player wins.&#10;&#10;Unition requires each player to carefully decide their path, balance resources, and build their empire while also playing the macro game of navigating the politics and subterfuge of those sitting around the table.&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!&#10;&#10;UNDO: 600 Seconds places you in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve. Right now, the main character of this scenario should have been lying on a sun lounger in Hawaii for a week already, cocktail in hand. Instead, he's clutching a pair of pliers with trembling hands, uncertain which wire to cut. Sweat runs into his eyes, adrenaline rushes through his veins. The seconds on the timer of the bomb tick down mercilessly ... 8 ... 7 ... He desperately tries to remember his training with the CIA more than three decades ago ... 6 ... 5 ... This must be payback for working only an office job these last ten years ... 4 ... 3 ... He needs to make a decision if he wants to save all the people in this skyscraper ... 2 ... He cuts one wire ... 1 ... As the fireworks begin to illuminate the skyline of Los Angeles ... 0 ... the sound of a massive explosion and a devastating ball of fire usher in the new year with a catastrophe...&#10;&#10;",

In that campaign the Japanese overran Malaya, captured the strategic British base of Singapore and conquered Burma. Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.&#10;&#10;CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.  It includes all critical operations, however: land and air warfare, special operations and logistical considerations. The game has two players: the Allied and the Japanese.  Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns. The objective of the game is to capture strategic locales and destroy enemy units.&#10;&#10;Game scale: Each map hex equals 60 kilometers. Each turn represents three months of operations. Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.&#10;&#10;The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &quot;Singapore to Calcutta&quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &quot;Imphal&quot;. Scenario 3 is a short scenario entitled &quot;Fall of an Empire&quot; and covers only the first few turns of the war, through the 1942-III turn. In addition there are two scenario variants, &quot;Operation Zipper&quot; and &quot;Historic Withdrawals&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The set &quot;Im Osten&quot; contains historical events which are related to Asia. This relationship is not necessarily obvious. Like all Anno Domini the &quot;Im Osten&quot; edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

In this asymmetrical game, the hero and villain sides play a bit differently, but in the end, they both have the same goal: Crush your enemies! This is playable as a standalone game or can be combined with the Power Rangers Deck-Building Game Core Set for even more possibilities!&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play cards to generate shards and energy. You use shards to buy cards or battle adversaries and gain rewards. You can attack the opposing team using attack cards, and when you are attacked, you can defend with block cards. At the end of your turn, you perform any &quot;end of turn&quot; actions, discard cards played that turn, take one damage for each adversary in &quot;The Grid&quot;, then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;The first side to reduce their opponent's hit points to 0 wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Various species can visit your restaurant, and you have to be aware of their different tastes: watch where you seat them, which meal you suggest them, and how you prepare the food.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to earn the respect of every species. To accomplish this, you have time until closing, which comes after the deck runs out. And watch out, if the guests are discontent, you can lose the game earlier!&#10;&#10;Players take turns one after the other, and their turn consists of three phases. In the Activation phase, a row or column of tables are activated based on the top card of the deck. The activated guests may advance to their next state or their stress levels can increase. The second phase is the Action phase, where the player can take various actions: seat new guests, take orders, prepare and serve meals, and buy ingredients. The player has to play a card for each action, and based on the type of the card, the interaction can decrease or increase the stress level of the guest. In the Ending phase, the player discards the ingredients exceeding the storage limit, and draws new cards. The most interesting part is the preparation of meals, where other players can also play cards and pay ingredients to help the current player.&#10;&#10;",

Well it would be if your opponent wasn't racing to do the exact same thing.

It is a two-player tactical/operational simulation of the combat action on the American Sector during the first two days of the Normandy invasion, 6-7 June 1944.  The game looks at the American efforts all along the right flank of the Normandy landings. While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions. Call it the &ldquo;Longest Two Days,&rdquo; because that is the time-period covered in the game. Forty-eight hours of some of the most critical action in American history.&#10;&#10;The key units are all here, including engineers with special abilities, DD-tanks,  parachute and glider landings, and even railroad coastal artillery. One defining feature of the game is unit deployment; a unit can be deployed in one of two modes: Movement Mode allows for the greatest movement but the weakest combat (which is not to say those units can&rsquo;t fight) and Combat Mode, which allows the strongest fighting abilities (but still some movement for most units).&#10;&#10;&quot;Bradley&rsquo;s D-Day&quot; offers an intriguing scale, a moderate level of complexity, and an ease of play that will make this game either a fine addition to your Overlord collection, or a good first start for those who have not already focused on this campaign.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 hours of daylight or 4 hours or nightime&#10;Hex 800 meters&#10;Units: Company/Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Equipment&#10;One 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two counter sheets (320 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20 page rule book&#10;One Terrain Effects Chart&#10;No dice (game owners need to supply two six-sided die)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Schweiz&quot; contains historical events related to Switzerland, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "India is a land of villages. The word &quot;panchayat&quot; comes from a Sanskrit word that means &quot;a collection of five&quot;. In ancient times, a group of five elderly people collectively made decisions for the village. In this game, you take on the role of the panchayat and help turn the barren land into the most blossoming village. Will you succeed in making your village the best?&#10;&#10;Each round of Panchayat consists of choosing two building tiles, placing the building tiles on your village board, and scoring points. When you select tiles to place on your village board, you also get the ability to hide some of the unused tiles. Points are earned by placing building tiles near or in natural landscapes, near other buildings, or at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;You can also earn points from three types of bonus tiles: placement bonus, adjacency bonus, and endgame bonus. While you balance all of this, you also need to consider placing building tiles in their groups of commercial, industrial, utility, and residential sections.&#10;&#10;The game lasts eight rounds, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fortes fortuna iuvat: Plinius adversus Vesuvium (Fortune favors the brave: Pliny against the Vesuvius) is a small and simple postcard game published as a freebie by SNAFU Design, first as a gift for the attendees to the Collonera Russa 2022 wargaming convention (Vilafranca del Pened&egrave;s, Catalonia) and later released for free as a PDF. It's the third of the Snafu Postcard Games.&#10;&#10;It's a solitaire game in which the player, as Pliny the Elder, tries to rescue as many people as possible from the Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD, guiding the quadriremes of the Misenum fleet. The game uses a standard deck of cards. After shuffling them, the player reveals cards, one at a time. Black cards affect the progression of the smoke and of the pyroclastic flow, while red cards allow the player to act (move the inhabitants of the zone, move the quadriremes, move Pliny's liburna).&#10;&#10;The name of the game comes from a line in a letter from Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger, to the historian Tacitus in which he retells the last moments of his uncle: &quot;'Fortes' inquit 'fortuna iuvat: Pomponianum pete.' (Fortune favours the brave, he said, head for Pomponianus!)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Every tribe on Apsyntion has the same origin story - the same apocrypha retold for generations. That once, our people came from the stars. That their homeworld was lost, swallowed by Wormwood, and the ancestors built the arks in a last desperate gasp, releasing them to the sky like so many seeds in the wind. That the people of the ark, so roughly deposited on the soil of an alien Eden, fought for the right to rule this new world and remake it in their own image.&#10;&#10;Sovereign is an expandable card game where each player controls a burgeoning far-future civilization at the brink of war. You will build an empire from the ground up, managing civilians and military units, along with facilities unique to your faction's way of life.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one of ten factions, with a personal ideology represented by a prebuilt deck. A deck has 30 unique cards specific to that faction, and 20 cards called Echoes- remnants of the ark that brought humanity to this world.  Score ten Echoes and you win the game, but an Echo is always vulnerable in the meantime, whether it's in your hand or on the table. You'll defend your own Echoes with units and facilities you build, or steal them from opponents by attacking where you think the Echoes are hiding. Forge them yourself or steal them from other players- build or conquer, it's up to you.&#10;&#10;The game is designed so that the backs of the cards are used as much as the front, since each card back is used to track construction progress from turn to turn, without revealing the card underneath. Citizens are represented by double-sided tokens used initially for building cards, but when flipped become lower class workers, who might power facilities, or become soldiers to fuel your dominance.&#10;&#10;Sovereign is great as a 2 player game, but optimized for 3-4, with an array of cards that can be used to hinder or help opponents - encouraging fragile, temporary alliances. The game combines the best elements from worker placement games and CCGs, to create a dynamic hybrid experience where a society can rise and fall in under 2 hours, with over 300 unique cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;",

Travel to the Manor on the Forgotten Hill, where rumors says that a powerful Lich hides, cage its Soul, steal its Relics and face your friends in this fantastic game for 1-6 players!&#10;&#10;The game has an unique way to play. The players start the game with 5 Magic Cards, and when the turn begins monsters will appear in front of each player, but instead of facing the player that is in front of them, monsters will chase the player they are pointing at!&#10;Then, players will have to choose secretly which monster or monsters they want to defeat, setting spells on the board face down, to prevent being chased when the magic Spells are cast. No one can see those Spells until the moment of revealing them, so if the monsters have changed between turns, the players will have to remember what they have prepared and if they need to prepare more Spells to defeat the Monsters.&#10;During the game you can find Relics, powerful items that you can hold to gain more power. You can also use Special Cards, changing the state of the game by adding Monsters, removing Monsters, changing Monsters or drawing more Spells.&#10;The game will end when a player defeats a Lich with one of its Special Relics (which have to be stolen from the Lich itself) or when a player gets 10 Souls (which are given by defeating monsters), whatever happens first. If there is a tie when winnng, the tied player which has its turn closest to the Starting Player Token wins.&#10;&#10;In Animagicians we have three playing modes for all kind of players:&#10;- The all vs all mode, where each player wants to get all Souls before each other, facing the monsters, tricking the other players and casting a lot of magic Spells.&#10;- The Solo Player Mode, where a trio of brave magicians has entered the manor with 3 Soul Cages to encage the Soul of the Lich.&#10;- The Co-op Mode, a challenging adventure for 2 players, where those players have to accomplish several missions inside the manor in order to encage the Soul of the Lich.&#10;&#10;You will also find ten unique Character Cards with its own backstory which explains why are they travelling to the manor, each of them with its own special powers (one locked and one unlocked) which makes each game different.&#10;&#10;Do you still dare to face the Lich?&#10;&#10;&#10;The contents of the Core Box of Animagicians are:&#10;&#10;1 Rulebook (both in English and Spanish)&#10;&#10;149 Cards:&#10;&#10;- 15 Characters (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)&#10;- 6 Glossary of Symbols (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)&#10;- 42 Spells&#10;- 20 Special Cards&#10;- 34 Monsters&#10;- 12 Relics&#10;- 4 Special Monsters (the Lich!)&#10;- 3 Special Relics&#10;- 2 Empty Rooms&#10;- 11 Missions (for the Solo Player Mode and the Co-op Mode)&#10;&#10;1 Cardboard with:&#10;&#10;- 3 Soul Cage Token (with Broken Soul Cage Tokens on the other side)&#10;- 25 Soul Tokens (2 sides, one side with a Level 1 Soul and the other with a Level 3 Soul)&#10;- 1 Starting Player Token&#10;&#10;",

It has a Euro-influenced, worker placement mechanic where you have two types of workers: the lowly henchmen that you use to claim a room, and the boss that can command henchmen to activate the ability of the room. You spend Work Tokens to command a henchmen, but if you command another player&rsquo;s henchmen, you have to give that player the Work Token. It also has an expanding score track that doubles as the elevator shaft, which affects your build options and game strategy in interesting ways.&#10;&#10;It is a small-box strategy game that plays more like a big-box game. The game is highly thematic, from the tongue-in-cheek art style, to the streamlined gameplay that rewards villainous actions.&#10;&#10;Command your workers and make judicious use of scant resources to build an optimum lair, and gain the boss's favor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In June 1942, forces of the Japanese Northern Army occupied Attu Island as part of its Midway campaign. Attu, at the far western end of the Aleutian Archipelago, was American soil. In May 1943, American forces landed on Attu to liberate it. They were unprepared for the tenacity of the Japanese defenders and the brutality of the environmental conditions. What was expected to be a week-long clean-up exercise became a month-long, nose-to-nose meat-grinder whose casualty levels would not be exceeded until Iwo Jima.&#10;&#10;&quot;War in the Wind: The Battle of Attu Island, 1943&quot; is a low-to-moderate complexity wargame (roughly eight pages of rules) depicting the brutal combat and conditions on Attu. The design focuses on the challenges faced by the American forces in the form of extremely variable weather conditions and logistical hurdles posed by nearly insurmountable terrain. The Japanese must use these conditions to their advantage in order to survive the overwhelming American numbers.&#10;&#10;In addition to the campaign game covering the entire battle, War in the Wind also includes three smaller scenarios focusing on separate phases of the battle.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 400 yards / 366 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (324 9/16&quot; counters - includes 42 blanks)&#10;One 20-page War in the Wind rules booklet&#10;Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;Three 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-10 Hours&#10;&#10;",

By playing out rows, each of which consist of 6 gangsters, players try to gain a majority through their most valuable gangsters. But careful! To gain powerful positions, sometimes sharpshooting is needed. The goal of the game is to become the most powerful of all, Al Capone. Tactics, strategy and cold-bloodedness will be required if you want to be celebrated as the boss of bosses in this game.&#10;&#10;What gives the game its flair, apart from the real metal munitions, is the deft touch of the illustrator as well as court artist Robert Nippoldt. From corrupt mayor William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson to Boss of Bosses Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone, all of the major gangsters of this lead-filled time are represented. The well-known portraits are taken from the eponymous book &quot;Gangster. The Bosses of Chicago&quot; by Robert Nippoldt, and give the game a sheen of authenticity.

You and your teammates take on the roles of 4 different emergency room staff members of James Young Memorial Hospital, a failing medical center on the verge of being shut down by a government agency. You only have until the end of your shift to prove to them that the hospital deserves to stay open.&#10;&#10;To accomplish this, players will need to coordinate care and prioritize which patients need to receive care first and which can wait until a later turn. Every round, patients will be added to the emergency room via ambulance or private vehicle with various conditions, needs, and risks. Patients with more critical conditions such as a heart attack or stroke have the risk of death, while others with more minor injuries, like an elbow sprain or knee pain may leave the ER against medical advice, if they don't receive treatment quick enough. Unexpected events such as an external disaster, code blue, and patients removing their IVs may also occur, causing more problems for the staff to deal with.&#10;&#10;There are 3 ways to lose the game, and only one way to win. The players will lose if they are unable to place an incoming patient into one of 12 rooms, if 3 patients expire, or if they have not earned enough points from patient discharges to demonstrate to the agency that the hospital is worth staying open. Will you be able to make the tough decisions of patient care and save the hospital?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1912. The unsinkable Titanic is setting sail on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic, and you have secured yourself the coveted position of deckchair attendant on the first-class promenade. Your passengers will tip you extra for getting their chair in a good place, so you and the other deckchair attendants must compete to reserve the best spots on the promenade. Passengers will pay most for their favourite positions, but you can still earn a few tips if you take someone else&rsquo;s preferred spot. Most desired of all is the centre spot &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be paid handsomely if you manage to place one of your deckchairs there.&#10;&#10;Today starts the same as every other. You rise as early as possible, collect your deckplan and head for the first-class promenade, hoping that you&rsquo;ll be the first to get there. It&rsquo;s still dark when you arrive and you find that the deck is a little unsteadier than usual&hellip; then you notice some passengers are kicking around a large chunk of ice that seems to have fallen somehow onto the deck&hellip; but still the band plays on, and the other attendants are arriving now so there&rsquo;s no time to waste! Arranging deckchairs is a cutthroat business, and besides, everyone knows this ship is unsinkable!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the announcement is made, each of the other players has 90 seconds to think up and write down a stipulation, or any condition that makes the announcement worse. For example, if a player announces that they have wings, one player might write &quot;but can't fly&quot;, whereas another player might write &quot;with a 50 foot wingspan that can never be retracted.&quot; All players hand their written stipulations to the player sitting next to the announcer who reads them aloud. The announcer selects which of the written stipulations is the worst (whichever they would want the least) and the player who wrote it collects the stipulations card to keep track of score. The announcer also reveals the bonus point category (Funniest, Most original, etc.) and awards the bonus card to whomever they deem worthy of it based on the written stipulations. The round is then complete and the next player begins as the announcer by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;The game is complete when all players have been the announcer twice. Players should count the Stipulation and Bonus cards that they have earned through game play. The player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In all Sumoku games, game play starts with the roll of a die to create a &quot;key number&quot; &ndash; either 3, 4 or 5. The digits in all groups of tiles placed in rows and columns must sum to a multiple of this key number. A tile is one of six colors, and a color cannot be repeated in a connected set of tiles.&#10;&#10;In the main game, players draw eight tiles to start the game. On a turn, a player adds a single row or column of tiles to the playing area to create valid plays &ndash; that is, the sum of the tiles played and all rows or columns added to during that turn sum to a multiple of the key number. The player scores the sum of the tiles played, and the sum of tiles in any row or column added to during that turn. If you finished a row or column of six tiles &ndash; that is, one with all six colors &ndash; you take another turn immediately before refilling your hand to eight tiles. The game ends when no one can play, and numbers in hand count against a player's score. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Other games include &quot;Speed Sumoku&quot; in which players each have ten tiles and try to create a crossword-style grid in which all sets of tiles sum to a multiple of the key number before anyone else. &quot;Team Sumoku&quot; plays similarly, but with each team creating one grid. &quot;Spot Sumoku&quot; has players trying to spot four tiles that sum to a multiple of the key number rolled from a public array of ten tiles. &quot;Solo Sumoku&quot; tasks a player with drawing 16 tiles and creating a legal grid from them, then drawing ten more tiles and adding them to the existing grid in a legal manner, then doing this with another ten tiles, and so on through all 96 tiles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Barricades are being built in the streets, shop shelves are becoming barren, marauders are looting houses. An invisible murderer is walking through the Town &mdash; merciless, weightless, and listless. No one knows how to protect themselves against it or who is to become its next victim. Seems like the Town is doomed &mdash; yet, those of its inhabitants who are privy to the mystery of its internal structure are still trying to fight back. Their efforts and hopes are guided by the knowledge and the will of three outstanding persons.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Pathologic is an asymmetrical stealth action game intended for 2&ndash;4 players. Three of them become doctors trying to save the Town, while the fourth takes on the role of the Sand Plague. In order to complete missions the doctors have to risk themselves and their Entwined companions, but it&rsquo;s their only chance to win. The Plague remains unseen until it decides to strike&mdash;and then it strikes mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Pathologic is designed after Pathologic the videogame and strives to keep what made its predecessor special: the atmosphere a town in agony, the feeling of doom and the desperate hope of those who have nothing else left. It&rsquo;s precisely this hope that makes the three doctors pursuing the same goal become rivals. There&rsquo;s only one winner in the game, so contesting other players is unavoidable.&#10;&#10;The board game is available as a reward for backing the remake of Pathologic the video game on Kickstarter. After its release, Tabletop Pathologic will be sold separately.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher' website:&#10;&#10;Operation Anaconda, the battle fought between Coalition forces and Al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan in March of 2002. This battle was a combined US-Afghan-Coalition force attempt to surround and destroy Al Qaeda forces, but the operation fell apart owing to poor command control. While technically a Coalition victory, the battle demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.&#10;&#10;The game system is based on the &quot;Boots&quot; system, which makes command-control the central feature of the design. Each player commands a combat force composed of one or more sub-commands. These sub-commands are maneuvered via picking Command Chits at random; When a Command Chit is picked, that sub-command is then activated. Since players do not know the order in which those Command Chits are picked, battles become chaotic fights as players strive to create and exploit opportunities.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game, with one player commanding Coalition forces, and the other Al Qaeda. Combat in the game is quasi-tactical. Units fire at enemy targets at range. Additionally, the Coalition player has access to various types of fire support, such as airstrikes. However, owing to the chaotic nature of the battle, fire support as well as various reinforcements appear at random. The Al Qaeda player has the advantage of his units being deployed face down so that the Coalition player must use ISR (Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance) to reveal them. Game play becomes a tense contest between asymmetrical forces in the mountains of Afghanistan.&#10;&#10;",
