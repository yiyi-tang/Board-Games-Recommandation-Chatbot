    "Description": "Originally self published by Mike Hayes in 1974 as &quot;The Warlord&quot; - this edition came in a red box.  It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as &quot;Warlord&quot; and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.&#10;&#10;As of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Daedalus Sentence is a cooperative escape game that challenges players to use limited actions and effective communication in order to flee from their captors and escape a dangerous and ever-changing prison. Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!&#10;&#10;In the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight &quot;The Daedalus Sentence&quot;, a grim tribute to the facility's designer.&#10;&#10;As the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.&#10;&#10;The main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!&#10;&#10;Enemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.&#10;&#10;The Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group. In addition to a four player co-op game, The Daedalus Sentence can also be played one-versus-all, with a player taking the role of the labyrinth and its minions.&#10;&#10;",

Things were different then. Now there are no fights in the tavern of Tortuga, nor galleons that can be raided, nor rum because its trade is restricted. You couldn't loaf about in cities because you had a reward on your head and the shipwrecks weren't exhausted. Those days were different!&quot; Suddenly the elderly man opened his eyes and leaned over in his seat. &quot;But don't go thinking that it was an easy life! Because sailing on a pirate boat required you to sleep with a knife under the pillow or else walk the board the next day. You had to be clever to not be interfered with in a mutiny! Think about it, boy &ndash; could you do that these days?&quot;&#10;&#10;In 21 Mutinies Arrr! Edition, players try to earn victory points and money by taking different actions on the board. One player, the Captain, starts the round and decides which action is performed that round. The other players can either perform it along with the captain or mutiny to become the Captain for the next round. The game ends after 21 mutinies, i.e. 21 changes of the Captain role. Then the player with the most victory points wins the game. This version of 21 Mutinies includes event cards, a total adaptation to the pirate theme (with rum, treasures, shipwrecks, boardings, etc.), a new design, and games for two players.&#10;&#10;Be the greatest pirate on the Caribbean Sea &ndash; if your sailors let you win, that is...&#10;&#10;",

The Halls of Montezuma is a Card Driven Game, allowing players the opportunity to recreate the various events and actions in Mexico from 1846 to 1848. The historical cast of characters is here, from Doniphan to Arista, Scott to Santa Anna. Even Lee, Jackson, Beauregard and Grant make appearances.&#10;&#10;Strategy card play allows you to move your forces, make events happen, activate the fleet, secure control of your lines of communication, and even invade Mexico with General Scott.&#10;&#10;The outcome is never a foregone conclusion. Victory comes from driving Mexico's political will down to zero; but each battle's outcome is in doubt - a few troops performing superbly can defeat many troops performing poorly. Mexico can achieve a quick sudden-death victory before the U.S. has declared war and can bring its force to bear.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;        Rules booklet&#10;        Deck of 110 Strategy &amp; Action cards&#10;        One 22x34 mapsheet&#10;        Player aid cards&#10;        Quick Start card&#10;        Two 5/8-inch counter sheets (352 counters total)&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Michael Welker &amp; David Fox&#10;DEVELOPER William Cooper&#10;COUNTER ART Rodger B.

Ordinary victory city locations are shown with a box, color-coded to show the original owning faction. Replacement centers are shown by a circle in place of a box. Each front also contains one or more faction bases (hexagon shaped) which act as a special sort of city. Bases and cities within each Front are connected by Attack Lines which indicate which cities may be attacked. Finally each Front lists which armies may be deployed or moved there.&#10;&#10;The First World War can be played by 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;There are two Alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers.

    "Description": "RONE: Races of New Era is a strategic post-apocalyptic card game for 2 or 4 players. Players are immersed in a dark world full of destruction and suffering, a world where people are fighting to take back their place after a global nuclear war annihilated all achievements of the human race and all that was left was only a handful of usable resources. The remaining scattered groups of survivors are fighting amongst themselves for dominance over the remnants of the past. Now it is your turn to join the global war and recruit soldiers, battle machines, powerful hybrids, or tremendous mutants into your army. Equip your troops with the best available technologies and show all your enemies who is the ruler of the new order.&#10;&#10;Players are represented in the game by their hero and play units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from the opponent&rsquo;s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player&rsquo;s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards &ndash; from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.&#10;&#10;These combined mechanics create a well-balanced system where every erroneous move or unplanned action can lead to a player&rsquo;s defeat. Each and every decision is tightly coupled, and even a small decision can completely change the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Players have to find a balance between investing in game control, which allows them to play cards more effectively, or investing in killing the enemy hero, which is the primary goal. This means that players should control their damage output wisely. One can easily feed the enemy graveyard with destroyed cards, which may turn the game completely against them - because of the recycling system which allows players to put cards from the graveyard back on the battlefield. So, instead of dealing massive amounts of damage directly to the enemy hero, waiting sometimes has its benefits.&#10;&#10;Timing of attacks, card activation, graveyard management and tactical decisions are the real keys to victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A member of the Checkers Family.&#10;&#10;International Checkers is not to be confused with American Checkers or British Draughts due to its rule differences. It is played on a 10x10-square checker board with 20 pieces per player. This game is popular in European countries like France, The Netherlands, Russia, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy, Israel and Brazil.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10x10, or 100 squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each player.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces (the Men) can move forward on each empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the last line on the opponent's side they become Kings.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as these squares are open, in a rule known as the &quot;Flying Kings&quot;.&#10;&#10;Captures: In International Checkers, maximum captures are obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump to capture his opponent's pieces, they must take the path that will effect the most captures of their opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on the King row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be Kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on King row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can effect a capture by moving forward or backward while jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is empty. If the Man can jump again from the arrival square to effect another capture, then it must do so.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A Kinged piece can capture an opponent's piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the piece to be captured is also empty. The King can stop on any square within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of their pieces loses the game.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw:&#10;&#10;     By mutual agreement of the players.&#10;     Both players have played five moves, after a position arises of one King against two pieces, which includes a King.&#10;     Both players have played sixteen moves, after a position arises of one King against three pieces, which includes a King.&#10;     Both players have moved twenty five moves solely with Kings and not a single piece was captured.&#10;     For the third time the same position arises with the same player at move.&#10;&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com (now defunct)&#10;&#10;Online Play/Apps links can be found in the Community Wiki at the end of the page.&#10;&#10;",

The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.&#10;&#10;On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.&#10;&#10;Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.&#10;&#10;&#10;By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities. In addition, players may test their skills with several viable historical alternatives, such as the inclusion of forces that could have been available to the respective commanders.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (456 9/16&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Bitter End rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Unit Organizational Charts&#10;Two dual-side printed Historical Set-up Charts&#10;Three dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-25 hours&#10;&#10;",

But watch out, your opponents may decide it's easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystems than nurture their own. In this hectic environment, you must choose how best to protect and care for your ecologies.&#10;&#10;Designed by a biology instructor, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total)&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s all about building healthy food webs in different biomes. If you create a healthy ecology you get the perks and powers of that biome. Each organism card lists what it eats and what it&rsquo;s eaten by. You arrange them with plants on the bottom, predators on top. There is a trade mechanic similar to catan where you trade with others based on what you need and what they need. It is a race to get 12 victory points and different organisms give different points. There are factor cards that can affect opponents and different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or attacking other ecologies.&#10;&#10;The game takes inspiration from titles like Settlers of Catan, Agricola, and Dominion. Real science is integral to the game as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom it is also strategic enough for game night.&#10;&#10;The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator. There is a full rule book included with the card game that also goes over the science.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ruins: Death Binder is a 1 to 2 player board game that incorporates unique reverse deck building and dungeon crawling mechanics. This is a game where you stand against great odds with very limited resources, you do your best to survive and push forward and test different strategies. You will learn to master and manage your cards and possibilities, as the game becomes only harder with time.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses his path and delves into the dungeon filled with different events and encounters.&#10;&#10;During the game your character gains taint, more taint it gathers the stronger and more difficult enemies are sent your way. Use action cards in combinations to defeat enemies and use their weaknesses. But be aware of their strengths and different abilities.  Thin your starting deck and store cards that fit your play style to form a new, more fitting deck. Gain experience points to use rest actions and make the character your own by upgrading various traits, to make him tougher, deadlier and more capable fighter. Partake on side quests that will give you even more resources and aid.&#10;&#10;Doomsday clocks that are built into the core of the game will make you think on each step of the journey. Watch for an exhausting and limited number of action cards, ever-increasing numbers, and strength of enemies and finally, encountering a boss. In this game, even the simplest decisions may end up having a great impact on your journey.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Soulaween&rdquo; is the most bustling festival at Death School!&#10;&#10;The name derives from a proverb of the school, &ldquo;Soul to win&rdquo;, which means reaping souls to claim victory. Legend has it, that long ago at Death School there was an accident, causing souls to flee and disperse in chaos. The teachers and students took it as a race, competing the speed of recollecting souls, and solved the crisis of the realm of death. This year, Papa Death, Osiris, Hei &amp; Bai Wuchang along with their trainees converge in &ldquo;Soulaween&rdquo;, with Teacher Vulture as their judge, are ready to engage in the rival of &ldquo;reaping souls&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;!&#10;&#10;Soulaween is a 2-player board game that features simple yet tricky rules and variable player powers. During the game, each player acts as a trainee of the death god, whose goal is to reap the fleeing souls by &ldquo;putting&rdquo; and &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; the soul pieces. Whoever gets 3 sets of souls becomes the winner of &ldquo;Soulaween&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;Soulaween&#227;&#128;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#229;&#173;&#184;&#230;&#160;&#161;&#229;&#133;&#167;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#134;&#177;&#233;&#172;&#167;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#165;&#173;&#229;&#133;&#184;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#231;&#168;&#177;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#188;&#229;&#173;&#184;&#230;&#160;&#161;&#229;&#133;&#167;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#229;&#130;&#179;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#171;&#186;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#140;Soul

    "Description": "6 nimmt! Brettspiel retains the central element of the 6 nimmt! card game: Each player reveals a card from their hand at the same time, then the cards are added to a central display with players possibly being penalized should their card end up in the wrong location.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes tiles numbered 1-100, and each player receives a hand of twelve tiles. Four tiles are revealed at random and placed in the first position of the first four rows on the game board. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, then reveals them all at the same time, with the tiles being added to the game board from lowest number to highest. A tile is placed in a row to the right of a tile with a lower value, with the smallest difference between tiles mattering should multiple options be available. (For example, a 16 would be placed to the right of 14 and not 7 should both of those numbers be present in different rows.) If a tile is lower than all rightmost tiles, then you place it to the right of the tile with the highest value.&#10;&#10;If the tile is placed on a space with a positive or negative bullhead symbol, the player gains or loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their played tile. If the tile fills the final spot in a row, then the player loses points equal to the sum of bullheads on all other cards in this row, then this card is moved down the game board to the first position in the highest empty row.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has played all of their tiles &mdash; or in a two- or three-player game, refilled their hand, then played through a second set of twelve tiles &mdash; the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;If you like, you can play 6 nimmt! Brettspiel with &quot;good luck cards&quot;. Whenever you score negative points, you draw such a card from the deck. These cards either convert a non-final row space on the game board to +5 points (instead of whatever it was) or convert a final row space to a bonus that might end up netting you points instead of losing them.&#10;&#10;On the back of the 6 nimmt! Brettspiel game board is a second board to be used with the &quot;professional version&quot; of the game. In addition to the &plusmn;bullhead spaces, this board has spaces that force you to draw a new tile, claim all the tiles in a row (instead of scoring negative points), or draw an action card. These action cards let you play anywhere, swap your played tile for another from your hand, skip to the front line, and more. This version can be played with or without the &quot;good luck cards&quot;. When one player is out of tiles, players lose points for the bullheads on tiles still in hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game, planes from the First World War meet in a battle. Simple rules of movement and firing include all the most important features of the aircraft of the time: speed, agility and firepower. Battles are fought at five different altitudes, so there are differences between the planes in terms of climbing and descending speeds. Some specific characteristics were also taken into account, such as gyroscopic effect, which gives some aircraft exceptional maneuverability. Wind influences movement and the position of the sun affects firing accuracy, so these factors are also taken into account. A plane under attack can escape into the clouds and thus hide from the enemy. Most of the pilots are average, but there are also rookies and aces.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It is about an initiation trial where you and your fellow initiates have to prove that you are worthy of your tribe's legendary animal's, the Jaguar's power.&#10;&#10;The Jaguar was the defender of the tribe in the ancient times, but on a fateful day it got struck by a terrible curse and was broken into crystal shards.&#10;&#10;The Shards of the Jaguar are still to be found in the Sacred Temple among the mountains, and the initiation trial is about to seek them and incorporate their power. But your journey will not be that easy. The temple is filled with perilous traps, and you have to learn how to use them, if you want to acquire the Jaguar&rsquo;s hunting instinct.&#10;&#10;Try to foresee what the others will do and set clever traps against them. Collect precious crystal shards, mystical amulets and map pieces leading to the Heart of the Jaguar. Outsmart the others and be the best in this trial to become the heir of the Jaguar, the defender of the tribe!&#10;&#10;Shards of the Jaguar has eight rounds, and in each round, each player sets a trap secretly (Poisonous Gas/Darts/Guards/Earthquake), and then each player moves their character in the temple spending action points. You can move, take crystal shards, perform rituals and heal yourself in your turn for the action points. But move carefully! Each space on the game board could contain a secret trap - activated by another player - so you have to pay attention to each other's movements to be able to find out which traps will be activated and so which spaces are safe for that round.&#10;&#10;After each player spent their action points, you activate the traps and check who got hit by them (gathering different negative effects). If you were able to hit another player with your trap, you get glory points, as you are worthy of the Jaguar's hunting instinct. At the end of the game you count the points you get for the crystal shards, the glory points for the successful traps, and the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A description by Phalanx's Uli Blennemann from &quot;Gone Cardboard&quot;&#10;&#10;It is a completely new game, much lighter in complexity. The game uses a large gameboard, comes in our big box and is for 2-5 players. Playing time is 75+ minutes. It is not a simulation game but provides more Alex flavor than Alexandros. Each turn, players move with their armies (wooden) and build cities and temples (both wooden, too).&#10;&#10;In this game, players follow the path of Alexander's army, occupying provinces in regions, building temples, founding cities. You score points each round and also at the end of the game for majorities. There are 5 regions, but for the short game you just use #2 to #4.&#10;&#10;Players have 15 tiny wood cubes which they distribute each round on a hidden plan in 4 ways. Then they reveal their choices and carry out the actions. This way they decide 1. turn order 2. army size 3. temple building 4. city building. By putting more cubes than others in the sections controls how the round works for you.&#10;&#10;So the player with the most cubes in 1. gets to choose their turn order (since going later may be better). Then the cubes in 2. become your army on the board (and having majorities in provinces scores 2 pts). Moving the armies around costs cubes as well, which are taken from 3. and 4. Then, where your soldiers are, you can build temples (3.) or found cities (4.). But if another player is also doing the same, whoever has the most cubes on their plan gets it, but pays 1 more than the second highest.&#10;&#10;In this way, players spend their 15 cubes each round, moving from province to province in the region, trying to score points for controlling armies, building temples and cities. Where players directly compete, the costs are high. Where you are unopposed, your unspent cubes carry on to the next round, allowing you to try to get more points.&#10;&#10;When the last region is conquered, there is a final scoring, for the majorities of temples and cities in each region and then in the whole game. The scoring switches here, since in the rounds temples earn you 3pts &amp; cities earn 5pts. But at game end, cities earn 10pts and temples earn 15pts.&#10;&#10;The game is a mix of planning, bluff, tactics and group think. It works as a contest of majorities and the use of the cubes, in both deciding who goes and what things cost, is clever.&#10;&#10;",

Modern technology is no longer available, and the entirety of the northern hemisphere becomes a desolate hellscape as a result of the ensuing solar storms. &#10;Society&rsquo;s rules and regulations are replaced by anarchy, and every day becomes a struggle for survival.&#10;&#10;As gameplay commences, you will become an integral member of one of the few remaining honorable and socially-minded communities. Players will choose between four unique characters (six with expansions), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and will head into the wastelands to ensure the survival of the group and fulfill crucial tasks. The game can be played with a fully-cooperative approach, or to make things extra interesting, there could also be a traitor within the group. &#10;Choose one of the four missions included in the core box, which are varied according to difficulty, play-time, and strategic approach. &#10; Under our Sun has a turn-based gameplay where each round represents a single day divided into different phases (morning, noon, evening, and night). Explore the area, tile by tile, to trigger events scattered throughout the map. Find precious loot and scavenge for resources to craft unique items in an effort to upgrade both your character and shelter. Engage in life or death fights against humans, animals, or something completely unknown. Adapt to ever changing weather conditions where even the most elementary of tasks results in a fight for survival.&#10;&#10;To succeed in this harsh land, players must manage resources, maintain their health, and ensure adequate water supply. Only through collaboration and the use of individual skills, will players be able to achieve survival and reach their ultimate goal (whatever that may be). &#10; Dive into the thrilling and complex world of &ldquo;Under our Sun,&rdquo; and become one of earth&rsquo;s final survivors!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A color based card game where players try to track the number of cards played in each color vs.  a limit card with maximums for each color.  Successful challenges result in points for the winner and penalties for the loser.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Deal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).&#10;&#10;Challenging: may &quot;call&quot; any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.&#10;&#10;After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).&#10;&#10;Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card. OR, if you have a set of 4 matching cards, you may draw 2, then discard 2 of the matches and place the other 2 matches on top of the draw deck; take a +1 VP card bonus.&#10;&#10;Game ends after all Limit cards have been played; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Columba, you'll build dovecotes, breed pigeons, expand your territory, and &ndash; above all else &ndash; avoid your opponents' falcons. Players start with 2-4 dovecotes depending on the number of players, and they use them during the game to claim flocks as their own. (The larger dovecote doubles the score of the flock claimed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players need to catch one pigeon of each of the four breeds, after which that goal will be replaced by a new one. The starting player reveals the first tile, places it on the table, then draws another tile and tries to capture pigeons to fulfill his goal. To catch a pigeon, you must place a tile so that it covers the square or squares with the pigeon(s) you need. You may capture pigeons only if you need them; you cannot catch pigeons which belong to a flock already claimed by an opponent, but you can (re)catch pigeons from your or your team's flocks. You receive a tile for each pigeon captured and place those tiles on your goal card.&#10;&#10;When you fill a goal tile, you place the tiles on it on your mat, optionally take a new goal card, play the now-freed goal card, then place the tiles on your mat wherever you wish to make one of your (or your partner's) flocks bigger, provided either of you have already built a dovecote to claim a particular flock as your own.&#10;&#10;You can also use the tiles to breed falcons. You need to discard two of them to get a baby falcon and two more on a subsequent turn to have it grow into an adult falcon that you can then send to prey on your opponents' flock and make it smaller.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more goal cards can be drawn; any player with an unfulfilled goal card loses four points. Each player counts the tiles or squares forming the flocks claimed by their dovecotes, and the player or team with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mountaineers is a strategic board game in which 1-4 players (up to 6 with the Deluxe or Collector's edition) compete against each other and AI climbers to earn climbing points (victory points) as they maneuver around a 18 in./45 cm tall rotating 3D modular game board. The theme of Mountaineers is lighthearted and fun, primarily focused on competitive route finding, resource management, character building and upgrades, while challenging players to react to various exciting (and sometimes comical) events that occur on the mountain.&#10;&#10;Strategy during both set-up and game play is important. At the beginning of a game, players need to choose four climbing routes, one character, and a starting position that work well together, in order to earn the maximum amount of points possible. However, as the game progresses, the mountain terrains fill up, making it more difficult to complete certain climbing routes. Additionally, various mountain conditions change (once per player), and event cards (drawn on each turn) require players to adapt their strategy, change their climbing routes, and purchase various combinations of gear upgrades to continue climbing.&#10;&#10;Resource management is important as players start with a limited number of thirty route markers and will on average draw only sixty supply tokens during a game. Depending on the game and the various difficulty of event cards used, players have to balance how often they spend supplies and route markers in order to climb efficiently and complete routes. Climbing strategy is also important. Players must be careful in what order they complete routes, how they maneuver on the mountain, and whether or not they pay extra to &quot;lock in&quot; certain route markers to avoid sabotage by other players.&#10;&#10;A typical turn involves drawing an event card, resolving the conditions of the event card (which may apply to other players), saving the event card for later use with your character, performing 0 to 2 regular actions, 0 to 1 special actions (if available), and special character actions (as allowed). Games with 1 to 4 players last ten rounds, each player drawing a total of ten event cards, and 5 to 6 player games last for eight rounds (with eight event cards/player). For 1 to 2 player games (and more challenging 3 to 5 player games), an &quot;AI&quot; mechanism can cause &quot;automated climbers&quot; to move around the mountain, placing route markers and blocking/sabotaging players. Players can also substitute more difficult event cards into the game, creating more flavor and challenge. The goal of a 2-6 player game is to have the most victory points at game end, and the goal of a one-player game is to have 55 victory points and four climbing routes complete at game's end.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;While Mountaineers has a similar 3D appearance to its predecessor The Mountaineer, it is a vastly different game. For example, The Mountaineer was a roll-and-move game that required resource trading between players and had a large luck element. On the other hand, Mountaineers offers freedom and interesting choices to players every turn as players can choose when and how much to climb, and are not restricted by a luck element. Additionally, Mountaineers allows players to &quot;lock&quot; their routes, and provides mechanisms for advanced climbing techniques.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Z War One is the world's first episodic, comic book miniature board game. It blends classic survival horror &amp; RPG themes with intense tactical combat, to provide a cinematic and truly unique gaming experience.&#10;&#10;The Z War One Issue #1 box set contains the extended first issue of the comic, along with the base set of models &amp; boards you need to start playing the game. Each subsequent comic book acts as an expansion pack, continuing the game's epic story, whilst introducing new miniatures, game mechanics &amp; environments along the way.&#10;&#10;Players take control of one of 4 main protaganists, completing chapters &amp; gaining vital experience points, with which they must upgrade their character if they are to have any hope of surviving the increasingly nightmarish scenarios.&#10;&#10;In addition to the game's co-operative comic book campaign, the quick-play &quot;Director Mode&quot; allows one player to connect with their devious side, using director cards to stack the odds in favour of the infected hordes!&#10;&#10;Although there are multiple ways in which Z War One can be played, the real heart of the game lies in it's 1-4 player co-operative comic book campaign. The Season One 6 issue campaign is made up of 26 exciting chapters, with the climax of each chapter taking place on the game board. The cinematic mood created by the comic carries through directly into the game play, as time limits &amp; set pieces drive the story forward at a breakneck pace. The missions themselves, whilst working from the same core set of game mechanics, vary widely in tone, from exploration &amp; tense survival horror to all-out pitched battles and daring escapes.&#10;&#10;Whilst the co-operative campaign is by no means easy, for more experienced players, there is the &quot;Directors Cut&quot; which adds game play elements from the quick play &quot;Director Mode&quot; to the campaign, essentially allowing a 5th player to participate and make life hell for the heroes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Espa&ntilde;a 20 features four complete games covering key battles fought over control of the Iberian Peninsula: Bail&eacute;n, Talavera, Arapiles, and Bussaco.&#10;&#10;Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&ntilde;os&rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s Corps d&rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.&#10;&#10;Considered one of Wellington&rsquo;s finest battles, Arapiles 20 (July, 1812) from Lance McMillan focuses on the hard-fought meeting engagement between his veteran British forces and Mareschal Marmont&rsquo;s French army in the hills south of Salamanca. With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.&#10;&#10;Rudi Garcia's Talavera 20 recreates the major battle which occurred near the city of Talavera de la Reina on 27 to 28 July 1809. One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail. As the French, can you find and exploit a weak spot in the allied lines? As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?&#10;&#10;Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal. One player commands the French army of Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na, while the other controls Sir Arthur Wellesley, Viscount of Wellington's combined British and reconstituted Portuguese army. Historically, a distracted Mass&eacute;na launched a series of uncoordinated frontal assaults straight up a steep ridge into the teeth of the British defenses, suffering heavy losses before Wellington elected to disengage and fall back to Lisbon. Can you as Mass&eacute;na avoid the same mistakes, or as Wellington can you use your superior position to achieve a decisive victory?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description &#10;In the new game Eaten By Zombies! players strive to survive as the horde of the living dead make it their goal in Death to force you to join the crowd. You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing.  No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.&#10;&#10;In the spirit of AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.&#10;&#10;If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind.   With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not.  But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!&#10;&#10;With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.&#10;&#10;Game Play/Mechanics &#10;You start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee &amp; Draw one card).  You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand.  You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4.  You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;If you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a &quot;buy&quot;) where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck.  Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.&#10;&#10;If you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.&#10;&#10;If you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.&#10;&#10;It isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.  If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.&#10;&#10;This is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom.  You spend the first few turns building up your deck only to see the zombies increase in power and slowly drain your will to live as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Eaten By Zombies!: In Cahoots&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The cards represent new elements that the players discover, and when the board has the proper form, the player reveals from his hand the element he/she discovered and adds the card to his/her pile of earned points.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;The game ends when a player can no longer draw more cards. &#10;The winner is the player with the most points or, in case of a tie, the one that discovered more elements that are next to each other in the Periodic Table of the Elements (chairs not included).&#10;&#10;Greek description:&#10;&Mu;&iota;&alpha; &omicron;&mu;&#206;&#172;&delta;&alpha; &tau;&rho;&epsilon;&lambda;&#207;&#142;&nu; &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&mu;&#207;&#140;&nu;&omega;&nu;, &eta; &omicron;&pi;&omicron;&#206;&#175;&alpha; &delta;&epsilon;&nu; &#206;&#173;&chi;&epsilon;&iota; &iota;&delta;&#206;&#173;&alpha; &alpha;&pi;&#207;&#140; &Chi;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&alpha;, &pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&pi;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&#206;&#175; &nu;&alpha; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&chi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&#206;&#175;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &#206;&#173;&nu;&alpha; &mu;&#207;&#140;&rho;&iota;&omicron; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &nu;&alpha; &delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#206;&#174;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &alpha;&pi;&#207;&#140; &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#207;&#140; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&#207;&#141;&rho;&iota;&alpha; &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&alpha;, &alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#206;&#172;&hellip; &tau;&alpha; &theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&#207;&#142;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;! &#10;&Mu;&eta;&nu; &alpha;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&upsilon;&chi;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&tau;&epsilon; &alpha;&nu; &eta; &Chi;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&alpha; &delta;&epsilon;&nu; &epsilon;&#206;&#175;&nu;&alpha;&iota; &tau;&omicron; &delta;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&#207;&#140; &sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf; &sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&omicron;, &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#207;&#142;&sigmaf; &sigma;&tau;&omicron; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;&#206;&#175;&delta;&iota; &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#207;&#140; &delta;&epsilon;&nu; &pi;&rho;&#207;&#140;&kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&alpha;&iota; &nu;&alpha; &epsilon;&xi;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&tau;&epsilon; &gamma;&iota;&alpha; &tau;&eta;&nu; &omicron;&rho;&theta;&#207;&#140;&tau;&eta;&tau;&alpha; &tau;&omega;&nu; &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&omega;&nu; &pi;&omicron;&upsilon; &delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&epsilon;&#206;&#175;&tau;&epsilon;, &tau;&omicron; &alpha;&nu;&tau;&#206;&#175;&theta;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron; &mu;&#206;&#172;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&hellip; &Pi;&omicron;&#207;&#141; &xi;&#206;&#173;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon; &mu;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&epsilon;&#206;&#175; &nu;&alpha; &pi;&#206;&#172;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &Nu;&#207;&#140;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&lambda; &gamma;&iota;&alpha; &tau;&eta;&nu; &alpha;&nu;&alpha;&kappa;&#206;&#172;&lambda;&upsilon;&psi;&#206;&#174; &sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf;!&#10;&#10;",

Just grab some fellow gamers and discover the rules while playing. The Fast Forward series uses the Fable Game system introduced in Fabled Fruit: With the presorted deck of cards, you will discover all cards and rules as you play. It will take 10-15 games of FORTUNE before your group has explored the entire system. It can then be reset and played again by the same or different groups!&#10;&#10;FORTUNE is the fourth and completely different game in the Fast Forward series!&#10;&#10;",

There is no need for additional supplements or game cards.&#10;&#10;By utilizing half-a-dozen or so six-sided dice (d6), about a dozen 10-sided dice (d10), a tape-measure and a standard set of playing cards, this was the first published set of rules to incorporate:&#10;&#10;- Variable move distance&#10;    - Specific casualty determination&#10;    - Random movement and firing sequence&#10;&#10;Figures are individually mounted, but movement, morale and combat is by the unit, with the basic unit being the 20 figures infantry platoon (or Pathan clan, Zulu Iviyo, Dervish warband), 12 figures for a cavalry troop and 4 figures for an artillery battery. Units are then added to make larger forces (company, battalion, Pathan/Dervish tribe, Zulu Ibutho, Boer Commando, and cavalry squadron). Each unit has an identifiable command figure.&#10;&#10;TSATF has been described as a semi-skirmish game. Unit movement is determined by die roll, different types of units under different circumstances rolling differing numbers of six-sided dice. Random card draws decide which units move first, and also determine the effects of fire and combat.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Sword and the Flame 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;&#10;Included in the updated 20th Anniversary Edition are many new features such as Pinning defenders, Two ranks firing, Overhead fire, Pass-through fire, Limited ammunition, Volley and independent fire, and a Rules synopsis page. The 20th Anniversary Edition is an improvement over the original edition.&#10;&#10;The Sword and the Flame is designed for use with 25mm figures, but it can be easily suited for 15mm and 20mm miniatures.&#10;&#10;",

Loot is lifted from the mark by playing one of five action cards, most of which work best when played alone. But tread carefully: while many pieces of loot have unique abilities that can affect the game, each carries a suspicion value. So when Constable Cramphorn is revealed from the last ten cards of the loot deck, the player with the highest suspicion score is apprehended, leaving the rest to compare the value of their ill-gotten gains to determine who is the most dirty and rotten of the Scoundrel Society.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's web page (Medieval):&#10;&#10;Medieval is a card-based board game that takes players back to the turbulent 13th century in Europe, Middle East and North Africa. The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.&#10;&#10;Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.&#10;&#10;And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).&#10;&#10;But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.&#10;&#10;Medieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system. It comes with 110 cards, lots of little pieces, and coin-shaped florin markers.&#10;&#10;",

An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined the two games support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;96 cards (3 sets of 32 different cards)&#10;1 rules sheet&#10;&#10;",

Fluff features palm-fitted rolling cups for poker-style peeking, and critter-adorned dice for &quot;wild-style&quot; play to inspire bolder bidding. Fluff up the bids, or challenge the calls. Be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.&#10;&#10;Each player places dice in their cup and gives them a good shake. Take a peek at the dice. Your goal is to &quot;call&quot; the total number of a particular dice across all the hands at the table. So the first player places a bid, such as &quot;I think there are 4 threes across all hands.&quot; Player to the left increases the bid or calls. You can only raise the value of the last bid by either increasing the value or quantity. So if I'm the next player, I can say 5 THREES, or keep the quantity the same and raise the value to 4 FOURS.&#10;&#10;Your other option is to call &quot;Fluff!&quot; on the existing bid. Say I bid &quot;9 FIVES&quot; and you have no fives. You might think I'm bananas, so you call &quot;Fluff!&quot; All players reveal their dice. If there are 9 FIVES or more, you would lose a die. If there are fewer than 9 FIVES, I lose a die, and I'm sad. You may also call &quot;Fluff!&quot; when it's not your turn, but you will lose two dice if you're wrong and the bidder still loses only 1 if you're right. It's risky and frisky!&#10;&#10;When you lose a die, set it aside for all to see, and start fresh with a new roll. The person who lost the die starts the next round with the opening bid.&#10;&#10;When you lose your last die, you're out. Now you're sad, too. Play continues until only one player has dice left. That player wins and may celebrate in any way they choose.&#10;&#10;So be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.&#10;&#10;",

Celebrated by many as &ldquo;Afrika Korps done right,&rdquo; this two-player game allows players to explore the key elements of the Desert War, beginning in December 1940 with Wavell&rsquo;s first offensive, Operation Compass, against the Italian forces of Marshal Graziani, and culminating in December 1942 when the Americans landed in Rommel&rsquo;s rear, thus sealing the ultimate fate of the Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;The African Campaign re-creates the ebb and flow of battle and wide-swinging action in the desert as the pendulum swings with both sides launching major offensives during the North African Campaign. Game play is swift thanks to the low counter density while capturing the key facets of the campaign including supply, ports, replacements, Axis fuel, strategic movement, air power, flak units, minefields, and more.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides an updated treatment to the Jedko 2nd Edition release and includes known errata along with new optional rules and variants as published in Panzerfaust/Campaign #74 (July-Aug 1976). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage to the original classic design by John Edwards. While the standard game remains true to the original, we&rsquo;ve added bonus material to explore other facets of the War in the Desert without sacrificing game playability. All components are upgraded to include a larger playing surface (1.5 maps) and 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting, to be enjoyed by both grognards and newcomers alike.&#10;&#10;",

Artifacts and Companions add powerful abilities and increased damage against the Rival. Forms offer a bit of both, and are necessary to face the Rival.&#10;&#10;Each turn advances the clock, bringing the player into direct conflict with their Rival. Once the Ethereal Row begins to run out of cards, the Rival acts either by gaining an elemental Form or by dealing damage. If the player&rsquo;s character survives this initial strike, they may spend Shards to deal damage in return. Damage inflicted persists if the Rival is not defeated, but there are only so many chances to win: each time the Rival acts, they tick down the number of actions they have remaining. The player must deal sufficient damage to the Rival before they use their last action to secure victory!&#10;&#10;&#10;A fantasy-themed spiritual successor for SpaceShipped, set in the Earthshine universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this brain-burner from the Kosmos two-player series, players try to protect their own trees and steal their opponents'. Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possibly hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.&#10;&#10;Druidenwalzer is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

It's the perfect calm before the storm: welcome to the Sakura Slam!&#10;&#10;In this standalone sequel to Kabuto Sumo, players return as the wrestling Kabutomushi (&quot;helmet bugs&quot;) and compete to knock off their opponents on an all-new square arena. The coin-pushing mechanic returns, but with a new platform, characters, pillars, and powers.&#10;&#10;New Arena Features:&#10;&#10;NOTCHED PUSHING PLATFORM&#10;In Sakura Slam, you must push from the corners of the arena. That makes it harder to focus completely on defense, as you can&rsquo;t always push your piece away from the edge&mdash;this means less stalemates and more body slams.&#10;&#10;FIXED CORNERS&#10;Four fixed corner posts loom over each match. Using these posts, can you better predict how an aggressive maneuver will play out? Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re near the edge: can you &ldquo;rope-a-dope&rdquo; and use the post defensively?&#10;&#10;TAGGING CORNERS&#10;When you push from a corner you haven&rsquo;t pushed from before, you place a marker, &quot;tagging&quot; that corner. Place one on each of the four posts to take a second push action immediately.&#10;&#10;Will you try and activate this power every four turns? Or, will you save one corner un-tagged until you have the perfect, epic, game-winning setup created?&#10;&#10;All but two characters are compatible with the original Kabuto Sumo.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Supershow  is a wrestling tabletop dice and card game for 2 - 6 players. Supershow is the worlds first UCG, or Unpredictable Card Game, that takes place in the underground wrestling world of the Legendary Fighting Federation. The goal of the game is to hit your finish card for a chance to defeat your opponent.&#10;&#10;The Supershow gives players the back and forth excitement of a live wrestling match using its unique turn structure. Players attempt to build up to their Finish cards by using Lead and Follow-up cards. Once you hit one of your three devastating Finish cards, you will attempt to keep your opponent down for the three-count. If your breaks out of your finish, the crowd's excitement goes up, and the next finish is more likely to end the high-energy match. The simplicity of the rules allows games to last just 5 - 10 minutes, while still being highly competitive and too exciting to just have one match.&#10;&#10;The Supershow also has mechanics for multiplayer formats: three-way, four-way, 2-4 player tag team, and tornado tag team. Each format can be elimination style or first to Finish. This is on top of different match types (stipulations) that are played with no additional purchases, such as escape the cage or submission match.&#10;&#10;With over 90+ players at the Supershow World Championship at GenCon 2017, the Supershow is more than a game you play with some friends; it's a community of players competing year-round to have the bragging rights of World Champion. The founders of SRG Universe are life-long gaming and wrestling fans and treat the Supershow as a wrestling promotion.&#10;&#10;",

In a new regeneration, you are standing at the console of your TARDIS as it flies through the Time Vortex.&quot;&#10;&#10;This web-published game is played using four booklets: Rules, Adventures, Enemies, and Events. Two six-sided dice are also required. all the Booklets, plus expansions and support materials are in the Files section below.&#10;&#10;An Adventure begins when the TARDIS lands at a location, be it modern-day London, the wilds of Sherwood Forest, or the distant planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius. Through actions such as Explore and Investigate, references in the Adventure book will lead you to paragraphs in the Events book, allowing you to gather Allies and discover the plots that are in progress. Eventually you will reveal the Enemy, each of which has its own 1-page section in the Enemy book explaining how you might discover their dastardly Goal. New Actions then open up, allowing you to Plan, Research, and (hopefully) defeat the Enemy. If you fail to reveal and Defeat the Enemy within 12 Turns, the Doctor is killed - maybe your next regeneration will do better (or at least be better dressed)!&#10;&#10;The 2nd Edition is currently being developed, incorporating material from the 1st Edition and selected expansions, as well as 12th Doctor material and all-new content.&#10;&#10;SC Games is a fan-based group which makes unofficial games purely as a labour of love.

Up to four players control the Prussian, Austrian and Russian forces commanded by Feldmarschall Carl zu Schwarzenberg, while up to a further four command such French personages as Marshals Ney, Marmont, Mortier, Victor, St. Cyr, or Napoleon himself.

Although greatly outnumbered, the British dominated by outmaneuvering the Italians with their superior armored vehicles. In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.&#10;&#10;On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.&#10;&#10;The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941&#10;&#10;The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The GameBeda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming. This fast-playing, operational-level game of the Battle of Beda Fomm represents a classic blend of simple gaming mechanics with nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.&#10; Relive the drama as the British player, maneuvering your outnumbered but superior armored vehicles and supporting personnel and weapon units to cut-off and summarily destroy the retreating Italian forces. As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction. Simple mechanics capture the flavor of desert warfare along with the unique qualities and characteristics of the opposing forces.&#10;&#10;This Consim Press edition represents a re-mastering of the original release by introducing many enhancements while remaining true to the original game design.
