B&eacute;cquer vs. Irving is also the third game of the saga Las Ligas de la &Ntilde; (The Leagues of the &Ntilde;).&#10;&#10;This collection of games includes:&#10;&#10;     Role-Playing Game. The game&acute;s director rules; the players abide. Learn to be a role master and put the players to the test, making them face stories and rules of your own creation. Once the game is finished the game&acute;s director will choose the best player or team.&#10;     Four Houses. You will be a member of one of the four houses (Chalice, Raven, Lion and Fire). You can be loyal, a mercenary or a traitor.  Speak, negotiate and save your cards to accomplish your goals and make more points than your rivals. You can either be a part of a team or follow your own path.&#10;     Survival.  Make sure you know the game&acute;s characters to survive and make it as far as possible in the game. Sometimes you will need to solve mysteries, or just choose between different paths; from time to time you will get rewards. Prepare to face B&eacute;cquer-Irving &acute;s wrath if you make the wrong choices. &#10;     Questions. Face different questions about the B&eacute;cquer-Irving universe. &#10;     Storytellers. Create your own stories emulating B&eacute;cquer, Irving and other &Ntilde; writers. &#10;     Contest13. Earn category points using the &Ntilde; value to get at least 13 points in one category. Try to remember the cards included in the decks of all players. If you believe you have achieved the necessary 13 points in one category (Wisdom, Seduction, Politics, Dark force&hellip;), check them.  If you do not have 13, you will lose all your cards and will need to start the game from scratch. It is a memory and mathematics game. In this game you will learn to use the categories of every card and the &Ntilde; value. &#10;     Ultimate Trophy. Are you the chosen one? To win the B&eacute;cquer vs Irving Ultimate Trophy you will need to add up more points than your opponents once the six games are finished.  Also, you will be put through a final test: a ten question quiz, they will be selected randomly and you will need to get at least five right. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    B&eacute;cquer vs Irving accepts, to facilitate the game&acute;s playability, any card from any of the two last games (Las Ligas de la &Ntilde; and Las Ligas de la &Ntilde; Galaxia MusiChess.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

After all, powerful diesel engines propel them as fast, if not faster, than many escort ships in a convoy when surfaced.&#10;&#10;The bonus for a submarine is, of course, being able to vanish by diving, hiding from escorts to ambush the merchantmen at will.&#10;&#10;The disadvantage of being submerged is the slow speed and the fact you are often blind to what is going on at the surface, that&rsquo;s when the game of cat and mouse begins!&#10;&#10;Run Silent, Run Deep is an unofficial expansion to Cruel Seas that expands upon the submarine rules presented in the core book. Track the depth and position of your submarine with a series of easy to read markers. Send your opponent off on a wild goose chase, haring after shadows and transients while your submarine slips through his defensive line to attack lumbering merchantmen.&#10;&#10;While games on the surface are a breakneck affair with chattering cannons and exploding shells, Run Silent, Run Deep is a game of stealth and patience - building to a nail-biting finale when escort and submarine clash one-on-one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of the 2019 set golfers are unique and will perform according to various individual golf statistics provided they play a similar golf schedule as in real life. Each golfer was rated for their driving ability, ability to hit greens, short game and putting. The courses have been rated for each round of play and each hole, based on the 2019 statistics. This helps capture easy or tough pin placements; good or bad weather conditions and easy or hard holes in general.&#10;&#10;Made the Cut! includes a risk/reward strategy option for the player when taking approach shots to the Green. You can choose to play standard, with no adjustments to the Golfer card or you can choose to Pin Hunt (PH) or Safe Play (SP).  PH reduces golfer&rsquo;s chance to hit the green in regulation, but if they do, the golfer has a greater chance of sinking the putt. However, a missed Green is on the &ldquo;wrong side&quot;, adding pressure to golfer&rsquo;s Short Game play. On the other hand, a golfer choosing to SP will find it easier to hit the green in regulation, but leave a longer than normal putt. However, a missed Green is on the &ldquo;right side&rdquo;, taking pressure away from golfer's Short Game play.&#10;&#10;Play a single golfer through his 2019 PGA Tour schedule, maybe just a handful of contenders or all players that Made the Cut! Play only the Majors, a handful of events or the entire season.&#10;&#10;The 2019 PGA Season Set includes approximately 260 golfers who earned at least a single Fedex point throughout the 2019 season AND played enough holes to record accurate statistics. It also includes courses and tournament information for all 44 events played out each weekend of the 2019 PGA Season, including complete fields!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If a player gets onto a service point (spacees 1 to 6) he has to pay with a Service coupon of which the players have 6 at the beginning of the game. The fee podger uses the service points without paying. When the fee dodger uses the second service station, all other players start to pursue him. Only at this point the attendant enters the game too. If a player captures the fee dodger he gets 1 point and the fee dodger starts again on space 16.&#10;&#10;The game ends, when all players have used all 6 of their coupons and the fee dodger is captured for the last time.

The game introduces four influential black Brazilian women on three types of cards: One shows an image, others show biographical information, and some have poems about the women. The poems were written by Brazilian author Jarrid Arraes, whose book Hero&iacute;nas negras brasileiras was an inspiration for the game.&#10;&#10;Each group of students gets an image card and has to research the life of that respective personality (there is a QR code on the image cards which leads to a page with information). After the research phase, each group receives three random cards. The goal is to have a set of cards which all belong to their initial personality. But the poem and biography cards do not show the name of the personality, the students have to figure out which information or poem belongs to their character. The groups can exchange cards with a drawpile or with an open display of cards. Whichever group gets a full set first, wins. &#10;A competitive mode is also included. In this mode, the teacher teaches about one personality, then deals out the cards to the students who have to figure out which cards belong to the character they learned about.&#10;The game is available to teachers as a free print and play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Everyone knows Robin Hood. &#10;Outlaws of Sherwood lets you play the tales of the legendary outlaw and his dastardly foes, from one-on-one fights to whole campaigns with multiple forces. You can raise your own outlaw band, or become a proud knight with his retinue of men-at-arms. &#10;As Robin you can win archery contests, disguise yourself in unlikely ways, and get knocked off a log by people you just met. As the wicked sheriff, you can oppress the peasants, chase Merry Men through the Greenwood, and do that evil laugh you always wanted to do.&#10;&#10;The core rules are simple, designed for new wargamers of all ages to pick up and play. &#10;A card deck decides who moves next. &#10;You can play other special cards to &ndash; say &ndash; dress up as a washerwoman and have nobody say you aren't. &#10;Combat is based on PAL's card version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where you can jump back or leap aside from a blow, or taunt your opponent with insults.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow for personalising your own 'faction' for good or evil, and developing your characters and their followings through a series of games.&#10;&#10;We include a whole set of scenarios, from simple 'starter' encounters to full-blown multi-player battles. &#10;You can play out a full ongoing campaign where your heroes and their followers gain success and reputation &ndash; or don't. And, if you want to take the outlaw motif beyond Sherwood, the campaign system can be moved to the Scots or Welsh borders, the marshes of East Anglia, or Ireland.&#10;&#10;There's a history of the real Robin Hood, sources for figures, and a listing of books, movies and television shows.&#10;&#10;If you want to rob from the rich and give to the poor, or simply keep it all yourself, Outlaws of Sherwood is the game for you!&#10;&#10;The PDF version of the game includes the Special Action Cards and the PAL Medieval action Deck, giving you all the components you need to play the game (minus figures, terrain, dice, a table and a opponents).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle Troll, game of Icelandic Sagas.&#10;&#10;The man thrust at Gisli with a spear, but Gisli struck off the spear-head from the shaft with his axe, and the blow was so stout that the axe passed on to the rock beneath, and one horn of the edge broke off. Then he throws away the axe and clutches his sword and fights with it, and shields himself with his shield. They attack him bravely, but he kept them off like a man...&#10;&#10;- The Saga of Gisli Sursson&#10;&#10;The world of the sagas is a world of proud and irascible men with touchy tempers and big axes, and how their bad manners as tourists are matched by an astonishing inability to get along with the neighbors. It&rsquo;s like the Wild West, without the schoolmarm and the preacher, held on a cold windy coastline.&#10;&#10;It's about blood-feuds, and raids, and quarrels, and blood-feuds, and stealing other people's stuff and taking one another to the rowdiest courts in the world, and blood-feuds, and being exiled to the far-flung reaches of the world and behaving just as badly there. It's about visiting other lands, meeting interesting people, and hacking them about with ironmongery and looting churches because that's where the gold and silver are kept. It's about you, me, Onund the dog-faced and his foster father Sven going over to see the farmer across the river to tell him exactly what we think of him.&#10;&#10;Personal combat in the Norse sagas is notable for its combination of grim humor, gymnastic violence and a graphic interest in the details of wounds, especially those with fatal consequences. &#10;Battle-Troll is all about that, a fast, bloodthirsty game simple enough to play after several horns of mead. Stolen mead, from a looted monastery.&#10;&#10;Also available: Battle Troll Action Deck: 52 cards - 4 sets of player turn cards; two End of Turn cards; and two complete Combat decks, with Attack and Defense strategies and card-sized Combat Results table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The aim of this game is to occupy sights (places) of Chemnitz and get the most points.&#10;&#10;The starting player draws a location card and places it at the corresponding location. This marks the start location for everyone. Everyone moves to a location (sight) during the first turn starting from the start location. Every time someone moves, a location has to be reached.&#10;&#10;Movements are allowed in one direction only (shortest path): to the side, forwards, or diagonal. A chip gets placed in each tile. This applies to the target location as well. For each path up to six chips can be used. An already occupied tile can be skipped, but not a location or multiple occupied tiles. For each location up to 4 chips (own or foreign) are allowed, but only one per turn. After occupying a location the current player can (but does not have to) draw a location card and auction it.&#10;&#10;A chip gets payed to the register and the card is auctioned. Up to 6 chips can be offered. If somebody offers six chips, the auction stop immediately. An auctioned location card can be used starting with the next round. Starting with the second turn, each player can choose: Either walk and auction or &quot;cap&quot;. This means that one location card is placed on the corresponding location, or another location. When capping, you can place as much chips on the location card as there are beneath it. A &quot;capped&quot; location is locked.&#10;&#10;The &quot;i&quot; wild card can be used to either &quot;cap&quot; a chosen location, the &quot;IHK&quot; wild card to get the own chips back from the register immediately. If it is passed on, the receiving player has to take back all of its own chips from the register. If the &quot;i&quot; wild card is drawn, the &quot;i-Chemnitz-Service&quot; will be the start location. When starting from the start location is not possible any more, because all the tiles around it are occupied already, another location card gets drawn as the start location. The game ends when someone runs out of chips.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Only &quot;capped&quot; tiles with at least one chip on it get scored. For correctly &quot;capped&quot; tiles all chips are counted for the corresponding person. For incorrectly &quot;capped&quot; tiles only chips of the &quot;capping&quot; person are counted, and only if the player has at least one chip beneath the location tile. All other chips are lost. Some special points can be gained by having matched places you wrote down before the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

If you add a few, you get a very different Imaginarium, It has all the components for an independent game. This is a simple association game that everyone likes - this is an excellent reason to save a couple of boxes for the winter holidays.&#10;&#10;Rules of the game:&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a chip and a set of voting cards in the same color as the chip.&#10;&#10;Definition of the first move&#10;&#10;You must determine who will walk first. You can use voting cards for this. All participants take their voting cards, shuffle and draw out any card at random. The first to start is the one who pulled out the card with the highest number. You can use any other mechanics to select the player starting first. For example, we play this right in chess. Then the game goes clockwise.&#10;&#10;Game progress&#10;&#10;All player chips are set to 1.&#10;The deck with illustration cards is shuffled and each player is given 6 cards in his hands.&#10;&#10;The player makes an association.&#10;&#10;Each turn one of the players becomes the leader. The presenter makes an association on one of his cards, tells the association out loud to the other players and puts the hidden card upside down on the table. Each player puts out one card, the most suitable for the voiced association. Then the cards are mixed and laid out in a row.&#10;&#10;Guessing the leader&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;The main task of the players is to guess which of the cards laid out on the table the presenter has guessed, and to vote for her. Each player selects one voting card with the desired number and puts it face down. The host does not vote or comment on the pictures posted on the table. You cannot vote for your own picture. When everyone made a decision and voted, the voting cards are turned over and points are scored.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Players move their chips on the playing field by the number of steps corresponding to the number of points won.&#10;&#10;",

Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ponle Acento is a game about Spanish orthography. It consists of cards with spelling rules and cards with words. The words have gaps in them where the spelling is difficult.&#10;&#10;Each player has three open word cards in front of them. One player draws a rule card and reads it out. Now everyone has to find word cards to which the rule is applicable and put it on top of the rule card. Only two cards can score per turn (from the same or different players), so players have to hurry. Players keep their correctly played cards and can exchange 3 for a victory point. First player to reach 3 victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

All players must draw and use cards from the same deck, often trading, discarding and stealing from each other to try and get the upper hand!&#10;&#10;This game is a 2 phase game - cold war and hot conflict - that is controlled by a central 'Tension&quot; mechanic, placing the pacing and speed at which the game takes place entirely in the hands of the players, where they can force their enemies into a war state, or bring their arms to bear.&#10;&#10;Players can, and will, use security tokens and deterrents to disrupt the plans of the other players - because at the end, there can only be one! &#10;Bluffing, lying and manipulating your competitors is to be expected, and intimidating an opponent to fold is a viable method of playing. It just pays to remember, if you try hard enough, almost any situation can be crawled out of.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Harpoon is the flagship of the Admiralty Trilogy Group's games. First published in 1980, it has undergone several major revisions, with the last, Harpoon4.1, being printed in the late 1990s. Although the system has remained fairly stable, naval technology has continued advancing, and there have been further developments in the game systems as  more information has been acquired. Harpoon 5 consolidates this knowledge and standardizes Harpoon with the other products.&#10;&#10;The era of modern naval combat began on October 21, 1967 when Egyptian missile boats launched four Soviet made Styx surface-to-surface missiles and sank the Israeli destroyer Eilat at a range of 13.5 nautical miles. The face of naval warfare changed forever!&#10;&#10;Harpoon 5 handles all aspects of modern maritime combat: surface, sub-surface, and air. Harpoon 5 is a system of detailed but comprehensible rules covering the many facets of modern naval actions. Consistent rating systems and evaluations of the capabilities of modern naval vessels, aircraft, submarines, and helicopters make it possible to achieve realistic results when simulating known situations, by extension Harpoon 5 also achieves realistic results with hypothetical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Harpoon 5 can answer questions like:&#10;&#10;Are carriers powerhouses or sitting ducks?&#10;Can transatlantic convoys survive in a modern wartime environment?&#10;In the cat-and-mouse games between US and Russian submarines, which is better?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore the second U.S. National Park and Michigan's first State Park in search of historical and natural treasures with this set of 5 games.&#10;&#10;Match Me if You Can is an Author's Cards-style card game. Choose natural treasures, historical treasures and/or locations around the Island, then collect the most cards in similar groups by asking for cards from other players or by picking up discarded cards.&#10;&#10;The Nature Hike has you searching for the route that will allow you to spot the most natural treasures each turn. Pick a card, roll the die to determine how many habitats you can visit, or if you have encountered an obstacle and must discard cards. A variation adds more player interaction by inviting you to collect observations from other players.&#10;&#10;The Scavenger Hunt is a cooperative game where players work together to find a pre-determined set of treasures before Winter arrives. Each turn, roll the die to move toward a revealed Scavenger Hunt destination while observing natural treasures along the way. When you get to the destination, if you can match the hiding place card of the historical treasure there, you collect the treasure. If you can't match it, another player can pick up the treasure later, or give you the card you need to collect it. You exchange natural treasure observations for more hiding place cards. You may also encounter events along the way, either obstacles, opportunities, or a change of season.&#10;&#10;The Hide and Seek game tests your memory as each turn reveals the hiding place of historical treasures on the Island that you can collect...if you remember where they are. Each turn, you can add a card to your hand, play a new movement option (that lets you move around the Island faster or slower, depending on the season), play event cards on other players (to slow them down), move to new locations while observing natural treasures (which add points to your score), and hunt for historical treasures (by flipping over a hidden location card around the board - if you are at the location on the card, you keep the treasure and score). Whoever finds the most treasures usually wins.&#10;&#10;The Treasure Hunt has you playing the sleuth, asking questions of the other players in order to discover the treasures they have hidden around the Island. Using the same movement and event rules as The Hide and Seek game, this game gives players many opportunities to score points: Visit locations on cards in your hand to score and gain special abilities useful in the hunt. Play historical treasures from your hand to score and help everyone know which treasures are not hidden. Ask yes or no questions of the other players to determine the location and the treasure they have hidden on the Island. Guess the treasure and location correctly to score big, or lose a little if you're wrong.&#10;&#10;Choose the experience you want based on the available players (2 to 8 people can play), the amount of time you have, or how much you want to think. While some of the games share common rules and themes (for example, each game features some sort of nature observation), each is a separate game. Cards have information about the Island you can read as you play, though knowledge about the Island is not required to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These modifications provide some uniqueness for the smaller ships and allow them to be battled out on the tabletop.&#10;Like the original KMH rules, they are not scale dependent. &#10;However, the changes were designed with 1/300 or 6mm ships in mind. &#10;These can be obtained from sites such as Sea Dog Studios, Langton Miniatures and War Artisan. The later is an exceptional value as you are buying a paper kit that you print yourself and make as many as you would like.&#10;&#10;Included in the book is a guide for creating your own ships or creating stats for historical vessels. &#10;Fifteen historical scenarios covering: the American Revolution, The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, The Tripolitan Wars and the Quasi-War with France.&#10;&#10;A section is included for creating campaigns with these small vessels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
