    "Description": "Lorrein is published by Sensalot in 2011. The Duces of Lorrein is a family game with a nice mix of existing and new game elements. It contains a new invented alternative to dice.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to complete you mission card which states to build 4 specified workshops (Mill, Saw Mill, Stone Mill, Tannery (leather)). You start with just 1.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:&#10;1) Each player throws the chancebowl and gets raw materials (Wood, rock, animal, grain, lavender)(wooden pieces). &#10;2)The raw material has to be processed in a workshop in order to become a useful product (product cards). Because the other players have the other workshops you'll have to negotiate with them to get you material processed. This makes players dependent of each other. With the product card a player can build a workshop, farm, castle, big castle or a witchery.&#10;3)The final step is paying food for each castle. If a player doesn't have enough food, a game piece has to be taken away.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that completes his turn and mission card.&#10;&#10;What makes the game interesting is the dilemma of being mutually dependent of your co player. Meanwhile each player wants to become independent by building your own workshops. For this you first need to negotiate with your co players. Becoming independent is often not on the road to completing you mission. So should you remain dependent and try to reach you goal asap, while running the risk of being blocked in the end, or should you try to become independent first and strong en your influence.&#10;Another element of influence in the game is the Mill. There is only one mill in the game. If someone else builds the mill, you lose it. Having the mill means controlling the food. You can use this position to get extra income or by starving and deterioration you opponents. Partner or Compete.&#10;&#10;Another element is the game of positioning:  &#10;A workshop has to border a Castle. A small castle can have 2 workshops and a big castle can have 4 workshops. The castle has to be positioned between the 4 8-sided landscapes. Getting a good position with the correct landscapes around your castle is important. However, you opponents can block you by building farms, witchery or a workshop adjacent to your castle.&#10;&#10;As an extra the game contains two additions in the manual which will strongly change the game. The first addition is the option to steal a farm if it isn't protected by an own castle or witchery. The second addition is to steal workshop by building a stronger castle.&#10;&#10;All in all a very good balanced game, with a lot of dynamic and a great replayability.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.&#10;&#10;",

The players are river pirates waiting at the foot of a waterfall (represented by a plastic ramp in connection with the game box) for the treasures of a capsized treasure ship.&#10;&#10;In her/his turn the player rolls a die to see if and how many water-chips she/he has to add at the far end of the ramp. Than the player must push the newly set water-chips up the river/ramp with a tree trunk for a given length. So every turn some water-chips are dropping off the ramp - that's the waterfall. When treasure blocks are on the water-chips they are dropping with them down the waterfall and the player, whose turn it was before the active player's receives the treasures.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;",

The apprentice who demonstrates the greatest skill in healing both the sick villagers and the druid himself will be chosen to take on this prestigious role.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic revolves around the strategic use of cards, where players must use the correct plants to heal villagers based on their specific ailments. Additionally, the game encourages intense player interaction through the &quot;Druid&rsquo;s Orders&quot; cards, which allow for special actions such as stealing cards, swapping villagers, or even sabotaging other players' progress.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is dynamic, with turns offering multiple possibilities: from healing your own villagers to disrupting your rivals&rsquo; strategies. Only after healing all your villagers can you attempt to heal the druid, using two specific plants that match his ailments.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is to be the first to heal the druid, but achieving victory requires balancing careful planning with the ability to adapt to your opponents&rsquo; actions in this exciting card and strategy game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As you move down the trail, you'll draw cards, which might be good or bad for you, bad for opponents, or terrible for everyone at the table. You'll also acquire useful items and specialties &mdash; with each character having a different set of things to find &mdash; have adventures, and come into conflict with other players. Conflict in Cross Hares takes the form of either shoving each other back and forth around the map or stealing items.&#10;&#10;Don't worry if you're far back on the path away from everyone else as with the right events or die rolls, you can race ahead of the others! Once you get to the factory, though, you'll need all of your skills and items to defeat it, so be sure you save some of your strength for that.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dive into the thrilling world of cycling races and feel the adrenaline of true competition!&#10;&#10;In Mind Cycling, each player takes on the role of a team manager, striving to dominate the race by employing clever strategies and carefully managing their cyclists' energy. The game takes place on a board representing a racecourse with various sections, including plains, sprints, and mountain climbs.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players move their cyclists a certain number of spaces, either diagonally or straight ahead, depending on the free spaces in front of them. Cyclists cannot move sideways or backward. The sprinter (green helmet) excels in sprint sections, the rouleur (blue helmet) in plains, and the climber (yellow helmet) in mountain climbs. Each cyclist type, therefore, has different movement capabilities depending on the section they are in.&#10;&#10;Strategies are key to success in the game.&#10;&#10;For instance, the &quot;Wheel/Relay&quot; strategy allows cyclists to form &quot;trains&quot; to enhance their movement. A cyclist can follow or lead a train, maximizing the group&rsquo;s efficiency. Water bottles (blue bases) can be used to perform attacks, granting additional movement steps in the appropriate sections. However, once used, the bottle is discarded, and the cyclist loses the ability to attack.&#10;&#10;Wind is another critical factor, reducing the speed of cyclists riding against it. Wind tokens are placed to indicate which cyclists are affected. Before each turn, players must analyze the cyclists&rsquo; positions, the sections of the racecourse, the wind, and potential strategies.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first cyclist crosses the finish line. Medals are awarded for the best cyclist, the best sprinter, the best climber, and the best team. The player with the most medals in their team wins the title of &quot;Best Mind Cycling Manager.&quot;&#10;&#10;Do you have the endurance and strategy needed to lead your team to the podium?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As Marshal of the interstellar fleet, it is your duty to oversee the colonization of nearby regions of the galaxy and thereby ensure the perpetuation of your people at any cost. But your race is not alone in its aspirations for dominance of the cosmos, or in having the power to realize that goal. Races hailing from various star systems venture out in all directions. Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions. Don&rsquo;t get too attached to your fleets or interstellar empire, because tides can and will turn quickly. Only you can determine the fate of your people: interstellar conquest or infinite servitude.&#10;&#10;StelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Variable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.&#10;&#10;Sectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a &quot;bridge&quot; which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.&#10;&#10;Moving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple but tense. Add up your firepower present at the battle site and then toss in a d6 roll. The opponent does the same. Compare the two totals, and the winner keeps the sector in question while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.&#10;&#10;While the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish.&#10;&#10;Conquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 120 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Modify the firepower of your sector or your ship&#10;     Boost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)&#10;     Steal or stop opponent's cards&#10;     Cheat the dice&#10;     Wipe out a whole sector&#10;     Even influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In clockwise order, each player places one of cards at the card row in the middle of the table, taking care not to go under the birth year or over the death year of the famous person.  &#10;  &#10;Whoever can't place it correctly, must take all the previously played cards. The winner is the player who either successfully places all of his cards in one round or who has taken the least cards at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is yet another Monopoly variant.&#10;&#10;Instead of Atlantic City properties, players purchase Las Vegas casinos (circa 1974), and rather than paying rent when you land on a property, players must gamble an amount specified by the property owner.  Games include Craps, Blackjack, and Roulette. The game was endorsed by Jerry Lewis (box features his photo and signature).&#10;&#10;Another version of the game, not endorsed by Jerry Lewis, comes in more conventionally sized box.&#10;&#10;Although the game uses Las Vegas as a setting, the game uses the French Roulette wheel instead of the American wheel. The American wheel has an added space: the double zero. Someone noticed this when designing the box and placed a die strategically to cover up the zero in a photograph of the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Password&#10;&#10;FROM THE BOX:&#10;&#10;Million Dollar Password is based on the addictive game show where quick minds and clear clues could unlock a million dollar prize! The game is played between two competing teams in a deceptively simple word guessing game. Clever communication is the key as Password players must rely on one-word clues to guess the secret word. Played just like the TV game show, Million Dollar Password is a modern twist on the original word association classic!&#10;&#10;brought into the 21st Century, both on television and as a home game, by being composed of nothing but Lightning Rounds. Mm-hm.&#10;&#10;Two teams of two players play four rounds. Each round consists of each team getting 30 seconds (measured by an electronic timer that plays the think music from the series) to score as many of the five passwords as possible.&#10;&#10;The team that scores the most points then plays a bonus round where the object is to get five words out of a specific number within the time limit. This part has six tiers, each worth a different amount of money, with Tier 1 having ten words and Tier 6 having just five. Winning all six awards $1,000,000.&#10;&#10;There is a variation for three players, with one player giving the clues for the other two. Games with five or more players can be done as a tournament.&#10;&#10;The show itself aired on CBS, hosted by Regis Philbin, from 2008 until 2009.&#10;&#10;",

Players try to get one another to make pairs of dirty-sounding, nautically-themed cards.  Each card comes with a challenge.  The more pairs a player makes, the more challenges that player must face.  Before long, players are standing on chairs with socks on their hands and cards on their heads.  As soon as a player fails or forgets to perform a challenge, that player is out of the game.  The last player left in the game wins.&#10;&#10;Go Fish Yourself is more than just one deck of cards.  It comes with a series of expansions that will allow players to keep the nonsense going.  Each expansion comes with 52 new cards and challenges.  These expansions (or editions) can be played as standalone games or combined with the original.  Players are able to mix and match their favorite pairs from all or any of the expansions to create customized decks.&#10;&#10;",

You put on your jacket, lace up your boots and set out.&#10;&#10;The leaves rustle on the trees, and the sunlight shines through the branches. A gentle breeze blows as you take a deep breath of forest air. Lost in your thoughts, you turn once here and then again there, sometimes going left and sometimes turning right... Suddenly you hear something rustling behind you in the bushes. You take a few cautious steps towards the noise and discover...a goose?! And it's talking to a goblin? Then all of a sudden, your friends are standing next to you in the forest...&#10;&#10;Umm. You decide it might best to head home quickly. There seems to be something wrong with this forest...&#10;&#10;Which is the shortest way back? You're in luck as the fairy tale characters decide to show you, but your friends are constantly changing the path in Memorinth in their own attempts to get home the quickest. However, with a bit of luck and memory, you'll be the first to get out of the labyrinth!&#10;&#10;To set up, place the clearing tile on the table, then place all of the player pieces on this card, then lay out the other tile to form a 5x5 grid with the clearing tile at the center; alternate the light and dark sides of the tiles, with the clearing tile starting on the light side. Place two of the eight fairy tale characters on each side of the grid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player flips over an unoccupied tile that matches the light/dark status of the clearing tile. If the revealed side of the tile has one of the eight fairy tail characters on it, you must move your player piece one space toward the side of the grid where this character is located &mdash; but only if a path connects the tile you current occupy and the tile to which you must move. If no path exists, you don't move. Starting with the second round, the clearing tile will flip from light to dark and back again, challenging you to remember which characters are where so that you can move in the direction that helps you best.&#10;&#10;Memorinth also has a &quot;master mode&quot; in which you place four of the fairy tail characters around a special double-sided action tile. On one side of this tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll remove a tile from the grid, then add it back on the opposite side of the grid, sliding everything in that row or column. On the other side of the action tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll swap two tiles, swap two fairy tail characters, look at the bottom of a tile, or receive a lucky clover token, which you'll need in order to walk on a path with goblins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Here's the fun scoring twist - each point token is worth as much as the number of tokens of that color not claimed. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are only 10 tokens available for each color, so if all of them are claimed, each one is worth zero points!

Also, the German TV Channel &quot;Super RTL&quot; uses &quot;Auf hei&szlig;er Spur&quot; in a weekly game program for kids, called &quot;SpieleGalaxie&quot;. The kids must find the guilty thief on the TV screen.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to follow the clues (shown on 3 dice: starting location, color of dropped diamond, and clothing detail) to find the right thief. Every player tried to find the right thief at the same time, following a circle of cards with suspects. There are also special cards (subway, etc.)&#10;&#10;",

In this way, you can eliminate suspects and catch the thief!&#10;&#10;Wer war's: Das Kartenspiel is a card game played with three types of cards: food, animals and suspects. The ten suspects are face-up on the table, as is one card of each of the four animal types. Each turn, a player can perform one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw two food cards. Each food card shows a number of apples, loaves of bread, or carrots.&#10;    Take one of the open animal cards by paying the amount of food shown on the card, using only one type of food (apples, bread or carrots).&#10;    Take one of the suspect cards by paying the animal cards shown on the suspect cards. The animals have seen this suspect elsewhere at the time of the crime, and he is not the thief.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one suspect remains &mdash; he is the thief! The players now look at the suspect cards they have collected. Each card is worth a number of gold coins. The player who has collected the most coins wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You&rsquo;re a busy group of pandas planning your escape from the zoo but you&rsquo;ll need supplies. You have been rummaging and pilfering unwanted food from all the other animals but now the Zoo Keeper is on to you. You must quickly trade all the goods you have collected so you can get the supplies you need and make your escape before you get caught. But be careful, certain actions will raise the Zoo Keeper&rsquo;s suspicion more than others.&#10;&#10;Pilfering Pandas is a reinvention of a classic card game but we've made a huge number of changes, not least creating a cooperative and solo mode. Pilfering Pandas is the third game from Wren Games who aim to bring back gaming to busy people. Pilfering Pandas therefore have a short playtime but we maintain depth of decisions and intuitive gameplay to give a game with some bite.&#10;&#10;Pilfering Pandas has similarities to Rummy as you are making number sets and runs but it also has this really interesting discard pile mechanism and this was the thing that we most wanted to bring to modern-day gaming.&#10;&#10;The Hideout is where you 'discard' a card but unlike traditional discard piles, the Hideout is not a pile, it's a spread of cards visible to all players and, for a fee, you can pick up as many cards as you want from it and make huge plays of sets in a single turn (there's only a hand limit in solo games).&#10;&#10;Players must collect sets and trade them with the Meerkats to earn points to increase their chance of escaping from the zoo. However, they must always stay at least one step ahead of the zoo keeper so they don't get caught by playing and picking up cards wisely and efficiently.&#10;&#10;But didn't want Pilfering Pandas to be just another set collection game so we also introduced a whole new level to set collecting whereby the previous sets you play directly effects what sets you can play in the future, making it much more strategic than traditional set collecting games.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However, only few people will have the opportunity to&hellip; change the course of history!&#10;&#10;On the occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, the National Centre for Culture, in order to promote the celebrations, has published a two-players' history illustrated card game  &quot;Grunwald &ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&rdquo;. One of the player is the leader of the Polish-Lithuanian army and the other leads the Teutonic Order. Each of them has a separate deck of 55-cards. The fight is a dynamic 20-30 minutes game.&#10;&#10;The players use the figures of military leaders, historical divisions and unconventional tactics enabling to tilt the scales of victory in one of the players' favour. The rules are simple and easy to learn even for the beginners, and the possibility of applying diverse tactics and strategies makes the game quick and dynamic, each time with a different scenario.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of successive clashes between subsequent military leaders and their divisions. The game is won by the player who is the first to gain six banners of the enemy.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to familirise young people with history, that is why it includes educational elements such as real historical figures, battle formations and real medieval weapons. It features a description of the battle. The card illustrations were verified for their historical fidelity by a military historian, Tomasz Mleczek. The game was created by Micha&#197;&#130; Stachyra and Maciej Zasowski from the publishing house Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier, and Piotr Foksowicz and Krzysztof Rogulski are the authors of the illustrations in the form of comic-book-like drawings.&#10;&#10;In the box there are 110 cards (2 decks) together with an instruction including educational elements.&#10;&#10;The game is not for sale and was distributed free of charge, among others, during &quot;The Grunwald Days&quot; on 15-17 July 2010 on the Fields of Grunwald.&#10;&#10;Source - nck.pl&#10;&#10;",

Players try to find out which item was stolen by which person and where. For this you take over the role of the three investigators and their friends - Aunt Mathilda, Inspector Cotta and Uncle Titus. Every character has a special ability which can be used once per game (e.g. move a second time). Just like in the original version, players move on the board. As soon as they enter a room/place, they can ask questions about the crime. Each player has a certain amount of cards in his hand, 3 cards have been put to the side - they say where the crime took place, who the thief is and which item was stolen. It's the players' goal to solve the crime. With the help of questions and your cards, you try to find out as much as possible about the case so that you will be the one to solve the mystery in the end and predict which cards have been set aside.&#10;All items, characters and places are based on the adventures of the three investigators. The place where you can solve the mystery, for example, is the old house trainer in Uncle Titus' salvage yard. Amongst the criminals players can find the investigators' arch enemy Skinny Norris, for example.&#10;&#10;",

It's possible to repel opponents by undoing their ropes and returning them to them.

Each turn when two or more players pass (voluntarily or not), everyone fills up their hand to 6 cards again.&#10;&#10;Different cards:&#10;- Objects: Pick up or drop objects.&#10;- Group: Regrouping of men and leaders.&#10;- Direct target: Start automatic move of a group up to 10 spaces.&#10;- Discard target: Inhibit an automatic move.&#10;- Ambush: Attack a nearby opponent group.&#10;- Threat: Let a weaker group give up an object without battle.&#10;- Disguise: Protect a group from some of the other events.&#10;- Fast march: Move up to 4 squares.&#10;- Attack: Start a battle.&#10;- Lost: Out of turn card which can displace a group that has just moved one square.&#10;- Trust: Out of turn card to stop an attack.&#10;&#10;Originally the game is from England.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Decision Games website:)&#10;&#10;The 19th century saw the great imperial powers of Europe clash in titanic battles to establish control over the continent. Empires at War simulates four of these battles.&#10;&#10;The Basic Game allows beginners to learn quickly, while providing experienced players an exciting evening of action. The Advanced Game fully simulates grand tactics of this period. Rules include provisions for light infantry (jaegers and chasseurs), command control, morale, fog of war, and mitrailleuse (early machine guns).&#10;&#10;- Inkerman, 5 November 1854 &#10;At the height of the Crimean War, the Russians made a determined attempt to break out of Sevastopol. After a desperate day of fighting in rough terrain and fog, the Russians nearly broke the outnumbered Allies, but fell back with severe losses.&#10;&#10;- Solferino, 24 June 1859 &#10;A decisive clash between the French/Sardinian and the Austrians came at the town of Solferino. The narrow French/Sardinian victory over Austria was due to the intrepid leadership of individual French corps commanders.&#10;&#10;- Koniggratz, 3 July 1866 &#10;The decisive battle of the &quot;Six Weeks War&quot; came after a month of preliminary maneuvering. After a day of bloody see-saw fighting, the Prussian Second Army suddenly appeared on the northern flank, rolling up the Austrian line.&#10; - Gravelotte-St. Privat, 18 August 1870 &#10;The decisive action occurred near the great fortress of Metz. The situation might have turned in favor of the French, but hesitation allowed Von Moltke to regroup and prepare a flanking maneuver that assured a German victory.&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;&#10;    400 counters&#10;    16-page rule book&#10;    4 maps on (2) 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;    1 inch box&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Quad game depicting 4 battles fought during the 19th century: Inkerman (1854), Solferino (1859), K&ouml;niggratz (1866) and Gravelotte (1870).&#10;&#10;Lots of chrome rules, including command control,different weapon types and morale.  Nato style counters.  Four maps (3 large and 1 small). Inkerman,whilst fought on the smallest map due to the small battlefield, is a standout. Games are always close and are extremely accurate and well designed and researched. A well designed simulation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Desert War: Tactical Warfare in North Africa, 1940-43, is an historical simulation of the tactical Combat in North Africa from 1941 to 1943.  The scenarios show several common situations involving German, British and Italian Units.  The combination of situations with varying forces allow an almost innumerable amount of different scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;Desert War is basically a two-Player game. It is played in sequenced turns, during which the Players use a new &amp; unique simultaneous plotting and moving system to move their units on the map, have combat and attempt to achieve certain objectives. The game is played in Scenarios which are various mixtures of forces and objectives.&#10;&#10;The Western Desert, stretching 1,400 miles between Tripoli and Alexandria, was described by one German general as &quot;a tactician's paradise and a quartermaster's hell.&quot; Between March 1941, when Rommel's Afrika Korps arrived in Tripoli, and May 1943, when the last Axis troops surrendered in Tunisia, the conduct of the Desert War furnished the proof for that general's impression.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactical simulation designed to recreate the mechanized struggles which took place in the &quot;perfect&quot; tactical terrain of North Africa during World War II. The 22&quot; x 34&quot; two-color mapsheet depicts a composite desert battlefield on which the flat sands are sparsely interrupted by patches of rocky cover or slight differences of elevation. Each mapsheet hex represents a hundred meters of distance and each Game-Turn represents three and a half minutes of actual time. Four hundred die-cut units represent the Allied, German and Italian combat units that contest the differing Desert War situations and scenarios. Opposing infantry companies, supported by tank platoons and anti-tank and artillery batteries engage each other within the tactical game scale of Desen War.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactician's simulation tool. Those of you who have been following this series from PanzerBlitz and Combat Command: Tactical Armored Warfare, France 1944 through Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Europe in the 1970's,  know that Desert War is a development of game you won't want to miss.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3.5 minutes&#10;Hex: 109 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; two-color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page folded rulebook&#10;One Simultaneous Movement Plot pad&#10;Two Scenario &amp; Tables players aid sheet&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Low&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

Now you and your friends make up the Revolutionary Committee, overseeing justice throughout the land. Still, now that the queen's gone, it would be a shame to let all that cake go to waste...&#10;&#10;Become the first among equals by amassing honour! Become happy by amassing cake! Send your friends' pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!&#10;&#10;Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations! Any player can spend their Generals to force a re-election or simply choose the winner of a vote. The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out. The player with the most cake wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imagine a world where humans never existed.  In its place, several other animal species had the opportunity to evolve and occupy the top of the food chain.  In this world, the future is the present, and the power struggle is even more intense.  Certain species dominate large corporations, while others live forgotten in the underworld.  Welcome to the Persona non Grata universe.&#10;&#10;In it you take on the mantle of a hacker willing to dismantle this model of tyrannical society.  To do this, you will need to gather information about the corrupt employees of the biggest corporations, sharing them and stealing them from your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game rounds are played simultaneously: You must select an information card, link to one of your action cards (download, send or encrypt) and pass the rest of the information cards in your hand to the next player.&#10;&#10;After all the information has been played, players compare the relevance of their information in each corporation.  The first two places can score, stealing information cards from other players.&#10;&#10;At the end of 3 rounds, we will count the points.  But be careful, to score in each corporation you will need to activate them with worker cards or headquarters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the artist&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this card game, players propose holiday destinations/types of holidays and then try to win the most points by sending the highest scoring group of people on those holidays. The basic mechanism is trick-taking with an element of bluffing.&#10;&#10;There are two kinds of cards in the game. Each player has five holiday destination cards. They are also dealt 6 traveler cards, which may be men, women or children with a value of from 3 to 8 points.&#10;&#10;There are five kinds of holidays that may be proposed:&#10;A romantic trip to Venice for a couple (one man, one woman)&#10;Night-life holidays in Mykonos with any number of men and women&#10;Trips to an amusement park for any number of children accompanied by one adult (man or woman)&#10;A restful family holiday at Berghotel (one man, one woman and one child exactly)&#10;Fantastic cruises (any number of men or women, but only men or only women)&#10;&#10;The starting player proposes a holiday by placing the card in the center. Three traveler cards are dealt to the centre of the table, one of which is face up - this is the value of the holiday. The other players, in turn, may agree to this destination, or change it by paying one traveler card (and augmenting the value of the holiday). This goes round, players changing destinations as long as they want to and can afford to, until everyone finally agrees on the destination.&#10;&#10;Players then play cards that match the criteria for that destination and the player who plays travelers with the highest score wins the holiday. This is scored as the value from the initial 3 cards plus any extra cards played to change the destination, divided by ten. Points that don't make up to ten exactly don't contribute to the score.&#10;&#10;The player to first score 10 points wins.&#10;&#10;The game has a nice element of bluffing as a player could propose holiday destinations they have no interest in so that after other players change the destination, they can change it to the real place they'd prefer to go.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeons are full of treasures, and some people return from them covered in glory, gems, and gold nuggets. More common, however, are the ones who died inside! You are obviously tempted by the chance to enrich yourself, but you don't want to be one of those who won't see the sun again. Luckily there are always many idiots lingering in inns who you can trick by promising glory and money, brave heroes ready to enter the deep caves occupied by terrible monsters and risk not coming back with their arms full of treasure.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Heroes Manager, you are sponsors of the &quot;dungeon cleaning operations&quot; in the kingdom. Thanks to public funds (you obviously don't want to risk your own money), you will hire cannon fodder, er, brave heroes in the local inns, equip and train them, then send them toward castles and caves to loot them and clean up of dangerous monsters &mdash; all in order to get richer shamelessly.&#10;&#10;But note that Dungeon Heroes Manager is a game in which the richest &mdash; and not the bravest &mdash; hero will win!&#10;&#10;",
