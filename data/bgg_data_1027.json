    "Description": "Oscar's Hot Night Out is an adult party game based around crafting ingenious names for imaginative &quot;adventures.&quot; It's played with three types of cards: Tops, Bottoms and Adventures. All players will have four Tops and four Bottoms; combining one each of these cards creates a description or phrase that we call a &quot;Name&quot;. Every round, a Judge will draw and read an Adventure -- a description of a fanciful and often naughty act -- out loud to the players. The other players each attempt to create a name for the Adventure from the cards in their hand and submitting it secretly. The Judge reads the submissions out loud and chooses the best name to win the round; its owner becomes the Judge for the next round. The game continues until a player has accumulated a number of wins  based on the total number of players, or everyone has laughed enough.&#10;&#10;Oscar's Hot Night Out is a different kind of adult party game. Are there naughty words? Yes, most certainly. Adult Situations? Absolutely! But, Oscar's Hot Night Out is a raunchy game designed  for everyone to enjoy -- whatever your preference or background, you're welcome at this table (as long as you can handle the occasional dirty word...) Oscar's Hot Night Out is a sex positive party game that celebrates what two (or more) consenting adults can get up to without condemnation or judgement. The game can be played by all genders and creeds. Oscar's Hot Night Out is not about creating uncomfortable shock humor or belittling other sexes and sexuality; it is fundamentally about the delight everyone gets from devilishly naughty turns of phrase and the fanciful acts they describe.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players place miner meeples out on the board to take different actions like visiting the workshop, mining the land, or cleaning out dirt to find gold. Taking an action first gives the best benefit, so players are met with challenging decisions on how to efficiently collect gold while trying to foil the efforts of other miners.&#10;&#10;Press-your-luck comes into play as players clean out buckets of dirt from their operation to find gold. Bedrock is more rich with gold than regular Dirt, but watch out&mdash;it also contains more rocks. If a player reveals two rocks when cleaning out, then a piece of equipment they have acquired from the shop breaks.&#10;&#10;Will you be the miner that claims it all?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep is an expansion for Eldritch Horror, a cooperative board game for one to eight players in which intrepid investigators must traverse the globe in an attempt to thwart the cataclysmic rise of an otherworldly Ancient One. Strange cults are gathering strength in remote corners and bustling cities all over the world. Though they seem to worship different gods, the investigators have found a thread that runs throughout all of the cultists&rsquo; horrific rites.&#10;&#10;In Masks of Nyarlathotep, each of these sects pursues the awakening of an aspect of the same horrific creature: Nyarlathotep. This being is known as the Messenger of the Outer Gods, and he is the only Ancient One that still actively walks among humanity. The investigators must work to stop the cults springing up to serve his many guises, or Nyarlathotep will gain enough strength to open the Ultimate Gate, ushering in an unthinkable doom. Strike down these cults in new Adventures, explore ancient mysteries among new Mystic Ruins, and destroy the monstrous followers of Nyarlathotep. New to this expansion, Personal Stories unique to each character add stakes to the actions undertaken by each investigator, and a Campaign mode adds a fresh challenge and enriches the narrative of the investigators&rsquo; struggles to stop the many cults worshipping the multitude of faces worn by one dread being in Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To attach a marketing card you must first pay 1D6 MT.  If you choose not to the publicity phase ends.  A mutant may not have more marketing cards attached than he or she has FT. &#10;     Mission Phase: You may play 1 mission card from your hand. To go on the mission, you must have at least 1D6 heroes. If you do not, skip the rest of this phase. Roll 1D6. This is the Carnage roll. For each point of carnage, discard one power card from your hand. For each point of carnage not negated by a power card, kill off 1 random Hero of your Team. Gain 1D6 MT for each killed hero. If you have any surviving heroes roll 1D6. Add the number of survivors. This is the success roll. If the success roll is higher than the carnage roll, the mission is a success and you gain 2D6 MT.  You may discard power cards to add 1 to the success roll for each card discarded. All tokens and cards attached to a killed hero are discarded/lost with him. &#10;     Fame Phase: Each of your Heroes that survived a mission last phase gains a FT. &#10;     Fortune Phase: Gain 1 MT for each FT and marketing card you have in play. &#10;     End Phase: Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player goes to start his turn, and there are no cards left in the deck. The player with the most MT at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 1-4+ players in which each player is a unique incarnation of Xenophon and the Ten Thousand. The 10,000 are Greek mercenaries who have come to fight for Cyrus, the younger brother of the Persian King Artaxerxes. Cyrus is killed in battle against the King leaving the Greeks abandoned, deep in hostile territory. The Greeks begin a long march northward to the Black Sea and Greek territory. The player whose pawn reaches the sea first and with the most men is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are 2 Tracks: &#10;&#10;     The Distance Track. This track has 60 numbered spaces. The first space is that of Cunaxa where Cyrus was killed. The last space is the Coastal Greek Colony of Trapezus. Each player has his own uniquely coloured pawn which he moves along &#10;&#10;&#10;the distance Track. Each space represents about 10 Miles.&#10;&#10;The Time Track&#10;&#10;     This track has 60 numbered spaces. A single neutral pawn is moved a single space after all players have completed a single turn. When a player reaches the sea he should take his coloured pawn from the distance track and place it on the time track on the current space to mark how long his journey took.  Each space represents about 2 days. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10,000 men. Men are lost during the journey due to fighting, exposure, starvation, and desertion. Paper and pencil to keep track of your manpower total.&#10;&#10;Each Food Token represents 1 days supply worth of food for the Army. Lack of Food Tokens will result in accumulation of Starvation Tokens. Mutiny Tokens represent dissent and despondency amongst the ranks. Anger Tokens represent the accumulation of barbarian forces arrayed against you.&#10;&#10;Players share an action deck. Most cards will increase or reduce the value of a target die-roll. Most improve your rolls. Others will be to the detriment of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 16 Phases: &#10;&#10;     Draw Phase - The current player draws 3 cards. &#10;     Route Phase - Roll against the Route Table.  The result will generate modifiers for one or more of the forage, travel and battle rolls. &#10;     Weather Phase &ndash; Roll against the Weather Table. The weather conditions will generate modifiers for the forage and travel rolls&#10;     Satrap Phase &ndash; Roll against the Satrap table to determine whether you encounter a Satrap.&#10;     Negotiations Phase - If you encountered a Satrap this turn make a negotiation roll. This will result in gaining Anger or Food tokens.&#10;     Attack Phase - Make an Attack Roll. If your result is equal to or less than the number of AT you have, you are attacked by Barbarians. &#10;     Battle Phase - If you are attacked by Barbarians remove 1 Anger Token and make a battle roll to determine the number of casualties.&#10;     Exposure Phase - If the weather was harsh this turn make an exposure roll and lose men accordingly.&#10;     Forage Phase - You may choose not to forage, if so skip this turn. Otherwise make a roll against the forage table to gain a combination of food and anger tokens&#10;     Consumption Phase - If you currently have a food token, discard all your starvation tokens. Discard 1 food token. If you have no food tokens to lose gain 1 starvation token. &#10;     Starvation Phase - If you have Starvation Tokens make a roll to determine the number of men lost.&#10;     Morale Phase &ndash; Roll on morale table to determine whether you gain a mutiny token.&#10;     Rally Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a rally roll to see whether you can remove any of them.&#10;     Desertion Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a desertion roll to see whether any men desert. &#10;     Travel Phase - Make a travel roll to determine how far your pawn advances on the distance map. This roll will be modified by weather and route markers and other activities undertaken during the turn.&#10;     End Phase - Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have finally reached the last space on the Distance Track. Players then calculate their scores: &#10;Player Score = (Remaining men) divided by (number of turns to reach the sea)&#10;&#10;",

This sometimes eliminates players' lead spirits as combinations of some elements (such as fire and water) are volatile. If either row has a total of six cards, a scoring occurs. The player with the highest combination of lead spirit and dance partner chooses all cards of one color from the row that caused the scoring. The player with the second highest combination follows, and so on. Cards taken from the row are set aside to score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends at some point after the stock deck runs out of cards for a second time. Players then score the cards that they have collected over the course of the game. Each card is worth one point, but bonuses are awarded according to the number of score cards of the same rank that each player has. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is set in a time that world trade is plagued by piracy, dangerous ocean voyages and fierce wars. Can you a small time merchant battle the stormy oceans and avoid the scourge of piracy trading goods for profit and becoming a Master Merchant, or will you build a superior fleet of ships and become to become a recognised Admiral of the Seas or perhaps you will find wealth in war and plunder your riches conquering ports around the world and become a Lord Governor.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a number of rounds until one player scores one of the three victory conditions and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In the standard game players are aiming to excel at one of three objectives. Master Merchant, Lord of Maritime or Lord Governor. Master Merchant requires a player to have 150g and dock at a port owned by their nationality. Admiral of the Seas requires a player to have 3 ship cards in his fleet and capture or buy a forth. Lord Governor requires a player to place his last nations port marker on the board.&#10;&#10;For a more challenging and longer game the number of objectives a player needs to win can be raised to 2 or all 3.&#10;&#10;Once a player has met an objective their turn immediately ends, however the round is not over and continues giving other player the opportunity to complete an objective. At the end of the round if more than one player has managed to complete all objectives needed to win, victory points are awarded (see below) to decide a winner, the highest scorer ultimately wins the game, if in the rare circumstances there is a draw, they can decide to accept a draw or both fleets can combat until one side loses a ship giving victory to the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4+ players based on the Novella &ldquo;Roadside Picnic&rdquo; by the Strugatsky brothers.  Each player is a Stalker, venturing into the dangerous Visitation Zones to bring back valuable artefacts left by visiting Aliens.&#10;&#10;There are 3 Decks: &#10;-  The Stalker Deck.  This deck is composed of cards the Stalkers use to avoid &#10;Hazards and find Artefacts. Each card has a Rating in 2 Traits: Avoidance Rating (used to avoid hazards) and Detection Rating (used to find artefacts)&#10;-  The Zone Deck.  This deck has 4 card types: Location, Hazard, Artefact and Events.&#10;-  The Character Deck. These represent Stalkers. Each one has a special Ability.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn having four phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Stalker Phase&#10;The current Stalker fills his hand to 10 stalker cards drawn from the top of the stalker deck.&#10;&#10;2.  Zone Phase&#10;A player may decide to completely skip the Zone Phase on his turn. &#10;The current stalker flips over the top card of the Zone Deck and places it face-up in the middle of the table. This card is called the Primary Zone Card. &#10;-   If the Primary Zone card is a location the Stalker must discard a stalker card of his choice from his hand along with the location card. &#10;-   If the Primary Zone card is a hazard the Stalker must play (discard) a stalker card to avoid it. The Hazard card will have a danger rating. The Stalker must roll 1D10 and add the avoidance rating on the Stalker card he played to the roll. If this total is equal to or greater than the danger rating of the Hazard card he successfully avoids it. If the total is less, he must roll 1D10 on the Hazard Table. Either way discard the hazard card. &#10;-   If the Primary Zone card is an Artefact the Stalker must play (discard) a Stalker card to find it. The Stalker must roll 1D10 and add the detection rating on the Stalker card he played to the roll. If this total is 7 or greater he successfully finds it. The stalker places it face-down next to him in his Swag pile. If the total is less, he does not find it; discard the Artefact card. &#10;-   If the Primary Zone card is an Event card, resolve it and discard it. &#10;-   The Stalker may repeat this process as long as he still has Stalker cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;3.  Recovery Phase&#10;If the Stalker skipped the Zone Phase completely, he may remove one injury marker. If he has 1 or more bracelets in his swag remove 1 additional injury marker.&#10;&#10;4.  End Phase&#10;The player may discard none, some, or all of his Stalker cards. Players may trade Stalker and Swag cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only 1 player is left alive or a new turn starts and there are no cards left in the Zone Deck. The winner is the last Stalker left alive or the one with the most Swag Points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A word or 2 is a board game based on the T.V. game show of the same name. It aired in South Africa from 1998 - 2008. It was adapted from Des chiffres et des lettres.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the player with the highest number of points after nine rounds: six word games, two number games, and one conundrum.&#10;&#10;Playing the game&#10;&#10;The Word Game&#10;Vowel and consonant cards are shuffled separately and placed face down in two piles. Taking turns, players 'call' either &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;vowel&quot;. A card from the corresponding pile is placed on the playing mat until all nine spaces have been filled. Players then attempt to form words using the letters before the timer runs out, with no letter being used more than once. The player with the longest word gets a point for each letter in the word, or 18 points if all the letters were used.&#10;&#10;The Number Game&#10;A randomiser is used to generate a number between 0 and 999. Players take turns calling for &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; value cards until Any or all of the selected number cards can be used to reach the target number, but numbers can only be used once. Permitted calculations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&#10;When the timer runs out, players announce their numbers. The player with the number closest to the target is awarded points as follows (provided the calculations were correct):&#10;10 points for reaching the target, 7 points if within 5 (inclusive), 5 points if within 10 (inclusive), 0 if beyond 10.&#10;&#10;The Conundrum round&#10;A list of 275 jumbled up nine-letter words are provided in the rule sheet. The first person to guess the anagram scores 10 points.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;The contestant with the most points at the end of all nine rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The family game Quatro Flash is one of these.&#10;&#10;The game rules are pretty simple, and the objective of &quot;four in a row&quot; sounds very familiar. There are actually a great many two-player games based on this principle. As a family game, though, this idea is amazingly new, suspenseful, and witty.&#10;&#10;Players proceed in turn. Each player places a disk of their color on the board. The object of the game is to arrange four of your disks in an uninterrupted row, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can be lined up on the same level, stacked on top of one another, or staggered as a stair-cased row.&#10;&#10;You need to follow the course of the game very attentively if you are to spot early enough a player's potential chances of winning and try to prevent this with one of your pieces.&#10;&#10;The temptation is great to disclose a player's possible chances and urge the other players to intervene, but this is not allowed. Creative conversation, however, cannot be prohibited completely.&#10;&#10;",

His deck can consist of three technique from the Hard style, and his ability allows him to suffer 1 damage in order to give his attacks Chain 1. Brahm is able to turn the Hard style in a combo heavy fighting form, at a cost. His mode action, Ragnar-Rock, makes it so that opponents no longer cancel his actions when he is damaged, but the tradeoff is that it prevents him from blocking. Brahm&rsquo;s Valhalla Block allows him to recover health that he may have willing suffered for those high damage combos. Health management is a key feature to Brahm playstyle.&#10;&#10;Cobalt, an Argentinian and elite ex-commando for the Red Star Committee, has a cybernetic arm that she uses to reposition and strike at her opponents from both near and far. This is represented best with blast actions that only last until the end of the challenge phase. For example when Dragging Hook&rsquo;s blast token hits a retreating opponent, Cobalt pulls the the opponent towards her space. Grappling Thrust on the other hand, will pull Cobalt closer to the opponent when they are hit by its blast token.&#10;&#10;The Brahm vs Cobalt fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions from the Push technique and Slam technique. The Push technique from the Hard style provides powerful attacks that push their target away, making it ideal for fighters wishing to distance themselves from an aggressive opponent. The Slam technique is one of the most physical sets of actions from the Fluid style that uses momentum to control the opponent&rsquo;s position in the arena.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 main locations located in the corners: Runner Entry, Stalker Entry, Satellite Uplink and Rebel Hideout. The centre 4 squares are known as the Intersection. In order to go from any corner location to any other corner location, you must first enter an intersection space.&#10;&#10;There are 4 Runners: Ben Richards, William Laughlin, Harold Weiss and Amber Mendez. There are 5 Stalkers: Subzero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball and Captain Freedom. Characters have 2, 3, 4 or 5 hits. When a character takes damage a damage counter is placed on it. If a character has more damage counters than hits, it is killed.&#10;&#10;Runners and Stalkers start the game at differing stages:&#10;&#10;      At the start of the game the Richards, Laughlin, and Weiss counters are placed on the Runner entry square. Subzero starts on the Stalker entry point. Mendez enters the game on turn 4. &#10;     If Subzero is killed, both Dynamo and Buzzsaw immediately enter the game zone otherwise Dynamo and Buzzsaw enter on turn 6.&#10;     If both Dynamo and Buzzsaw are killed, Fireball immediately enters, otherwise Fireball enters on turn 10. &#10;     If Fireball is killed, Captain Freedom immediately enters play, otherwise Captain Freedom enters on turn 14. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique deck of cards comprising, Move, Attack, Defence and Special cards.  Players take turns to draw three cards, place them in their hand and then play cards to move their own units and attack opposing units. &#10;&#10;     Move cards are used (discarded) to manoeuvre a player&rsquo;s units around the board.  A unit may make a max of 2 moves in a turn and must move the entire distance described by the move card or not at all.  &#10;     Attack cards are used to make attacks against opposing units in the same space. A unit may make up to 2 attacks in a turn. &#10;     Defence cards are played to negate an attack.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when all Stalkers are killed or all Runners are either killed or escaped. &#10;&#10;     The Stalkers win if all of the Runners are killed. &#10;     The Runners get a minor victory if 1 or more of them make it to the Rebel Hideout. &#10;     The runners get a major victory if 1 or more of them makes it first to the Satellite Uplink and then the Hideout. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The other player is the Holnists.&#10;&#10;The map shows about 40 owns linked by roads and includes other features such as rivers, forests, and mountains. The distance between two adjacent towns linked by a road is called a space. Towns have a rating of either small, medium, or large (which affects recruit rolls).&#10;&#10;There are a variety of different types of units each of which have four differing statistics:&#10;&#10;     Move - the maximum number of spaces the unit can move in a turn. &#10;     Fight - when rolling the D6 to attack, a roll of this number or higher will kill an enemy unit in the same town. &#10;     Sneak &ndash; a unit may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units. To do this, it must roll this number or higher on a D6. This stat is also used to retreat from an enemy that enters a unit&rsquo;s location. &#10;     Recruit - when rolling the D6 to recruit, a roll of this number or higher will convert a militia in the town into one of the player&rsquo;s unit types. &#10;&#10;&#10;A regular 52 card deck is used. The Postmen can use red cards. The Holnists can use black cards. Cards are played to influence dice rolls and statistics or to generate special events.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with the The Postmen going first. Each turn is divided up into five phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move Phase&#10;          Units can move a number of spaces up to their move stat rating and may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units by rolling their sneak number or higher on a D6. &#10;    &#10;     Fight Phase&#10;          If opposing units are in the same town, they will fight. All units get to make one attack and all attacks are simultaneous. &#10;    &#10;     Recruit Phase&#10;         Each unit may make 1 recruit roll if it occupies a town with 1 or more militia in order to convert 1 militia in the town into one of its unit types. &#10;    &#10;     Militia Phase&#10;         If a town is unoccupied by Postman or Holnist Units roll 1D6 to see whether a militia unit appears. &#10;    &#10;     Mail Phase&#10;         Draw 2 cards. Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to destroy the opposing Leader Unit.&#10;&#10;",

Players accumulate supplies and advantages in several different categories.  While this goes on players eliminate different end of the world scenarios until only one remains. The remaining scenario will favour certain types of stockpile categories which will determine victory conditions.&#10;&#10;There are 2 common decks: &#10;&#10;     Stockpile Deck: This deck contains 10 cards in each of 13 different stockpile categories: Weapons, Food, Animals, Vehicles, Plants, Knowledge, Medicine, Shelter, Trade, Water, Power, Cold and Equipment. Each category of cards has two cards each of values 3 to 7.&#10;     Scenario Deck: The scenario deck contains 20 cards giving a description of the stockpile categories advantageous in overcoming it (e.g. Zombie Apocalypse = Weapons x3, Vehicles x3)&#10;&#10;&#10;To start flip over all the scenario cards face up and spread them over the centre of the table so that all of them are visible.  The top 5 cards of the stockpile deck are also flipped.&#10;&#10;There are 3 stages: &#10;&#10;     Prepping Stage: Players take turns with to flip over the top card of the stockpile deck and take 1 of the face-up stockpile cards and put it face-down in their stockpile. Players can look at their own stockpile cards but not their opponents. Move to Scenario Stage if there are no more face-up stockpile cards. &#10;     Scenario Stage: Players take turns to pick one of the face-up scenario cards and put it face-down in a discard pile. When there is only one scenario left, it becomes the End of the World Scenario (EOTWS) and play continues to the scoring stage. &#10;     Scoring Stage: The EOTWS will list categories that receive a bonus card value multiplier. For example: if it is the Zombie Apocalypse, all your Weapons cards and Vehicle cards are worth 3 times as much.  For every category you have zero cards in, get -5 points. Your final score is equal to the total point value of all your stockpile cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

It was about &quot;DaDaoCheng&quot;, an area in Taiwan which was not only the business center of Taipei in the 1920s and 1930s, but is also now one of the most cultural tourist site with beautifully renovated architectures and shops, cafes and galleries. The painting is now one of the most important art pieces of Taiwan and in the collection of Taipei Fine Arts Museum.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now you get to move your piece whose number matches that sum, and so on until you've run out of bonus moves.

How many depends on how much more lemonade you sold this quarter than your opponent. A business unit which has the most upgrades in the game - and that's what makes the game interesting - gives you a certain advantage.&#10;&#10;But pay attention, not every business card can immediately upgrade your company. If you still sell your lemonade for 50 cents in the neighborhood you probably will not need the lemon squeezer ultra 9000 yet. If there is nothing in your interest you can let yourself cash out and use the money on later markets. It is quite important to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing because before you know it he &quot;strikes&quot; all your niches and wins the game. If the legal way doesn't work you can also get the black &quot;illegal cards&quot; from the market to gain mad advantages.&#10;&#10;Squeeze is the kind of game you want to play in every lunch break. It takes around 10 minutes and invites to an immediate revanche. It is perfectly made for two players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Citizens of Gotham, pay close attention! Things may never be the same again&hellip;&#10;Since the release of the Batman Miniature Game five years ago, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of changes here at Knight Models. The games has gone from strength-to-strength, with a hardback core rulebook, two expansions, and the successful launch of the Batmatch organized play rules, helping to grow our amazing community around the world.&#10; We are delighted to announce the arrival of the 2nd Edition Batman Miniature Game rules. &#10;This free downloadable PDF rulebook is the culmination of thousands of games, and feedback from our customers. &#10;Fear not: it is still the game you know and love, with its street-level strategic action in Gotham&rsquo;s darkened alleyways, but we&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to streamline the mechanics, making the rules more intuitive and even more fun, and we&rsquo;ve consolidated a lot of hard-to- find rules and Traits into one mighty tome. We think players new and old will love it!&#10; But that&rsquo;s not all &ndash; far from it! The launch of the new edition is spearheaded by brand new miniatures, representing the pinnacle of our studio&rsquo;s output. The new models are produced in high-quality, coloured resin. Knight Models was founded on a love of display-quality models, and we think painters and modelers will agree that these new miniatures are the best we&rsquo;ve ever produced.&#10;&#10;The Batman Miniature Game is a skirmish game based on the broad Batman universe. You can command one of the most famous criminal bands in Gotham City to expand your territory and control the underworld, or stop their evil plans with the Dark Knight and his allies.&#10;&#10;The game includes the most important characters created by Bob Kane, like Batman himself, Robin, Nightwing, etc. aided by the Gotham City Police trying to stop the gangs led by the most infamous criminals and psychopaths of the DC Comics universe, like The Joker, Penguin, Two-Face and many others.&#10;&#10;Knight Models team has created incredibly detailed miniatures to accurately portray these characters and their sidekicks in 35mm scale ready to assemble and paint. This is a licensed and official DC Comics product.&#10;&#10;Here are just a few changes to the game for the new 2nd Edition:&#10; Bat Cape (1SC, Passive)&#10;As long as it is able to spend a Special Counter, the model will not take Damage, be Knocked Down, nor become a Casualty as a result of Falling or Jumping. In addition, the model may Leap Down without spending the MC, and without using any of its total movement allowance.&#10; Mixed Combat Style (2SC)&#10;The model may perform a close combat attack action and a free ranged attack action in the same activation this round (no Action Counters are required for the ranged attack).&#10;&#10;The actions Run and Spring into the Air are disappearing. This was a difficult decision, because we wanted to limit the number of Movement Actions &#10;and enhance the ones without changes, giving us a set of Movement Actions solid as concrete.&#10; We also bring forward changes that affect Speedsters.&#10;In 2nd Edition, with the new changes shown on older teasers, we believe that more Speedsters will appear in the game board, and will have to manage their Speed Force Counters more accurately.&#10;With this new rule, Action Counters will be determinant in their game:&#10; Fatigue&#10;When a model with the Speedster trait has not any Action Counter, it suffers -1 to Movement and Defense Basic Skills.&#10; With all of this, we thought that Speed Force Master needed a little update:&#10; Speed Force Master&#10;This model can spend up to 2 Speed Power Counters during the round like Action Counters.&#10;&#10;These are just a few of the traits that have been improved for the 2nd edition.&#10;&#10;",

A player starts by choosing an easy or difficult card. He then draws a card from each different deck available, A, B and C showing it only to his teammate. Those cards have different identities in order 1, 2 and 3. The other team, without knowing and seeing the cards has to choose 3 numbers between 1 and 3, which will be the sequence of the identities that the previous team must try to describe.   &#10;You then have to describe those identities to your teammate. If he correctly guess an easy identity he scores 1 points, and if he guess a difficult one he will score 3 points.   &#10;The team who scores more points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's a Thursday afternoon on the Plain of Shinar, and once again there is nothing to do. (History hasn't been invented yet much less bowling!) It looks like another wasted day. But then one of your buddies has a bright idea! &quot;Let's build a tower all the way up to heaven!&quot; he says. &quot;Sure, I've got nothing better to do&quot; you reply. And so the legend begins . . .&#10;&#10;Building Babel is a card game for 3-6 players in which, working together, they try to successfully build the fabled Tower of Babel. In so doing players will also be trying to get more recognition for their efforts than the others do. Throughout the process God will be trying to stop them?&#10;&#10;All that is required is 1 deck of playing cards and a handful of markers/tokens for each player. The cards are considered to be of two types &ndash; &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; cards (2 to J) which are used to construct the Tower, and &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; cards (Q, K, A) which disrupt the construction process.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and a hand of cards dealt to each player (hand size is determined by the number of players). The rest of the cards form a draw pile.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to play as follows:&#10;&#10;     The active player plays a valid &quot;Brick&quot; Card on the Tower. These must be placed in order. The base of the tower is a row of four 2s. Next up will be the 3s and so on until the top row is filled with the Jacks. There must always be at least two more cards on any uncompleted level below the one being played to. If a player completes a row in the tower, they place one of their tokens beside it. This will show who put the most effort into the project, come the end of the game!&#10;     If they cannot play a &quot;Brick&quot; card the active player must play an &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; card (if they have one).  The effect of the cards are as follows:&#10;         ACES: The next player misses their turn.&#10;         QUEEN: The order of game play is reversed (e.g. from left to right.)&#10;         KING: The last &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; Card played is taken off the tower and is shuffled into the draw pile.  Additionally when the first King card is played all game related talking between players must stop due to confusion of the languages.  When the fourth King card is played the game is over! &#10;    &#10;     When the player has played their card (Brick or Act of God) they pick up the top card of the draw pile, their turn is over and play passes to the next player.&#10;     If they have no &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; or &ldquo;Act of God&quot; card to play the player must pass their turn. If the player was forced to pass their turn they cannot draw a card. On the turn after a player has passed, they may choose to shuffle up to half of their cards (round down) into the draw pile and replace them with an equal number then drawn from the top of the deck. That player's turn is then over.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues until the tower is completed or the fourth King appears at which point God stops the project.  In the event that tower is finished all players win, but the player with the most tokens beside the Tower is the big winner!  However, if the fourth King card is played before this happens then everyone loses but the player with the most tokens beside the tower is the biggest loser for have put so much effort into a failed project.&#10;&#10;",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But the streets, the language, and the eerie, dark tunnels aren't the only foreign elements at play. There's something distinctly otherworldly in the Parisian catacombs&hellip;&#10;&#10;In The Pallid Mask scenario, you and your fellow investigators will enter these tunnels in search of a stranger whom you believe must be connected to the events surrounding the performance of The King in Yellow at the Ward Theatre in Arkham. But with each new strange twist and turn, you'll find yourselves only stepping deeper into mystery. Perhaps you can follow the tunnels all the way to the pulsing heart of the play's mysteries, but there's a chance, too, you'll simply find yourselves lost amid the shifting landscape. What begins as a trek through moist and clammy tunnels of stone may become a journey that leads you under the earth, through The Gate to Hell, and straight to your demise at the Well of Souls or some other forgotten chamber.&#10;&#10;Destined to be a fan-favorite, the scenario from The Pallid Mask utilizes the game's locations in a novel way, bringing them into play only as you travel through them, and arranging them in a constantly shifting and unpredictable fashion. Each new step through these labyrinths could be your last.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Years spent leading the charge whether it be onto naval vessels or merchant junks has refined Ryota&rsquo;s skills into a well honed tool that the Jung prize highly.

When deep in his cups he will tell any that will stop to listen to him, boasts from catching whales of unfathomable size to wild and fantastical sea creatures. The truth is Yori is no better with the harpoon than anyone else, however he has learnt to be resourceful in battle. He always has sake on hand and uses it to bolster his own and others' confidence when combat ensues.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
