    "Description": "Welcome to the forest of Viaud, a forgotten place with a dungeon in its center. The rediscovery of this dungeon and the treasures it conceals has led to an influx of many peoples to take control of it. &#10;Everyone has established their camp on the edge of the forest, ready to do battle, to settle a new economy and to reign on the ways to establish their power in this place. Skirmishes will take place, the most courageous peoples will dare to build outposts, will recruit units as close as possible to the dungeon and their opponents. &#10;Each people has its special abilities, a season that makes it stronger, but how long will the current season last and when will yours come? No one can master these elements. At each turn, you will discover a punctual, ephemeral power, to be optimized as best as possible to develop yourself or fight your opponents!&#10;&#10;Battles For A Dungeon is a strategy and placement game. As in all the games created by Mathieu Roussignol, the freedom of the players is huge, your choices have a strong impact on the other players&rsquo; strategies, no dice are to be rolled, the luck is present but very limited. You will find here an easy accessibility for a game including a lot of possible strategies. Peoples have perfectly balanced asymmetric powers/characteristics, so that everyone can play as he wants and has the same chance to win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Kingdom Series Board Game follows the books of The Kingdom Series and The Knights of Arrethtrae very closely. A familiarity with the books will lead to a quick understanding of how the game is played.&#10;&#10;The Kingdom of Arrethtrae is divided into thirty territories. At the beginning of the game, each territory is occupied and controlled by the Dark Knight and his Shadow Warriors. The mission is to retake as many of the territories for the Prince as possible before He returns on His ship as He journeys from the Kingdom Across the Sea. It will take Him ten rounds of play to reach the city of Chessington. Once the Prince reaches the docks at Chessington, the game is over. Every knight has the opportunity to retake one territory on each turn by battling against Shadow Warriors and possibly creatures. If a knight is able to retake a territory on his turn, he will acquire a precious resource or weapon to help fight future battles. A knight will usually not know the scope of the battle until he or she enters the territory and draws a battle card. The knight may face a single Shadow Warrior, multiple Shadow Warriors, creatures, and even a Stronghold. Weapons and resources will be necessary to retake a territory with creatures or Strongholds.&#10;&#10;One to six players can play the game, but there will always be six knights represented on the board. For example, if there is only one player, he will control all six of the knights. If there are three players, each player will control two knights. For four or five players, one or two of the players must control two knights or those knights can be controlled by all players jointly. All six knights are encouraged to work together and strategize on how to recover as many territories as possible. Only through teamwork and keen strategy is a team of knights successful. Victory occurs in varying degrees, for each territory and its people are precious to the Prince. Ultimate victory occurs when all thirty territories are recovered before the Prince arrives.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Following the initial release of SPQR in 2019, we have been inundated with player feedback concerning the game mechanics. It is always important that we take into account the wisdom of practising wargamers and humbly recognise some of the issues raised by players in the SPQR community. We have this taken some of those suggestions and reworked and streamlined the game system to alleviate these issues, as well as rebalancing and tweaking unit point structures to promote overall balance.&#10;&#10;In SPQR, players take command of a warband and lead it to victory, glory, and legend! &#10;With a lightning fast and easy-to-play system, SPQR allows you to build a complete warband capable of scouting out enemy armies, clashing across borders, and conducting raids on farms and villages.&#10;&#10;SPQR also includes a complete campaign system, so you can watch as your heroes rise in stature and warband increases in size, while each warband features specialised scenarios to reflect its own tactics and methods of waging war.&#10;&#10;Hire mercenaries or lead your fierce troops with Heroes of Legend - let nothing stand in your way as you conquer all for the glory of your nation and the gods themselves!&#10;&#10;Complete warband lists are included for:&#10;&#10;     Caesar's Legions&#10;     Gaul&#10;     Dacia &amp; Sarmatia&#10;     Imperial Rome&#10;     Britain&#10;     Germania&#10;     Macedonia&#10;     Athens&#10;     Sparta&#10;     Thebes&#10;     Persia&#10;     Iberia&#10;&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Clay poker chips are stacked on a central, circular wooden board in 3 stacks of 16 chips of randomly mixed colors (5 colors, RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW, BLACK).  Traditional values are generally assigned to the colors (i.e. RED = $5), but some color values can change for particular players based on various bonuses awarded.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with opportunities to TAKE one poker chip for themselves from the top of any one stack or GIVE one to another player from the top of any one stack.  The latter action is only constructive for winning because on the GIVER's next turn, it awards him the bonus of taking exactly 2 chips from the top of any combination of stacks (or 2 from the top of the same stack); once per round they may even take 3 chips in the same manner.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds until rounds equal to the number of players are played. Each round, values are tallied; the final accumulative highest grand total tally wins.&#10;&#10;This is mostly a strategy game with not much luck, except for the initial set-up that offers a bit of luck; this is balanced by letting each player start a round in a game.&#10;&#10;TOMA: Take;  DACA: Give  (in Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;re primarily a Wheat farmer but are now experimenting with other crops as the market has become saturated. You've narrowed your choices between Rice, Oats, Corn, Barley or Quinoa to add to your harvest in hopes of getting ahead of the market and to turn a better profit. However, the competition is experimenting with the same philosophy. Can you outthink your neighbors and develop a strategy that yields a better return? Or will you fall victim to your poor investment decisions?&#10;&#10;Supporting up to 9 players, Agronomy is the deck building game that combines the reality of life on the farm with real world economics. Each player begins the game with a deck of 8 wheat and 2 random specialty crops. Every round, players take their turns simultaneously and reveal their hands to determine the market value of each crop. Investing in equipment cards will either increase the quantity of your crops or decrease the cost of purchasing additional crops. Market cards will directly affect the value of your crops and in some cases your opponent's. Research cards will either disrupt your opponent's game play or enhance your own. With 24 different cards to choose from, players will randomly choose 3 cards from each category to create a different and exciting challenge each game. Each player has a common goal of being the first to reach $60, but every dollar spent takes you further away from goal. So invest wisely.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The battle composed of a series of vicious counterattacks that ended, after much blood spilling, pushing the Republican army to the left bank of the river it had crossed 4 months before.&#10;&#10;The game is a Battalion level simulation of the battle, played on a hexagonal grid with hexides spanning 500 meters and 8 hour turns. The turns consist of successive divisional activations and separate air and administrative phases. The scenarios depict five of the bloody counter-offensives that took place between August and October 1938.&#10;&#10;Status markers and air operations are handled in separate charts. Maneuver, morale, intelligence, enemy reaction and divisional assets play a significant part in the battle management. Combat resolution is interactive and fluid, maximizing unpredictability.&#10;&#10;The game includes a set of rules, one scenario booklet, one A2 map, three air operations charts, ten corps asset charts, and three, two sided, counter sheets. One six sided die and, optionally, two opaque cups are also required.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

He repeats the process by drawing an action card and turning the spinner again, which determines the action to be mimed (for example: THE LION PAINTS).&#10;At this point he proceeds with the mime (one or two minutes of time can be set, at the competitors' choice).&#10;The game stops either at the end of the time or when a contestant guesses both the subject and the action he is performing. In the latter case, both the mime and the first contestant to guess win a token. If no one guesses, no tokens are awareded. The game then continues in the same way counter-clockwise from the last one who mimed.

    "Description": "Tautot&igrave; is a creative writing game based on tautograms, a puzzle game that consists in forming sentences or compositions whose words start with the same letter. The youngest player draws an inspiration card and, immediately after, a letter card. He places them in the center of the table, clearly visible to all players. Then turn the hourglass: each player has the task, in the time of the hourglass, to write on his blackboard a meaningful sentence containing at least one subject represented in the inspiration card. One point is counted for each word in the sentence that begins with the letter drawn. One point is subtracted from this sum for each word that does not have the required initial. If, while composing a sentence, you come to a net of 5 words with the same initial, the score doubles. The game continues with another round of play (the player to the right of the last one draws the inspiration card and the letter card, and so on...). The winner is the one who reaches, first, the score of 35 points (or more, as chosen by the players before starting the game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is based on the memory palace technique, which consists in remembering elements by associating them with known spaces. In this game there are 40 cards set in 8 different rooms of a house. Each card has an out of context object placed in the given environment. Each room has 5 points of interest.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to remember in sequence the &quot;out of context&quot; object of each tile. The player is facilitated when associating the objects to be remembered to the various rooms and points of interest in the house.&#10;&#10;Challenge mode. Each player takes a coloured scoreboard card. The picture cards are shuffled and equally distributed to each player. The remaining cards are set aside. The players place their cards face down in a horizontal row in front of them. The youngest player starts by turning the cards over in their sequence and carefully observing the &quot;out of context&quot; objects for 30 seconds. Then they turns the cards face down again and begins to remember the sequence out loud, naming the objects from left to right and then turning the corresponding card face up for verification, and so on until the end of the row of cards. Each guessed object is worth one point. At the first mistake the player will have to stop and pass the turn to the next player in clockwise order who will play in the same way. At the end of the round, the game goes on until one of the players reaches 20 points (always waiting for the end of the round, so that all players have completed the same number of turns).&#10;&#10;Knockout mode. Arrange the cards in a row in the center of the table in multiples of 8, from one to five rows depending on the desired difficulty. All players observe the series for 30 seconds. At the end the youngest player turns the cards face down and begins to remember the sequence, naming the subject on each card and then turning the card over for verification. At the first mistake, the uncovered tiles are turned face down once again and the second player begins. The first player who remembers all the objects wins.&#10;&#10;",

Teams work with, not against, one another. A member of TEAM 1 acts out a charade on his team card while TEAM 2 guesses, then a member of TEAM 2 acts while TEAM 1 guesses.&#10;&#10;The charades in each round round do not have to be performed in any particular order. Each performer is free to act out the charade of his choice, and may seek the help of other team members if stuck.&#10;&#10;The game has been designed to play in one evening.&#10;&#10;VARIATIONS&#10;1. Instead of the performer choosing the charade he will act out, have the other team pick a number.&#10;2. Certain charades might be taken on as a group project, with team members acting together to achieve the desired effect.&#10;&#10;",

Getting connections is as simple as landing on the space, then reading and voting on a statement. You get a connection when the majority agrees with you! You will need money for expenses and to pay for Passport Stamps. Luckily, there are cards that can help you in numerous ways - by moving you across continents in one move, winning a lottery, and even getting free Passport Stamps!

Only the might of the Royal Navy stands between him and the British Isles &ndash; that and Napoleon&rsquo;s own meddling in international politics. Austria and Russia, thrust into the welcoming embrace of Britain, mobilize their forces... Will the British forge a Grand Coalition and annihilate Napoleon&rsquo;s armies in one decisive battle? Or will the Emperor force his enemies to submit after a series of dazzling campaigns?&#10;&#10;Pursuit of Victory is a 2-player game of military conquest and diplomatic realignment, of bold action and meticulous planning, playable in a couple of hours. Napoleon will have to face an ever-shifting combination of European powers, consider the fate of Spanish and Polish people, and keep an eye on small, but mobile British forces. Britain will have to contain Napoleon&rsquo;s ambitions, stoke the fire of Spanish insurrection, subsidize their allies and wait for an opportunity to strike a crucial blow against the French.&#10; In Pursuit of Victory players simultaneously play two cards. One for its initiative value and up to two actions, and the other one for its various military and diplomatic effects. Each player has a hand of 10 cards and playing any given card makes it unavailable for next 2-3 turns. And there are always the two national questions looming ahead. The French can recreate Poland and take over Spain, but will the gains outweigh the costs?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A simple task at first, but once Winter wanes, the challenge is increased as David will have to learn to farm, make traps to catch small animals, and eventually learn to hunt to survive. Along the way, learn about Davids story from his past and why he must survive.&#10;&#10;In WOODS there are no heroes. Just you, the elements, and the will to survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In CATAN, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn, dice are rolled to determine what resources &mdash; sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore &mdash; the island produces. Players spend these resources to build settlements, roads, and cities and to purchase development cards that have different effects. Each settlement and city you have is worth points, and you can gain additional points by building the longest road, acquiring the largest army, or collecting certain development cards. The first player to collect 10 points wins.&#10;&#10;In CATAN: 3D Edition, the island of Catan rises off the table for an immersive experience like no other. Your settlements grow from fertile grain fields, and your cities nestle into the sides of majestic mountains. The look of the land is based on terrain tiles hand-sculpted by game designer Klaus Teuber. All of the terrain is hand-painted for stunning color, and the intricately-designed player pieces are antiqued for a look that's full of history and character.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note that this is the same game as CATAN, but a decision has been made to keep the entry separate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Close Call is a tile drawing, grid-management game for 1-2 players.  You play the role of an air traffic controller, guiding aircraft to their destination while avoiding disaster.&#10;&#10;Your airspace is represented on the game board by a 13 x 9 rectangular grid.  Aircraft of various types, chosen randomly from 72 double-sided tiles, continually enter your airspace, moving according to their pre-determined flight plans.  As they travel across the sky in all directions, you can make slight adjustments to their paths.  Your ultimate goal is to safely guide them to their destination, but the number of adjustments you can make is limited, and new aircraft enter your airspace every round.&#10;&#10;In the Solo Game, you earn points by safely guiding aircraft to their home destinations.  Earn enough points and you&rsquo;ll impress your boss and win the game.  Make a wrong decision, though, and the aircraft may be involved in a Close Call, requiring them to be grounded and putting a permanent stain on your performance record.  Too many of those and you&rsquo;ll ultimately get fired&mdash;and lose the game.&#10;&#10;To add to the challenge, there are also hot air balloon tiles in the bag.  Balloons move with the wind, which can change directions each round.  You can&rsquo;t control the balloons&mdash;your only recourse is to guide the other aircraft around them.  And if that&rsquo;s not enough of a challenge, you can choose to add a drone, which moves randomly, radar interference zones, which prevent you from making any adjustments, and flight plan changes, which alter the home destination for an aircraft.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player variant, you compete with another air traffic controller to determine who&rsquo;s better at your job.  You each control your own fleet of aircraft as well as a neutral set.  There are two ways to win:  Perform well enough to convince your boss you&rsquo;re the best, or cause your opponent to look so bad that they get fired.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(There just wasn't space on the card for the British who were basically backup anyway.)&#10;&#10;A VERY simplified combat odds calculation system with an 50% chance of survival for any otherwise doomed unit, including even 14th Cavalry Group which was supposed to hold the Losheim Gap (obvious) offensive gateway, and which was stretched thin there, at that.&#10;&#10;Includes the push-your-luck 50% Pressed Attack/Desperate Defense combat option which can shift the odds one level for ... or against ... you.&#10;&#10;As in Postcard Barbarossa! and most of my other games, the Recovery from Disruption phase arises at different points for different unit types which can be critical.&#10;&#10;&quot;Those damned Engineers!&quot; blowing bridges can bring an early German breakthrough to an unforeseen halt, though.&#10;&#10;A Chinese translation to be worked up.&#10;&#10;NOTE: As long as you keep (only) my copyright statement, its Dedication, and my war&amp;history quotes on it, you are - ANYone is - free to print off copies of my English language edition in postcard - 4&quot;x6&quot;/A6 or 5&quot;x8&quot;/A5 - format to send to family and friends or whomever.&#10;&#10;Of course, for your own personal copy, you will want to photocopy-enlarge its pieces and especially its mapboard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
