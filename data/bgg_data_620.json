Beginning learners often practice the parts that make up a html document, but many times, do not put together entire documents. The game will help students see how to construct entire documents. It will provide opportunities to try various ways of constructing html documents. It will also serve to aid retention of the structure of html.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play all of the cards in your pile. All players use the center piles to build documents. There may be up to four documents in the center area. When a document is closed, by playing a card, the cards are removed from the center area and a new document can be built in its place. Documents begin with a card. All documents must have: a title, a header, a picture, text, a link. Play continues until one player has played the last card in their pile and become a winner.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;212 cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(Text by the publisher) Bildsch&ouml;ne Wortspiele is a compact collection of 8 card games that deal with images and associated words. The set contains 100 cards (90 photos, 6 jokers, 4 blancs), 4 cards with suggestions for words, 1 booklet with rules and examples.&#10;The principal mechanism is very simple: You form compounds by combining the words that you associate with two or more photos. A photo doesn&rsquo;t represent only one word. For instance, for the photo that shows an eagle you can also say &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;, or &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;claw&quot;, or &quot;animal&quot; and so on. Thus, in combination with other cards in the set, you can form numerous words such as &quot;bird bath&quot;, &quot;bird table&quot;, &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;game bird&quot;, &quot;pack animal&quot;, &quot;stuffed animal&quot;, &quot;animal farm&quot;, &quot;animal world&quot; and so on.&#10;The games can be played on all language levels. The selection of the photos ensures that you can form a large number of compounds within the range of basic vocabulary. Also, you can extend the linguistic range deliberately in terms of code, style and special languages.&#10;In educational contexts the games cannot only be used for vocabulary training. It is also possible to train more subtle competences such as abstract thinking (eagle &gt; bird &gt; animal), the perception of paralleles and differences (bird: bird of prey vs. singing bird), style and narrating (you put down one card after another and let narrate / narrate yourself).&#10;You can play most of the games either in competition or in coordination. Some of the games you can even play on your own. Depending on which game is played, the emphasis is on speed, concentration, memory, or wit. All the games are a challenge to imagination.&#10;The games are suited for cross-generational, highly communicative playing within the family.

    "Description": "&quot;The Austro-Prussian War (1866) was fought between the Austrian Empire on one side, and Prussia and the Kingdom of Italy on the other side.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The largest naval engagement occurred near the island of Lissa in the Adriatic Sea.  There an Austrian fleet of ironclads and steam powered wooden ships fought a larger Italian fleet.  The Austrians caught the Italians unprepared and succeeded in 'crossing the T' of the Italian fleet.  The heavy side belt armor of the ironclads was invulnerable to gunnery, and the most effect offensive tactic was ramming.  The Austrian fleet emerged victorious.&quot;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students. The game is designed to be played on a 5x9 foot table using miniature ships.

Wellington would begin his winning streak in Spain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Salamanca was the most decisive battle of the entire war which smashed Marshal Marmont`s French army. Although the war would continue for two more years, the French were put on the defensive, as the British, Portuguese and Spanish troops harassed the French until they were pushed back over the Pyrenees mountains into France.&quot;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students.

The suits are four different types of illusions commonly performed by late-Victorian era stage magicians and you'll need an &quot;aha!&quot; idea card of a suit and a card of values 1,2 and 3 of the same suit to perform (put into play) an illusion to earn Prestige Points points. There are 16 different magicians to play, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, optional trait cards, and the all important Events (fate) deck that you both need and dread.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The space ship Himmelsziege travels through space, trying to evade the dangerous black holes. &#10;One player is the route planner, another is the captain. The planner reveals three route cards, and secretly blocks one of them with a magnet on the underside of the board. The captain then chooses one of the route, and the planner tells the captain about one other route that is not blocked. The captain then has the option to change the route. &#10;Afterwards, a small metal ball is rolled from a ramp at the starting point toward the destination. If it passes the magnet, it is stopped and caught by the black hole.&#10;&#10;Depending on the outcome and on whether the route had been changed, chips in different colors are awarded to the players. The goal of the game is to collect chips, but mainly to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Object of the Game&#10;&#10;The overall object of the game is to be the player with the best deal on a home. The best deal is determined by the total cost of purchasing the home less the total value of the home.&#10;&#10;Each mini-game contributes to the total cost and/or total value of the home which is recorded on the home buyer's contract. At the conclusion of the games, the cost and value of each home is calculated, producing a winner(s).&#10;&#10;Each mini-game has a contributory goal to the overall goal.&#10;&#10;In Mortgage Mambo, the mini-game goal is to get as many loan offers as possible and then to select from those offers.&#10;&#10;In Realtor Roundup, the mini-game goal is to get to the best realtor and therefore get the largest number of buyer incentives.&#10;&#10;In Inspection Perfection, the mini-game goal is to increase the cost or decrease the value of your opponents Home Buyer's Contract.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;House Hunt General Rules&#10;&#10;For both single player games and games of two or more.&#10;&#10;1. Each player should take a blank Home Buyer's contract. Each player will need a pen or pencil to record results on their home buyer's contract.&#10;   2. Select one Home Profile from the set of Home Profile cards. Each player will use the same home profile as a starting part for their home contract.&#10;   3. Each player then uses a pencil to fill out their home-buyer's contract with the information from the home profile card.&#10;   4. For a complete game, play in the following order:&#10;          * Mortgage Mambo&#10;          * Realtor Roundup&#10;          * Inspection Perfection&#10;   5. You may also play each game by itself or skip one or two of the games. If Inspection Perfection is played, it should always be played last.&#10;&#10;Realtor Roundup and Mortgage Mambo Rules&#10;&#10;For two or more players:&#10;&#10;1. Select one side of the draw box for the game you are playing to pull cards from.&#10;   2. Place the END GAME marker in the middle of the draw box For a longer game, place it closer to the side opposite where you will draw from.&#10;   3. All player tokens begin at START.&#10;   4. Select one player to be first. This is the current player.&#10;   5. The player on the right of the current player draws a task card from the draw box and asks the current player the question on the outside of the card.&#10;   6. If the current player requests a hint, the player on the right opens the card and reads the hint (usually a set of multiple choice answers).&#10;   7. The number of spaces a player may move is stated on each task card and depends on whether the current player got the answer right and whether a hint was used. Follow the directions on the task cards.&#10;   8. When a player lands on a space with directions, the player should follow those directions prior to the next player taking a turn.&#10;   9. When a current player's turn is over, play proceeds clockwise to the next player, who becomes the current player.&#10;&#10;For single players:&#10;&#10;1. Set up play as for two or more players.&#10;   2. Draw task cards and answer the questions.&#10;   3. If you need a hint, open the task card enough to see the hint while still obscuring the answer.&#10;   4. When you've answered the question, open the card completely to confirm if your answer is correct.&#10;   5. Move your token as directed and record any changes to your home buyer's contract.&#10;&#10;Inspection Perfection Rules&#10;&#10;For two or more players only.&#10;&#10;1. Shuffle Inspection Deck. Each player should take four (4) cards from the deck, making certain not to show the cards to other players.&#10;   2. There are two objectives to this game. The first is to discard all of your cards. The second is to ask other players questions that you think they don't know, forcing them to pick up another card from the pile and to receive a penalty which will affect their home buyer's contract.&#10;   3. Play proceeds as follows:&#10;          * A player chooses a card from his/her hand and asks any other player the question on the card.&#10;          * If the questioned player gets the answer correct, s/he receives the reward specified on the card.&#10;          * If the questioned player gets the answer wrong, s/he receives the penalty specified on the card and must draw a card from the inspection pile.&#10;          * In either case, the questioning player discards the card in the common discard pile.&#10;   4. Play then proceeds to the player on the left of the player who just asked the question.&#10;   5. When one player has no more cards, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Ending The Games&#10;&#10;At the end of the games, complete the calculations on your home buyer's contract. The person with the best deal wins.&#10;&#10;",

The teams do this by landing on the clues and/or stealing clues from other teams.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;1. Put one electron card on each electron space on the board.&#10;   2. Place the mystery element envelope on the mystery element box on the board.&#10;   3. Put the question cards on the question box on the board.&#10;   4. Pick a game piece and place it in the nucleus.&#10;   5. Distribute markers and periodic table folders to each team.&#10;&#10;Playing Game - read all directions before playing&#10;&#10;1. BEGINNING PLAY - Each team rolls a die. The highest number goes first.&#10;   2. One at a time, all teams must answer a question card correctly to cross from the nucleus to the first shell.&#10;   3. If answered incorrectly, wait until your next turn to try again. You must answer the question correctly to leave the nucleus and start playing.&#10;   4. After your team has correctly answered a question card, move your piece from the nucleus along one of the bridges and remain there until your next turn.&#10;   5. CONTINUING PLAY - On your next turn, roll the die and travel in any direction along that shell.&#10;   6. ELECTRON CARDS - When you land on an electron clue card, pick up the card and share it only with your team.  Use your periodic table to mark off elements that the clue eliminates.  Once an electron clue card is picked up, the space becomes null.&#10;   7. QUESTION BRIDGES - Use the question card bridges to travel to available clue cards in different shells. You must answer the question correctly to use the question card bridge.&#10;   8. ELEMENT SYMBOL/DIAGRAM SPACES - If you land on an element symbol, jump to the corresponding element diagram, and vice versa.&#10;   9. WINNING THE GAME - Once your team thinks they have determined the mystery element, travel back to the nucleus, answering question cards correctly to travel across the bridges and rolling the die. It is not necessary to land in the nucleus by an exact roll of the die.  Once in the nucleus, you may announce your guess and check the envelope. If you are right, you win! If you are wrong, place the card back in the envelope, your team is out and the game continues with the other teams.&#10;&#10;",

Each player must reach the finish, or &ldquo;Lights Out,&rdquo; and the player with the fewest calories at &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Caloric Consequences&#10;&#10;OBJECT: The object of Caloric Consequences is to get through a day of meals and activities (from Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to Lights Out) with the fewest total calories.&#10;&#10;SETUP: Place the cards in the appropriate places on the board and distribute one notepad, one pencil, and one game-piece to each player. The game is for 2&ndash;4 players, ages 21 and up.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;1.           All players roll the die. The player with the highest roll goes first, then the turn passes to the right.&#10;&#10;2.           All players start on Wake Up &amp; Smell the Coffee.&#10;&#10;3.           The active player rolls the die once during a turn and moves his or her piece according to the number indicated.&#10;&#10;4.           The player to the left of the active player draws a card from the stack that corresponds to the space the active player lands on and reads the scenario and the options, NOT the calories.&#10;&#10;5.           The active player MUST choose one of the options. (It can be assumed that all of the food and drink options on a card are of the same serving size.)&#10;&#10;6.           The inactive player reveals the caloric value of the active player&rsquo;s choice, and the active player records that value on his or her notepad. (Each player should total his or her calories after each turn. Players may use calculators.) The inactive player then reads the remaining caloric values.&#10;&#10;7.           If a player lands on Free Time and chooses an activity to do right now, he or she MUST physically complete that activity.&#10;&#10;8.           Play repeats according to the steps above.&#10;&#10;9.           The first player to reach Lights Out deducts 100 calories.&#10;&#10;10.       The game ends when all players reach Lights Out. An exact roll of the die is NOT necessary to reach Lights Out.&#10;&#10;11.       To Win: The player with the lowest number of calories wins.&#10;&#10;12.       In the case of a tie, the winner can be determined with one of the following methods: flip a coin, roll the die, pushup contest, arm-wrestling, rock-paper-scissors, thumb-war, draw straws, or staring contest.&#10;&#10;OPTIONAL: Players may calculate the excess calories they consumed in a day and estimate how much weight they would gain in a year if they made the same choices in life that they made in the game with the equations below:&#10;&#10;total calories &ndash; 2,000 = excess daily calories&#10;&#10;excess daily calories x 365 &cedil; 3,500 = yearly weight gain&#10;&#10;LONG GAME: Play can be lengthened by circling the board more than once.&#10;&#10;CARD GAME: To play as a card game, players take turns reading cards to each other, reading one card per turn, going in order from Breakfast to Dinner. Players choose options and calculate calories as in regular play.&#10;&#10;",

The first battle took place around Bull Run river (the battle is also known as First Manassas).&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The battle was a chaotic affair. Neither army had been properly trained, and the bewildering assortment of uniforms led to confusion. The main battle centered around Henry Hill. General Jackson's brigade occupied the hill and held the position against a series of piecemeal Union attacks, leading to the comment 'There stands Jackson, like a stone wall.' Jackson had his nickname, and the Confederates had their first victory.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This scenario focuses on the fight for Henry Hill from noon until about 4 PM, when Early's Brigade arrived to seal the Confederate victory.&quot;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

    "Description": "&quot;On August 5, 1864, Admiral Farragut led a flotilla of 14 wooden ships, four ironclads, and numerous gunboats into Mobile Bay to seal off the city of Mobile, one of the two remaining Confederate ports.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;While entering the bay, the Union monitor USS Tecumseh struck a submerged torpedo and sank. Under fire from both the Confederate fleet and Fort Morgan, Farragut had to choose between retreating or risking the minefield. He then issued his famous order, 'Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Though both ironclad and wooden ships fought at Mobile Bay, this game gives players the opportunity to see how an all ironclad engagement may have been fought with ships of varying designs, and consider the trade offs naval engineers must make when designing a warship.&quot;&#10;&#10;This &quot;build your own ironclad&quot; game is a miniatures wargame intended for use with students. The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table which recreates characteristics of Mobile Bay, including islands, forts, water depth, pilings, and mines. Components necessary for play are available for free download at the Junior General website.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Big Fight for Little Round Top. Fast and Easy Rules for Replaying Part of the Battle of Gettysburg.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Confederate attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top was the subject of considerable controversy. It began late in the day and was marked by confusion and a general lack of coordination. The terrain was partly responsible for this.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oates' 15th Alabama was given the difficult task of assaulting up the hill. They ran into Chamberlain's 20th Maine, which was defending the far left flank of the Union army. Several charges were turned back. Finally, with his men low on ammunition, Chamberlain ordered a bayonet charge, which finished off the weary confederates.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a miniatures wargame intended for classroom use (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniatures. Aspects covered in the rules include infantry formations, sharpshooters, protective cover, commanders, charges, and morale.&#10;&#10;",

Those three divisions charged across a field of fire a mile in length, and up a sloping hill towards the muskets and cannons waiting for them at the top . . . The day ended in defeat for the Confederates. Pickett&rsquo;s Division was utterly destroyed.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with students in grades 6 to 8.

It can be played on graph paper (by marking off a 27 x 27 area) using coloured pencils to indicate the placement of watchtowers, or miradors, each of which will occupy a 2 x 2 square.&#10;&#10;Several factors combine to make this a very fast and unusual game: line-of-sight connection (which is a feature of Sid Sackson's game Network); graded placement (incorporating the use of micro squares); and equivalent goals - that is, either player can win by connecting the board edges either from north to south or from east to west.&#10;&#10;A significant feature of the game is that players can use their opponent's placements to facilitate their own connections. So, in trying to win the race to connect, you must check that the next move you plan to make doesn't inadvertently improve your opponent's chances more than yours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Also known as &quot;Er Qi Shi&quot; or &quot;2-7-10&quot; is a traditional Chinese card game, closely related to Majiang and the Rummy family of games.  It can be found in Guang Xi province of southern China, particularly to the city of Guilin (from which it derives one of its names), as well as in Sichuan province (specifically Leshan where a particularly ornate style of writing for the numerals is used) and in the city of Chongqing.  It is rare, but not unheard of, to see it played outside of these environs.&#10;&#10;It is traditionally played by 4 people, three players and one dealer. Cards are divided into two suits - informal and formal characters numbered from 1-10 and one &quot;Phoenix&quot; or joker card. There are 4 duplicates of each, with the 2's, 7's and 10's of both suits picked out in red (which are worth extra points when scoring).  Play proceeds in a manner similar to Majiang, with players attempting to create a variety of different &quot;melds&quot; or special hands, with the winner's score being calcualted on the strength of his or her hand.&#10;&#10;",
