    "Description": "Hordes &amp; Heroes Medieval is designed as a fast play tabletop historical wargame, which uses hexagon marked terrain as a precise and effective method for moving troops. The rule system is simple and easy to learn, yet sophisticated enough to allow &ldquo;realistic&ldquo; battles to be fought between a diverse range of medieval armies. It is easy to play, but more difficult to master.&#10;&#10;One A4 Quick Reference Sheet is sufficient to contain all the information necessary to play. The Combat Results Tables can be printed or photocopied, cut and pasted together as required. The main rules need only be consulted when players are learning the rules, and occasionally thereafter, to clarify situations as they arise.&#10;&#10;The precision of the movement system and the speed and efficiency of the combat system ensure that the game flows quickly and even a closely fought contest between two armies of 150 points can be concluded within 1&frac12; hours to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be played on modular hex terrain which can accommodate a range of different terrain features, e.g. open ground, hills and slopes, rivers, woods, impenetrable terrain etc. Larger terrain features can extend over a number of adjacent hexes. The terrain is an extremely important aspect of the rules, in that, it is of great strategical and tactical significance because of the way it influences movement, Command and Control, and combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Queen's Dilemma is a sequel to The King's Dilemma,, the award-winning (and Kennerspiel des Jahres-nominated) interactive narrative legacy game, and uses an improved Dilemma Card System to bring players an even more immersive experience.&#10;&#10;Set a hundred years after the dramatic events of the first game and building upon the revolutionary Dilemma Card System, The Queen&rsquo;s Dilemma introduces a brand-new story, improves the existing legacy mechanisms, and adds a lot of new exclusive features.&#10;&#10;Take your seat at the Queen&rsquo;s Council and choose your own persona from a pool of 6 unique characters. You will live the story from their perspective, whether as a cunning master of subterfuge, a fierce military leader, a greedy merchant, a philosopher advocating for progress, an aristocrat with a penchant for the occult, or a vicious lord tied to criminal activities.&#10;&#10;Develop your character with exclusive personal abilities. Each character comes with Duchies or Marks under their direct control, and a deck of secret personal objectives and branching narrative paths that will define your story and future goals&mdash;which may intertwine with the destiny of the entire kingdom.&#10;&#10;Shape the political identity of the Realm through the new ideology system. The policies you enact will alter the balance between six opposing political ideologies: Tradition against Progress, Force against Diplomacy and Order against Liberty. These also represent the moral values and agenda of your character: each one has a founding ideology they always root for, and other secondary interests whose importance varies from game to game, changing alliances at the table.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s not all. The new keyword system allows the game to keep track of your personal choices: an unexpected act of forgiveness could secure you the eternal gratitude of the people, but a radical resolution could tarnish your reputation forever. Make your decisions wisely: the consequences of your choices will come back to reward or haunt your character later in the campaign.&#10;&#10;Watch the map of the kingdom evolve as a result of your decisions! The events that unfold will change the world forever and unlock new game rules altering the flow of the campaign. Defend your interests when a Dilemma card directly involves the territories placed under your control, and construct buildings to gain new abilities and sources of revenue.&#10;&#10;Manage the resources of your lands and trade with other players to achieve your goals: increase your political power, collect materials to improve your buildings, support the Queen&rsquo;s Army in the war in the south, and provide for the needs of your people to avoid discontent, unrest, and revolts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You will lead a team of seasoned climbers and attempt to be the first to summit the greatest peak on the globe. You will need to wisely equip your expedition with the supplies, choose your climbers and assault teams, map out your route, and then start up the mountain for death or glory.&#10;&#10;This is a print-and-play game, with two main decks of cards, some tokens and a series of location cards. Before the game, players will need to carefully select supply cards to give them the best chance at success because the mountain is an unforgiving place that will throw dangerous Encounter Cards at the expedition. Once on their way up the mountain, how well the player balances these cards with the expedition's health, endurance, and strength will define the razor thin margin of success and failure atop Mount Everest.&#10; All components (and some alternatives) are provided in the PNP files. Expect your first expedition to take around 30min, with follow up games lasting around 15-20min. Mount Everest is a dangerous place, so carefully choose your supplies and read the rock face well, and you just might secure the coveted prize of being the first to reach the roof of the world.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Combat Results Tables can be printed or photocopied, cut and pasted together as required. There is a Quick Reference Sheet Generator on the website to enable players to quickly create and print the play sheet for a game between any fantasy armies contained in the army lists. The main rules need only be consulted when players are learning the rules, and occasionally thereafter, to clarify situations as they arise.&#10;&#10;The precision of the movement system and the speed and efficiency of the combat system ensure that the game flows quickly and even a closely fought contest between two armies of 150 points can be concluded within 1&frac12; hours to 2 hours. This makes the system ideally suited for competitive and tournament play.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be played on modular hex terrain which can accommodate a range of different terrain features, e.g. open ground, hills and slopes, rivers, woods, impenetrable terrain etc.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Harder skills yield greater rewards but also carry harsher deductions.&#10;&#10;Each event has unique dice mechanisms representing the gymnast's execution of her skills. Players must decide whether to keep rolling (chasing glory at the risk of more deductions) or to take their lumps and call it quits. Smart decisions--and getting an adrenaline boost at the right time--will ultimately make the difference between a gold medal and not even making the podium.&#10;&#10;When the meet is over, awards are given to the top-scoring gymnast in each event, with one gymnast being crowned as All Around Champion.&#10;&#10;",

It is the time to muster your armies, gather your priests, claim mighty artifacts and secure the favor of a powerful cult to pave your way into even greater victories.&#10;&#10;Tekhenu: Time of Seth adds new layers of interaction and new options to Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun.

There are 3 gameplay variants in one set: Original Play, Bluff, and Boba the Builder. Choose a variant to suit your cravings, just like your boba orders!&#10;&#10;In Original Play, match the ingredients to the ones shown on the drink card to fulfil drink orders, then draw reward cards after you&rsquo;ve completed them. Deftly dodge your competitors&rsquo; sabotage tactics, and be the first to earn 11 points worth of drinks.&#10;&#10;In Bluff, think of it as Original Play, with a twist! Inspired by a wrong order, how do you know if the ingredients used to make a drink are correct? No one knows until someone gets called out. Will the temptation of a yummy reward risk a game of lies and a ruined reputation? The first to complete 5 drinks will end the game, but the one with the highest points will win.&#10;&#10;In Boba the Builder, manage and build your inventory to fulfil the market demand for boba! Peek over at your competitors and anticipate the drinks they plan to make. Put a stop to their plan, or make calculated moves to snatch up all the drinks when everyone&rsquo;s least expecting it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle of Legends: Rome vs Macedon: Print &amp; Play Edition, which is a reimplementation of Battle of Legends: Print &amp; Play Edition (2019 Wargame Print &amp; Play Contest Winner), is a two-player board game that focuses on four battles fought between Roman Republic and Macedonian Kingdom in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, namely Elis (208 BC), Aous (198 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC), and Pydna (168 BC). It is developed to simulate those battles on a tactical level with a hex grid board, terrain tiles, unit counters, faction cards, and d6 dice.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into hex spaces for unit placement and terrain tiles are placed onto them to create the battlefield of a chosen scenario. The Hill, River, and Forest are the terrain types which affects unit movement and combat in different ways. For instance, in battle Cynoscephalae (197 BC), which is mainly a hill battle, one hit is ignored if a unit on ground is attacking against a target unit on hill, in order to reflect the difficulty of uphill combat.&#10; A unit is represented by a number of counters (equal to unit strength) on a hex space. The Roman army consists of Principe, Triarii, Velites, Elephants, and Equites units; whereas the Macedon army contains Pezhetairoi, Hypaspists, Peltasts, Hetairoi, and Cretans units, each having its own movement-attack-defense powers, special skills and abilities. Great effort has been made to bring out the differences in fighting formations of two armies, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Phalanx&rdquo;, while preserving a simple and streamlined game mechanism.&#10;&#10;A leader is attached onto a unit and moves with it while upgrading friendly units in range. Leader influenced units make more powerful attacks, and hold the ground better. Therefore, effective positioning of a leader allows you to take the advantage in the course of battle. &#10; Faction cards lie at the heart of the game. They are kept secret and played to order units (green), activate their offensive (red)-defensive (blue) abilities, or start an event. Each faction has its own unique set and the content is changing from one scenario to another. Order cards allow you to position your units strategically across the battlefield to best coordinate your attacks, while ability &amp; event cards empower you to apply some combat tactics such as charging, flanking, envelopment, phalanx, testudo, and withdraw. There is also a scenario card in each deck which takes the place of a key event happened in that battle. For example, the surprising pass of Romans through a secret path in Aous Battle (198 BC) is simulated by an order card which upgrades their movement up to 5 hexes.&#10;&#10;BoL is played over a number of game rounds (scenario specific) in which players take their turns respectively. Each turn consists of three steps:&#10;1.Order Units: Order a group of units by playing an order card from your hand.&#10;2.Move Units: Move each of ordered units either by marching, or attacking. Play an ability, or event card where possible.&#10;3.Select Cards: Manage your hand by discarding-taking cards from your faction deck.&#10;This ordering of steps imposes a strategic depth to the gameplay by forcing you foresee upcoming events and make necessary adjustments beforehand.&#10;&#10;The dice combat system is kept simple yet efficient, in which engagements are resolved quickly by referencing unit cards. To succeed in combat, you must consider unit types, unit strength, ranges, terrain effects and leadership.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you must bring your opponent down to zero morale, or stand higher on morale at the end of the last round. Morale status may be changed with losses of units, or strategic places on board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Rounds should last around 60 seconds.&#10;&#10;There are attack, block, throw, and counter cards, all of which need to be played strategically to maximize the damage a player can do to their opponent, without taking too much damage of their own.&#10;&#10;Predicting what your opponent might play and making a decision on what to do within seconds adds an arcade feel to the game; there isn't always time to think things over, sometimes you just have to throw down a card and hope it works, we call that our version of button mashing.&#10;&#10;Whether played with a single opponent, or against a group of people rotating in and out, Fist Fight will provide hours of the high-energy entertainment.&#10;&#10;",

Also be attentive to the game of the other participants, to make the best decisions. In addition, the &quot;action cards&quot; will dictate certain moves that must be used wisely.&#10;&#10;Trios are built by combining TAIL + BODY + HEAD of the same type. The types are lizards, fish, and insects, each on a different background color to facilitate association.&#10;&#10;The deck is mixed very well with the 70 cards (the image cards and the action cards). The mixed deck is placed in the center of the table upside down. Each player starts with 4 cards.&#10;&#10;Each one will make the possible trios and will leave the remaining cards in their sector of the table to continue playing with them. All cards in play are placed face up, showing the built trios and the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;In turn, each player will pick up a card from the deck: If an image card comes out, the following two movements are made:&#10;1- The card is used to make a trio or laid in the player's sector of the table to use it later and Exchange is made (mandatory). For this, an image card of one of the playmates is chosen and it is exchanged for an own image card (the one that has just been lifted or another). You cannot break a trio already built by another player. If an action card is drawn, only the action specified on it is done and the exchange is not made.&#10;Whenever one of these cards appears, it is played immediately.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player manages to assemble three different trios, that is, a trio of each type.&#10;&#10;",
