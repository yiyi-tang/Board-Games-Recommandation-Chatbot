One player, the Arch Villain, attempts to build and execute dastardly plots while the remaining players -- each of whom assumes the role of a classic pulp hero -- try to foil these plots. Among the 10 heroes to choose from are Samantha Starr (intrepid reporter) Grigor the Great (former magician to the Tsar), and the Blue Falcon (ace aviatrix). The game plays out over three Acts, as the Arch Villain works toward the execution of a final Master Plan, such as the construction and activation of a massive death ray, or encasing the world in ice for all eternity.&#10;&#10;The key mechanic of the game is the creation of &quot;Adventures,&quot; linked sets of cards that the Heroes must investigate and overcome in order to collect Heroism points. There are two types of Adventures: &quot;Wild Adventures,&quot; which are generated on the fly by a combination of card plays and draws from the various decks; and &quot;Plots,&quot; which are custom-built by the Arch Villain player and have much higher stakes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of Australia's many contributions to the world of gambling. The game is conducted in a flat circle of approximately 20 feet (6 metres) or larger. The only equipment required (aside from materials for tracking bets) is two coins (by tradition pre-decimal pennies), and a flat piece of wood called the &quot;kip&quot; approximately 8 inches in length which has holes carved in it to fit the coins neatly but loosely enough for the coins to come out when tossed.&#10;&#10;The game is run by a &quot;boxer&quot;, who calls the first &quot;potato&quot; (one of the players around the circle) in to toss the coins. The spinner wagers an amount of their choice on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. Other players around the ring can then also bet on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. .&#10;&#10;Once all bets are taken, the boxer calls &quot;no more bets&quot;, and the player tosses the coins in the air using the kip. To be a valid throw, they must go above the head height of the spinner, be rotating sufficiently and land entirely in the ring - if they do not the boxer calls &quot;barred&quot; and the throw is retaken. Ideally the call must occur before the coins settle.&#10;&#10;If the coins land both on the same face, the round ends and non-spinning player's bets are paid off, with people who bet on the same face as that landed winning. A new round of non-spinner bets is then taken before the spinner throws again.&#10;&#10;If the coins come up with one tail and one head, the spinner spins again. If 5 &quot;odds&quot; come up, all players lose and a new spinner is selected.&#10;&#10;If the spinner throws his nominated face three times before either 5 &quot;odds&quot; being thrown in a row, or a spin with both coins being the opposite face, the spinner wins and is paid at 7.5 to 1 (in most modern games).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Odd is a simple abstract game for 2 players, with stones of 2 colors, typically played on a hexagonally tiled board with 5 cells on each edge (though it can be played on almost any tiling). Odd can also be played with pencil and paper.&#10;&#10;Definitions:  &#10;&#10;     A group is a set of stones on the board, all of the same color, for which it is possible to trace a continuous path between any two of  them by stepping between adjacent stones of that color.&#10;     The size of a group is the number of stones in it.  &#10;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;     The board begins empty.&#10;     Players take turns.  On each turn a player places one stone of either color onto any empty space.&#10;     The game ends when the board is full.  Player 1 wins if there is an odd number of groups of at least size 5 on the board, and Player 2 wins otherwise.  When counting groups, be sure add up the total number of connected groups of both colors.&#10;&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&#10;     One can change the character of the game by increasing or decreasing the minimum size which a group must have in order to be counted at the end. The larger the minimum group size, the more strategic and less tactical the game becomes, and vice-versa    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Omniana is a fantasy card game in which players use their imagination to creatively debate battles between many strange &amp; absurd characters in a multitude of exotic &amp; normal locations.&#10; On each Character Card there is a brief description of an original character detailing his special abilities, weaknesses and history. Players take turns sending one of their characters into an opponent's situation to battle against that opponent's pre-selected character. One or more of the remaining players will judge each battle. Using only the information on their cards, both of the battling players must argue how and why his character would win in a duel. The judge(s) decides the victor and awards him either a treasure or an advantage card. The player with the most treasure at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.omnianathegame.com&#10;&#10;",

Players compete to give away all of their money by answering questions about these paintings.  Questions are multiple choice, or players may opt to play an &quot;Expert&quot; card and answer without the multiple choice options for a greater reward.  Correct answers allow players to draw a &quot;Philanthropist&quot; card, which indicates the amount of a donation and has other effects.&#10;&#10;Philanthropist: The National Gallery, London offers several variations on the game mechanics of the original, allowing players more strategic options and lifting this game above many standard trivia games.&#10;&#10;",

Approximately 250, half-inch counters represent the forces available.&#10;&#10;Movement of forces is by pre-plotted orders, with opposing forces ending the week in the same hex having their combat resolved on a separate set of geomorphic, tactical combat boards.&#10;&#10;The tactical combat system is rather advanced for the time, including such elements as LOS, panic, bayonet attacks, enfilade fire, cavalry charges, facing, and elevation advantages.  The strategic game also has rules for supply/foraging, lines of communication, weather, forced march, baggage trains, partisans, forts and garrisons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Off The Hook is a fun-filled, action-packed poker game that combines calculated chance with thought-provoking strategy.&#10;&#10;Each player gets ten white chips, two colored dice, one green marker, and one blue marker.  The starting player takes five &quot;community&quot; dice, and one green die in the closed Off the Hook box.  The player then shakes the box, and opens it to look inside, and announce a poker hand based on what they see.  The box is then passed to the next player, who can either call their bluff, accept the call by looking in the box an making a new (higher) call, or give up an &quot;Off the Hook&quot; marker to pass the box without penalty.&#10;&#10;If a player gets caught bluffing, they lose the number of chips to the challenger equal to the number showing on the green die in the box.  Otherwise, the challenger pays.&#10;&#10;The person with the most chips wins (usually the last one left in the game).&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.offthehookpoker.com/&#10;&#10;",

All you need to do is fly out to the border planets and sell them. However, the Hands of Blue are in pursuit!

They won&rsquo;t fly 86 million miles for a box of band-aids, will they? &#10;In this game you try to fly 86 million miles through space to escape the Hands of Blue. But you must be wary, because your competition is doing the same and will tip off your enemies to your location (by playing cards to stop or slow you down), of course, you can do the same! &#10;In the basic game, designed for 4 players, the object is to be the first crew to accumulate $5000 in platinum (that is the point system) over several rounds of play. In doing so, you must try to complete a trip of exactly 86 million miles in each round of play.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Like the original Take Your Pick, this is a party game where one player is the subject and everyone else draws three cards, each of which has two choices on it A or B.  The judges orient their cards in their hands such that they select one option from each card (turn the card one way, and the top word is circled, rotate it 180 degrees and the other word is circled).&#10;&#10;In turn, each judge calls out the two words on one of his cards to the subject, who answers his preference.  If the judge was correct, he keeps the card and continues.  Wrong, and his turn ends.  The subject gets the same score as the judge who got the most points this turn.&#10;&#10;Quick and entertaining, which is what SimplyFun party games seem to be.&#10;&#10;This edition includes entertainment choices (Batman or Spiderman, P Diddy or Led Zeppelin, etc).&#10;&#10;",

In between the hands was a spinable hanging plastic piece. The object of the game was to have the dancers gyrate in such a way that that center piece spun around. Whichever team that could keep the spinner rotating the longest was declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each freight card shows a destination and a table of fees. The actual fee depends on the zone one's pawn is located and the type of the operation permit.&#10;&#10;The game board is a map of Finland divided in three zones: southern, middle and northern Finland. The map shows the largest cities and a set of roads (tracks of squares) between them. There are two types of operation permits and you may buy an extended permit to operate with improved rates.&#10;&#10;Moving your truck (pawn) happens by roll-and-move and should one land on a given square an event card is drawn. The major part of events consist of maintenance costs. Once the destination city is reached a new freight card is drawn.&#10;&#10;",
