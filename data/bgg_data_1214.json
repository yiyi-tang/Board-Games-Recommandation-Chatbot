You have 2 sets of cards: little ones with letters and big ones with words and pictures. Letter cards are placed face down on the table, then a player opens up an animal card and tries to find matching letters turning them up and building the word from that animal card. When the last letter is turned face up the player who's done it gets the animal card. Whoever gets the most animal cards wins.&#10;&#10;There are some other variants: you can play a simple memory game looking for two macthing letters or contest each other in some sort of scrabble.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&laquo;&#208;&#151;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&raquo;

Each unit in Victory Decision: Raid! represents one individual infantry model.&#10;&#10;Games are focused on infantry squad vs infantry squad, and typically have 6-10 figures per side. These rules cover almost all aspects of World War II wargaming, from Troop Quality and Leadership to Bunker Assaults, Combat in Buildings and Vehicle combat.&#10;&#10;Victory Decision: Raid! features a unique Leadership-modified alternate unit activation system. The result is a fun and fast paced war game that involves both players constantly.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed with 20-28mm miniatures in mind, but the Victory Decision: Raid! game system is flexible enough to handle any miniatures from 15mm to 32mm. So whatever your existing miniature collection consists of, you can start playing right away.&#10;&#10;This rulebook not only provides Scenarios but also 27 Point based Force Lists for British, German, Soviet and US forces from early to late war.&#10;All necessary Game Markers are also included within this book.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a 4 page free scenario to compliment Fallschirmjaeger, British and US Paratrooper books.&#10;&#10;Victory Decision: World War II is an action based game that allows you to command a platoon sized force or more in this momentous conflict. It features a unique Leadership-modified alternate unit activation system. The result is a fun and fast paced war game that involves both players almost constantly.&#10;&#10;The rules cover virtually all aspects of World War II gaming. The full rulebook contains rules for:&#10;&#10;     Moving, Hiding, Infiltrating and Spotting,&#10;     Shooting and Concentrated Fire Actions,&#10;     Assault and Close Combat Actions,&#10;     Artillery and Air Strikes, Bunker Assaults, Night Fighting, Foxholes, Tank Pits and much more...&#10;&#10;&#10;Victory Decision emphasises Troop Quality and Leadership and includes a fast and detailed Vehicle combat system.&#10;&#10;The rules cover individually based infantry miniatures and also group- or multibased miniatures, aka Infantry Stands. While designed with 20-28mm miniatures in mind the Victory Decision game system is flexible enough to handle any miniatures from 6mm to 32mm. So whatever your existing miniature collection consists of, you can start playing right away.&#10;&#10;This rulebook not only provides Scenarios but also Point based Army Lists for late war British, German, Soviet and US forces. All necessary Game Markers are also included within this book.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slyde is an abstract strategy game for two players. It&rsquo;s a bloodless fight where the goal is to bring together as many pawns as possible.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a set of pawns, Black or White. The pawns can appear in two states: fixed or mobile.  At the beginning, the entire 12x12 board is covered in mobile pawns, which alternate in color to create a checker pattern. White starts the game, then players move alternately. During  a move, a player swaps one of his mobile pawns with an adjacent mobile pawn of his opponent. The player&rsquo;s pawn then becomes fixed, but the opponent&rsquo;s pawn does not. Symmetric play can be quite a nuisance, so there&rsquo;s a special rule to discourage it. If a board is in a symmetric position, the next player to move can change the state (mobile/fixed) of any pawn regardless of color instead of doing a standard swap. This does not apply to the first move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more legal moves. The player who controls the biggest group (defined by orthogonal connectivity of like-colored pawns) is the winner. If the two biggest groups are equal in size, the second-biggest groups are compared, and so on.&#10;&#10;Slyde is the first specimen of a new family of games. In fact, a few designers have already proposed their own interpretations of the same concepts of swapping, fixing and coalescing &ndash; much like there are many variants of Draughts or Chess.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The number of players is in theory not limited, but since the active player gets a small bonus, with more players, the active player's dice roll should be shared with others.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The active player rolls 2 dice and uses both to fill the four areas on the player sheet. The other players may use one of the die results. The four areas are Virus analysis, Research, Tests and Flattening the curve. In order to analyse the virus, players have to fill the area with polyominos based on the die result. The other areas are filled with numbers according to rules, that are slightly different from area to area. For each area there's a specific goal that must be achieved in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

What&rsquo;s different from previous Memo editions is that each tile has two pictures on it and a player can choose to match either of the pictures in order to claim the tile. Furthermore, a player can search for a match from among the tiles already captured; even tiles held by an opponent. Whoever holds the most tiles at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The first to complete the treetop challenge wins!&#10;&#10;To start, players build a tree with face down cards from the tree deck. These cards show a number and a color. Players start with 3 cards from the tree deck in their hand. On your turn, you reveal a spell from the spell deck which causes a range of effects, some good, some bad. After resolving the spell, you can draw more tree cards, set traps on other players, or attempt to climb the tree by revealing a tree card at the level of the trunk you are currently at, and playing tree cards of a particular color and total number to beat the trunk's card. Once you make it to the top of the trunk you must beat the 3 treetop cards in a similar fashion. There are a number of different rules and modes.&#10;&#10;",

Here the important thing is to learn and have fun, because the fight begins by playing.&#10;The dynamics of the game consists of 1,200 questions, included in six categories. Each category is represented by an iconic figure from that field: Simone de Beauvoir (Academy): great theoretical references of yesterday and today; Angela Davis (Street): social movements and activism, also on the Internet; Judith Butler (Bodies): sexuality, health, LGBTQ and transfeminisms; Frida Kahlo (Culture): feminine and feminist contributions to the history of literature, music, fine arts, cinema, comics, etc; Olympe de Gouges (Rights): progress on rights (abortion, divorce, vote ...), institutional policy, conventions and international law; and Valentina Tereshkova (Herstory): Did you know that history is full of women who do things?&#10;Objective: Have fun! And, incidentally, learn something about our own feminist genealogies.&#10;You will have to move around the board answering the questions correctly and collect all the cards of the &quot;Queens of Feminism&quot; protagonists of each of the six categories. To win you must return to the center and answer a question from a category chosen by the rest of the participants.&#10;&#10;",

The three games are:&#10;1.  ECOTRIVIA:   Containing 648 Questions related to the environmental issue and the ECOCARDS game.&#10;2.  ECOCARDS: 2 Decks of Cards, using the 4 elements of nature: Earth, Air, Water and Fire, containing 54 EcoTips and 54 EcoVips.&#10;3.  RECYCARDS: where only with the right strategy you will be able to recycle all waste.&#10;&bull;    The great appeal is that the 3 games although they can be enjoyed independently, we have articulated them in a single Main Game, creating an entertaining ECO Adventure.&#10;&#10;Play, get fun and learn in this ECOadventure to become into a Guardian of your Future!

    "Description": "Do you want to make your party unforgettable? For a fun company, the best incendiary board game is best! The &laquo;Green Mexican&raquo; is exactly that. It is universal for any party and is designed for a company where they like to spend an interesting time:&#10;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#145; easy and short rules, time of learning &mdash; up to 5 minutes;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#145; the game will decorate any party, even the one where everyone is &quot;driving&quot;;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#145; you can play both the three of us and the big company;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#145; the goal is not so much the victory, as an interesting and fun process of the game.&#10;&#10;Don (chairman of the Mexican mafia) chooses a successor among the players. But his adviser, who dreams of heading the cartel, constantly arranges pretenders all sorts of tricks, trying to show that they are all only &quot;green&quot; Mexicans, and do not deserve to take the place of the Don.&#10;&#10;The set includes cards of two types &mdash; 45 orders of the Don (performed by the player), 45 insidious interference of the Advisor (the player transfers their performance to any other player) and the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;What if it is impossible to execute two (three) Advisor card tips simultaneously? Hence, you are unlucky and the chances of becoming a &quot;green Mexican&quot; have increased significantly :) For example, if one card says that the left hand should be held at the back of the head, and the other that the left hand should cover the knee, then one must break at least one of the cards of insidious advice.&#10;&#10;What if the player can not fulfill the order of Don described in the card? What can not mean?! He does not want to disappoint Don? :) You need to try until it works out. But if, nevertheless, the task is not fulfilled, then such a card goes into a dump, turn the card upside down.&#10;&#10;A pause is possible? What pauses? The struggle for the cartel's empire is in full swing! Ordering alcohol, chewing a fragrant shish kebab or answering the phone call, the player is obliged to fulfill all orders of the Don assigned to him or cards with tips of the adviser.&#10;&#10;The most enterprising and attentive will win, but everyone will get pleasure and positive emotions!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boardgame LibertEx!&#10;&#10;The game is the path to financial freedom&#10;Once, five financiers sat and drank compote. One of them leaned back in his chair and said: &ldquo;Guys, let's make a game about how we got into these chairs. Well, where do we get such cars, such as apartments, and such grandmothers? &rdquo; The second one recalled how he had lived in a hostel for six months and ate a doshirak to maintain a store ... As a result, the LibertEx game appeared - about rat-running &ldquo;work for an uncle&rdquo;, about a gradual understanding that money is not a goal, but a tool and big dreams. The fourth edition of this game is in front of you.&#10;&#10;Everything is as in reality&#10;The playing field is your daily routine. You can work harder, get tired more, and earn a little more - until you fall off from accumulated fatigue. And you can use your time a little smarter - to implement your ideas and search for opportunities.&#10;&#10;What are the possibilities?&#10;Well, for example, your neighbor may come to you and offer to open a kiosk with shawarma. Or your classmate will offer you to buy a furniture factory because he is leaving for Cyprus. Or you just learn something valuable and interesting. Opportunities are anything you want, from a valuable spare part found in a landfill that you brought home and repaired before purchasing the enterprise. The main thing is to use them correctly. The strategy is that you do not have to grab at every chance: it is important to understand what, when, and how it will bring you money.&#10;&#10;Need to count?&#10;Yes, this is a personal finance game. You will have to count quite a lot - but, believe me, every second of working with your head will pay off. After a couple of parties, you can quickly figure out not only how many years you will earn on a new apartment, but also how much it is more profitable to invest in stocks and indices in comparison with the purchase of the McDonald's franchise.&#10;&#10;What is the purpose of the game?&#10;The main objective of the game is to make your passive income (coming regardless of your actions) exceed your fixed costs (for example, food, home, clothes, and so on). Once you achieve this, you win.&#10;&#10;But what about a yacht and a plane?&#10;There are dreams in the game - this is what makes you happy. For some, the limit of happiness is a new iPhone, for some - their own yacht, and someone will not be able to live without a concert of their favorite star. All the dreams in the game are clearly tied to the real world and to Russia - if you see the price for a million red roses, it means that it costs so much. Not very expensive by the standards of the oligarchs, by the way. To find out prices for concerts of stars, diamonds, cars, and other services or things, the creators sent inquiries as if they were going to buy it themselves. So the prices are real. Take courage.&#10;&#10;Why do I need holiday cards?&#10;Because you can&rsquo;t work all the time. Health, family, and other values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;are taken into account in LibertEx - otherwise nothing. In other economic games, you need to work and work, but here the goal is to become happy. Therefore, do not forget to relax and spend time with loved ones.&#10;&#10;What kind of news cards?&#10;These cards change the game situation. When you reach a level where exchange rates, the value of stocks, and valuable metals will be of great importance, you will begin to read the news far from the usual person.&#10;&#10;A crisis!&#10;Yes, there are crises in the game. They may come unexpectedly like a thick polar fox. Everything is like in the 90s, in 2008, and in other best years of our economy. It will be fun, and the little bottle will come in handy. And what is the economy in Russia without such a risk?&#10;&#10;Well and most importantly&#10;Perhaps, based on the results or during the game, you will find your personal path to financial freedom and independence.&#10;&#10;",

The board game &quot;Conflict Cards&quot; has an age limit of 18+!&#10;&#10;Cards of &#208;&#161;onflict (2 Edition) are a very controversial, if not &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; game. In it, participants will select the most successful answers to strange questions. Uncensored. Without political correctness. No brakes. &ldquo;Cards of &#208;&#161;onflict&rdquo; raises a wide variety of topics, often going far beyond the generally accepted norms of decency and etiquette. But if your company prefers black humor, banter over everything, and undisguised sarcasm, then this game is just what you need. Here you can plunge into the world of toilet jokes about orgies, people of non-standard sexual orientation, racism, and of course, laugh heartily at other charms of modern civilization.&#10;&#10;Table of Contents Cards Board Game Content:&#10;- 85 cards with questions&#10;- 420 cards with answers&#10;- rules of the game&#10;&#10;The game begins with the fact that each player receives 10 white cards. In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.&#10;&#10;White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.&#10;&#10;There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The children of Alarielle have arrived to seek revenge for the rampant despoiling of the Mortal Realms. They're not driven by glory or conquest, but rather bitter hatred for those who would destroy their natural homes.&#10;&#10;Unleash nature&rsquo;s fury with this card pack! Combined with the Core Rules and your miniatures, this set allows you to summon the spirit of the forests to fight in skirmish battles. An abilities card lets you use deadly in-game tactics and powers, while a set of 12 fighter cards provide profiles for two types of Dryads, two types of Spite-Revenants, two types of Tree-Revenants and six types of Kurnoth Hunters.&#10;&#10;This set contains an abilities card in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, as well as two divider cards to keep track of tokens that apply to fighters in game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While all gods possess power and responsibility beyond that of mortal ken, they themselves were never created equal. Not all bestrode the world like the mighty sun, or commanded the realm of the dead, or even represented all of feline kind in their regal majesty.&#10;&#10;The lesser gods and demons knew their place, and divined that their survival would hinge on levying favor with the one patron that would dominate the cosmos when all was done. It was not a matter of followers or that their duties were of any lesser import. Yet the whims of fate and the cosmic tide had left them without grand monuments and legions of devoted followers. Such was the nature of a divine existence.&#10;&#10;For the patron deities that grant them succor, these Guardians ply their talents in their patrons&rsquo; names, adding to their grandeur and protecting their devoted followers as their own. Serving the mighty was their truest path to enduring this war to end all wars.&#10;&#10;The Guardians Set introduces a new set of Guardians ready to join the gods in their quest. Most of the Guardians contained in this set are terrible demons with vicious abilities the gods would much rather have at their side than used against them. The introduction of new Guardians into the game gives new options to select from, increasing the possibilities for different combinations and interactions for each game. The presence or absence of each Guardian can have a profound impact on the gameplay dynamics.&#10;&#10;The Guardians Set comes with:&#10;&#10;11 Guardian figures:&#10;-3 Mafdet figures&#10;-2 Am-Heh figures&#10;-2 Pazuzu figures&#10;-2 Ammit figures&#10;-2 Shezmu figures&#10;5 Guardian cards&#10;&#10;",
