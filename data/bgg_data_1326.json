    "Description": "Paths to Aegis is an automa rogue-lite deck-building board game. The game allows for 1-4 player cooperation as each player takes their own character with a unique set of abilities and strengths as they discover new tiles on their way to defeat Cerberus by gaining more powerful cards and leveling up.&#10;&#10;Each turn the player rolls the die to move across the board or rolls the die if they're in battle. Rolling a 1 or a 2 places them in battle. Once a player is in battle, life clips keep track of health for both the player and each enemy they fight in battle.&#10;&#10;While in battle, a player will use as many action cards as levels they are and use those actions to either damage the enemy or heal their health. On the enemy's turn to attack, the player must roll the die. Each enemy has a standard attack and most have a special attack. If the die roll matches the enemy's special attack, then it usually damages the player more than a standard attack. Once the enemy has been defeated, players earn coins which they can use to either purchase more action cards at the market or level up.&#10;&#10;As it is a rogue-lite game, you can expect to die. But don't worry! Upon death, you only lose half your coins and you keep any cards you purchased.&#10;&#10;",

Players will control tactical locations, place traps, launch fireballs, destroy walls, teleport across pits, climb ledges, sling arrows, swing great-axes, steal relics, and much, much more!&#10;&#10;Each team of players has their own win conditions, and will go toe-to-toe with their opponents to achieve them through fast-paced strategy-fueled combat. Adventurers traverse the Goblins&rsquo; cave in order to steal Relics&mdash;objects of great arcane power. Goblins must defend their homes from the greedy invaders who are trying to steal their relics, navigating the cave through tunnels only they can use! Each team is comprised of unique characters with rich lore and powerful specialized abilities, not unlike a board game version of a MOBA (like League of Legends) or hero shooter (like Overwatch or Apex Legends).&#10;&#10;Players control two characters simultaneously. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they draw an ability card from each character's ability deck, roll a die for each character&rsquo;s movement, then move and use an ability card for each character, in any order they wish. The game ends either when all characters on a team are incapacitated, when the Adventurers escape with a relic, or when 10 rounds have passed.&#10;&#10;With 10 playable characters, multiple cave maps, and several planned expansions, Goblin Cave offers a great deal of replayability and long-term support.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, players chose whether to cast a ghost from either their own area or a shared area space. Ghosts can be casted in any diagonal direction.&#10;&#10;When casting, a player will pick up all ghosts currently on that area space. The player then choses a direction and puts one ghost marker on each space proceeding straight in that direction until they have used up all the ghost markers.&#10;&#10;If a player finishes casting and the last ghost marker lands in his or her own Safe Area, the player may take this single ghost marker and place it off the board to be used for Reincarnation.&#10;&#10;After finishing this Capture step, the player may then choose whether to use Reincarnation or Store. By using Reincarnation, the player will draw a card with a bonus written on it. Reincarnation rewards the player with a bonus but if the player Stores their captured ghosts, they can trigger an even bigger Reincarnation bonus later in the game.&#10;&#10;The bonus enables the player to cast again and chase away more ghosts from their area. However, players should be careful not to chase away too many ghosts which could result in limited choices. Instead, they should strategize to chain the bonus events together so that they can win in one fell swoop. At the end of a round, remove any ghosts that remain in either player&rsquo;s Safe Area.&#10;&#10;",

The game was to teach children the rules of the road.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own car on the game board - dice and tokens (money) are used to play, which are used to pay fines for violating the rules of the road.&#10;&#10;Interesting fact: &#10;The official rules of the game also provide a basic overview of road traffic signs.&#10;The preface to the rules was written by the Ministry of Emergency Security&#10;&#10;Basic course of the game:&#10;It is played on a game board that shows the road (which has a clearly defined start and finish) and each player has his own figure (in the shape of a race car), which moves around the playing area. To move around the board, players roll the dice (three dice with numbers 1 to 6). At the beginning of the game, players roll the dice - the player with the highest total starts and then the others according to the sum on the dice.&#10;Subsequently, the players take turns - everyone rolls the dice on their turn - and according to the sum on the dice, they move on the playing field towards the goal with the toy car.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the roads, including traffic signs - for example:&#10;&#10;     Main road in front of the intersection - the player can continue without interruption&#10;     Side road in front of the intersection - you are on a side road and you have to pass all the vehicles on the main road - so deduct 2 points from your roll of the dice for the delay at the intersection.&#10;     Prohibition of overtaking - in corners or marked places, players may not overtake the vehicles of other players in front of them - they must follow them, even if they threw a larger number of points on the dice. It is possible to overtake only after the end of the overtaking ban.&#10;     Traffic light - the game contains a dice that has colors on the sides - red, yellow and green. When a player arrives at the intersection square with a traffic light, he must roll this dice and may not continue until he is green.&#10;     Speed &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;limit - a player who moves in this part of the road counts only half the value of his dice roll.&#10;     No stop sign - if a player ends his turn on this square, he must pay one coin fine.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game also contains red wooden chips that represent money. At the beginning of the game, the players distribute them evenly. When playing, the places where fines are paid are defined - for example, No stop sign.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who reaches the finish line first and at the same time has at least one more money - so he did not spend everything on fines.&#10;&#10;",

Yes, the B-movie - low on budget, but high on thrills, chills, and bloody spills. This may not be the glamorous side of Hollywood but if you roll your dice right, it could still be profitable!&#10;&#10;This time around, you'll have access to new roles and specialized equipment to help you get the job done. But your responsibility to produce a watchable film is as demanding as ever! Your movies now have unique genre requirements: crime, fantasy, horror, sci-fi, western -- or some kind of mixed-up genre soup combination.

Or risk summoning them early when they're weaker in case you lose control of them and are forced to use them? And will you have the Seals at hand to make sure your Demons are boosted, or enable you to banish your opponent's Demons that threaten your victory? Luck will certainly play a big part when largely uncontrollable entities are involved, but Demonic victory will depend on how well you play the hand you're dealt.&#10;&#10;On a turn each player will play cards &amp; also metal tokens (seals).&#10;It's played over 3-6 rounds (depending on number of players).&#10;The player with the highest points score at the end of the rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns sliding 1 of their pieces across the board. There are no captures or jumps, but players' pieces will keep sliding on open tiles if they move in a direction until they would run into something. When you lead a piece home, that's one less piece on the board to block your rival. Every piece on the board may help or halt your progress.&#10;&#10;While Nersha has several board layouts that ship with the game, players can decide to change the board or the number of pieces to play with, among other aspects. There are also seven different tile types that can add more complexity to mapmaking.&#10;&#10;This game is designed to bridge between casual or abstract games you learn as a kid with daunting games like chess, bringing together all playstyles.&#10;&#10;",

Collecting certain elements will level up your Traveler's spells, enabling power plays that can shift the pace of a fight dramatically. Each Traveler uses each element differently, and can greatly affect how you prioritize your drafting and banning.&#10;&#10;Banishing enemy characters, securing artifacts, and defeating rival Travelers will destabilize your opponent's timeline, but also grant them more power.

    "Description": "You can feel the ice-cold wind on your face. Snow is crunching under your feet. The panorama is simply amazing. You are standing on Jungfraujoch and looking out over Switzerland &ndash; it is a feeling like no other! You quickly take a picture before continuing on with your tour of Switzerland. There is so much to discover. In Broc you want to see Maison Cailler, the famous Swiss chocolaterie, and you plan to visit the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. And perhaps you will be lucky enough to snap a picture of an ibex in the national park! But unfortunately your holidays will soon be over. Only those who plan well manage to see as much of Switzerland as they can before the holidays officially come to an end. You obviously also need a bit of luck on this kind of trip. An exciting game for all Switzerland enthusiasts.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;You are exploring Switzerland with a small group of travellers. Your three travellers start in different cities in Switzerland: one starts in German-speaking Switzerland (in Basel), one starts in Ticino (in Mendrisio) and one starts in Western Switzerland (in Geneva). You win the game if you score the most points with your three travellers. To earn points, your travellers have to reach as many destinations as possible, go on discovery tours and take pictures of attractions.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;The youngest player is the tour guide and is responsible for managing the calendar during the game. The youngest player begins the game and takes a turn. A turn means they 1) roll the dice and reroll and 2) perform the roll results. After a turn, the next player takes their turn going anticlockwise, and so on. Every time the tour guide takes their turn, a new day of travel begins. The tour guide moves the calendar marker forward to the next day.&#10;&#10;",

If the goalkeeper guesses the direction, they will put gloves to cover the circles inside the goal. Those circles has numbers and the shooter needs to choose one empty circle and roll the die to match with one of the number of that circle. If that happens it will be a goal, otherwise the shot will be blocked.&#10;&#10;First team obtaining 5 goals will be the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;",

RAID's unique gameplay brings everyone together!&#10;&#10;RAID is a fast-paced party game for players of all ages - it's great for adults who love word games and are uber-competitive, as well as more casual players and kids. There's even a second board on the reverse side where it&rsquo;s easier to form words. RAID is perfect to encourage children to have fun with words and you get TWO games in ONE BOX!&#10;&#10;One player rolls the dice and takes the number of letters indicated on the dice from the bag and places them face up in the circle for everyone to see. At a quick pace the next player does the same. As soon as any letters are in the circle, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s turn. To form a word you take letters from the circle. The first player to shout out a word grabs the letters and fits them on their board in one of their rows.&#10;&#10;Anyone can steal or RAID any word from another player's board by combining it with one or more letters from the circle to form a new word. Note: the new word has to have a completely new meaning to be a valid RAID. New letters are constantly being added so be sure to look out for new opportunities on your road to victory.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to win:&#10;Be the first player to complete three rows in your field.&#10;Be the player with the most points after a pre-agreed time limit.&#10;Be the player with the most points after all the letters tiles have been drawn.&#10;&#10;The RAID App is here for everyone and you can download it on your phone, tablet or personal computer right now!&#10;&#10;",

Activate special skills and be the last one standing to win!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drafting heroes (from the 17 character cards included in the box) that they will use to battle their opponents. Each player shuffles a 54 card standard playing card deck (sold separately) and draws a starting hand equal to the value printed on their current character. They also draw cards equal to that character's LIFE value. Players will then pick one card from their hand to represent their starting POWER (1-10 cards have power equivalent to their numbers, while Jacks, Queens and Kings equal a power value of 11,12 and 13 respectively).&#10;&#10;Players then take turns playing different suits and numbered cards in specific combinations to activate their character's own unique battle skills. These skills will either allow you to charge up your current battle power value even further, increase the rate of damage dealt to losing players at the end of the round, or any number of special abilities (like drawing more cards or dealing instant damage to an opponent).&#10;&#10;Once all players PASS, everyone counts up who has the current highest power value. That player wins that round, dealing damage to every other player, equivalent to the current rate of damage! Those players must discard life cards equal to the damage rate. If a hero loses all of it's health, that player must switch to one of their reserve heroes. When all of your opponents heroes have been reduced to 0 health, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

(It is also a fantastic get to know you game for a first date)&#10;&#10;First the Active Player is selected. Then, all other players look at their cards in hand and choose a number of cards to play face down in the middle based on the Quick Start Chart. Then if needed, add cards from the deck until there are at least 5 cards in the middle (again see the Quick Start Chart).&#10;&#10;After all cards are submitted, the Active Player mixes the cards up and turns them over face up and puts them in a row. The Active Player will then secretly choose from the options which one they personally are &ldquo;Most Like&rdquo; AND which one they are &ldquo;Least Like&rdquo; and write it down. (Note: This is NOT which one do you like the most? It is which one are you most like?) At the same time all other players are secretly writing down what they predict the active player will choose for Most and Least about themselves.&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their decisions, all non-active players reveal their choices at the same time by placing their (Most Token) and (Least Token) below each of the respectively chosen cards. The Active Player will then place their (Most Token) and (Least Token) above each respectively chosen card. After points are awarded, discard the cards from the middle, everyone restocks their hand to five cards and the next player become the Active Player.&#10;&#10;The points needed to win varies on based on number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Once each player has played three cards, these cards are revealed one by one and resolved. The players do the same with their three remaining cards. They get their six cards back and begin a new round if the end of game condition is not met.&#10;&#10;A player wins if they are the first to reach the rocket with all their meeples.&#10;&#10;Solo mode included: Program against a virtual player&#10;Program character configurations in the waiting line, in successive challenges.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Treeblox is an abstract strategy board game in which two trees compete for sunlight in three-dimensional space.&#10;&#10;The game starts with an empty board. Players then take turns placing cubes that represent leaves and branches. Unshaded leaves &mdash; that is, leaves that are visible when the board is viewed from above &mdash; count as active and supply their tree with energy to grow further. Your goal is to shade your opponent's leaves while keeping your own leaves open to the sun.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one leaf in a space on the 4x4 game board. On a turn, if you have 1-2 unshaded leaves, you place one piece on the board, whether a branch or a leaf; if you have three or more unshaded leaves, then you place up to two pieces. You can place nothing in a leaf, so a leaf serves as an endpoint for growth. If you place a branch, however, then you can add a branch or a leaf to any available side of that branch. You can have multiple branches growing on the game board, and the branches and leaves can extend outside of the 4x4 game board. If you build high enough, you can shade an opponent's leaves.&#10;&#10;When a player has placed their final piece, whether because they've placed everything or they have no legal placements available, the other player goes through a &quot;final growth&quot; phase in which they place everything they can. At that point, whoever has the most unshaded leaves wins. If you ever have zero unshaded leaves during play, you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "March 4th, 1861. In his inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln promises not to invade the south or curtail slavery as long as tariffs are collected there and forwarded to the federal government. The south secedes from the Union nonetheless. Lincoln won&rsquo;t let it go, however, and attempts to reinforce Fort Sumter (in his view still federal property) in Confederate South Carolina, provoking the south into firing the first shots. Its cannons level the fort, albeit without loss of life. War fever in the north is at its zenith, and the stage is set &ndash; for the U.S. Civil War.&#10;&#10;During this game you&rsquo;ll compete for cards representing Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry and Generals &ndash; by playing hands of 3-card poker. (Hence, &ldquo;3CP&rdquo; in the game&rsquo;s title.) However, since this is more or less a friendly competition, the &ldquo;pots&rdquo; are not winner-take-all. Instead, the winner of a round will gain two components, while his/her opponent will gain one &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the winner&rsquo;s decision. Close attention to your needs and those of your opponent is required. Your goal is, ideally, to build four Brigades, each with a General and Supplies, and perhaps one additional Brigade if you&rsquo;re lucky. Card management in the form of &ldquo;what poker hand to play now and what to save for later&rdquo; is also an important factor toward winning the game.&#10;&#10;This is the third game in a series using the 3CP Game Engine&trade;, which employs custom cards and a deck of standard playing cards.&#10;&#10;",

With almost 1,000 pages, the book set features an abundantly detailed world, four unique, bold, extensively playtested new classes, four original races, hundreds of unique illustrations, and hundreds of subclasses, spells, feats, and backgrounds &mdash; plus more. Working also as an expansion to Arena: The Contest and Tanares Adventures, you can experience the power of these new features as new classes, sub-classes, and races as the miniatures also come with everything you need to play them on our board games too.&#10;&#10;Behold the majesty of the new Gold Dragon and the new, fearsome Penumbral Dragon, ready for the fight on Boss Vs. Boss mode, found on the Dragon Collection Expansion. Meet the warlords from Arena: The Contest, in new, exclusive miniatures, complete with new cards. Face the terror of the new foes from the Penumbral Plane and complete your 3d scenery collection with the new Scenario Pack.&#10;&#10;In Tanares, whenever war was waged, the bloodshed summoned a powerful, frenzied Dragon that buried the civilizations involved, resetting History and forever changing the landscape.

Under this decree, and without many high-level adventurers out there, your Team may become one of the most powerful units in the world. Build an Adventure Team Sheet, earn Career Points and level up, design a headquarters and flag.&#10;&#10;Effect real change to all aspects of the scenario, be it with your 5E party or through the Solo Mode, a 300+ card deck that lets 1-4 players live and play the Adventure without a GM!

As they play through missions on numerous planets with a variety of biomes, they will discover the true nature of their enemy, and will have the opportunity to unearth the rich story of the world of Phantom Epoch.&#10;&#10;A wide range of character choices, including human and alien species which can be combined with a diverse set of classes, allows players to create and grow their own characters to match their own play style. Each mission has its own map, objectives, enemies, and challenges. Every map has a completely unique layout. No two missions will be the same, and players will have to adjust their strategies accordingly.&#10;&#10;Outside of missions, players will need to gather resources to repair and restore functionality to the starship that serves as their headquarters. Doing so will unlock facilities to improve their characters with upgraded equipment, attributes, and skills. As secrets from the past are revealed, they will gain combat knowledge in the form of branching advanced classes that allow players to further customize and empower their characters.&#10;&#10;Before missions, players prepare their equipment and Action cards that they'll bring with them on a mission. During a mission, players and adversaries simultaneously select Action cards at the start of each round. The selected cards determine the turn order for the round. During their turns the players and adversaries play the selected action cards one at a time. The campaign is made up of 40+ missions, and ends when the final story mission is played. As a fully cooperative game, players win a mission together by completing the mission objective, or lose together when all players are defeated or the objective is failed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Bell of Treason is a fast-paced, card-driven board game in which two players experience the existential crisis faced by Czechoslovakia in response to Hitler&rsquo;s territorial demands. One player represents the ideal of trying to Defend the country, even without allies and at any cost. The other player represents the historically victorious ideal of agreeing to Concede the Sudetenland territory, in order to prevent bloodshed and hoping that Hitler&rsquo;s demands would stop there. The game adapts the crisis modeling system originally introduced in Mark Herman's Fort Sumter and then further developed in Fred Serval's Red Flag Over Paris. The game does not make any judgment about whether it would have been the right choice for Czechoslovakia to defend itself in 1938, nor whether such a defense could, in any sense, have been successful. Instead, it allows you to experience for yourself this crisis period of 1938, which forever influenced Czechoslovakia's path and the eventual course of World War II. The game can also be played solo, using an adaption of the innovative and elegant system originally designed by Jason Carr for Red Flag Over Paris.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
