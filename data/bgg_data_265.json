    "Description": "In this kids game children learn about waste separation.&#10;The map shows 4 houses and a street leading to the waste disposal site. Each house has a garbage can. There are also two garbage trucks. These Trucks start collecting waste at the beginning of the game. The game ends when those trucks reach the disposal site. Players work together to sort all the trash before the trucks pass by their houses.  And because this is a cooperative game, you can give your turn to another player if he or she needs it. Goal of the game is that the players try to dispose their garbage to be recycled before the trucks reach the disposal site.  If all the garbage is sorted by the time the trucks come to pick it up, everybody wins!&#10;The cards show different kinds of recyclable waste such as paper and glass, material to compost but also hazardous waste.&#10;One of the two dice decides which waste to handle the other advances the garbage trucks.&#10;&#10;A cooperative game for 2-4 players Ages 5 - 8&#10;&#10;",

To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!&#10;&#10;UNDO: Curse from the Past is one of three initial cases of the innovative new game series UNDO. As players travel far into the past and try to give the victim a new future, they gradually explore an extraordinary story about a curse that spans millennia and destroys the happiness of a family.&#10;&#10;Berlin, Germany, January 1994: Stunned, an old lady falls over the handrails and into the depths. Her eyes show no signs of panic, but grief about what has happened. She hurtles towards the ground from the sixth floor of a hotel, looking fondly at a tuft of blonde hair in her hand. The cold air turns her final breath into a small plume. The last things she perceives are a terrible scream from above and the city lights mingling with the stars in the nightly sky...&#10;&#10;",

But there are cases where the card does not have an effect in the current game situation; in that case, no Knonster is moved. If a Knonster crosses the finish line after position 60, it will be placed on the best still available place on the podium. If a player has fewer than 5 hand cards, the player draws a card from the draw pile (if there are any cards left).&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends immediately after the third Knonster has crossed the finish line. Theoretically it can also happen, that the draw deck is depleted when a player is about to draw a card, but fewer than 3 Knonsters have reached the goal. In that case, the game also ends, but only for the Knonsters which have reached the goal the points will be distributed.&#10;&#10;",

Now is your chance to dominate the epic lands of Azeroth and beyond with cunning economic strategies. Buy the ominous Twilight Highlands and feel the presence of the Old Gods in the air. Trade for Scourge-infested Icecrown to gain complete control of the coveted Northrend zones. And for the ultimate power play, seize the mighty faction capitals: Orgrimmar and Stormwind. When you own it all and reign supreme over your opponents, victory will be yours.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the player with the most money at the end of the game. On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to the battle ground (jail).&#10;&#10;Fully customized game elements including:&#10;&#10;Custom Money: $1 Chen (from the new Pandaren race, featured in the soon-to-be released expansion, Mists of Pandaria)), $5 Magni (Dwarf), $10 Vol'Jin (Troll), $20 Tyrande (Night Elf), $50 Sylvanas (Blood Elf), $100 Varian ( Human), $500 Thrall (Orc)&#10;&#10;Custom Tokens: These top 6 tokens were voted on by fans: Corehound Pup, Murky, Doomhammer, Hearthstone, Mechagnome, Flight Path Boot&#10;&#10;",

The bears are in 4 colors; equally colored bears sit opposite of each other. The target is to earn honey-jars by making the bears of the same color face each other. By rolling the color dice, you change the direction the bear is looking at: towards or away from the center of the circle. You can decide which of the two bears of the rolled color you turn around.  The first to get 5 pots of honey wins!&#10;&#10;In 2006 a Miffy version was released, featuring the world-famous designs of Dick Bruna.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Here the players find themselves as Orc War Chieftains on their way to fight those intolerable forces of the Empire. Only problem is that several Orcish clans have run into each other so inevitably they start to squabble over the carcass of some unfortunate Elf that is roasting over a campfire. In the time it takes for the sun to move from up to just a little more up the Orcs are at it and it&rsquo;s each Orcish War Chief for himself.&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to create armies, which are placed into 3 battle lines or formations. Each line must have one musician and one standard bearer and each of these must be placed on the far left or right of each line. Each line can be up to 12 units long but a player can create a shortened battle line by placing the two required units closer together.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player will draw one or more cards from the deck. Units drawn must be placed whilst other cards are discarded for their effects. Once a battle line has a musician and a standard bearer and all spaces in between the two are filled (with units or loot), that line can go to war and attack the battle line of another player. All units are worth a battle rating. Both sides simply add up their ratings for all units and the highest total wins, although the roll of a fate dice can still mix things up.&#10;&#10;The winner can take any loot present from the defeated player's line and this is in truth the main aim as loot is worth points that are tallied up at the end to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Chaos Marauders also allows for players to try and construct larger units made up of multiple cards such as War Machines.&#10;&#10;See also: Summary of differences from the first edition of Chaos Marauders.&#10;&#10;",

The bowler rotates his handle to first ball of the over and back to the start, revealing a type of ball (leg break, bouncer, etc). The batsman rotates his handle to the type of ball bowled, and back again, revealing a batsman scoring runs or being dismissed. If you know the rules of cricket, it's obvious how to simulate a test match given these rules.&#10;&#10;There are several versions of Test Match. Johns Sands first version appeared in 1954 and shows an 8 ball Over. This being the correct rule in Australian Cricket between 1936 to 1979. Australian Cricket changed to a 6 Ball Over from 1979 and later Test Match versions reflect this change. Other graphical changes, such as updated Grandstands, players positions and scenery have also changed in time. English cricket on the other hand always had a 6 ball Over from 1946 so Waddingtons version only ever showed a 6 ball Over.&#10;&#10;",

This derives from the four colors (red, white, green, yellow) that form the suits of this deck of traditional Chinese playing cards.  In English, these are sometimes described as Chess cards because they depict the Chinese characters from Chinese chess (XiangQi). As with most Chinese traditional playing cards, the cards are much longer than they are wide. However, there are regional variants with shorter cards.&#10;&#10;Note that See Sek is different from Chess cards that only come in two colors and which are used for a different game.&#10;&#10;A full deck consists of 112 cards: 28 cards in each of 4 suits (the colors). Each suit has the Chinese characters for the seven types of XiangQi pieces, repeated four times.&#10;&#10;They are often used to play Rummy-type games and the melds may be three or four of exactly the same kind, three or four of a kind but in all different colors, single-card melds (the General or Ong), and three-card melds in 'sequence' and in the same color. There are two 'sequences': Ong, Soo and Chiau (Jiang, Shi, Xiang); and Koo, Beh, Pow (Ju, Ma, Pao).&#10;&#10;In Singapore and Malaysia, these card games are often played by Hokkiens and Teochews.&#10;&#10;",

There are 8 of each kind.&#10;&#10;As well, there is a chef (Poppa, presumably); he balances the pizza on a finger, and his body can also roll on the ground.  This makes it extra-interesting to keep him balanced! (For a simpler game, connect the notch in the body to the legs, which prevents rolling.)&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll a special 6-sided die.  It will either be one of the 4 toppings, a 'wild' topping (you pick), or a chef.&#10;- If it is the chef, then you don't have to place a piece!&#10;- If a particular topping is not available, then roll again.&#10;- Otherwise, put your topping anywhere on the pizza, including on top of other food, without spilling ANY toppings.&#10;&#10;The goal is to NOT spill toppings off the pizza.  If you do, you're OUT!  Last one left wins.&#10;&#10;Ages 3 and up.&#10;&#10;",

You play cards to move your 2 meeples around the cards's circle and gain points.&#10;&#10;First, you can (optional action) use a power card (those cards are collected on pickaxes). Each card has a unique effect - read it by hovering the card in your hand with your mouse.&#10;&#10;Secondly, you have to chose between drawing 2 movement cards OR use 1 movement card then draw 1 movement card. A grey downward arrow allows you to move your meeple ; a black upward arrow allows you to move any opponent's meeple. Each arrow gives 2 possibilities : moving a meeple by the number indicated in the circle (positive = clockwise ; negative = unclockwise) OR moving a meeple toward the card with the number indicated in the square.&#10;&#10;You'll gain points by surrounding any &quot;home&quot; card with your 2 meeples or with 1 of your meeple and one opponent's meeple.&#10; The goal is to be the first to reach 12 points.&#10;&#10;The game is online playable at Boardgamearena.&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft story of the same name &ndash; that is, they don't know whether or not rats truly scamper behind the walls of their residence.&#10;&#10;In the game, one player is the Giver and starts the round with the dice cup and a single die, which shows one rat on one face, two rats on another face, and no rats on the remaining four faces. The Giver places the die in the cup, shakes the cup, places it face down, then peeks inside. He then claims to hear no rats behind the walls or some number of rats. If he says no rats and the next player &ndash; the Receiver &ndash; believes him, the Receiver becomes the new Giver, adds a die to the cup, and the game continues; if the Receiver doesn't believe him, then he lifts the cup. If no rats are present, the Receiver loses one &quot;brain&quot; scoring token to the Giver; clearly he's touched in the head if he's hearing rats where none exist. If rats are present, however, then the Giver loses two brains, giving one of them to the Receiver. The Caller's an even worse case!&#10;&#10;If the Giver claims that rats are present, he must pay one brain, then the Receiver taking the cup can call him (with penalties going one way or the other) or he can believe the Giver, handing over one brain to the Giver as the sanity cost of accepting such nonsense. The Receiver can then either pass the cup along to the next person or he can add a die to the cup, shake all the dice, and make another claim about the number of mice in the walls, with this number being at least one larger than the previous number. In this case, the Receiver becomes the Giver, and the round continues as before.&#10;&#10;Once one player has lost all of his brains, the game ends, and the player with the most brains wins.&#10;&#10;",

When you kill a boss (in the third row), the player who has made a dent in the second row gets an artefact.

The game may end in two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Immediately when the players get all the artefacts (in which case, each Artefact scores 5 points),&#10;     OR after ten turns (in which case, the Artefacts do not score).&#10;&#10;&#10;Last Heroes is both collaborative and competitive. You need the other players' ammunition to load your weapons, and in return you help them by making a dent in the monsters' rows. The winner is the player who has killed the most valuable monsters and provided the most ammunitions to their fellow hunters.&#10;&#10;",

Oda Nobunaga tried to unify the country and reorganize the government by bringing the authority back to TENNO. In 1576, he selected Azuchi, a town on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa where he started to establish his new castle and power. This unconstrained and lively city reflected his ambition to bring an end to a chaotic era. The city was characterized by a luxurious castle and open markets; his city underwent unprecedented growth. Now it is your turn!&#10;&#10;In Azuchi Castle, players acting in the role of retainers need to complete Oda Nobunaga's mission: Construct Azuchi castle. You need to produce resources (roof tile, stone, wood) and earn money. You should also raise armies against upcoming attacks. Based on your efficient choice of actions, you could win the game by earning more victory points than your competitors.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;A heart wrenching co-op tabletop game where you must work with a partner to waddle your three fragile ducklings to safety. As a game where 2 parents from 2 families choose to either work together or against one another to keep their 3 duckling children safe, it simulates what life is like as a parent when the world is out to get you.&#10;&#10;The parents are the players and they share a responsibility to supervise and keep their ducklings safe. Families start at opposite bodies of water, with one beginning at the lake and the other at the pond, both with the goal of getting to the other side. The path to your goal is created by the players and is constructed by a deck of randomized event cards prior to play.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a parent rolls a die. They move up to the amount of spaces they rolled, and then choose an event card to land on. They will flip this card over and read its effects. Each event card has two options. The parent must choose one of the two options. They may consult their partner on what to do, but it is ultimately their choice. Some biomes can cause harm to the ducklings. When harm comes to the ducklings, an affliction token must be placed on the card. If three afflictions are placed on a duckling, both parents must flip the card so that the picture is face down. This card is now out of play, and the parents must read out loud the text on the back of the card.&#10;&#10;If all of the ducklings in your family are flipped, you lose. The family with the most ducklings left alive at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Additional Mechanics Included in Gameplay:&#10;&#10;     Each duckling has a unique talent that can only be used once in the game.&#10;     The die you use corresponds to the amount of Ducklings you have. The more ducklings you have waddling behind you, the slower you are able move.&#10;     A territorial duck fight will occur if two parents of different families land on the same space. When this happens, both families suffer an affliction.&#10;     Once both parents from one family reach their new home, the Winter Season begins, where the remaining family suffers one affliction at the start of each of their parents turns.&#10;&#10;&#10;Features of Ducklings&#10;&#10;     Gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, but both the moral and strategic decisions add depth to the simple gameplay.&#10;     Unique, custom artwork for over 60 cards.&#10;     Modular game board as the game is constructed out of a randomizable deck.&#10;     Players can shape the path any way they want, even with creative branching paths.&#10;     The modular game board allows for variable play lengths to fit time constraints as the players do not have to use the full deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each Badger die holds one supply die.&#10;    Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.&#10;    If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.&#10;&#10;&#10;After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &mdash; or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

They can raid Spanish fortresses or kill the Kraken. But they must also beware the Spanish Armada, the British authorities and other pirates. The main goal is to be the pirate with A) the most gold and B) a head still attached to a neck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is about the water cycle: that it evaporates from the sea, rivers, lakes, etc, into the air, where it forms clouds, the clouds move with winds, when they pass over mountains it starts raining, the rain will supply rivers, lakes and underground water, and from here it goes to the sea.&#10;&#10;What it&rsquo;s not so obvious that they learn is that the quantity of water in the planet, in it&rsquo;s different forms, does not increase or decrease over the centuries. The population is increasing fast, and that this is originating problems in the water cycle all over the world. This is leading to shortages of water in some regions and to very difficult life conditions.&#10;&#10;In this game, players can influence the water cycle. The board represents the water cycle, with all the elements described above, each of them is numbered (from 1 to 6). Players throw dices and each of them choose a movement (one dice) that they want to do. Then they will have to move their water (colour cubes for each player) between those elements. The board also has the population, that is increasing at the same time it&rsquo;s fed with water, and players will try to ensure the population gets the water that it needs. Only this way can they get points. If a player cannot do the movement for the die they chose (or were forced to choose), they LOSE 1 point&#10;&#10;The player who can ensure the best balance of water between the different elements of the water cycle, whilst being able to give it to the population whenever there is an opportunity, will make more points and win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A collectible card game from Steve Jackson aimed directly at the kids.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you and your fellow ninja claim the four golden weapons and keep them away from the skeleton general and his army before they overrun the ninja fortress? You would think so, given that the weapons are hidden within your fortress, but ninja are sometimes so sneaky that they forget where they hid things. Start looking, ninja!&#10;&#10;In Ninjago: The Board Game, a spin-off of the 2011 line of Ninjago spin-and-attack figures from LEGO, players must work together to claim the weapons and fight back the skeleton guards you'll encounter. On a turn, you spin the die, then take one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; On a two, you move your ninja up to two spaces, searching a guardhouse for a weapon if you stop in a space where a guardhouse is located.&#10;&bull; On a one/guard, move one space, then place a skeleton guard on a space occupied by a ninja.&#10;&bull; On a one/general, move one space, then move the skeleton general one space down the temple steps.&#10;&bull; On a rope/general, attach a rope to your ninja's head (!) and a nearby guardhouse, then swing to any space that you can reach and land there, then move the general down the temple steps one space.&#10;&#10;If a skeleton guard is in your space at the start of your turn, spin the spinner. If it lands on your color or the color of any other ninja in that space, you defeat the guard and take a normal turn; otherwise, move the general down one step and lose your turn.&#10;&#10;If the general reaches the bottom of the steps, he steal one weapon from you, then climbs to the top of the steps once again to begin another descent. If you have claimed no weapons by the time this happens, you all lose the game.&#10;&#10;Once all the weapons are claimed or captured by the general, enter the final battle, taking turns with the spinner to see whether the general captures another weapon, whether the ninja do, or whether nothing happens. Your sensei awaits on the side of the board, ready to aide you once during this final battle to protect the weapons &ndash; unless you've already used his power during the game.&#10;&#10;As with all the LEGO games, Ninjago: The Board Game includes multiple variants, such as adjusting the power of the sensei, adding a memory component, adding or removing steps in the temple to tweak the general's effect.&#10;&#10;",

Will they succeed or are the strict guards too clever for them? &#10;&#10;Strategic escaping game&#10;SECTION X is a game in which clever escapees dig tunnels themselves but also make use of tunnels belonging to other players and cut each other off. Special hiding places ensure that the prisoners are safe when the ruthless prison guards make their rounds. A rumor has spread that an escape is imminent, so it becomes more and more difficult to remain out of the hands of the guards. Doors lock the entrances to the different escape tunnels.

Each game adds to all prior games until Game 21, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, is attained.&#10;&#10;As well as building WFFs (Well Formed Formulas), players must also try to reach a goal by using rules of inference.&#10;&#10;For example: If the goal is 'p', a player could use the 'Ko' (or Conjunction Out) rule and use 'Kpq' as a premise.  In other terms, if the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy and the last games of WFF 'n PROOF are hard.&quot;  Then it can be inferred that the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Up to 36 dice are rolled depending on the game being played.  One player sets a 'goal' by building a WFF in the goal area of the playing mat.  players then alternate playing dice to the &quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; sections of the play area.  If a die is placed in the essential area it MUST be used in either a premise or a rule.  If a player doesn't think that it can be used, he can challenge his opponent.&#10;&#10;To win, a player must make a successful challenge or be unsuccessfully challenged.&#10;&#10;Games 3 through 19 introduce the 11 Rules of Logical Inference in this order: Conjunction, Implication, Reiteration, Disjunction, Negation, and Equivalence.  Then 18 more derived rules are added to the mix for Game 20, the PC (Propositional Calculus) game.  The 21st and final game, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, takes the PC game and adds timed moves for rapid and chaotic scoring.&#10;&#10;",

Water is in the corners and sand is on the sides. A treasure chest sits in the center of each tile, which is one of the two colors. Placed together, the tiles form a water/sand maze.&#10;&#10;During the game, players take turns drawing a tile and adding it to the grid in almost any location; the one restriction is that a player cannot extend the grid in the direction of the opponent. When the grid is complete, players score one point for each chest that is connected to more exits on their side of the grid than on the opponent's side. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each awful situation has been ranked from 1-100 by a panel of experts based on physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. This ranking is what we call &quot;The Misery Index&quot;. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt three situation cards, which they place face up on the table in front for them, ranked by numerical order of The Misery Index. This is called a players' &quot;Misery Lane&quot;. There are three rounds of play:&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 1 &mdash; &quot;Misery Lane&quot;: The player to the right of the first guesser draws a card from the draw pile and reads the situation aloud and shows the illustration, but hides The Misery Index number on the bottom of the card. To win the card, the player must correctly guess where this situation falls in their Misery Lane. If they are correct, they win that card and add it to their Misery Lane.&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 2 &mdash; &quot;More or Less Miserable&quot;: After a player has collected a total of eight cards in their Misery Lane, they have now entered the second round. In this round, the player to the right takes the first three cards from the top of the deck and and reads the descriptions aloud. Now the player must correctly put all three cards in the correct order (from least to worst) by announcing them aloud to the group, without seeing their Misery Index number. If they are incorrect, play continues to the left and they will have another chance with three more cards on their next turn. If they are correct, they add them to their Misery Lane and progress to Round 3.&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 3 &mdash; &quot;Margin of Misery&quot;: In this final round, the player must guess The Misery Index number within 10 points. The player to the right draws a card and reads the situation aloud. The player now must correctly guess a 10-point range that this card falls into. For example, if it is a Misery Index number of 82, and the player guesses a range of 75-85, that player wins that card and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Win condition: Be the first player to have 12 cards in their Misery Lane.&#10;&#10;",
