The planners had predicted the direction of most of the German thrusts, with the exception of the intensity of the flanking movement via Prussia and Slovakia. Although the Polish Army had already started their mobilization during mid-August, the final part was postponed until August the 30th due to the political situation and the work to find a diplomatic solution. However, on the German side, a general mobilization had already been completed under the cover of a military exercise, and the German army was deployed around the Polish border according to the German strategic invasion plan, Case White (Fall Wei&szlig;), originally developed by generals Blumentritt and von Manstein. &#10; Plan West&trade; is an attempt to create a fun and fast-paced board game on one of the most decisive campaigns during World War II. The game is based around a chit-pull system and a Victory Point time track that forces the Germans to operate at a historical tempo during the game. Plan West&trade; covers the first 10 days of the campaign and is played on a coffee table sized map.&#10;&#10;It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Stargard Solstice, Plan West and Army Group Narwa and utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of a 3D plan of a little cottage. There are two platforms on each side of the roof where Hansel climbs to throw down ginger.&#10;&#10;Below stands Gretel who catches the pieces of ginger. There are six places where Gretel can stand on each side of the cottage and each side of the roof.&#10;&#10;You can move Hansel and Gretel according to the throw of the dice. Hansel can move one platform up or down, and Gretel can move to an adjacent place on the ground. A third option given on the dice is for Hansel to throw down one ginger by sliding new tile from the bundle on the table.&#10;&#10;Each platform of the roof consists of six ginger tiles. On the other side of the tile are one or three almonds, but there can also be a witch who can catch Gretel and force her to give up one ginger tile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no tiles to put on the roof. Whoever has collected the most almonds wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kreuzwort-Pulok is a collection of games with the same materials: 256 letter tiles (15 don't have letters, but faces on them - these are wildcards) and a grid board for each player that is protected from the view of other players by an integrated paper screen. There also is a cardboard &quot;plate&quot; (a round disk for discarded tiles).&#10;&#10;The goal is to form crosswords on the grid boards. There are ten games included:&#10;&#10;Sechzehner-Spiel: Each player has to form a word that someone announced. Tiles not needed for this are used for crossing words. Tiles are drawn and discarded (openly, so other players can grab the discarded ones). When the first player finishes, the other get penalties depending on the number of tiles left over and the number of tiles missing for the basic word.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;nfer-Spiel: Each player has to form a cross of two words with five tiles. When that isn't possible, additional tiles are drawn, but not more than two unused ones can be held in the end. The first player to achieve a legal crossword scores points.&#10;&#10;Achter-Spiel: Same as the F&uuml;nfer-Spiel, but two or more crosses have to be formed, three tiles can be kept.&#10;&#10;Kaufspiel (for two players): Each player draws ten tiles and looks at them without sorting them. The active player can then announce &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;playing&quot;. When buying, he/she also announces a number of tiles. Both players now have to discard this number of tiles and redraw them. When playing, both try to form a legal cross with their tiles. The winning player gets 10-15 points, the other one a penalty depending on the number of unused tiles.&#10;&#10;Leiter: Two columns of ten letters each are places on the table. The task of the players is to extend each pair of letters in one row into words. Thus they can get rid of their tiles. A player who cannot play has to draw a new tile. The first player to get rid of his/her tiles is the winner.&#10;&#10;Gruppenspiel: Similar to Leiter, but with an open cross instead of fixed columns. So the players can add tiles in any direction, as long as the letter combination occurs in a German word.&#10;&#10;Wettrennen: Each player gets 19 tiles and secretly forms a cross using at least 11 tiles. The score of the first player to achieve this is 10 plus the last digit squared (11 to 91 points). The other players lose one point for each unused tile.&#10;&#10;W&ouml;rter anbinden: A letter is placed on the table. Each player takes turns to add a letter, but the letters still have to form the beginning of a word. When that is not possible, all but the last (at least) two tiles are discarded and the last letters start the new word. The first player who can use up his/her tiles is the winner.&#10;&#10;Ausf&uuml;llspiel: Three letters are flipped open on the plate in the middle of the table. All players now try to form a word which uses two of these letters as first and last letters. The first player to manage this is the winner.&#10;&#10;Alleinspiel: A collection of four solitaire games.&#10;&#10;The designer of Kreuzwort-Pulok is uncredited, but the preface is signed &quot;J.M.&quot; (It seems likely, but isn't entirely clear whether these are the initials of the designer).&#10;&#10;(User Summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to either build your city to a strength of 15 or to pummel your enemy's city to a strength of zero. Each player holds two &quot;decks&quot; of cards - a resource and action deck. Action cards may be played if the player has the corresponding resource cards to spend. Actions include strenghtening your city, hiring a champion to defend your city, deploying spies and thieves, and attacking the enemy city or champion.&#10;&#10;Though intended for two players, up to four may play at one time by adding one deck for each additional player; this may add more dimensions to the game as alliances and cooperatives may be formed and broken.&#10;&#10;The play is not too intense, though planning a few turns ahead is essential to success.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you move one of your checkers to an unoccupied, orthogonally adjacent square, subject to the following.  The value of a checker is its number of friendly orthogonal adjacencies minus its number of enemy orthogonal adjacencies.  You can only move a checker when you increase the moved checker's value.  The last player to move wins.  I.e. if you don't have a move on your turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;",

Having visited Hexham, capital of the Middle March last year, and toured the first purpose-built gaol in England, my interest in the Border Reivers was rekindled and I devised the following game.&#10;&#10;&quot;Being both a wargamer and a role player I was interested in developing a fast, easy set of rules suitable for a skirmish encounter while instilling a sense of proprietary interest on the part of the players with their figures. Too often, I find, tabletop generals are willing to sacrifice their regiments with gleeful abandon, heedless of the actual cost. Role playing games generate a notion of investment and caution, with characters developed over a series of adventures. Steel Bonnets attempts to recreate the care and concern a reiver patriarch would feel for his sons and gillies when they are on raid.&quot;&#10;&#10;Scale: One turn equals one minute; one figure equals one man; half an inch equals one yard. 20mm or 25mm figures are recommended.&#10;&#10;Although a miniatures game, figures have individual characteristics and skills that develop over time.&#10;&#10;This simple system includes rules for Spotting and Victory Point, as well as everything need for combat. Includes four scenarios: The Cattle Raid, Black Mail, Government Raid, &amp; Gaol Break.&#10;&#10;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #78 (March 1994)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a dungeon crawl created by the same designer as &quot;Cutlass of Fire&quot; and made to poke fun at it. The rules are filled with funny references to the game itself and the previous game.  &#10;Squares are laid face down on the table and turned up as player put their pawns on them.  The player will encounter walls, monsters, skulls, fountains, and treasure chests.  By using cards for all actions except moving, the players battle monsters, find gems, and find spells, weapons and armor.  The players' ability to use the items depends on their skills. Spell skills are based on the known elements of the universe, namely: Cheese, Nougat, Lint, and Uranium 236. Weapon skills could be: Stabby, Pummely, Huckey, and Minty Fresh.  The number of hits a player or monster can take is called, &quot;Chutzpah.&quot;  The game ends when 7 gems are returned to 7 skulls (just like Cutlass of Fire) and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The basic rules of race games are still used however, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed.&#10;&#10;The hare must be advanced on its own track at the same time as the dogs. This is achieved by using two dice of different sizes, the smaller one for the hare. The dogs are moved by the players individually when their turn comes round, but the hare is moved at each throw of the dice.&#10;&#10;To win, a dog can either land in the same compartment as the hair or pass the winning post, but the dogs may not pass the hare, and those that might, lose a turn. Losing a turn is also the penalty if a dog lands in a compartment already occupied as `it is supposed a fight ensues'.&#10;&#10;",

The player with most chips at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;The &quot;board game&quot; is a push your luck game. The pieces, which contain numbers from 1-6, are placed on their bases, face down. One piece of each color is flipped over and put on the corresponding position in that color's spiral. &#10;A player can now flip over pieces and move them into their position until he/she flips over a piece that is larger than a previously played piece in the same color. In that case, all pieces that were jumped over are moved back to their bases (behind the un-flipped pieces, in numerical order) and it's the next player's turn. The same scoring applies as in the dice game.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN - corrections welcome. The rules aren't easy to understand)&#10;&#10;",

The players throw the die in turn and make a number of moves with any pawns equal to the value rolled. Each space on the bridge has a weight score and if the sum of the pawns' weight is greater than the stability score of the bridge, it collapses. Pawns at the start and in the middle of the bridge fall into the river and swim back to the start, pawns near the end land on rocks and are eliminated.&#10;&#10;If a player wishes to move his pawn to the goal and win, he must declare his intention to do so before rolling. The next player may then try and guess the roller's identity, with a correct guess eliminating that player from the game as well.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From the instructions:)&#10;&quot;The game is very simple and can be played with young children.  Each of the players will have a great deal of fun as they try to make the longest leg.&quot;&#10;&#10;(User Summary:)&#10;A picture of a boy, without legs, is placed on the table.  Players draw tiles with sections of a leg and a number printed on them.  One or more tiles can be played each turn to extend one of the boy's legs, but may only be played if their values total 7 or 11.  Boot tiles force players to complete their leg, but must also follow the 7-11 rule.  The player who completes the longest leg wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
