    "Description": "From their own land and time, Mulan, Lu Bu, and Musashi were transported to an arena to fight heroes from other places in a cruel game of survival. This was a fairy-tale place of terrible cruelty and fantastic legends. But then one day they found themselves elsewhere again, in a world called Yashima. This time they were joined by another hero of legend, Bruce Lee. Together they find themselves in a new world, and unlike the kami masters native to this land, their battle is in the hopes that each encounter may give them a clue on how they may return home.&#10;&#10;Yashima: Legends from Fairytale is both a standalone two-player game as well as an expansion for Yashima: Legend of the Kami Masters that allows you to add two additional players to that base game. Combine these two items with Yashima: Legend of the Deep Woods and Yashima: Legends of the Icy Peaks for epic eight-player team-based showdowns!&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play as Lu Bu to shock and awe opponents with raw power and a cavalier attitude towards your allies. &#10;    Play as Bruce Lee to counter your opponent's attacks, turning their offense into yours. &#10;    Play as Musashi to use unmatched agility and blur the lines between movement and strikes. &#10;    Play as Mulan to exploit your opponent's weaknesses with indirect tactics and redirect their own skills against them.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Cover Me, you are the chief editor of a magazine and your task is to brainwash the public so they think the models that star on your cover are the most stylish in the industry. Unfortunately you can't do this alone, and you need the help of the other magazines, but they are interested only in launching the models in their portfolio. Can you trick the other magazines in covering the models that help you achieve your goal and crush their dreams to become the most prestigious magazine?&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game is played in seasons. Each three months make one complete season, and after each season, a season special is published with your top model. To select a model, a player always has a selection of possible models available (his portfolio). Based on the selections of the different magazines you influence the public and determine the trends for the season. By anticipating the selections of your opponents and selecting the right model for your own magazine you can try to put a model on one of your covers that is completely in line with all trends so it can be your star in the season special. If you manage to do this, you keep the model in your score pile and you score points. If you haven't managed to cover such a model, you don't score points this round unless you managed to put three models on the cover that don't have anything in common with the fashion trends. If you manage to have such alternative models you can score multiple models, but this isn't easy to achieve.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately it is impossible to keep your star models as they will look for other opportunities, so during the game you will see many models leave and the selection of new models is also a key aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;After three years (12 seasons/rounds), the game ends. You count the points of the models you scored during the game. Not all models have the same point value. The later the model enters the game the more points she's worth, because such a model is more difficult to score.&#10;&#10;The game features 162 unique highly detailed models, a catwalk with public that also serves as a storage solution, a scoreboard and markers to achieve a realistic gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Who'll be the star on your cover?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reiner Knizia's Ingenious series got a new child in late 2008: Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel (&quot;Ingenious: The Card Game&quot;). In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&#10;&#10;As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On 15th November 1943, 100,000 Japanese of the IJA broke through the Chinese defense lines at Shek Mun, Cili and Lishui River. The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as &quot;Growling Tiger Division&quot;) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.&#10;&#10;The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.&#10;&#10;At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. &quot;No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.&#10;&#10;On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000. Chinese casualties were more than 100,000 but they held the City of Changde at a terrible price.&#10;&#10;Scale&#10;1hex = 800m , unit = bataillon. Compared to the original game, we reworked the supply rules system and the management of the tactical chits and Air Force chits (and new graphics..)&#10;&#10;Victory conditions&#10;The Japanese must control Changde at the end of the game. If at the end of any turn the Japanese control Changde, it's an automatic victory. If at any time during the game a Chinese reinforcement unit enters Changde, the Chinese wins the game. The Japanese will start strong but will have a lot to do to keep their supply roads safe. Supply is needed for heavy artillery and to reorganize and reconstruct infantry units. The Chinese reinforcement will enter the map in their rear from all sides. A double encirclement. It will be brutal.&#10;&#10;Activation by divisions. Tactical chits and Air Force chits. Classical sequence of play and CRT. But as always with Wayne's games, there's more than that.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are old-fashioned typesetters, building up words letter-by-letter to be used on a printing press. As the letters come out, you must plan and place them accordingly, while carefully using your bank of vowels to puzzle out a higher score. Use the tools of the trade to twist the rules, and create combos that land you the bonus letters you need to win.&#10;&#10;On a turn, both in solo and multiplayer, a consonant is randomly turned face-up for all the players to use in building up words on their player card. The catch? All placed letters must be put in the leftmost empty space of a given line. Players can freely use their bank of vowels before and after to help out, as long as they haven't run out. As more consonants come out, the words get trickier to fit together, and certain letters become more desirable. Certain actions, like taking hard-to-use letters or using the special ability, result in bonus 'wild' letters of your choice, clinching the final pieces to your word puzzle. You have limited room for error, and the letters themselves have no value- only word length matters for scoring. Every five letters, each player may opt out on their own and score their cards, or risk another five letters that may ruin everything.... or fit beautifully into place.&#10;&#10;Plan, place, and chance it either on your own or with a group of fellow typesetters. Typeset is built to travel, easy-to-teach, and infinitely replayable with the wealth of ability cards that twist and change the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Fate of Reiters is a new game of the  series By Shot, Shock and Faith (in French: &quot;Par le feu, le fer et la foi&quot;) and allows the simulation of religious wars that occurred in France from 1562 to 1598. This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.&#10;The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.&#10;The Fate of Reiters  is a grand tactical game which, for the first time, allows the simulation of five battles of that era :&#10;COGNAT : January 6th, 1568&#10;DORMANS : October 10th, 1575&#10;AUNEAU : November 24th, 1587&#10;VIMORY : October 26th, 1587&#10;METRIEUX (aka VIRE-CULS) December 10th, 1587&#10;&#10;This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are with areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represent a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.&#10;The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible... Are you ready to put on the Henri de Guise, Duke of Lorraine and fight your enemies the famous German mercenaries? The Fate of Reiters is the second opus of By Shot, Shock and Faith (P3F). This new HEXASIM game offers you this option with an innovating and elegant game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.&#10;&#10;The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.&#10;&#10;There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.&#10;&#10;There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).&#10;&#10;The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player picks one card from their hand to play and then activates an ability printed on that card (3 choices). There are nine abilities that enable you to manipulate cards in your hand or your opponent&rsquo;s hand, earn victory points, or steal them from an opponent.  The game ends when a player has no more cards in his hand, at which point the surprise factor of the Trojan Horse and Favor of the Gods award a few extra points.&#10;&#10;Clever managing of your hand and wise choice of which ability to trigger can help you triumph over your opponents!&#10;&#10;",

You use your cards to work in the collective farm shared by all, but you also have a private plot of land that no one else can touch. By harvesting crops from both fields (adding them together), you can win valuable production cards.

During your turn, you may also be able to harvest fields in order to take one production card. Plant the first card in front of you on your private plot so that it forms a grid of square fields. You can place it next to a previously placed card or cover one or two fields of any previously placed cards. However, your private plot can be a maximum of three fields in each direction (3x3). Plant the second card in the central collective farm, with exactly one field of this card covering a previously played field.&#10;&#10;You may then harvest one of the crops on the card placed in the collective farm. To harvest a field, count the number of orthogonally connected fields of the same crop that are also connected with the crop you just planted.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, play continues until all hand cards have been played. Alternatively, when a player takes their fifth production card &mdash; that is, has collect each type of crop once &mdash; the game ends at the end of the round. Each player then sums the points on the production cards in front of them, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The twist here is that the rotating board of Yama contains triangular slots that stand the cube up on its corner - revealing three sides, each of which can be seen from a different point of view. And it is in one of these three point-of-views in which you must try to form your line of four-in-a-row.&#10;&#10;With Yama we strove to design the components such that they convey the rules. The cubes are painted such that no matter how you orient it one side will show a different color to the other two. The way placing three cubes in a cluster forms a valley for placement of the next level which covers up and block your opponent, or cliches your victory. These all contributes to making Yama one of the easiest and most intuitive game to learn.&#10;&#10;However the game itself is treacherously easy to lose yet deeply strategic and tactical when played by two equally skilled players. The three dimension aspect of the victory goal and the three dimensional aspect of the cube placement can be very tricky to wrap your head around - leading to surprising twists and turns that belies it simple rules and components.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns drafting cards and using their workers to furnish, cook, craft, clean, and trade.

    "Description": "Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.&#10;&#10;For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.&#10;&#10;Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.&#10;&#10;So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.&#10;&#10;Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.&#10;&#10;Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Flocks often contain sheep from many players and cooperation can be key to moving a flock into an advantageous position. But how long will this helpful, peaceful pastoral scene last when the cards require players to take actions for other players which can include placing opponents' shepherds in lower scoring areas and moving flocks that do not contain their own sheep?And a hungry wolf ever lurks in the background...&#10;&#10;A deck of cards is used by the players to take actions such as placing shepherds, putting sheep into flocks, moving flocks of sheep, and moving the wolf. It is these cards, with their requirement to manipulate other players' pieces, that drive the decisions the players must make in the game and guarantee a high level of interaction among players. Each player also has a Sheepdog wild card for use once per game.&#10;&#10;",

Your ultimate goal is to gain fame and fortune by being the first cryptozoologist credited with the actual discovery of a new species, making you world famous. Somehow you have landed yourself smack dab in the middle of feud between Bigfoot and Yeti so it's time to choose your side as it will help shape the fate of your research and ultimately your success!&#10;&#10;During each turn in the game, players draw from either the Unknown (deck) or from the top of Tabloids (discard pile). Each player mounts or joins expeditions for the various cryptids in the hope of reaching ten or more points in play. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that expedition's score. Also during each turn a single Action card may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids or manipulate other facets of the game. Each cryptid has an ability that will help you in some way and is triggered when you play them. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition. The game also has a shutout rule involving Extraterrestrials that, if achieved, prevents all other players from scoring that round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Moscow Campaign; Strike and Counterstrike Russia, 1941, is the successor to SPI's earlier treatment of roughly the same events, The Battle of Moscow (originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #24).&#10;&#10;The Moscow Campaign covers the final German drives on the Russian capital and the first Soviet counteroffensive. The scale is 6 miles per hex and three days per turn.  Units (blue Germans and brown Soviets) are predominantly divisions. The Soviets have a few corps, and some German mechanized divisions are replaced by kampfgruppen if eliminated in combat. Though they have &quot;historical&quot; designations, the formations are pretty generic. They display combat factors, movement allowances and NATO symbols. Most formidable are the German 6-8 panzer divisions; most common are the lowly Soviet 1-4 infantry.&#10;&#10;Games can begin as early as September 30, 1941, and end as late as December 31st. A variety of starting points, ending points and German orders of battle produce 24 scenarios, four lasting all 31 turns, the rest - centered on the German offensives in early October and late November and the Soviet riposte at the end of the year - 8 turns each.&#10;&#10;The four-color map is functional though not an aesthetic gem. It shows cities, rivers, railroads, forests, swamps, lakes, Soviet fortifications and scenario start lines.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave but not mandating combat between adjacent enemies). The stacking limit is three units of any size per hex.&#10;&#10;The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Overruns during movement are also possible, though they require 11 to 1 odds. Germans must trace supply lines to railroads that have been converted by Eisenbahn Bautruppen, Soviets to unconverted rail lines that run to the north, south or east of the map. Lack of supply halves movement and combat factors but doesn't, by itself, result in elimination.&#10;&#10;Weather changes historically. Rain, mud and full winter successively erode movement allowances and combat strengths.&#10;&#10;There are no air or command rules.&#10;&#10;Victory points are awarded for destroying enemy units and for geographical objectives (possession of Moscow for either side, proximity to Moscow for the Germans, pushing units west of the start line for the Soviets).&#10;&#10;When published, this was one of SPI's largest and most sophisticated games.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 6 miles / 9.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Brigade to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; four-color mapsheet&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page foldout Moscow Campaign folder&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The set &quot;America&quot; contains historical events which are related to America.

    "Description": "Ardennes II is a Standard Combat Series reissuing of the award-winning game Ardennes from 1994 using the additional research available in the BCS game Last Blitzkrieg. Like its predecessor, it covers the German Wacht am Rhein offensive in December 1944 against the heretofore &ldquo;quiet front&rdquo; of the Ardennes Forest.&#10;&#10;Despite heavy losses on both the Western and Eastern Fronts, the German Army attempted to re-invigorate its offensive forces using drafts of the elderly, infirm, and very young.   The defending US forces were recovering from the dash across France and using the Ardennes area to give exhausted units a chance to refit and to give their new reinforcements some modest battle-zone experience.&#10;&#10;The result went down in history as the Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;Overcoming the initial surprise, the US forces put together a series of determined defenses, numerous timely bridge destructions, and the incredible power of their well-supplied artillery to stop the vaunted German Panzer troops nearly dead in their tracks.&#10;&#10;Ardennes II covers all this action in turns representing one day of combat and a hex scale of 1 mile per hex. Units are usually reinforced battalions (or smaller). The full campaign game lasts only 16 turns from 16 Dec to 31 Dec 44.&#10;&#10;In addition to spotlighting the better OOB and map research first used in Last Blitzkrieg, the game differs from its predecessor by highlighting the unique nature of the artillery on both sides, correcting the original&rsquo;s &ldquo;Supply Wagon&rdquo; supply system, as well as giving units the opportunity to withdraw before an enemy attack. It also cuts back on the amount of chrome rules which the player needed to wade through, and which exaggerated the effects of some marginal forces.&#10;&#10;The game continues the SCS tradition of a very clean and easily played Sequence of Play, clear unit interactions, and straight-forward victory determination.&#10;&#10;This game is highly recommended for those interested in learning for the first time or teaching the fine hobby of wargaming to beginners.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;Ardennes Campaign, 2 maps, 16 turns&#10;Breakthrough Campaign, 1 map, 6 turns&#10;KG Peiper, part of 1 map, 5 turns&#10;The Goose Egg, part of 1 map, 5 turns&#10;Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, parts of 2 maps, 8 turns&#10;Tip of the Spear, 1 map, 4 turns&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Renju has evolved rules to balance the game however: Go-Moku heavily favors the first player.&#10;&#10;Renju counters this with two important rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Setup: one player places two black stones and one white stone on the board.  The other player chooses which side to play.  White places one stone, then Black places two more stones.  White removes one of these last two Black stones, then the game proceeds normally.&#10;     Restrictions: Black may not create a three-three or four-four.  (That is, a move that creates two open-ended threes at once, or two fours at once.)  Black may not create an &quot;overline&quot; - six or more stones in a row.  White is NOT thus restricted, and can win by any of those moves, OR by forcing Black to make such a move to block White.&#10;&#10;&#10;Renju lacks the depth of Go, but the strategies are far easier to understand, and mere mortals can become quite good at it.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Pente&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Offense and defense can choose their personnel and can be either aggressive or conservative.  Offense can pick from run or pass plays.  Defense can pick a focus area of the field.  The 144 possible outcomes match real football averages at the play and possession levels. Try playing with your own personal game-plan or style.  You can be a conservative team that runs the ball and controls field-position.  Or you can be a wide-open passing team that takes aggressive risks on defense.&#10;&#10;The Flip play solution is a diagrammatical solution of the offense and defense play pairing.  Each offense play-card has a play arrow which is positioned in one of six lanes.  Each defense play-card has play outcome arrows in each of these lanes.  The cards are aligned and the offense play arrow will line up with one of the defense outcome arrows yielding the outcome of the card pairing and the play.&#10;&#10;Each team has three kick tables for kick-offs, punts, and field goals.  These tables are used with three dice and the results match real football stats.&#10;&#10;Four possessions per side is a quick game (30 minutes) and eight possessions per side is a good game (60 minutes).&#10;&#10;",

Between September 1st and December 19th two armies contended for the American capital, seat of the rebellion, home to the Congress, and from where independence from Great Britain had been declared only the year before. In this contest battles were fought in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Today roadside placards mark these places: Cooch's Bridge, the banks of the Brandywine, The Battle of the Clouds, and Germantown. For 225 years a solemn, common grave has marked the site of the Paoli Massacre. Glory attends the name of Red Bank where the hated Hessian was sent packing, and the fight for Fort Mercer where the Royal Navy suffered its worst defeat of the entire war. Fort Mifflin stands in mute testament to the patriot's naked valor; while Valley Forge remains a shrine to his devotion.&#10;&#10;Yet all this could have ended on the gallows for Washington and his men, instead of the nation we call the United States of America.&#10;&#10;Scale: Two miles per hex.

Starting in the 1700s, by law all leases would expire on the same day. The law has since been changed, but landlords and renters still stick to July 1st as the universal moving day. And since so many people are moving on the same day, it's of course near impossible to hire movers or even rent moving trucks &mdash; so everyone in the community shows up to help you move!&#10;&#10;In Moving Day, your job is to pack all your stuff nicely into the available vehicles, trying to avoid crushing lighter items by putting heavier items on top, while also assigning people from the community to each vehicle. Some of them are pretty clumsy and might break fragile items if you are not careful, but if they bring delicious food with them, it might be impossible to turn them away...&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose a set of two item tiles and one person card from a general display, then assign them to your vehicles. Be aware that your vehicles have limited space and different shapes, and you must fill the items from the bottom to the top. People also have different strengths and should ideally be strong enough to collectively lift your heavier items.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. Each player now has sixteen item tiles and eight people cards assigned to their vehicles, and they calculate their score:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Heavy items on top of lighter items break the lighter items below.&#10;     Clumsy people will break fragile items.&#10;     Heavy items score more points than lighter items.&#10;     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same shape.&#10;     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same type.&#10;     Food tokens are also worth 1 point each!&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A party game for horrible Swiss people.&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Round Boss&quot;, choosing a red fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players. Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Kampf gegen das B&uuml;nzlitum is a Swiss adaption of the popular Cards against Humanity. It features all new cards with Swiss celebrities, places and topics of interest.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "House of Normandy is a &quot;quad&quot; centered on the dynastic struggles of William the Conqueror's extended family, and the second game in the SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series. The earliest of the four battles collected herein saw two of William's sons duking it out. The other three battles are all drawn from the reign of Stephen of Blois, the Conqueror's grandson, and the long period of instability and intermittent civil war that has come to be called The Anarchy. During the twelfth century, armies tended to avoid giving battle to one another, and when it did come to blows, neither side exhibited much endurance; there's none of that &quot;they fought from sunrise to sunset&quot; stuff here. Nor was anyone involved particularly renown for any special military genius. As a result, the battles here are short, small, and uncomplicated affairs, ideal both for solitaire study, and for a quick game with a friend. That's not to say the battles are lacking in flavor, however, as each brings something unique to your table.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Tinchebray (1106) gives each player Wings composed of both cavalry and foot soldiers, and arrayed in echelons. S &amp; S vets know that horse and non-horse units don't support the other's attacks, which makes things tricky. The battle turns on the timely (or not) arrival of a hidden English Wing.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Standard (1138) is a matter of English quality versus Scots quantity. The English have a good defensive position, and are mostly arrayed into a single Wing (with all the pluses and minuses that come with it). Successive waves of Scots will usually be forced to attack the English piecemeal. The English have the advantage in the early game, but the longer the game runs, the more Scottish numerical superiority will rule the day. To recreate the spectacularly lopsided victory that the English enjoyed historically, the English player will have to seal the deal in the early going.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Lincoln (1141) might be described as a game of &quot;press your luck&quot; for poor King Stephen. He has some good units, but as soon as one Wing defects, the others might follow, turning an even contest into a slaughter. His Angevin opponent must make good use of not only his horse, but also his Welsh infantry, which is fearsome but brittle.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Wilton (1143) commences at dusk, and ends at nightfall. This means the battle has a time pressure element, quite unusual for the S&amp;S system. Neither player knows exactly when the battle is going to end. Will the Blesevins break through the Angevin line, or will Stephen's retreat be covered by his gallant rearguard?&#10;&#10;The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT. S&amp;S II revolves around the activation of Wings using double-sided Command Markers, with a flexible scale and simple, easy-to-teach rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An operational level wargame of operations in the area of the Scheldt Estuary in Belgium and Holland in October and November of 1944. The crucially important port city of Antwerp had fallen to a rapid British advance in September, but the port could not be used until the coastal artillery defences at the mouth of the Scheldt had been neutralized and the river swept of thousands of mines. It fell to the First Canadian Army, already tired and overstretched after being in continuous combat since the D-Day invasion, to do this.&#10;&#10;The nature of this campaign poses challenges to the players: the grinding, attritional nature of the fighting; the difficulty of the terrain fought over; and the limited resources available to either side. The Staff Card system, adapted from Joe Miranda's &quot;Bulge 20&quot; system, does not allow players to move and fight every unit every turn, as is often the case in other wargames - they must choose what they want to do, and where, and how to support it. The combat system, seemingly very simple because it does not rely on odds computations or column shifts, favours the defence and reflects the incremental nature of unit losses as they wear away in the fighting.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game Summary:&#10; Irish Freedom is a solitaire wargame covering the Irish war of independence, and then the Irish civil war. The player controls the Irish forces fighting the British, then, after the treaty with Britain, plays the role of Michael Collins' Free State forces against the anti-treaty Republicans.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Map&#10;    Rules&#10;    British counters (Army, RIC, Black &amp; Tans, UVF)&#10;    Irish Free State counters (Mob, Guerillas, Regulars, A/Car, Artillery)&#10;    Irish Republican counters (Mob, Guerillas, Flying column)&#10;    D6 is required&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing time = 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Game play: &#10;As the Irish player, you must first force the British to end the war in a treaty. This is done by denying areas of the country to them and eliminating British units. After this is completed, the Irish forces split along the line of the civil war. As the Free State (pro-treaty) player you will likely be initially outnumbered by the Republicans (anti-treaty), but with superior organisation and tactics, you can force their surrender.&#10;&#10;Historical background and the game: There are very few games on either the Irish war of independence, or the subsequent civil war. The war of independence can be indirectly blamed on the Germans. In 1912, after years (centuries, some would say) of resistance, the British parliament passed the Irish Home Rule bill. The bill then began to grind its way through parliament to become law. This was widely approved in Ireland, apart from the North-east, where the largely Protestant population feared for their future in what would be a largely Catholic state. They started to arm themselves as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and so did their Irish nationalist adversaries. Civil war looked likely, but was happily averted by the sudden arrival of several million heavily armed Germans in Belgium and France. Both the UVF and the Nationalists then happily joined the British army to fight the common foe. Meanwhile, the home rule bill was suspended for the war's duration, but sure it would all be over by Christmas... wouldn't it?&#10;&#10;It wasn't, and by 1916 some more radical Nationalists (called Republicans) got fed up and in Easter staged a farcical uprising, limited to those units that didn't get the message that it had been called off. It was crushed, but the hanging of the leaders, and the increasing harshness of British measures as the war progressed caused a sea-change in public opinion. In the 1918 general election, almost all of Ireland (not the North-east) voted in the Sinn Fein party, which refused to sit in the British parliament and, in 1919 declared Irish independence. Desultory fighting started between the new Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces. This is the point at which the game starts, with IRA units of varying capability in most areas of Ireland, and British garrisons (mostly Royal Irish Constabulary) throughout. In 1920 the home rule bill (remember it) passed, but by now with a special amendment allowing two parliaments - one for the North-east (now called Northern Ireland) and one for the rest of Ireland. Sinn Fein ignored it, as they already considered themselves independent, while Northern Ireland voted itself into existence. The game shows this effect with Northern Ireland having extra military units of the UVF.&#10;&#10;As the war progressed, the IRA were most successful in the Southern parts of Ireland, and the British forces were gradually excluded from the countryside and limited to towns. The game simulates this by giving different units different strength depending on the terrain - IRA guerillas and Flying columns are best in the countryside, the British better in the urban areas.&#10;&#10;With neither side able to win, and the British half expecting the home rule bill to have solved things in the first place, a peace treaty was signed. The treaty gave Southern Ireland (now called the Free State) Dominion status (like in Australia or Canada), with the King still as head of state, and cemented the separation of Northern Ireland. Naturally, this disgusted the more radical elements of Sinn Fein (led by Eamon De Valera), and military units who considered that they had won and so should have full independence. An election in 1922 was won handily by the pro-treaty Sinn Fein, but this did not solve things and fighting started as the pro-treaty forces, under Michael Collins, started to assert themselves over the anti-treaty forces. At this point, the players forces are split - largely along historical lines, with the South containing more anti-treaty forces, and the East more pro-treaty forces. As the player, you control the Free State forces against the anti-treaty republicans. This also means that you need to be careful how you fight the British since you will be raising troops that may not be loyal to the Free State!&#10;&#10;Initially outnumbered, the Free State forces rapidly mobilised and quite quickly crushed the Republicans. They used innovative tactics, notably landing troops by ship at key points behind enemy lines, and were able to win battles because they generally had artillery and armour (armoured cars) while the republicans didn't. In the game you can perform naval landings, and you have attached artillery and armoured car units to give a bonus in combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is decided by two things - How quickly the British are beaten, and how quickly/completely the Republicans are beaten.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Guardians of Xobos is a sci-fi themed tabletop game inspired by RTS classics, in which players compete to gain control over the last active source of energy on the planet. A long, long time ago Patrons, great explorers of the universe, arrived on Xobos and after gathering enough power to continue their journey, they left Guardians there to protect the planet. The Guardians of Xobos cared for the energy sources for centuries, but once the planet began to fade, they started to fight each other in order to survive.&#10;&#10;The game is full of dynamic action tactical and strategy battle with unique mechanism of upgrading units by creating &quot;links&quot; between the Guardians. The player can give orders to his units, so that each unit can be supported by a different Guardian to gain healing powers or improved attacks. Since the Guardians can be upgraded via technology, one unit can act as a &quot;tank&quot; with a huge amount of damage or healing powers. In the game it is also possible to focus on economy by building structures for gathering resources and producing smaller units called Quarks.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the player must gather Energy to revive the dying source and have the highest amount of Energy in round 15, the last one in the game. &#10;In The Guardians of Xobos there are 5 structures for gathering resources, upgrading units and protecting the territory.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of two phases:&#10;Phase 1: Tactical phase, in which players move units (Quarks and Guardians) around the map and place tokens to mark attacks. After each player takes their turn, the fights between units are resolved (the player attacking other units declares damage he/she deals upon an enemy unit).&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Economic phase, completed simultaneously by all players, in which each player can establish links between Guardians, create Quarks, start building structures, and build technology tiles to boost units (or upgrade other military aspects of units or buildings).&#10;Important note: there is no randomness in the game, no dice rolling or card drawing. In fact, there are no dice or cards, but only Units and Technology Tiles available for purchase using certain resources.&#10;&#10;From the beginning of the first round players need to focus on various aspects of military and economic development to gain control over the last active source and each of the 15 rounds is more and more intense.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At heart, Anno Domini: Fussball is like every other Anno Domini game: Each edition of the game includes 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which that event happened on the other.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives nine cards and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place theirs in chronological order with what's already on display. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the current order of cards is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed. If the order was correct, the doubting player receives two cards and ends his turn without playing anything; if the order was incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who had accepted the order as correct &ndash; receives three cards. The first player to rid himself of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in Anno Domini as most events are rather obscure or are hard to date precisely. As you might expect, Anno Domini: Fussball contains historical events related to football (i.e., soccer for those in the U.S.), and the relationship of events to dates is not necessarily obvious. Like all Anno Domini games, the Fussball edition can be played on its own or mixed with any number of other Anno Domini editions.&#10;&#10;",

The players send their tribers to spaces on the main board to build monuments and gather raw resources. The resources gathered are stored on each player's tribe board and  may then be processed into food. Feeding your tribers brings you HPs and lets you win the game after the sixth season. A single season is divided into six phases in which the players take their actions in a clockwise order:&#10;&#10;Errand phase - place your tribers on the main board&#10;Harvest phase - gather resources from the main board&#10;Processing phase - process raw resources from your tribe board into food&#10;Feeding phase - spend food on feeding your tribers&#10;Ecology phase - adjust the harvest levels (quantity of resources available) on the main board&#10;Clean-up phase - build monuments and prepare for the next season&#10;&#10;Developing inventions (in the form of invention cards with different symbols) enhances the effectiveness of your food processing, and collecting sets of different symbols brings extra points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",
