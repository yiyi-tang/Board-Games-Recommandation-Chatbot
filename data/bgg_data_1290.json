    "Description": "This game, described as &quot;astrological&quot;, has its theme about divination through the stars and tarot cards.&#10;It includes a solo mode which is more a self divination than a game and a duo mode which is a game.&#10;&#10;Each player has 12 cards in their hand. The first player thinks of a question and mentions its theme to the other player. The theme can be health, feelings, money, work ... He then turns the plate on the board in order to bring his number (determined from the transcription of the letters of his first name into numbers) in the area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;his astrological sign. He then moves the &quot;sun&quot; disc on the board so that the green solar ray is on the sign of the other player. This indicates 3 numbers which correspond to constellation maps. If the player has a matching card in his deck, he places it in front of him. If he doesn't have one, he passes and the other player moves the discs on the board to identify 6 more digits. When all the cards have been identified, the players compose their answers using the booklet supplied with the game. The players then assemble the cards according to their symbols and sort them in numerical order. The player with the highest row of cards wins&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Advanced Chess is a new ground-breaking warfare strategy game. The game is well balanced between skill and luck making it very competitive. Playing Time 30 - 120 Mins Recommended Age 5 and Up. Number of players required is 2 players one on one, 3players two against one or 4 players, two teams of two players in which you can communicate with your partner during your turn. In American Catur your partner and you will be taking on the roles of the government leaders (WE THE PEOPLE) who has been empowered by the Constitution to go to war, when you hear the word &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; you can picture your partner and you strategizing as the generals of the armed forces with your President in a war room looking sternly at the earth board, preparing your next best step for combat. Deciding where to engage the enemy and what maneuver are going to make sense to help achieve this goal. It will be your team strategy- to win by controlling all of the Armed Force troop&rsquo;s (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard) in a battle to force the opponent&rsquo;s President in a position of no escape, or to capture him or to eliminate him.&#10;&#10;It is your tactics to consider all the factors involved and apply this knowledge of the troops strength and your team determination to make decisions that would result in controlling the center of the earth board. Each team of two begins with a total of one President and 29 troops that each player on a team shares by alternating turns. One player controls the black triangle space to travel on with their piece and the other partner controls the white triangle spaces to travel on. The other option to play is by alternating turns one player controls the area in front of them and then the other player controls the area in front of them. The line that divides the area is between the army and President. You will be alternating turns taking one action at a time over the course of setting up your strategic plans of controlling the earth board. You need to evaluate your earth board during each move. It will help you keep tracked of all projectile chips used and all troops&rsquo; movements.&#10;&#10;This earth board is your map where you need to go, and what you have to conquer. And around the perimeter of the earth board, you have two rows to have the ability to launch your offensive or defensive attack with projectile chips by rolling the dice to capture, eliminate pieces or use the chips as an obstacle for your opponent&rsquo;s pieces to go around. Beware that sometimes a roll of a launch can become a misfire that captures or eliminates your own pieces. The winner is the one who forces the President in a position of no escape(DEFCON1), or eliminates him with a projectile chip. There is one more major part of the game if the President is in checkmate or stalemate, we go into DEFCON 1 in which all unused projectile chips are launched alternating turns to see how the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Both sides White/Black are equipped with four types of projectile chips; 16 poison gas that captures one-piece that travels on the triangle space, 8 biological gas that can with one strike captures up to two-pieces that travels on the square space and 16 atomic nukes that eliminates one-piece that travels on the triangle space, 8 hydrogen nukes that can with one strike eliminate up to two-pieces that travels on the square space. If you can&rsquo;t determine a winner after exhausting all the launching of the projectile chips at the end of the game the President that is in checkmate loses, if it is a stalemate then count the total points of just captured (POW)pieces to find out the winner of the game. Do Not count the pieces that were eliminated or on the board. There are no draws. Who do you control!&#10;&#10;www.americancatur.com&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Eric Jude Egypt Curtis&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion is used to bridge High Frontier with the next game in the series, Interstellar.&#10;&#10;Module 4: Exodus introduces contracts that form new decks (not patents) tied to pairs of ideologies. Contracts are auctioned in a special auction (as part of the Fundraise Operation); players bid in years to complete (lowest bid wins). A timepiece chit is placed on the Sunspot Cycle to mark the bid. Winning a contract grants a cash advance, and further rewards upon fulfillment (bringing the contract to the specified destination), including ongoing abilities. If late for delivery, players owe late fees and/or may default (inability to bid on contracts until the advance is repaid). Discarding a contract gives a player the  default chit - this gives them a VP penalty and the inability to bid on manned contracts.&#10;&#10;The contract deck flips to gold-side when any player produces an Isotope, causing Isotope monetization.&#10;&#10;A second Colonist queue (spaceborn) is available once you have a Colony Beyond Earth Orbit (BEO). Within your Faction, they cannot co-exist with earthborn Colonists (the Humans from Module 2). All Robots (including those from Module 2), are placed in the spaceborn queue.&#10;&#10;Cybernetics icons on contracts are required to implant augmentations, which grant abilities to the Colonist they are implanted on. Augmentation chits are implanted onto Colonists and remain attached to that Colonist until Decommissioned or removed. A Colonist with one or more augmentations is an augmented Colonist. An Colocated augmented Colonist is required for the promotion Operation.&#10;&#10;Anchoring a Bernal with a Dirtside matching your isostandard founds the isobank: Exodus contracts are activated. Isotope may be transfered to the isobank (adding to the isototal) to assist with a starshot, either during the game (desperation) or at game end. VP are given for contributions. A desperation starshot ends the game at the end of the current cycle; the starship must exit before game end or the commander suffers VP penalties.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They came from space. From within meteors they broke out and caused devastation. With corporations and security companies concerned only with the elites, the people pleads for world government action. The president of the world is then forced to finance mercenary giant robot pilots, paying for each head of the giant monsters.&#10;&#10;Project HUNTER is a minimalist solo print-n-play roll-n-write game in which you drive a giant robot in order to defeat the giant monsters that have invaded the earth. You will need to print these sheets and get some dice, pencils and eraser.&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;The main objective of this game is to defeat at least one monster of each of the six species. However, you must survive until then! Your giant robot is destroyed if its chassis is completely damaged or if it overheats, which will cause an explosion. You also lose if you run out of money after a hunt.&#10;&#10;Hunting Kaijus&#10;To face a monster you first roll three dice. Each die will indicate a monster avaliable. Of these three you will have to choose one to face. If you don't want to face any, you will have to spend $ 50 on the maintenance of your robot to be able to wait another day. So you can roll the three dice again. You start the game with $ 300 in cash (write it down).&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;As soon as you choose a monster to face the combat starts. The combat is separeted between the turn of the monster and the turn of the robot. The monster always starts first.&#10;&#10;Monster Turn&#10;On the Monster turn you must roll a number of dice equal to the Monster Attack value. Each die is treated individually and allocated somewhere in the robot sheet. Each die that landed at number 6 causes 1 Overheat. Each result less than 6 can be absorbed in some armor of the robot. See in the diagram of the robot that there are squares for you to write down the result of the die you want to allocate there. You can place it wherever you want as long as there are already any other results linked to it, it must obey the rule (see below). If you cannot allocate any die in the sheet this die becomes 1 damage in the Chassis.&#10;&#10;Armor&rsquo;s Rules&#10;In the diagram of the robot you will find several blank boxes to record the result of a die. Each of these boxes has an arrow. If the arrow is facing the box, it means that it has some rule. Each symbol on the black circle will indicate he rule.&#10;&#10;Robot Turn&#10;On the Robot's turn you will be able to choose if you want to attack normal with your weapons or if you want to overload the shots. If you choose to attack normal, roll the dice equal to the number of weapons you have (initially you only have one weapon). Add up all the results of all the dice and write down the amount of damage the monster has taken. If the monster loses all hit points, it is defeated (see below).&#10;If you choose to do an overloaded attack, you will roll twice the attack dice but will cause 1 point of Overheating.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Near Hill 192 and St Georges d'Elle, France, 11 July 1944: Pfc. Ralson A. Shepherd was not the only hero among the ranks of the America dogfaces fighting near Hill 192. The battle minted heroes, including Private Joseph Marez, an aid man with the 9th Regiment. Disregarding a &quot;hail of machine-gun and rifle fire&quot; according to the unit history, Marez ran forward to attend to two wounded riflemen.&#10;While he was holding a tourniquet to the first soldier's leg, Marez was hit in the head by a German bullet.

Located about five miles north-east of St. Lo., Hill 192 would hardly be classed as hill on most military maps, but in a countryside where a significant high point is twenty or thirty meters above the surrounding countryside, Hill 192, named for its height in meters, was a strategic point that would cost a lot in American lives.&#10;&#10;This is not a complete game. Ownership of the ASL RB and modules providing Germans and American is a requirement to use this product.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     The Good Sheperd &ndash; St-George-D&rsquo;elle, June 9th 1944&#10;     Stopped Dead &ndash; Near Hill 192 and St-Georges-D&rsquo;elle, June 13th 1944&#10;     Three Abreast &ndash; Hill 192, near St. Lo, June 16th 1944&#10;     Raiding Party &ndash; Near Hill 192 and St-Georges-D&rsquo;elle, July 5th 1944&#10;     Death&rsquo;s Draw - Near Hill 192 and St-Georges-D&rsquo;elle, July 11th 1944&#10;     Heroes&rsquo; Garden - Near Hill 192 and St-Georges-D&rsquo;elle, July 11th 1944&#10;     Hill 192 - Near Hill 192 and St. Lo, June 11th 1944&#10;     Bocage Party - Near Hill 192 and La Croix Rouge, July 6th 1944&#10;     The Big Hurt - Near Hill 192 and St. Lo, July 11th 1944&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Your assailant removes her mask - It is the Muscle. &#10;&lsquo;&lsquo;Once again you&rsquo;ve been careless with your steps.&rsquo;&rsquo; You say nothing. &#10;&lsquo;&lsquo;The Baron refuses to leave Schloss B&ouml;se, so we must go to him.&rsquo;&rsquo; She hands you a wax sealed envelope, then disappears into the darkness.

Each players represents rival guilds of thieves, insurgents, and trouble makers known as Ravens vying for control of the city as the Baron&rsquo;s grasp loosens. By stealing powerful artifacts and relics, each organisation hopes to emerge the victor when the moon disappears.&#10;&#10;The game is played through five rounds where they will use their Raven cards to steal, claim and store items to earn points at the end of the game.  At the end of five rounds, players will tally their points, with the highest number determining the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The winner is whoever is first to complete their environment board with all six animals.&#10;&#10;DISCOVERING ANIMALS AND ENVIRONMENTS&#10;To make the experience richer, the material in the pack can also be used in an unstructured way, i.e. by presenting the cards to the children as if they were flashcards.&#10;&#10;",

Every caliber from field gun to the terrible 210mm crashed down, lifted long enough for the stunned Frenchmen to rise to the surface, then began all over again. By midday, 80,000 heavy shells had fallen in an area of barely half a square mile. Trees were blasted to matchwood; platoon-sized bunkers had simply vanished; many Frenchmen were buried alive not once but repeatedly. Nevertheless, as the German assault teams advanced to infiltrate the French lines, almost half of Driant&rsquo;s men had survived. Isolated, unsupported, blown out of their own fortifications, the Chasseurs fought on.&#10;&#10;This expansion contains special rules (Attack &agrave; Outrance...), geo boards and counters for the French (inc.

    "Description": "Battle of GOG is a board game for 2-4 players set in the ancient land of Canaan. Designed by Vitali Minin, Battle of GOG challenges all family members to find 5 sacred scrolls as they battle over the land of Canaan.&#10;Game rules are simple, combining strategy and luck equally, so anyone can win.&#10;The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. Despite simple mechanics, game play involves complex strategic thinking. The map of the game can be assembled in numerous combinations, so each game session plays differently.&#10;Sometimes you need to carefully consider whether to make a move that benefits yourself or one that puts your opponent at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory: conquer cities, fight enemy soldiers, obtain the scrolls, or reach all 4 corners of the map to make a winning move.&#10;With so many factors involved, even establishing 3 cities in the most abundant map areas won`t ensure your victory, as Ability Cards and Treasure Chest Cards can make the difference in a critical situation.&#10;Lastly, remember that the Oracle of the game is GOG' and that he has the power to save you from the Angel of Retribution!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by the historical legacy of Colonel Percy Fawcett, Z, Lost Trails is a strategy deck-building card game with both competitive and cooperative game modes. The game progresses through 3 stages as you prepare your finances in London, gather a team and resources in South America, and finally embark on an expedition through the Jungle. This game is designed to challenge your ability to plan ahead, out-maneuver, and survive one of the most legendary quests the world has ever known.&#10;&#10;Deep in the dark jungles of the Amazon rainforest, lies hidden a lost city known only as Z. It may be in the center of a nearly impenetrable forest, along an undiscovered black river, deep in some snake infested canyon, or on top of a lonely, craggy peak, guarded by denizens from a forgotten time. This archeological marvel only awaits discovery from a courageous and intrepid explorer such as yourself. Many have gone in search of it, but few have returned to regale their friends and colleagues with the tale of their sufferings and defeat. This game allows you the opportunity to be a turn-of-the-century explorer; taking you from your living room to the dark and dangerous recesses of South America. Combat poisonous snakes, deadly spiders, tropical diseases, murderous savages, and untimely mishaps on your quest to find the lost trails to Z, a city of great riches, personal bliss, and just possibly the answer to your most profound questions and desires. Select your character and fulfill their dream. But remember, you need to embark properly outfitted with porters, mules, weapons, supplies, and medicines, if you are to have any chance of finding the clues that can insure your survival and, just possibly, success.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Become a legendary hero, rich and powerful. Arm yourself with bravery and challenge the evil creatures! Lovely promises of fortune and glory will bring you to deep forgotten catacombs, but only a true hero, with a body and mind forged in the strongest steel will survive.&#10;&#10;Half role playing game, half figurine (1:50 scale) Catakombes Dark Reign is a cooperative game for 1 to 3 players embodying a group of heroes, who form an alliance against their opponents to accomplish their quest, while another player gives life to the adventure as the game master. The game takes place in an alternative medieval era, where legendary creatures and magic coexist with the real world.&#10;&#10;Purpose of the game&#10;Incarnate a hero willing to over- come every risk to achieve the main quest.&#10;&#10;1/Setting up&#10;You need to define who the heroes (PC) are and who the Game Master (GM) is. We recommend a group of three adventurers PCs. The game master (GM) is in charge of animating the adventure for the PCs in the respect of the game&rsquo;s rules.&#10;The GM chooses a quest and prepares the &laquo; Catacombs&rsquo; plan &raquo; cards enables to create a unique gaming board for each game.&#10;Each PC chooses a character with the help of a predefined sheet or PCs create their own character if they wish.&#10;The introduction of the game takes place in a narrative way. The GM describes the quest to the PCs, who verbally describe their actions. Every conceivable actions are possible, it is up to the GM to adapt them to the game.&#10;When PCs enter the catacombs the game play is in turns.&#10;&#10;2/Game turn&#10;During a game turn, there is first the PCs&rsquo; turn then the GM&rsquo;s turn and each turn is divided into 3 phases.&#10;PC&rsquo;s turn :&#10;Phase 1: The characters recover all their action points (A.Point).&#10;Phase 2: One of the PC&rsquo;s (by turns) draw an unexpected card at the start of each turn (except in the first turn of the game) and the PCs suffer its effects. Take care of all the various effects affecting the PCs and their allies (Fear, Burning, Poisoned...), and remove expired markers.&#10;Phase 3: Each PC does his actions (walk, run, attack, search ...). Each time a PC does an action, he removes the equivalent action points as indicated by the action&rsquo;s cost. When a character is activated, they aren&rsquo;t obligated to spend all their action points in one go. For example, they may do one action then let another PC or ally play their actions and finish their actions afterwards. But once the PC&rsquo;s turn is over, all remaining action points are lost.&#10;GM&rsquo;s Turn:&#10;The GM repeats the 3 phases of a turn, like during the PCs&rsquo; turn (bare in mind that the GM doesn&rsquo;t draw an unexpected event card). The GM&rsquo;s characters play in the GM&rsquo;s desired order.&#10;&#10;3/End of the game&#10;The game ends when the main quest is completed or all PCs are eliminated.&#10;The GM then reads the conclusion of the quest and the PCs intervene verbally describe their actions.&#10;The PCs add up the experience points, Ecus earned and the treasures found during the game and share them equally.&#10;Then the PCs spend their experience points to develop their characteristics and gain new skills. They can go to town in order to buy new equipment with their hard-earned ecus.&#10;&#10;- description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For centuries, Samoan warriors have spun and tossed their weapons in dazzling demonstrations of courage and skill. The traditional wooden war clubs were later replaced with hooked steel machetes. In 1946, a young knife dancer, &ldquo;Freddie&rdquo; Letuli, was performing in San Francisco at an event that also featured a Hindu fire eater and a girl who twirled a baton with light bulbs on the ends. Letuli wrapped some towels around the ends of his knife, dipped them in fuel, set them alight, and invented fireknife dancing.&#10;&#10;The fireknife dance (siva afi) is now a major feature of Samoan culture and the pinnacle of any luau.&#10;&#10;In this game, 2-6 players are fireknife dancers. The game alternates between a practicing phase (where players improve their hands) and a performing phase (where players dance by playing cards). In each dance, the best performer earns points. The first player to score a certain number of points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This reimplementation of Fireknife! was developed and tested with the help of professional fireknife dancers. All card text is bilingual (Samoan and English). The cards feature gorgeous art by Samoan artist Troy Safotu.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fertile Ground is found all over the world, and as a Gardener, you endeavor to find and Sow the unique flora of the globe in your own Garden. As your Garden grows, your plants help and guide you along this path, accelerating your progress while also necessitating thoughtful orientation of new plants in your Garden. But you're not alone; other Gardeners are watching, and working just as hard to create the most productive Garden by the end of Winter - and only one will prevail!&#10;&#10;Gardeners begin with a hand of between 1-7 of the 200 unique Plant Cards and work to Sow these into their Garden. As they do so, they will need to Collect resources (Soil, Sun, Water, Seed) to pay for the cards as well as make sure that they have appropriate space where each plant can survive. Taking turns, Gardeners collect resources, gather cards, and Sow plants into their Gardens; as they accumulate more plants and their associated abilities, their capacity to do each of these increases drastically. The game proceeds through the four seasons (rounds) in which each Gardener has a set number of turns, and at the end of each season Gardeners Pollinate their plants to gather Harvest. At the end of Winter, the value of the accumulated plants, resources, various tokens, and more determine the total value of each Garden, and thus the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The variety and possibilities in this game means that no two trenches will ever be the same. Cards will provide Power Points, which is the ultimate decider of who wins in the game, and is provided by infantry cards and bolstered by support cards. Special cards can provide great advantages, if the trench can support their particular placement rules.&#10;&#10;Part face-off and part-puzzle, all the cards have their own placement peculiarities, which will need to be thought about. Players will need to decide which place, out of the available places, would the card be best, to facilitate future potential card draws. This is ultimately the crux of the game, the construction of the trench through quick and simple puzzle-solving.&#10;&#10;And if that isn't enough, then the Buildings and Bombs expansion allows players to construct buildings in their trenches and utilise No Man's Land, adorning it with dangerous defences.&#10;&#10;Good Luck, General.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The dark forests, forced-marches, and human waves of a low-morale, poorly led force ... face the crack troops of a still ascendant Germany. The horror of a two-front war is upon the Kaiser&rsquo;s best leaders and there is only one way out: total victory.&#10;&#10;Historians know the battle took place near Allenstein. However, General Erich Ludendorff named it after Tannenberg, some 30 klicks to the west, to avenge the defeat of the Teutonic Knights at the earlier battle of the same name that occurred in 1410.&#10;&#10;The world was a far different place during the summer of 1914. Germany was on the offensive on the Western Front. Trench warfare had yet to set in. Crowds, out in the streets welcomed war with open arms, and cheers. A massive Russian Army headed for East Prussia, and eventually, the heart of Germany ... in an unprecedented invasion&mdash;ten Russian Armies in all could be mobilized. Hindenburg was called out of retirement to manage the German side along with Ludendorff. Despite overwhelming numerical advantages by the enemy, the battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army, and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov.&#10;&#10;A series of follow-up battles (1st Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well, and kept the Russians off-balance until the spring of 1915. The Battle of Tannenberg set the stage for the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes a week later, where the reinforced German Eighth Army now faced only the Russian First Army and forced it back over the prewar border. &#10;Russian forces would not again march on German soil until the end of World War II.&#10; Ownership of GWASL I is required. &#10;Includes eight scenarios, two sheets of counters, all the geo boards needed to play the scenarios, folio, and special rules.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Opening Blow &ndash; Stalluponen, East Prussia, August 17th 1914&#10;     Disaster at Gumbinnen - Gumbinnen, East Prussia 1914&#10;     Fresh Blood &ndash; Usdau, East Prussia, August 27th 1914&#10;     Samsonov&rsquo;s End &ndash; Frogenau, East Prussia, August 29th 1914&#10;     The Kerensky Offensive &ndash; Lvov, Ukraine, July 1st 1917&#10;     Sacrifice for Joffre &ndash; Vilna, Russia, March 20th 1916&#10;     Action Along the Wilja &ndash; Vileyka, Russia, September 22nd 1915&#10;     East of Sosenka &ndash; East of Sosenka, Russia, September 24th 1915&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A key player in the Central Powers, Austria-Hungary and its territorial ambitions represented a match to the tinder-box that become World War I. &#10;The Hapsburgs, namely Emperor Franz Josef, dreamed the dreams of conquerors. Ever an expansionist, Josef&rsquo;s latest conquest was Bosnia-Herzegovina. And it was a Bosnian Serb that assassinated Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia followed on 28 July 1914. On 1 August Germany declared war on Russia, the protector of the Slavs. Within a few days Austria declared war on Russia, then on Belgium on 7 August. By the end of 1914, Austria-Hungary and Germany would be at war with France, Britain and Japan, and later, following the attack on Serbia, Montenegro. There were setbacks in the campaign against Russia in Galicia. The Austrian army had more success in 1915, and by the middle of 1916 had conquered Serbia and Montenegro, pushed the Russians back from Poland and by the end of 1916 a combined German-Austrian-Bulgarian attack knocked out Romania. The Austrians also had to face Italian attacks on the South Tirol and the Isonzo River. It was the success of British and French reinforcements, reaching the Balkans and Italy, that forced the Austrian Emperor to sue for peace in October 1918. On 29 October, as the Austrian Army fell back from the Piave River, British and Italian aircraft fired into the fleeing columns. &#10;The Austrian armistice took effect on 4 November 1918. &#10;A total of 1,495,200 Austro-Hungarian soldiers died during World War I.&#10;&#10;Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL I and all preceding GWASL modules are required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Polish Legion &ndash; Kostiuchnowka, Ukraine, June 8th 1916&#10;     Bread Not Blood &ndash; Radoszyce, Galicia, November 20th 1914&#10;     Brzo, Brzo! &ndash; Radoszyce, Hungary, November 17th 1914&#10;     Polish Hill &ndash; Kolki, Hungary, July 4th 1916&#10;     To The Very Last Hour &ndash; Przemysl, Galicia, March 20th 1915&#10;     Cossack Terror &ndash; Buczacz, Hungary, June 8th 1916&#10;     Opportunity In Bukovina &ndash; Okna, Austria-Hungary, June 6th 1916&#10;     The Rojische Bridgehead &ndash; Rojische, Ukraine, June 9th 1916&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s a race against time as crew become infected, drone aliens will be drawn to the colony until eventually an alpha alien will arrive and wreak havoc on the colony and its crew.&#10;&#10;Scour the colony for useful items and weapon, locate the clues to discover the alien host and send them to quarantine, keep crew infection down, research the alien gene sample codes, deal with crisis events and distrustful crew members, seal off parts of the base and set defenses, send the robot to rescue fallen crew, prepare medicines and vaccines, stock up on ammo, jump in a space suit and search the plant surface, destroy the alien drones then hold out until the rescue ship arrives, just make sure you get home...alone.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a set number of rounds (which also determined the difficulty), a crew marker counts down the rounds and at the other end of the round tracker an Alien marker moves in the opposite direction, if the markers ever meet, the Alpha Alien will arrive and the &lsquo;Host&rsquo; crew member will die.... or evolve?&#10;&#10;Players start off with a limited number of active crew, some must be rescued, other will be distrustful and need convincing to join. Player must scour the ship looking for clues as to the identity of the Alien Host, looking for blood samples and crew logs, players also need to gather alien samples for HQ. The colony is also full of weapons, tools, events, and more. Players risk crew when venturing out in colony as the longer they search, the more exposure to the alien virus they risk. The game is about managing and taking risks, use your crew wisely as they have different strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The game ends and the players win, when they have discovered and quarantined the Alien Host, found and reported the Alien samples to HQ, all get into the airlock and the rescue ship arrives.&#10;&#10;The player loose if no one makes it out alive, and this can happen in many ways...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Sound of Metal is a fully cooperative (or solo) tabletop miniatures skirmish game. With a rogue-lite campaign system, players take on the roles of survivors of humans, trying to get by after the downfall of civilization, a result of the Great Robot Uprising.&#10;&#10;After a large meteor crashes into the planet, the Robot overlords start to experience communication issues and many start to malfunction. Humans dubbed this event as &quot;The Glitch&quot; and see it as their opportunity to take back their planet. This is no easy task, as the human population is just a fraction of what it once was, and communication is a challenge. Although the Robots have been greatly disrupted, they are still, in every sense of the word, a great threat.&#10;&#10;Players create survivors, find a vehicle, and traverse the countryside, gathering resources, finding food and weapons, and learning skills to complete mission objectives. In doing so, players characters will level up, gain notoriety, and try to find and destroy the machines central core.&#10;&#10;The game features an action-point based system - These points double as action points and your characters health. As your character takes wounds, they lose action points. Run out of action points, and you collapse.&#10;&#10;Combat/skill checks are performed by rolling dice, bolstered by stats and gained skills.&#10;&#10;Similar to the great tactical, turn-based video games of the 90s, such as X-Com and Jagged Alliance, players can spend extra action points to perform actions at higher levels of competency, being able to aim, change their stances, or focus on specific tasks.&#10;&#10;Enemies are controlled by the game's AI  - each enemy has its own order of operations reactionary programming. Players face these enemies in campaign missions, as well as random encounters.&#10;&#10;The world unfolds in front of the players - as they track their progress on the overworld map. Moving costs food and fuel, and dangers lurk around every corner. The map is be randomly generated each game, and players will find settlements, points of interest and missions in different areas every game.&#10;&#10;Players never control more than 6 survivors at a time, and can be played with 1-6 players cooperatively, splitting up the survivors among players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pass, provided that there are no empty cells or every empty cell is controlled by some player.&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty cell not controlled by your opponent.&#10;     Remove an enemy stone from a cell you control and place a stone of your color on that cell.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of empty cells you control, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points that is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token that is placed next to the board at the start of the game. It is only used when komi is an odd number. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button.&#10;&#10;Stigmergy is based on Micha&#197;&#130; Zapa&#197;&#130;a's Tumbleweed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Carentan, 10 - 13th June 1944 is an Operational level board-wargame which shows fierce fighting in the 1944 Normandy Campaign between Germans and Americans. In starting phase of the battle enemy armies used elite airborne formations and later less experienced mechanized forces. In effect training and determination factors were balanced. Americans achieved success because of material advantage and better coordination of combined arms actions.&#10;Could the battle outcome have been different? On tactical level German fallschirmj&auml;gers had edge, because they were masters in using urban terrain. But lack of ammo and high casualties forced them to leave Carentan. On the other hand Americans used consistently artillery support and they gained ground step by step. These battlefield elements are shown in &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot; system. &#10;Two scenarios are included. &#10;&quot;Purple Heart Lane&quot; depicts struggle for Carentan between enemy paratroopers. Players can use optional rule and see what would be battle finale, if troops from 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division appeared earlier on the battlefield. &#10;The scenario &quot;Battle of Bloody Gulch&quot; shows American defence of Carentan against German counterattack. In this fighting American armored units are present as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Italy fought mostly against Austria-Hungary along the northern border, including high up in the now-Italian Alps and along the Isonzo river. The war was initially a failure for Italy despite being numerically superior to Austria-Hungary. The Italian army repeatedly attacked Austria, making little progress and suffering heavy losses, and then being routed in 1917 by a German-Austrian counteroffensive after Russia left the war allowing the Central Powers to move reinforcements to the Italian Front from the Eastern Front. In October 1918, as civil unrest increased in Austria-Hungary, the Italians attacked again. The Austrian army broke, and the Italians drove deep into Austrian territory.

    "Description": "The soldiers of the Ottoman Empire fought a variety of combatants during World War I. &#10;There were five main campaigns in the theatre: the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, the Mesopotamian Campaign, the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign, and most famously, the Gallipoli Campaign. &#10;The Ottomans joined the Central Powers, goaded by Germany, in its hope that Russian troops would be drained away from the fronts in Galicia and Poland. Scenarios in this module cover the Battle of Sarikamish, as well as the campaigns in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and OF COURSE &hellip; Gallippoli, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the Conflict. &#10;The Dardanelles campaign was fought on Turkish soil, as the ANZAC tried to create a passage through to the Black Sea. Gallipoli was the brainchild of Winston Churchill, and was a bitter failure. After massive hardship, ANZAC soldiers were withdrawn, having failed in most cases to even get off the beaches. Russia also invaded Turkish territory, in the north. Following the collapse of the Tsar&rsquo;s government, the Turks swept north and entered Russian territory proper. By the Russian surrender in the Spring of 1918, the Turkish forces had taken Baku on the Caspian Sea.&#10;&#10;Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     The Bergmann Offensive - Caucasus Front, November 7th 1914&#10;     Stand At Pine Ridge - Pine Ridge, Gallipoli Peninsula, April 25th 1915&#10;     Plugge's Point - Z Beach, Geba Tabe, Gallipoli Peninsula, April 25th 1915&#10;     Valley Of Death - Kereves Dere, Gallipoli Peninsula, June 21st 1915&#10;     Forgotten Arabs - Gallipoli Peninsula, August 6th 1915&#10;     Achi Baba Nulla - Cape Helles, Gallipoli Peninsula, June 4th 1915&#10;     Fir Tree Spur - Cape Helles, Gallipoli Peninsula, May 8th 1915&#10;     Australian Achilles - Gallipoli Peninsula, May 19th 1915&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The land is in peril! Two brave heroes, along with their trusty companion, must take on enemies of progressing difficulty, along with a challenging final boss, using only their wits and their abilities. Each player rolls 3 dice for their character, using push-your-luck mechanics to try to activate their most powerful abilities, or settle for whatever damage they can get, depending on their strategy.&#10;&#10;Roll Crawl is a 1 to 2 player print and play game, with two heroes trying to activate their own abilities to reduce the health of their opponents to zero. They can forego activating their own abilities and combine their dice to active the abilities of their companion. But whatever you do, deal as much damage as you can. Your opponents are ready to hit back, with more dice than you. The more health they have, the more dice they roll, so players must be strategic about deciding when it is the right time to push their luck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
