    "Description": "The Whelming Matches factory has burned down, with only this artifact found in the destruction. Cold to touch, it sat amongst the ashen remains of the factory. Why? How? These questions have yet to be unanswered.&#10;&#10;Matches is a trick-taking style card game, with a unique spin on scoring and playing. The lead player plays a number card to start the blaze. Each player in turn order must play a card matching that number (which increases the blaze's heat and point value), or a set of cards that equal the value of the card.&#10;&#10;A player can choose to pass, upon which they collect points for each of pairs they have played. The last player to pass wins the trick and collects the points on the blaze card...but will NOT score their pairs they have played.&#10;&#10;Deciding if you'll get more points from the pairs you've played, or if you need to try and stay in to get the points on the blaze card, is the heart of Matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes optional powerful &quot;Burn Cards&quot; which can be purchased with points. These Burn Cards can have huge impacts on how the game is played, the possibly points to be scored, and the cards in players hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They must compete against each other to achieve each nation's 'national objectives'. While actual war is not allowed in the game, the play should show quite clearly how tensions developed to such a high pitch in 1914.&#10;&#10;Note: A full set of rules and print-and-play components are available for download in the files section, below.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Origins of World War II&#10;&#10;",

These reduce the thinking time a lot, as you have only a few choices to make, but still some choices to give the impressions that players are actually playing. In addition to that, certain spaces on the board allow for extra movement. Sometimes you may move an animal in the very back in order to gain some extra movements for the others.&#10;&#10;Is a conga-line-style race, because only one animal can occupy one space, and the taken spaces don't count when you move your animal, which results in amazing jumps over other animals.&#10;&#10;",

Points are awarded for the capture of the most important towns: Munich, Regensburg, Passau, Straubing, Landshut, and Burghausen. You have to occupy these with a unit.  Occupying a town brings money into the bank, with which you can pay for the cost of the troops.&#10;&#10;Battles are dealt with by using the Maneuver Cards and Dice. The action cards give support to the players when they court points and power. The points acquired by each player are recorded on the pad. The player with the highest number of points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included. Will you reach the pole and return ahead of Peary, or end up icebound and abandoned like Franklin?&#10;&#10;It's also possible to lose your ship and be forced to try riding home on an iceberg!&#10;&#10;",

The players add their played card to their display, overlapping the cards, so that only the half that they touched when revealing the card is seen. The other half is taken out of play for this game.&#10;&#10;Some cards show icons that allow you to collect victory points immediately.

Finally, you score more points for each face-to-face victory when comparing the symbols on cards you have taken out during the game as part of the city wall.&#10;&#10;Scoring during the game weakens your display because the scoring symbol is only on card halves with a single icon of influence, while other card halves show up to three icons.&#10;&#10;Tallinn is the second game in the cycle of little tiny card games of Medieval Theme in the Baltic Sea by OSTIA-Spiele, following VISBY.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game DOVER PATROL by Harry Gibson is a wonderful Naval themed and early version of a type of hidden tactics game of skill. It was sold alongside the similar L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence and a more complicated game called Tri-Tactics designed as an incorporation of all three, by Gibsons and marketed together at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons).&#10;&#10;Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, the U.K. distribution rights for which were acquired in 1925 by Gibsons. Dover Patrol was launched in 1911, whereas the original H. P. Gibson & Sons company was registered in 1919. Prior to that, The International Card Company operated between 1903 and 1919, when Harry Percy Gibson purchased ICC to form his company. Whether Harry Gibson designed the game is therefore open to some doubt.&#10;&#10;The game play of Dover Patrol is very much like L'Attaque, which forms the basis of the near-identical game Stratego by Jumbo, published in 1946 after World War II when the patent would have expired. Gibsons themselves had to effectively &lsquo;start again&rsquo; around that time having had their premises destroyed in the Blitz.&#10;&#10;The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.&#10;&#10;Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.&#10;&#10;It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The German players has six different sets of victory goals, depending on the orders from the HQ: the Allied does not know which one is in use and has to plan the invasion accordingly. German reinforcements are also affected by the battle plan used.&#10;&#10;Rules are quite standard for SPI wargames, with units able to 'break down' into their component formations. The game goes on smoothly and ends in a reasonable time.&#10;&#10;At least four editions exist: the original 'Test Series' edition, with the most primitive components and rules; the 'Simulation Games' edition, with die-cut counters, heavier cardstock for the map, and cleaned up rules; the SPUK edition, printed in the UK under licence with different colours; and a later more colourful edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Final Nine is a compact and competitive card game based on the rules, equipment, features, design, fun, and quirks of Disc Golf. It&rsquo;s a game about making decisions, picking the best DISC, applying SKILL, avoiding TROUBLE, hoping for LUCK, and making the PUTT.&#10;&#10;Just like Disc Golf, the aim in Final Nine is to complete your chosen set of HOLES in the lowest number of THROWS possible. It's for 1-4 players, ages 10+, has 108 cards, and takes 30+ minutes to play (full 18). It comes with 2 sets of rules: Standard and Battle, 3 Levels of Play: REC, AM, and PRO. You can also play an easier game using half the pack, or full which is harder. The card swapping and play system allows for a rapid turnover and randomness of cards, allowing for massive replayability.&#10;&#10;To play, lay out the HOLE cards as a board sized grid course (9 or 18 cards), or stack the HOLES in order/shuffled. Each player receives 9 cards for their HAND, made up of DISC and ACTION cards. Swap two cards out at the beginning of a new HOLE. Play a DISC card to match the HOLE GRIDS and find a safe landing spot. Add SKILL if you, can then draw the next ACTION card to see if your THROW was a success, or you end up with a DEVIATION or CALL. If TROUBLE has effected your THROW, add LUCK to nullify it. Once you are within 2-3 GRIDS of the BASKET, use a PUTTER to complete the HOLE.&#10;&#10;Final Nine is like a little fun Disc Golf course in your pocket. It's for those times you can't get to the course because of weather or injury, for those who already play, and those who would like to learn more about the sport. Play your game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SF3D began as a feature in the May 1982 issue of Hobby Japan under the name, &ldquo;Wonderful Junk Kit.&rdquo; Included in that early feature was a scratch-built kit built by Kow Yokoyama of a powersuit pieced together from a Microman action figure, ping pong balls, and salvaged model kit parts.&#10;&#10;The response to Yokoyama&rsquo;s design was huge &mdash; the era of &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; mecha was just taking off, after all &mdash; and so a regular feature in Hobby Japan was born. This new series, dubbed SF3D Original, featured story and background details by Hiroshi Ichimura alongside kits created by Yokoyama. Yokoyama&rsquo;s kits would later be joined by those of other scratch builders, like Makoto Kobayashi, as the workload increased under the demands of a regular column. SF3D ran regularly in Hobby Japan through 1985.&#10;&#10;SF3D takes place in the distant future, following a cataclysmic World War IV that all but wiped-out life on Earth. Human settlers return to Earth, specifically Australia, and soon find themselves unhappy with their overlords in the Galactic Federation. Crime runs amok and the settlers are unable to restore order themselves, so the Galactic Federation tasks the Strahl Democratic Republic (SDR) with straightening things out down under. The SDR&rsquo;s methods are heavy-handed and the settlers soon find themselves thrown under the boot of vaguely Germanic totalitarianism. In turn, the unhappy settlers hire mercenary forces to get rid of the SDR and war breaks out in post-apocalyptic Australia.&#10;&#10;(from the Box:)&#10;&#10;The storm which is World War IV engulfs the continent of Australia. War sparks ingenuity. Ingenuity birth technology. Technology is escalation. The puppet regime which is called Shuttoral World Government is the enemy. The Australian-led resistance grows in strength with the advent of the HAFS &lsquo;Jerry&rsquo;, a tow-legged tank with a ground speed of 54 km/hr. War continues&hellip;&#10;&#10;January 11, 2885: New Canberra City falls to Australian forces. The Germans retreat south skirting the desert.&#10;February 3, 2885: Shuttoral forces, isolated, make an abortive drive on the township of Gibson. A beachhead rescue saves most ot the force.&#10;April 25, 2885: Shuttoral scientists make a secret presentation to Command of the prototype Krachen vogel, armed drone recon.

Includes slightly larger counters than are usually used in Japanese wargames.&#10;&#10;There was an expansion/sequel to this produced.&#10;&#10;",

The males must move very carefully, though. A single wrong move and the male ends up in the stomach of the 'love-hungry' female. And when a male makes such a mistake, it lets the others move about without fear for a short time while the female&rsquo;s hunger is satisfied &ndash; a chance to move closer to the female without being noticed.&#10;&#10;Spidertwist is a tactical game with simple rules that gains special attraction from the fact that the goal of the game is also the source of the danger. Two different webs (game boards) allow various starting configurations of male spiders and promise much enjoyment over many games.&#10;&#10;",

Wayne Schmittberger adapted the rules for streamlined play.&#10;&#10;From GAMES Magazine:&#10;&#10;&quot;The oldest known form of chess, Chaturanga is a lively game in which moves are determined, as in backgammon, by a combination of dice rolls and player judgment.&quot;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ludoteka (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;The above article is incorrect, properly speaking. The game depicted with dice is &quot;Chaturaji,&quot; a gambling game often using dice. &quot;Chaturanga&quot; is the earliest known form of Chess, originating in India, and bares only superficial resemblance to Chaturaji, in that both games use a selection of similar pieces. Chaturanga is played on an 8X8 grid with two players, and differs from modern Chess in some fairly significant ways: there is no castling, there are no En Passant captures, and pawns do not gain an initial two space move; the Elephant or &quot;Gaji&quot; (which inspired the Bishop) jumps only two spaces diagonally; the Queen equivalent, the Mantri, or &quot;Advisor/Minister&quot; moves only one space diagonally in any direction, and games can be won by Bare King and -lost- by Stalemating an opponent (which is precisely the opposite of the Persian descendant of Chaturanga, Shatranj.)&#10;&#10;Some moves and pieces are debated, as this is a very ancient game, and of course it evolved over time, but further research rewards a great deal of interesting discussion on the subject.&#10;&#10;",

Using the right amount of force and deference, you must win exactly a certain number of debates per kingdom. Succeed and you may call upon the ruler for future support; fail even once and lose the game.&#10;&#10;The Emissary is a solo trick-taking game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. The game begins by arranging the deck's eight kings and queens in a row. The player then &quot;visits&quot; each card, in whatever order they choose, drawing a new hand of eight cards from the remainder of deck at each stop. They then draw cards one at a time from the deck, forming the basis of tricks, which the player answers from their own hand. The catch is that whatever place the king or queen being &quot;visited&quot; by the player is (e.g., 1st place through 8th place), that's how many tricks must be won by the player -- no more, and no less. With only a limited capacity to bend the rules through special abilities, the game becomes an exercise in careful hand manipulation and excruciating trade-offs.&#10;&#10;The game is inspired by the decktet game Gongor Whist, which itself was patterned from the standard-deck card game Oneonta Whist. This game also holds the core for the free print-and-play game For Northwood!, which swept top prizes in the 2021 BGG 54-card contest. Familiarity with trick-taking games will make understanding the following rules a breeze. Of course, prior knowledge isn't strictly necessary.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Borodino '41: Battle for the Moscow Highway October 11-18, 1941, is a simulation game depicting the little known but crucial battle for the Moscow Highway that took place near and on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino, October 11-18, 1941.  The motorized division SS Das Reich and the 10th Panzer Division were ordered to detach themselves from the outer encirclement line around the forces of the Soviet Western Reserve Fronts and head for Dorochova.  That would halfway to Moscow. Resistance was not expected to be significant.  But already rushing in to block them were all the forces that Stavka could scrape together.  Several tank brigades rolled out of Moscow to slow the German advance.  Cadet schools marched off to throw themselves in the way of the oncoming panzers while from far across Siberia, trains rushed at full steam, all other traffic shunted out of their way, bearing Stavka's ace card, the veteran 32nd Rifle Division from Vladivostok.  Despite subsequent German claims that only mud preserved Moscow from their iron clutches, an examination of the fight for the one all-weather road from Warsaw to Moscow shows a much clearer picture of what really happened.  Here is a clash of titans, two crack German divisions facing one of the best rifle divisions in the Soviet Army.  If your experience from other wargames would lead you to believe tat the panzers will romp, you, like the Germans at Borodino, are in for a big eye-opening experience.&#10;&#10;Based on the award winning Black Sea Black Death game system, Borodino '41 uses a map scale of 800 meters (one half mile) per hex, three or four impulses per daily turn, with infantry battalions and tanks and anti-tank guns by company (battery).&#10;&#10;The units are played mostly face down, with dummies, to recreate the Fog of War. Combat involves fire, and assault, which are influenced by troop morale, terrain effects, armor support, engineers, and various other specialized units.&#10;&#10;Included are some of the best troops of both sides, as well as Soviet reserve infantry, and tanks ranging from Pzkpfw IIIs and IVs, BT-7s, T-26s, T-34s, a few KV-1s, amphibious T-38s-even a T-28 Co without engines!&#10;&#10;The game uses an updated version of the Black Sea Black Death system, with relatively little chrome and a high level of excitement. The impulse based game system keeps both players actively involved. Localized swings in initiative are common, and the situation presents many counterattack options for the Soviet player, even though he is on the operational defensive.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day&#10;Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 22-page Borodino '41 rules booklet&#10;Five Player Aid cards&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",

As the game goes on each player secretly chooses whether they want to go for a coop victory or a single-player win.&#10;&#10;Set in ancient northern Europe, Dawn blends strategy with unique player dynamics.  As the town is being built there are threats that players need to decide if they want to fight.  In the midst of this players have to also deduce who is helping and who isn't.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of six rounds.  Each round consists of three phases.  First, players draw cards until they have nine in their hands, then they select one to put in their storehouse.  During the second phase, each player plays their cards to either: perform and action (such as heal another player, or spy on a threat), try to build a building by playing a resource card face down in front of it, or try to thwart a threat by putting a card face down by those.  Finally, there is the resolution phase where the cards played face down are shuffled and revealed to see if a building has been built or a threat has been thwarted.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, it is revealed who is a coop player and who was going for a single-player victory based on the amount of treasure each player has stored in their storehouse.  There needs to be thirty prosperity-points worth of buildings built for each coop player or the coop players fail.  If they fail, then the player with the most treasure stored in their personal storehouse wins the game.&#10;&#10;Dawn is the next game in the Darkness four-part saga.  Where Darkness represented players competing for limited resources, as they would during &quot;dark times&quot;, Dawn represents what happens when people choose to work together.

In this turn based strategy game, players build their space station and fleet from supply cards. The winner is the first player to take down their opponent&rsquo;s Station Core.&#10;&#10;Outpost 18 is a two player 18 card game that plays in 10-15 minutes.

But be careful &mdash; unexpected attacks can blindside you, and leave you drifting through the cosmos like space-dust.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Leaders are rated for command, initiative, and combat.  Special rules reflect the abilities and weaknesses of the Crusaders' heavy cavalry.  Each of the four games is complete in itself, and can be played in 1 1/2 to 3 hours, with the ever-present possibility of one side or the other triggering an automatic victory.&#10;&#10;Contains the battles of Antioch, Ascalon, Acre, and Arsouf.&#10;&#10;",

Players secretly select one of their 9 Battle cards from their hand and place it face down. Once both players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their selected cards. The player who revealed the highest initiative Battle card gets to complete their Action phase first.&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;During a player&rsquo;s Action phase, they complete the actions listed on the active card&rsquo;s action bar. Players must complete actions from the top of the card to the bottom, but can skip any action that is not locked.&#10;&#10;Locked actions are indicated by the lock icon.&#10;&#10;Reactive Actions with a black background allow players to perform the maneuver up to the speed listed.&#10;&#10;Keywords and unique pilot abilities may also change how actions and cards interact. Once a player completes their Action phase, the turn proceeds to the next player.&#10;&#10;End Phase&#10;After both players have completed their Action phases, they return their active battle card to their hand and begin a new game turn. Cards with the Dazed keyword receive dazed tokens and cannot be returned to the player&rsquo;s hand until they have played a card with the Recover keyword to remove dazed tokens.&#10;&#10;When a fighter has taken 15 damage, they are defeated leaving the fighter remaining as the victor. Do you have what it takes to become the Aerodome Champion? Can you help decide the fate of the galactic-verse?&#10;&#10;",

If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.&#10;&#10;A variant is given in which all pieces which cross the board are summed to determine the winner, although a player exiting their 'X' still wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The original magazine publication also suggests playing on a 6x6 board with additional '10' and '11' pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Each infantry stand represents 360-foot soldiers while each cavalry stand represents 180 mounted troopers. Ground scale is 120 yards to each inch, while all game turns represent 30 minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;This is a &ldquo;Big Battle&rdquo; game where you will command multiple divisions, not battalions. This makes engagements of over 150,000 combatants a playable reality.

Both the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary periods are supported.&#10;&#10;&bull; Fully developed from the original Fire &amp; Fury ACW rules with clarifications and updates to produce a completely new stand-alone product.&#10;&bull; Irregulars, skirmishers, massed artillery, national doctrine, while unique Initiative and Reserve Movement phases replicate Army level C2.&#10;&bull; The rules are black and white with full color outside covers, 96 pages long in addition to a two-page tables and charts sheet.

Players start each round by choosing their hand of cards through a draft. Each card has two uses: 1) a monster action that changes the city plan, and 2) a unique scoring criteria for earning points. But you can only use each card for one of its two purposes. After the draft, players take turns constructing and demolishing buildings until both players yield. They then score points based on the unused cards that remain in their hand, and how well those cards' scoring criteria are reflected in the final city plan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From the rules card)&#10;&#10;You are a collector of fabulous items.  You start with little money but have 9 precious un-cashed checks.  As you acquire and exhibit your collection, you receive &quot;prize points&quot; that reflect its increased value.  The more valuable your collection, the greater the value of your remaining checks and the easier you will find it to buy even more expensive collector items.  You buy items whose cards you hold in your hand.  But you'll also bid at hotly-contested auctions.  Trading is not only encouraged, it's often essential to build your collection.  When any player buys his 10th item, the game will end.  The wealthiest collector is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dungeon Scrawlers &ndash; Heroes of Waterdeep, you race your opponents through a thrilling dungeon scrawl.&#10;&#10;Players each take their own copy of the same dry-erase dungeon map and a dry-erase marker. Starting with their marker on the &quot;start&quot; space, when the game begins they speed through the maze using a single, unbroken line. Along the way, they have to face challenges that earn them points: fill in a monster to defeat them, circle a treasure to take it, trace a spell to cast it, and more! The game ends when time runs out or someone defeats the final boss, and whoever has the most points wins. Plus, players pick one of five available classes, each with their own special ability!&#10;&#10;Journey to Waterdeep as you explore a wide variety of locations: haunted streets, crowded ports, labyrinthine hedge mazes, and even take on Xanathar in his lair! The game also includes a deck of &quot;mini-dungeon&quot; cards from which you draw when you drop to a deeper layer of the dungeon. Each one is unique, providing different paths for different players, and which exit you find determines where you'll pop back up on the main map. You can even play an always-changing game mode with just the dungeon cards in which players hop from card to card, eventually reaching a random final boss with a unique challenge. There's even a massive final dungeon featuring two dragon bosses that takes up two entire sheets!&#10;&#10;Get ready to scrawl your way to riches!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Automania, The Game Of The Motor Giants, was Ian Livingstone's second self-produced game, after Boomtown, in a limited edition of 1000. The board is a simple scoring track and large flags for each country. Players have nice wooden car shaped pieces in six colors and a larger car to score with. There is a numbered deck of 56 Market Cards in English and German which affect the game each round. Players use a Record Sheet and the rules are in English and German.&#10;&#10;Players represent national car manufacturers trying to export cars to six other countries. Combining the placing some export cars in the markets on the board and secretly noting the remaining export cars on your Record Sheet, players also assign advertising budgets to the markets. Each market has a export limit that it can accept and the cars go for a fixed price in each market, so whoever spends more money on advertising gets to sell their cars first. But before revealing the spending, players play one of their Market Cards, which affect the Market in various ways (e.g. 36 - Car of the Year, Sweden will sell all its cars in the USA). After the market is reorganized, players then determine what cars are actually sold and how much Sales Revenue they have earned. Then subtract costs from sales to give profit. For each $10,000 profit you earn, you move your scoring marker one space on the scoring track. First round the track wins.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a fun game, it drew some criticism in Sumo for the imbalance caused by the Market Cards. The designer replied and suggested which cards might stand removing (7 to 17, 26, 27 and 35). Ian's reply is on the Game Cabinet and makes interesting reading today.&#10;&#10;",

The Polish Army must face the Bolshevik armies attacking Warsaw. The Red Army player's goal is to invade the capital. The Polish Army player's goal is to block them and destroy the attacker's armies. Will Polish soldiers succeed? Can they defend Warsaw? If they fail, Bolshevik armies will continue west over &quot;the corpse of white Poland&quot;, and communism will spread across Europe&hellip;&#10;&#10;While playing this game, you will see the difficulty faced by the Polish army. Players test their command skills by moving armies on the board and planning successive attacks on the enemy. Combat is resolved using a special deck of cards.&#10;&#10;The game also requires skillful bluffing. Players don't know how strong the enemy armies are, or which attack will be the decisive strike. An attack might only be a distraction, tying up valuable enemy divisions that could be better used elsewhere.&#10;&#10;The publication is enriched with an illustrated historical article. The game contains scoring rules for playing a match of two games, suitable for tournaments.&#10;&#10;Box contents:&#10;Game board, 12 unit tokens, 60 cards, 24 wooden command markers, 6 cardboard attack markers, 1 wooden time marker, Polish and English booklets with game rules and a historical article.&#10;&#10;",

Sickle-cut. (Hitler's strategy to occupy France)&#10; 2. Barbarossa plan. (Hitler's strategy to occupy Moscow, etc.)&#10; 3. Military operations 'Bagration and Overlord'. (The Allies terms for 2 separate plans to land in Europe and occupy Berlin)&#10; 4. The entire campaign in Europe and Northern Africa.&#10; Each of the above has 2 versions, one for beginners and one for advanced players.&#10;The game is played on a mapboard printed on both sides.&#10;The conditions for victory of the different participating countries (i.e. players) vary, for example, Italy could remain neutral and still win the game, even if the Allied troops occupy Berlin.&#10;&#10;All the elements of warfare can be found in this game - infantry, armed troops, navy, airforce, paratroops, bombers, artillery*, planes and submarines represented by about 200 markers. The battles are settled in a simple and clearly defined way.

    "Description": "The 1978 release of Verdun, though based on the 1972 release from Conflict Games (designed by John Hill), is a completely new game with a new designer (Marc W. Miller).&#10;&#10;&quot;Verdun: A Dagger at the Heart of France&quot; is an Operational level board-wargame simulation of the 1916 German offensive that was supposed to &quot;bleed the French white&quot; in a single great battle of attrition, but instead turned into a bloody debacle of 10 months of slaughter.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are mostly conventional for hex and counter wargames. Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.&#10;&#10;Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.&#10;&#10;Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.&#10;&#10;Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.&#10;&#10;The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks. There are also rules for the Germans reducing the fortresses that surround Verdun.&#10;&#10;While control of the city of Verdun is a primary victory condition for the game, the real key to victory is the amount of attrition each side does to the other.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, red/blue, square/circle, one/two items, and with/without cross.  Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the climax of the American Civil War the armies of the Confederacy were pressed back into their heartland as the rebellion tried desperately to sustain itself against Union forces. One of the most important campaigns occurred in southeastern Tennessee and Georgia, as Federal armies pressed toward the Confederacy&rsquo;s vital city of Atlanta, home to much of its remaining industry and gateway to the southern and western lands the Confederates still held. The campaign for and siege of this vital city broke the power of the Army of Tennessee, the key rebel command outside northern Virginia.&#10;&#10;The theater of these operations is roughly bounded by the Tennessee River to the north, the Chattanooga area to the west, Atlanta to the south, and the Appalachian Mountains to the east. It was here where the formidable Union command team of Sherman and Thomas plied their trade, dooming the Confederacy's last chance to survive the Yankee onslaught. Here too the soldiers of the rebel Army of Tennessee fought stubbornly to defend their homes.&#10;&#10;Look Away! The Fall of Atlanta is a strategic-operational simulation of the Army of Tennessee's campaigns in the Georgia theater of the Civil War. The game covers the fighting between Union and Confederate forces in Tennessee and northern Georgia during the spring and summer of 1864. Each hexagon represents an area roughly 2.6 miles in diameter (4 km). Each turn in the game represents about five days of real time. There are four scenarios dealing with the major engagements of the war plus a campaign game covering the entire period.&#10;&#10;Look Away is the third game in John Prados' series on the American Civil War, following The Campaigns of Robert E. Lee and The Army of the Heartland: The Army of Tennessee's Campaigns, 1861-1863.&#10;&#10;Look Away! Game scale:  about 2.6 miles (4 km) per hex; about 5 days/turn; according to ATO website and the Turn Track from the map artwork on the ATO website: https://www.atomagazine.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=55&amp;category=6 .&#10;&#10;Biafra! was included as a bonus in this issue.&#10;&#10;",

This wargame uses a variation of the system used in Vae Victis issue 13 for &quot;Arnhem&quot;.  The focus of the game system is on initiative and command, with alternating formation activations (i.e., the German player activates one General's command, then the Soviet player activates one General's command, and repeat until all the units are activated).  This is one of Vae Victis's larger games in terms of counters and markers, but still fits on the standard Vae Victis map (which is far smaller than the typical ca. 2' x 3' American wargame map).&#10;&#10;This issue also includes counters for a scenario for &quot;Caesar: Conquest of Gaul,&quot; the Batte of Sos.&#10;&#10;As with all Vae Victis wargames, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.

    "Description": "A fervent party game in which the players will have to play fast, show memory and concentration.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. Every turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. They all plays simultaneously and will try to catch the more valuable cards (with the highest numbers) in order to win. To do it, players have to stick one hand on a card with the biggest number preferably.&#10;&#10;But do not play too fast and take time to look at the card which you want to stick because you will have to answer a question about it. Do you remember how many tentacles there was on your card? Do you remember the color of every Qwark? Yes&nbsp;? You won your card, congratulations. No&nbsp;? Next time, try to be more attentive. ;-)&#10;&#10;There is 48 different Qwarks: with several eyes, with or without tentacles, which are sad or joyful and of 6 different colors.&#10;&#10;Quickly play but not too much. Use your memory and remain concentrated until  is in your turn to answer the question.&#10;&#10;",

Aside for the obvious need to supply your own Lego (or compatible) blocks, the game calls for the players to provide a number of six-sided dice in a number of colors, a red and a green d8, a d10 &quot;Initiative Die&quot;, and a d12 or d20 to act as the &quot;Doomsday Clock.&quot;&#10;&#10;I DO TO YOU NOW THE ENORMOUS HURT!&#10;&#10;",

Each player finds themselves abusing their power, and their friends, as they try to take a dominant position, and win the game.&#10;&#10;Addictive Alchemy is a deck destruction, or deck shaping game, where players drink potions a little too quickly, and have to manage their potions, and the side effects that come with them.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with the same deck of cards (potions), and on their turn they will each drink 2 potions. However, those potions mix in their stomach or &quot;system&quot;, and as a result at the start of their next turn they will have a side effect! To make matters trickier their foes can alter their side effects turning something that was intended to be helpful into something harmful, and unexpected.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The six sons of the Sultan have come to you, the foremost tea merchants in land, with a request:&#10;&#10;Provide us with the best exotic teas the world has to offer and we will reward you richly (we may even favor you with special privileges if you impress us), but only one of you can become Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate!&#10;&#10;Six Sons of the Sultan is a game for two players that takes about 15-20 minutes. Players will have 10 rounds to gain prestige by supplying different kinds of tea to the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. Each type of tea has different costs and prestige points associated with it as well as special actions that may help the players during the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire play option.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game uses only 9 cards, 3 dice and some eurocubes. It can be printed, however, as a single page game board&#10;&#10;Phase 1 - The Dice Roll&#10;The start player begins the round by rolling all 3 dice (Note: in consecutive rounds each player will only roll two dice, having had one die passed to them previously). Once the dice are rolled they are assigned as follows:&#10;&#10;One die is chosen as the Order Die, the die number corresponding to 1 of the 6 Tea Card numbers.&#10;&#10;One die is then chosen as the Wealth Die, and will increase a player&rsquo;s total wealth by the amount shown on the die.&#10;&#10;The final die is the Passing Die and is passed to the other player. This die is locked and may not be rolled during the next player&rsquo;s turn unless the player uses the White Tea card&rsquo;s special action.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - The Tea Order&#10;The player may now place orders on the Tea Card that matches the Order Die&rsquo;s number, thus pleasing one of the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. A player may move their eurocube token up the card&rsquo;s track as many spaces as they are able to pay for (the bottom number denotes the price), moving their token on the Wealth card accordingly. If a player has (0) wealth they may not place an order this turn.&#10;&#10;Spaces on the track also have a Prestige Point value which is totalled up at the end of the game (the top number shown for the space).&#10;&#10;Certain marked spaces also allow the player to use the Special Action of that card. If a player can afford to move their token up a number of spaces, passing more than one Special Action space, only the final space landed on is counted. The space must be landed on to use the Special Action. The player does not have to use the Special Action if they do not want to.&#10;&#10;Phase 3 - Wealth Gained&#10;The player may now move their Wealth token the number of spaces as indicated on the Wealth Die.&#10;&#10;The player&rsquo;s turn is now over and the opposing player takes the remaining two dice and rolls them to begin their turn.&#10;&#10;Once both players have had a turn, the round is over, the round token is moved down one space on the Time Card and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;Play continues for a total of 10 rounds. When the 10th round is finished, players add up their respective Prestige Points to determine who will be the Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate. If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most accrued wealth is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.&#10;&#10;",
