    "Description": "Rifles in the Peninsula is the third game of the solitaire RIFLES series, which also includes Rifles in the Pacific and Rifles in the Ardennes. The focus of this new title is on the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815).&#10;&#10;The RIFLES system allows the recreation of small combat engagements (five to ten units per side), using an abstract map that represents the main features of the terrain like trees, buildings, hills. Placement of terrain features is guided but is never the same on each game, always creating new tactical challenges. The enemy strategy and the fog of war is recreated with the use of random Event Markers and &ldquo;Activation Tables&rdquo; that drive the enemy units toward their objective.&#10;&#10;Rifles in the Peninsula introduces new rules to cover unique aspects of the Napoleonic Wars including mounted troops, formations, and the impact of the longer reload time of the weapons of the period (pistols, muskets, and rifles). The different attributes of the units (combat factors, quality, special traits) grenadiers, voltigeurs, cuirassiers and dragoons.&#10;&#10;The Campaign game has been greatly redesigned and is now based on the timeline of the main campaigns of the period. The new Glory Track will represent the career of the Leader of your units, your avatar in the game, and your rank will have a direct influence on the game. Each year of the campaign includes four to six main &ldquo;scenes&rdquo;: a scene can trigger one Mission on the battlefield or a Campaign Event. Twelve different Missions are available, covering classical military duties like reconnaissance as well as iconic battle episodes like the capture of a gun. Campaign Events are resolved without the need to setup the battlefield and cover episodes like barrack inspections, field maneuvers and of course duels. As a bonus, an optional mini-game The Duel (inspired by the movie, The Duelists)has been included in the package: this mini-game allows players to re-create a saber duel with a more personal perspective, providing an additional level of immersion in the historical period.&#10;&#10;From thundering muskets, to rattle of sabers, Rifles in the Peninsula vividly recreates Napoleonic skirmishes like never before.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s the final countdown! Who will prevail? Oh, and watch out for the Zombies!&#10;&#10;Mortals is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game played with Blinks. &#10; Each Blink (tile) starts with 60 seconds to live and players take turns stealing life from opponents tiles.&#10;&#10;If a tile moves alone it goes into attack mode and with each move, it can steal life from opponents connected tile.&#10;The attacking piece gains 5 seconds per connection.&#10;&#10;An attacking tile will steal from every tile including its own team. Sacrificing one tile to prolong the life of others is a common tactic.&#10;&#10;Turns proceed into all Blinks are dead.&#10;&#10;As each Blink begins to die, each tile becomes a zombie and drains life from any connected tile.&#10;&#10;The last surviving Blink is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "HMS Royal Sovereign was a 1st Rate Ship-of-the-Line of the Royal Navy, bearing 100 guns. She was launched from Plymouth Dockyard in 1786 and developed somewhat of a poor reputation from her crew, supposedly dubbed &quot;West Country Wagon&quot; owing to poor manoeuvrability and speed.&#10;&#10;Prior to her famous role at the Battle of Trafalgar, she participated in the battles of &quot;The Glorious First of June&quot; as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves, and was Cornwallis' flagship in his famous retreat of 16 June 1795. In the latter battle, after a day's pursuit, a far larger French fleet came within firing range of the entire Brtish fleet.&#10;&#10;Realising the danger to his rearguard, Cornwallis brought Royal Sovereign southwards imposing his vessel between the two fleets, using the power of the 1st rate's broadside to dissuade the pursuing French. In doing so, he managed to delay the French long enough until the appearance of an unknown fleet spooked the French into their own retreat.&#10;&#10;In Game:&#10;&#10;HMS Royal Sovereign is an exceptionally powerful 1st Rate in the game. Beware the brunt of her broadside, particularly if you choose to include Admiral Collingwood as a character in your fleet. His presence will allow his ship and friendly vessels near, to re-roll its initial broadside. This gives you a distinct advantage for this crucial portion of any battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

French ships have access to the 'sturdy' upgrade for a discount, and thus have a significant number of ship point to chew through.

    "Description": "The Santisima Trinidad (officially named Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad) was a Spanish first-rate ship of the line. This number of guns increased over the years. At launch in 1769, she had 112 guns, though this number gradually increased. between 1795 and 1796 she was upgraded to 130 guns, and in 1802 this number was increased to 140. Following this last rebuild, she was the heaviest armed ship in the world, bearing more guns than any other ship in the Age of Sail. Effectively, however, the fourth gundecks guns were comparatively small.&#10;&#10;This armament was not without its problems. The weight of the additional weaponry rendered her a particularly poor at sail, leading to the ultimately rejected suggestion that she be restricted to the defence of the Bay of Cadiz. She remains notable as one of the very few 4-decked ships ever built.&#10;&#10;In the game:&#10;The vast bulk of the Santisima Trinidad is alluded to with its special rules in Black Seas - she is only ever able to make a single change of direction during her activation. She also requires a successful skill test to be able to travel at full sails.&#10;&#10;The trade-off for this deficiency is an arsenal that dwarfs any other ship in the game. Any vessel unfortunate enough to be caught in the broadside is sure to be shredded. You'll want to capitalize on this as best you can, unleashing your initial broadside (which conveys additional bonuses) at the optimal moment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "USS Constitution was one of six Heavy Frigates commissioned by the United States Congress in 1794 to protect American shipping against Barbary Pirates in the Mediterranean. These frigates were designed to outmatch the frigates of any other nation while remaining nimble enough to slip away from larger ships-of-the-line.&#10;&#10;These six frigates (Chesapeake, Constitution, President, United States, Congress, and Constellation. Chesapeake, Constitution, President and United States) were armed with 44 guns, normally a mix of long 24-pounders and 32-pound carronades. Across their service life, these ships would often end up over gunned, carrying upwards of 50 guns into battle.&#10;&#10;Revolutionary construction techniques gave the six frigates much thicker hull planking than their British or French equivalents, allowing them to soak up a tremendous amount of punishment. It also allowed them to carry a much heavier armament relative to their size, as seen by the arrays of 24 and 32-pounders carried on the 44 gun vessels.&#10;&#10;In the Game:&#10;&#10;USS Constitution should be in the thickest fighting on the table, leading the charge into the enemy battle line, using her exceptional survivability to weather the storm of shot and shell while blasting away with her own guns.&#10;&#10;While she might not be able to tangle with larger First Rates like Victory, she can hold her own in frigate actions, tying up the enemy fleet while the remainder of your ships go after other objectives or gain a more advantageous position.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A gunboat squadron is like a gnat in comparison to the larger ships-of-the-line. Nevertheless, they have a useful place in the fleet. A gunboat would typically have only a single mast with square-rigged sails, mounting between one and three fixed cannons.&#10;&#10;Fleets of all navies kept gunboats on hand. They could be useful in shallower waters, as with only a single mounted cannon, they were able to manoeuvre relatively easily where a large ship could not. If this cannon was a 32-pounder it could still prove dangerous to larger vessels. For instance, a frigate could easily destroy a single gunboat with a single broadside hit. But if deployed in large numbers, the frigate would struggle to deal with every gunboat before sustaining heavy damage itself. The extremely cheap cost and relative time is taken to build these gunboats could prove a tremendous advantage.&#10;&#10;Gunboats were crucial to Napoleon's notion for the planned invasion of England in 1804, whilst the US Navy's policy between 1803 and 1812 focussed its Navy around the concept - this was to prove ineffectual against the British Blockade in the war of 1812.&#10;&#10;In the Game&#10;&#10;In Black Seas, Gunboat squadrons are tiny vessels. This means that they are extremely difficult to hit, but are vulnerable to collisions from larger vessels, particularly if that vessel was travelling at speed. They mount only a single light cannon and are too small to allow for upgrades  - their relative evasiveness, however, means that they will be difficult to deal with in battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Frigates&#10;&#10;Frigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the Age of Sail.  A small warship with a perfect balance of speed, armament and resilience that made it one of the perfect vessels for single-ship action and privateering against merchant ships. It usually had one main gun deck as well as the guns positioned on the top decks. These were categorised as either 5th or 6th rate within the British Rating System, dependent on the number of guns they mounted.&#10;&#10;The 5th rates were the archetypal frigates of the period. Used for single-ship actions and privateering, they could make their crews very rich as a result of the share of the prize money for any captured ship. A frigate was a desirable posting for a Royal Navy officer as they often saw action, so glory and promotion were more likely in addition to monetary benefits.&#10;&#10;Frigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; Indeed, even in the midst of a fleet engagement, it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first... Wargamers take note!&#10;&#10;Brig&#10;&#10;A two-masted square-rigged vessel, with between 10 and 18 cannons, frequently used in combat actions by various navies. Ships with less than 20 cannons were considered Unrated. These were not really meant to participate in large battles &ndash; that was the domain of the ships of the line. However, they were the vessels of choice for privateers and still played a valuable role during larger battles, relaying orders and messages in a similar fashion to the 6th rates.&#10;&#10;The Frigates &amp; Brigs Flotilla box contains all you need to get these vessels to the tabletop. These are suitable for navies of any nation. The kit includes a bobbin for rigging your vessels, detailed sails and pennants for every nation, as well as all the gaming materials for using the vessels in your games of Black Seas.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 3rd rate ship, as defined by the British rating system, was a ship of the line which mounted between 64-80 guns. Usually, this would mean two gun decks. Despite their relative size and power compared to larger 1st and 2nd rates, it was considered that 3rd rates maintained an effective, perhaps even superior balance between sailing ability, firepower and cost.&#10;&#10;For a number of nations, 3rd rates were the most popular ship size. Cheaper to operate and easier to sail without the sacrifice of offensive capability, the only ships a 3rd rate could not single-handedly engage were larger three-decked ships. A large number of 3rd rates were built and employed on a variety of missions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Thieves is a science fiction heist board game, first developed and released in 2013.&#10;&#10;Set in the year 2595, aboard a futuristic space station - physically represented by a medium-sized hexagonal board - up to eight players are directed to navigate towards the crux of the game, the Black Star Diamond, located at the center. Players are dealt a small hand of cards that are categorized as &quot;Equipment&quot;, &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;PvP&quot; - the last of which is inaccessible throughout this first phase called &quot;Heist Mode&quot;. During this time, players must overcome obstacles, including doors and turrets, while also accounting for treachery dealt by their opponents.&#10;&#10;Once the Black Star Diamond has been snatched, the board resets into &quot;PvP Mode&quot;, which allows for players to utilize their generally lethal PvP cards, to pursue the jewel's carrier. The player to return to their starting hexagon dubbed the &quot;Spawn Point&quot; wins the game.&#10;&#10;Designed by Samuel Horton, Tobias Phelps and Ryan Brock, the game was intended to emulate the tone of a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) - a video game - title, with heist being the central mechanic. The game was inspired predominantly by Dota 2, Scrolls, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (1st Edition) and Gloom.&#10;&#10;In 2019, American film &amp; video game developer Botto Entertainment acquired the intellectual property rights to Star Thieves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your challenger stands across from you as you enter the arena. Only one of you will walk away as champion. FIGHT!&#10;&#10;Sent&#197;&#141;: Ultimate Arcade Fighter is a fresh take on the classic arcade fighter! Sent&#197;&#141; is the first tabletop game to capture the puzzle fighter experience, and bring it from the digital space to the analog.&#10;&#10;Sent&#197;&#141; is a fighting game with a vibrant cast of worldly characters. Each character brings their own asymmetric style and abilities to each match. Play as a chef with powers over ice and fire, a trickster magician with manipulative mind games, or a lively DJ dropping powerful beats!&#10;&#10;On your turn, activating your attack is as simple as clearing a chain of same colored connected marbles from the dispenser. Your character's unique attack list will tell you what attack they perform based on the number and color of marbles cleared. Use your attacks wisely to hinder your opponent, accelerate your own unique systems, manipulate the board, and deal damage to your opponents' health gauge buttons! Each time you break a button, they must insert 1 of their 5 coins into the arcade cabinet (marble dispenser). When there are no more coins to insert, it's game over!&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 buttons. These buttons act as health gauges, one for each color of ability and marble (Red, Yellow, and Blue.) When dealing damage, you decide which button to damage, and once a button is brought down to 0, you break it and disable your opponent's access to those attacks! However, broken buttons allow you to &quot;Short-circuit&quot; through marbles of that color (essentially making them linking marbles), allowing a weakened opponent to more easily activate their hardest hitting attacks in their remaining colors. Your buttons will recover as you &quot;Short-circuit&quot; through same colored marbles, and can be re-activated at the beginning of any turn. But do so too early and they could get broken again quickly, burning another coin!&#10;&#10;A player is knocked out once they have no more coins to insert, but be careful. If a button is broken while having other buttons out of commission, you must insert a coin for each broken button! You'll need to carefully balance aggression and caution in this quick-action puzzle-driven fighting game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Disarm The Base is a quick, co-operative game based on direct action. Players need to find and disarm war planes on a base, both avoiding the guards and disarming all the planes before the deck runs out.&#10;&#10;Play takes place on a game board representing the base. Tiles representing different war planes are placed face down in hangars on the board. Each turn, players take up to four actions, which include moving around the base, playing cards from their hand, or giving or taking cards. Players then draw cards from a deck, resolving red cards immediately and taking other cards into their hands. Red cards do unfavorable things such as closing gates, placing guards in hangars, and turning on lights; cards in hand allow actions such as unlocking hangars, opening gates, turning off lights, and (of course) disarming planes. At the end of your turn, a guard on the perimeter of the board moves one space.&#10;&#10;Players win if they disarm all the planes and at least one player escapes the base. To do that, players need to move around the board, use a code card or a crowbar card to open a hangar, enter the hangar, use a code card or a bolt cutter card to disarm the plane, leave the hangar, find the rest of the planes, and finally get out of the base back to where the banners were left! Players don't know which hangars contain planes, and every plane differs. If the deck runs out of cards, the supply runs out of guards, or more than one player is discovered by a guard, the players lose.&#10;&#10;",

Great for games AND non-gamers.

Each floor is reversible, providing varying scoring options for different playing strategies.  The Kickstarter base game comes with the walls, 2 reversible floors, 8 teams of dice (80 total), a limited edition decal of one of the 8 named Gladiators, instruction booklet and custom art.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players take the role of bunnies which start with 10 carrots each. Through card play, they try to make the other players lose carrots. Last player with any carrots left wins the game.&#10;&#10;Game play is similar to Uno, played over several short rounds. At the start of each round, every player gets a hand of 6 cards. In his turn, a player can discard a card that matches the number or color of the top card in the discard pile. If he is unable to do so, he has to draw a card. When one player has no cards left, the other players have to pay one carrot for each card left in their hands. Then a new round starts.&#10;&#10;Special rules: When a player is unable to play a card, he not only has to draw one, but also to stand up. When he plays a card in a later turn, he sits down again. There is a quite large number of special cards that allow to steal one carrot from each player that is currently standing. Other special cards make all other players stand up, or try to steal a carrot from a specific player.&#10;&#10;A player without any carrots left is immediately out of the game. Winner is the last player with any carrots left.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Without encountering significant obstacles, the reconnaissance elements of the 1.Panzerdivision raced across Luxembourg, crossing the 50 kilometres, even before the inhabitants were awake, and reaching the Belgian frontier at Martelange at 07.45 hours. The German plan foresaw an attack on Martelange by Marschgruppe Voraus &ndash; a motorcycle company supported by armoured cars - then an attack on Bodange by the entire Advance Guard.&#10;&#10;This tactical mission (TM) revolves around the efforts of the Belgian 5th Company, 1er Regiment de Chasseurs Ardennais'  valiant attempt to slow the Germans' Race for the Meuse River. This TM is compatible with MMP's ASL System and modifiable to be used with other miniature Wargaming systems.&#10;&#10;The Tactical Mission Pack comes with 1x Tactical Mission (a.k.a. Campaign Game) + 5 Scenario played on a historically based (24&frac12;&quot;x 35&quot; with standard ASL 7/8&quot; hexes) map of the Sure River Valley; between the villages of Wisembach and Bodange, located 3-kilometres west of the Belgian-Luxembourg border.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At every round, players get resource cards based on their progress, and use them to implement interventions aimed at achieving the SDGs. By way of those interventions, players advance from level 0 to 3 for each SDG or &ldquo;Goal&rdquo;, and receive more resources to invest and further their progress.&#10;&#10;Basic Setup&#10;Distribute 17 tokens of the same color to each player; divide the resource cards by type and stack them on the outer part of the board; and place the Technology token on the globe in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;To determine their starting level, players roll the die. The player with the highest roll rolls the die again and positions an initial token on the first intervention for the corresponding SDG number. The other players follow in a clock-wise direction, rolling the die in turns until all players have placed six tokens.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has progressed the most towards the SDGs wins: each level achieved for each Goal is counted as a point, and the first player to fully achieve any Goal is awarded two extra points. The game can be limited in time, in rounds, or can end when the first player achieves a certain level for all SDGs agreed by players at the start of the game. Reaching Level 1 for all Goals typically requires about 1 hour of play time; Level 2 two hours; and Level 3 three hours.&#10;&#10;",

Stitchcraft is a two-player strategy card game that plays in 15 to 20 minutes where players have the same deck of 40 cards, 5 copies each of 8 colored tapestries, and are racing to have 7 of the 8 colors face up on the table or 4 copies of one color face up on the table.&#10;&#10;Stitchcraft won the Implementation of Simplicity award at CinCityCon&rsquo;s 2019 design contest for being easy to learn while retaining strategic depth.  Turns are composed of each player drawing a card and then taking two actions. An action can be either placing a tapestry from hand face down on the table OR taking a face down tapestry and flipping it face up, activating the power of that color. Each color has a unique effect based on the Pattern set chosen at the start of each game. If players ever get tired of one Pattern set they can simply change to a new Pattern for an entirely different play experience.

You'll need accuracy, timing, and finesse to win this kinetic tabletop game.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Blinks begin the game as unscored Flickers, which appear as a spinning white light. Set three Blinks aside, then evenly distribute the remaining Flickers to all players. Assign each player one of three colors: magenta, cyan, or yellow.&#10;Take the Blinks you set aside and long press them.

Long pressing a Flopper when alone will return it to a flicker.&#10;Turning a Flicker into a Flopper&#10;Take all three Floppers and combine them into a single cluster. Place the cluster about 3 feet away from the players (i.e. the other end of a short table) and in front of a backstop such as the game box. The further away you place the Flopper, the more challenging the game will be.&#10;Creating a cluster of Floppers&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Players take turns sliding their Flickers towards the Flopper. Attaching to the Flopper will score the Flicker for the team color being displayed. A scored Flicker that has been connected displays a single dot of its scoring color and an entire half Blink of the current Flopper color. That Blink is now an extension of the Flopper, so Flickers that attach to it will score for the color of the Flopper.&#10;&#10;&#10;Some Flickers may not attach at all when thrown: these are left where they are. They are still active, and may be knocked into the cluster by other players&rsquo; Flickers.&#10;After every Flicker has been thrown, pull the unattached flickers aside, then separate the scored Flickers. This will make them display their scored color. Count the amount of your color and add that to your score tally. Double-clicking a Flicker in this state will reset it back to an unscored Flicker, ready to be distributed to players and thrown in the next round.&#10;                                                                                                         &#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The first player to reach 11 points is the winner.

    "Description": "Fracture is a new kind of territory control game where players fracture and rebuild the entire board on each turn. From a simple set of rules emerge surprisingly complex strategies.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Distribute Blinks evenly to all players (minimum 4 Blinks/player). Each player chooses a team color and sets their Blinks to that color by double-clicking. Once all players are set, recombine all Blinks into a starting arrangement with colors segregated.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;The object of this game is to make your Blinks &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; In order for a Blink to be happy, it must be:&#10;a) touching at least two other tiles, AND&#10;b) not touching a tile of its own color&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player makes a fracture by splitting and separating the cluster into two smaller clusters. The clusters can be of any size; they do not have to be equal. You can choose to only move a single Blink, and you can move any tile, not just the ones of your own color.&#10;&#10;Fractures must be able to be slid into and out of place while remaining flat on the table. They also cannot split the board into more than 2 halves.&#10;&#10;The player then reconnects the two clusters in any way they choose. Once a player has finished their move, play passes to the next clockwise player.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The game ends when, at the end of a turn, a player has made all of their own color Blinks happy. In games with neutral Blinks, they must make all neutral Blinks happy as well.&#10;&#10;This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#144;&#134;' (Ri no ri, Logic and Psychology) is a card-drafting game for two players. The title is derived from two kanji words: &#232;&#171;&#150;&#231;&#144;&#134; (logic) which means in this game you can win by precise deduction, and &#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134; (psychology) which means in this game you can win by bluffing as well. So the title implies this is a game of deduction vs. bluffing.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two phases: mustering phase and battle phase.&#10;&#10;During the mustering phase, players draft revealed soldier cards to form their hand of five cards each.&#10;&#10;A battle phase consists of five battles. During a battle, the attacker places a card face-down from their hand. The backside of the placed card has partial information about the soldier's identity. The defender looks at it, and places a card from their hand. Then they reveal both cards.&#10;&#10;A soldier card has its soldier type and power value printed on it. If both players have played a soldier of the same type, the soldier with the lower value wins the battle. Otherwise one with the higher value wins the battle, but some types get a bonus power against a certain type.&#10;&#10;A new round begins after the fifth battle. When a plyer has won total of six battles, that player immediately wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players know the identity of some cards their opponent has drafted, and the partial information is printed on backside of each card, which means defender can predict which card attacker has played. But there's some chance of attacker's bluff if carefully drafted. You should consider your opponent's intention to win the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#157;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#230;&#150;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#230;&#131;&#133;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#129;&#169;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This dice game is designed for the Blinks system allowing competitors to take dice and bet on results.&#10;&#10;SCORING:&#10;Each Blink is worth the amount of points shown on its face (1-6). If you have more than one Blink with the same face value, the duplicates are instead worth 10 each. For example, a player with a 4, a 5, and a 6 has scored 15 points (4 + 5 + 6), while a player with 3 4s has scored 24 points (4 + 10 + 10).&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The player with the highest point total is the winner.&#10;While this game can be played with more than 2 players, it's recommended that you play with at least 5 Blinks per player for a competitive game. Also, experiment with starting arrangements for more interesting games. Finally, for more advanced play, limit each player to using the re-roll action only once per game.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;12+ Blinks&#10;5-10 Min.&#10;Takeaway Dice is played using Widgets.

First, they may (but don't have to) re-roll all the dice in the cluster. Then they must remove a Blink from the cluster and claim it for their own.&#10;&#10;Not all Blinks can be legally removed from the cluster at the start of a turn. Blinks with neighbors on opposing faces are &ldquo;locked,&rdquo; as are Blinks that, if removed, would fracture the cluster into more than 2 pieces.&#10;Examples of locked Blinks&#10;Players take turns in succession until the last Blink has been claimed. At this point, players add up their score.&#10;&#10;This Game is played with Blinks Widget.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On May 10, 1940, the German Army Groups A and B began their invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Allies, who determined this to be an offensive based on the Schlieffen Plan, set up as planned a line of defense along the Dyle river in Belgium. However, the German main force, the Army Group A's armored forces, broke through the Ardennes forest, contrary to the Allies' expectations, and advanced behind the Allied forces and advanced quickly in Northern France towards the English Channel.&#10;&#10;The Rise of Blitzkrieg simulates the Fall of France. One player is the German, the other the Allies, and the game starts with operations plans. Can the German player trap the Allied player who knows the historical facts? Can the Allied player use its military strength to stop the German invasion? This game challenges the players' operational skills.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The board spaces determine the next rounds subjects from the cards drawn - Everyday, Pot Luck, Sayings, Leisure and a Free-For-All space.

It is up to the maintenance worker and the zoo keeper to contain the animals and restore power back to the zoo. If you can get the maintenance worker to the maintenance shed to restore power, you win! If more than three animals escape or if either person run out of health points, you lose.&#10;&#10;Mayhem at the Rockport Zoo is a roll and write game where you roll four dice to determine which animals will escape and one die for the direction in which they travel.&#10;&#10;Both the zoo keeper and the maintenance worker have two actions per turn. The only way to contain the animals is to close the gate or tranquilize the animals.&#10;&#10;With five exits and twelve types of animals, the race is on to protect the public. Each turn the danger will escalate and as the game progresses, the animals can travel greater distances. There are enough traps outside of the zoo to only catch three animals should they escape. If a fourth one escapes, the mayhem spreads outside of the zoo and you lose the game.&#10;&#10;Entry for the 2019 Roll and Write contest&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
