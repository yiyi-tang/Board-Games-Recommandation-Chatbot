    "Description": "Victoria Harbour On Board is one of the Hong Kong On Board series. The chess pieces are designed with local characteristics, and players can use them to travel through different districts in Hong Kong. Victoria Harbour On Board can bring players closer together and enhance their understanding of the different districts in Hong Kong. It is a very special souvenir with Hong Kong characteristics. (from game box)&#10;&#10;Players start their custom, Hong Kong-themed pieces at square on on the heavy paper playmat. They then roll a die to progress to square 81 encountering various Hong Kong landmarks on the way. Similar to Snakes and Ladders, these landmarks can move you ahead or send you back on your path. For example, landing on square 23 lets you take the tram to square 29. While essentially a reskinning of Snakes and Ladders, the Hong Kong theme and nice metal tokens makes this a fun souvenir that can spark memories of a visit through playing the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you may place a garden card, build your hut, or upgrade your hut into a house:&#10;&#10;&#10;    When you place a garden card, you must partially overlay it on existing garden; the overlaid color of tulip becomes rare, so therefore its market value is raised. &#10;    When you build a hut or a house, you discard several cards and place the building on the garden. You may hire an artisan when you have built a house. Each artisan has a special ability.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, for each color, you score victory points equal to the market value of that color multiplied by the number of squares your buildings occupy on that color. Then add some bonus depending on your buildings' location. The highest scorer wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Leiden1593&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#230;&#160;&#189;&#229;&#159;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#162;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#160;&#189;&#229;&#159;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#128;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#232;&#163;&#149;&#231;&#166;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

Divided into many small kingdoms and city-states that wage near-constant war with snake-men, native tribes, and with each other, the Dricheans are renowned for the gleaming bronze of their weapons and armour, and their martial prowess. Organized and militaristic, these formidable warriors pose a new threat to adventurers exploring the Lost Isles.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Frostgrave: Ghost Archipelago examines the scattered realms of the Dricheans, presenting players with three new mini-campaigns featuring these bronze-armed warriors. Also included are additional rules for using Drichean Crew and Soldiers as well as guidelines for creating your own Drichean kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Athelorn Avengers exemplify everything that makes Wood Elves some of the best teams in Blood Bowl: stunning speed and agility, unexpected savagery and natural talent. Star Players like Jordell Freshbreeze and Gloriel Summerbloom have become household names for Blood Bowl fans everywhere. Wood Elf teams are incredibly popular, as they're known to put on an impressive show &ndash; they're just as likely to (literally) dance circles around their rivals as they are to get smashed in (literally) spectacular fashion. They play the game better than just about anyone else, and they look stunning while they're at it.&#10;&#10;Wood Elves hit hard and fast, but they're not known for their endurance and resilience, alas. They&rsquo;re the proverbial glass dagger, but in the hands of a skilled coach they can produce impressive results. If you're content to scrape by with minimal effort, this isn't the team for you &ndash; it takes finesse and skill to win games, but when you succeed, you know you've earned it. For their part, Wardancers are amongst the most impressive starting players in the game, all your Wood Elf players start with at least 7 Movement, and they have access to one of the wildest collections of Star Players to be found anywhere.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to assemble the Athelorn Avengers, a Wood Elf team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 2 Catchers, 2 Throwers, 2 Wardancers and 6 Line Elves, plus a roster sheet. Also included are a transfer sheet, 2 turn markers featuring a Wood Elf motif, 3 thematic balls, and 14 Citadel 32mm Round bases featuring holes in which to place the ball.&#10;&#10;The rules to use Wood Elf teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike!

At the start of a round, each player places one of their cards face down to predict how many chips will be played that round. Players then take turns, and on a turn you can either place a chip in the playing area or pass. Do you add chips to get closer to your prediction at the risk of losing more of your chips, or will you pass and let your opponent control the conversation?&#10;&#10;Once either both players have passed or a total of nine chips have been played, the round ends and players reveal their cards. If your card is closer than your opponent's to the total number of chips played, you win and collect all the chips played, plus two additional chips from your opponent. If the two cards are equally close to the total, whoever last took an action loses and whoever passed first wins. Play multiple rounds to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#229;&#186;&#149;&ldquo;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#226;&#128;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#226;&#128;&#165;&rdquo;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;!&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#188;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#168;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&ldquo;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#188;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#168;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#129;&rdquo;

You are an Elemental Trunk Man, a time-traveling agent, who unblocks treasure boxes collected over time and takes out treasures. With the help of the elemental spirits, we will unlock the seal of the treasure chest and aim to open more treasure chests than our rivals!&#10;&#10;We will start from the point where you can communicate with the four spirits of Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth. &#10;In order to open the sealed treasure chest, we communicate with the spirits to gain mana and unseal the treasure chest. You can earn points of contribution by the degree of contribution.&#10;&#10;There are two things you can do in your turn! &#10;-Summoning spirits (increases the spirits that can be communicated) &#10;-Unseal the seal of the treasure box (Communicates with the spirits, obtains mana and unseals the seal of the treasure box)&#10;&#10;The spirits are wooden tokens of the four elements. On your turn, you shake up your set and throw them. The pieces that land upright can be used to trigger your actions. The more tokens you collect, the better chance of success.&#10;&#10;There are some treasure chests where bonus points can be added to the contribution points by releasing the seal quickly, and by removing the final seal. It is important to have the bonus points at the end of the game and the timing of releasing it. However, if you do not summon the spirits, it will become difficult later.&#10;&#10;Summoning spirits requires a deck build idea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;how to combine the spirits. It's fun to think of your own combination. In addition, it may be important to change the combination depending on the situation of the treasure chest.&quot;&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;New sense game of &quot;token build&quot; x &quot;role action&quot; x &quot;placement&quot;! You are a treasure chest unlocker &quot;Elemental Trunk Man&quot;. With the help of spirits, unlock the seal of the treasure chest.&#10;&#10;The game starts with four spirits pieces of fire, water, earth, and wind. And, shake those spirit pieces like a dice every time. As a result, you can gain spirit power if the spirit piece is standing up. You use this spirit power to unseal the seal of the treasure chest.&#10;You can also increase spirits pieces by using spirit power. Create your own strategy by combining 11 kinds of spirit pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Adlerangriff is the German word meaning Attack of the Eagles, the assault on south-east England by The Luftwaffe which was to be undertaken prior to the invasion of the British Isles and this term was used by the Germans to define what the British referred to as The Battle of Britain.&#10;&#10;Whilst Fighter Command R.A.F was spread over airfields in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island, only those squadrons in the south-east would be able to interfere with an invasion which, it was expected, would take place along the south coast between Dover and Weymouth. The battle will, therefore, be fought over the area covered by No 11 Group. If the Luftwaffe can permanently destroy the Sector Stations and Airfields of No 11 Group, thus immobilizing the fighters that use them, the invasion can be undertaken.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Through factory labor a modern lifestyle was established. Now in the 21st century, humanity is again witnessing major technological innovation. Artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous driving ... These technologies are changing people's lives. Some have said that AI will overwhelm human intelligence. How does this technological &quot;SINGULARITY&quot; change many of the concepts that humanity has cultivated over a long history?&#10;&#10;In this game, players aim to bring business to prosperity during the 4th Industrial Revolution as a manager. The game progresses through development of AI technology while planning which plant to build and watching the market where players can freely trade. It is fun to wonder how to use the developed AI technology and make the management's own dreams come true.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user

The Emperor has chosen you to build perfectly suitable ponds, so the carps can reach their highest potential. To do so, you must assign each Koi colony its proper place.&#10;&#10;In each round, players have to cooperate assigning a different group of carps splitting the pond. It&rsquo;s important to optimise the area to shelter the most colonies.&#10;&#10;In turn you need to build the perfect home to the colony.&#10;&#10;First, determine the perfect pond rolling the 3 dice. These dice show you the exact number of nishikigoi you must have inside a pond area when it&rsquo;s closed.&#10;&#10;To shape the pond, each player must play a Pond card (placed partially other cards) in turn order until a pond area is completely (the wather lilies line is closed). To do so, the card can be partially placed over other cards in play (never underneath).&#10;&#10;When the pond is closed, if the exact number of nishikigoi of each colour matches the dice, remove 5 of the played cards and put them at the bottom of the deck. The rest are set aside to show you have built a perfect pond area.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cards have been played. There is no more space in the imperial pond and it&rsquo;s time to evaluate how well you have done.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players seek to reunite the Queen of Hearts, at one end of the deck, with her King, at the other, by eliminating all other cards.&#10;&#10;To set up a game, the King and Queen of Hearts are removed from a deck, which is then shuffled. Afterwards, the King is placed on the bottom and the Queen placed on top. Cards are dealt, one by one, from the top of the deck and played next to the Queen, forming a row that allows all cards to be seen at once.&#10;&#10;Cards can be removed one or two at a time, but only when they are bookended by two cards of either the same suit or rank. If all cards save the Queen and King are eliminated, the game is won; if cards remain and no further moves can be made, the game is lost.&#10;&#10;Strategy comes in the form of hand management, deciding which cards to eliminate and when. Immediately discarding cards whenever possible is likely to lead to a loss; rather, cards that can easily be eliminated later -- such as those of the same suit as the King and Queen -- are often better to keep, in case they can be paired up later with other cards to eliminate some stubborn holdouts. Success or failure often depends on which cards the player can manage to hold on to for later use.&#10;&#10;Royal Marriage can be played on a table or entirely in-hand. To play the latter, the King is placed on the top of the deck face-down, while the Queen is placed on top of the King face-up. Cards are then dealt from the bottom of the deck onto the Queen, and fanned out to show available moves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

To impress the judges, you'll gather gems to complete contracts for points and powers, and you'll vie over achievements which transform into trophies.&#10;&#10;By hiring the right combinations of miners and backing them with carefully managed resources and planning, you're certain to undermine your competition. But be careful - if you mine too aggressively, you'll earn fault from the supervisors, which carries steep fines now or deeper penalties if ignored. And if you or your competitors mine too greedily, the reinforcements in the mine will start to break - when a mine tile loses its last reinforcement, it caves in, taking miners with it.&#10;&#10;Combining resource management and efficiency planning with direct player interaction, Fault! is a truly unique hybrid of gaming styles. Whether you're skillfully navigating the maze of the mine to excavate carefully selected stones or wildly flinging dynamite and grabbing every exploded element, you're sure to unearth stories to remember.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The German player has the choice of sending a Panzer Army south as Hitler ordered historically, or keep them with AGC as the generals wanted in order to take Moscow.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 6/10&#10;&#10;SOLITAIRE: 6/10&#10;&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2, up to 6 players with AGN and AGS.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;DAMOS: Army Group South&quot; is game 3 of the Barbarossa trilogy of wargames that can be combined together as a mini-monster. Each game by itself is a straight forward operational simulation of each theater, and all 3 games share the exact same rules allowing for easy integration. Units are divisions for the Germans and Division to Army sized for the Russians.&#10;&#10;DAMOS is a brand new, unique take on operational scale WW22 combat. With almost 0 player downtime, DAMOS is highly interactive between possible reactions, combat postures, and other mechanics. DAMOS takes many well-known wargaming conventions and repackages them into an all-new take on the most familiar conflict in wargaming that force long-time grognards to rethink their normal instincts.&#10;&#10;Army Group South covers Von Rundstedt&rsquo;s extended trek towards the Caucasus. AGS had the largest theater of operations and the highest expectations placed upon them compared to the other Army groups. While assisted by the Hungarian and Romanian armies, the best executed armored breakthroughs only went so far once the fuel trucks could not keep up with the Panzers.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 6/10&#10;&#10;SOLITAIRE: 6/10&#10;&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2, up to 6 players with AGN and AGC.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1995 is the third iteration of our Procedural Combat Series and it examines a cold war gone hot during the Yugoslavian wars of succession. The combined might of a Serb dominated JNA and a weakened but still potent Russia move on the smaller republics in an attempt to establish A Serb dominated Yugoslavia giving Russia a foothold in NATO&rsquo;s backyard.&#10;&#10;PCS is an easy to learn, but difficult to master rules-system. Instead of Combat values, unit's are printed with a Unit Quality Rating and a Movement Allowance. Combat strength is determined randomly based on unit quality, and positioning before an attacking. The result is an original system which focuses like a laser on the unpredictability of cold war-era combat.&#10;&#10;The OOB includes a well-researched collection of available divisions and air assets. The Russian OOB is based off the militia which attacked Grozny in 1994. The JNA is accurately represented though assumed to be at full strength. Numerous other Balkan and NATO nations are represented. 1995 focuses more on maneuver and less on chrome as there are no special counters, but lots of units instead.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 7/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 9/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A few months [before June 2021,] we announced that we would be discontinuing both 1968 &amp; 1987.&#10;&#10;These games were designed when I first started the company and frankly, I was in a rush to put out a catalog. Unfortunately I don't think either of these games are up to the quality I want to maintain with CSL so both will no longer be available on our catalog.&#10;&#10;If you purchased 1968 and/or 1987, I will provide you with a 20$ discount toward your next purchase.&#10;&#10;Finally, I apologize that these games ended up being broken.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The 4th title in the Procedural Combat Series (PCS) allows players to recreate the infamous Vietnamese Tet Offensive across Vietnam. PCS is uniquely suited to simulate the conflict given the variable combat strength system being an elegant way of representing asymmetric and conventional warfare on a number of levels.&#10;&#10;1968 is arguably the first game in the series to give a player a significant chance of winning through an Automatic Victory. The Vietnamese player is incentivized to string a series of rope-a-dope attacks together forcing the American player to constantly react or recover instead of operating offensively. The American player while having advanced weaponry, fantastic air power, and well-trained units, they lack strategic objectivity making it more difficult to turn success into political consequences/VP.&#10;&#10;Random events can play a key role in changing the pacing of the game; like ending a turn prematurely, allowing several spent units to refresh or even exchange combat chits. The Vietnamese player receives material support through the USSR and nuances regarding supply/logistics allow the Vietnamese player a level of strategic and operational flexibility unavailable to the American units, at the exchange of raw power.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 7/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 9/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players are working in a company which is in trouble, and they fear the next round of layoffs. To increase their chances to keep their job, they start sabotaging their coworkers' health by inviting them to a nearby &quot;boteco&quot;, a kind of pub with disgusting food and questionable cleaning. By stuffing their beloved colleagues with horrible food, they try to damage their organs. This is done by playing food cards on them. &#10;Players get points for the food they eat, but if they eat too much, they might die. When the first player has died, the player with most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
