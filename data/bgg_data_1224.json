The rules recommend using one deck with two or three players and two with more, but experienced players may always use two decks.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 9 or 12 cards (12 being more challenging) and attempts to make sets of three cards (trios) which are consecutive multiples of the same number, e.g. 2-4-6 or 55-66-77. This is done via standard Rummy-style play - a player draws the top card of the deck or discard pile and then discards a card. If a joker is used in a trio a player holding the card it is representing may also swap that for the joker.&#10;&#10;Completed trios are placed face-up on the table. Players may lay off cards on any trio to form longer sequences, and may also form new trios in different directions.&#10;&#10;",

This curse uses the new &quot;crystal Discovery cards&quot; instead of the normal discovery cards to offer fresh challenges. You discover these new cards and move forward until no crystal discovery cards are available, then the game ends. Now it's time to see whether you've broken the curse or not...&#10;&#10;&bull; Prodigy mode: In this game mode, your explorers are incredibly talented, so you start with five additional action cards. This not only increases your stack, but allows you to take further actions. The powerful cards show multiple achievements, key words, and skills to strengthen your powers, to make actions easier, to activate character skills, and to protect you!&#10;&#10;&bull; Immortal Mode: Not everyone can survive, and some get queasy when they see the rapidly shrinking stack of action cards. If you are one of them, this mode is for you!&#10;&#10;How does it work? Very simple: Put the medallion in your backpack at the start of the adventure, and if you fail due to an unexpected turn of fate, you only have to wait for the magic. You're already in the middle of an adventure again, but maybe not quite as you imagined it... The medallion should not be misused as eternal life has a high price. How high? Well, you have to find out for yourself. All you have to do is die!&#10;&#10;&bull; &quot;There is a traitor among us!&quot; Mode: Before the start of the game, randomly draw one of the seven fate cards and look at them in secret. Four of them are &quot;Don't trust anyone!&quot; cards and have no effect for the time being. The other three, however, are &quot;The Continent Demands a Victim!&quot; cards that give you only two options: murder an explorer at the best possible time, or die...in a cruel way!&#10;&#10;And as if that weren't enough, the impact of each fate card is different, so you never know what to expect when you meet your friends &mdash; or your victims.&#10;&#10;You do not need this expansion if you already have the What Goes Up, Must Come Down collector's edition (white box) from the Kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;",

It's a crazy fun game that involves some strategy, a little luck and an uncanny ability to dodge getting hit with house shoes, beach sandals, and chanclas.&#10;&#10;How to play: Put the slippers on the table and deal 7 cards to each player. Set the deck on the table face-down to be the draw pile, and turn over the top card to start the discard pile. Take turns putting matching chore cards down on the discard pile. You can match on chore or color. Special action cards match every color. When an Angry Mom card is played, anyone can grab a slipper and throw it at someone else; the person hit has to pick up 5 cards from the draw pile. The first person with no cards left in their hand is the winner; or you can play until only one person is left.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Early August 1870. The Prussian Chancellor Bismarck has accomplished a diplomatic master stroke thanks to the Ems Dispatch: France has just declared war on Prussia. Prussia was able to gather all of the German states around it while Napoleon IIIs empire remains alone with no nation willing to support the perceived aggressor.&#10;&#10;In Paris, the belligerent frenzy has brought the population to the boiling point and they already see themselves at Berlin. France claims to have the better army. Didn&rsquo;t the war minister Marshal Leboeuf declare his unequivocal assurance to Adolphe Thiers, himself lacking in confidence as to the country&rsquo;s preparation : &laquo; We are prepared and extremely prepared. If the war were to last two years, our soldiers would not lack for a single gaiter button&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The mobilisation is launched and the troops rush toward their concentration point on the border. But apathy meets with incompetence : plans that have been prepared for a long time are modified several times, the mess in the stations is indescribable. In addition, this is an incomplete army led by superior officers who do not know their troops well and who position themselves to lead an offensive without a plan but an offensive that has been rendered obligatory by popular demand.&#10;&#10;On the other side, the Prussian state has learned from the experience of its two previous campaigns: the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864 and especially the Seven Weeks War against Austria in 1866. The mobilisation then the concentration proceed like clockwork. The long-established plans and orders are followed to the letter. The invasion may begin as planned.&#10;&#10;&#10;In &quot;La Guerre de 1870&quot;, an evolution of The Marshals series for the campaigns of the 2nd Empire, will you, as Napol&eacute;on III, finally become your uncle&rsquo;s worthy military heir by saving your country from the Prussian enemy? As von Moltke, will you be able to wisely manoeuvre your divisions to drive the French to a decisive battle to occur where and when you decide ?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;This wargame can be linked with &quot;Sedan 1870&quot; to play the full Campaign of the Imperial War since the beginning of the war until the final decisive battle of Sedan.(https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/306065/sedan-1870)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Complexity : 7/10&#10;     Solo playability : 6/10&#10;     One turn = 1 day&#10;     One counter = 1 division (and 1 SP = 2000 men, 1000 cavaliers or 2 batteries)&#10;     Scale : 10 km between 2 zones&#10;&#10;&#10;A second great game based on the same system deals with the italian campaign of 1859 and 1866 : &quot;les campagnes d'Italie 1859-1866&quot; (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/375547/les-campagnes-ditalie-1859-1866)&#10;&#10;",

She was arguably the most famous of these ships due to her role in Operation Chariot in 1942.&#10;&#10;Though she saw a brief service with the Royal Netherlands Navy, her most famed action was that against the dry dock of St Nazaire. This facility was the World&rsquo;s largest dry-dock, and provided a site of vital strategic interest to both Allies and Axis, offering a gateway to the Atlantic and large enough to house the mighty Tirpitz and Bismarck. Should they have been unleashed upon Atlantic convoy shipping, the war effort will have suffered incredibly.&#10;&#10;With the dock well into an estuary and capital ship involvement an impossibility, a daring plan was concocted. HMS Campbeltown would be disguised as a German ship and, along with a flotilla, would be laden with explosives and used as a ram against the dock gates. Simultaneously, the flotilla would disgorge their loads of British Commandos to sow chaos amongst the Kriegsmarine defenders. The vessels and their payloads of munitions and men were seen as expendable, such was the critical nature of this mission.&#10;&#10;Though both Allied and Axis losses were heavy the mission was a complete success &ndash; with the dry-dock knocked out of action for the duration of the war, and the threat of the Tirpitz sailing the Atlantic never materializing.&#10;&#10;Contains 1 ship. Within the pages of Close Quarters! the latest supplement for Cruel Seas, you&rsquo;ll find rules and a scenario for re-enacting the daring St Nazaire raid on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To win, all apprentices must graduate to become masters by casting spells and gaining power in each of five different magic disciplines.  However, apprentices are inexperienced and foolhardy with spells, casting uncanny incantations that tend to do more harm than good.  If any player dies, all players lose. &#10; Therefore, masters will try and protect themselves and others by countering incoming spells and planning powerful sorcery spells.  Don't forget that so much spell power in one place can cause horrible electrical storms, so strategize as a group to win as quickly and efficiently as possible!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

And welcome to our brand new cooking show &mdash; Ninja Chef: The place where true masters of nunchucks and razor claws compete against the great and glorious Octo Zamzey for the title of &quot;The Best Rice &amp; Sushi Chef!&quot; The drama is hotter than wasabi, the plot rapid as a flying onigiri! Sounds intriguing, huh? Then let&rsquo;s roll it!&#10;&#10;In the family board game Ninja Chef players participate in a cooking show not as regular folks, but as animal ninjas! There's more: the animals in the game are not just random characters, but the very last of their species in Japan. At Cosmodrome Games, we appreciate the diversity and fragility of nature, so we decided to create a special board game that will help you not only enjoy your time with family and friends, but will also tell a story about unique and endangered species.&#10;&#10;How does it all start? The show host and main jury is the famously beloved Octo Zamzey. He&rsquo;s become extremely tired of untalented participants and decided to get the fastest, bravest, and most nimble creatures in the whole universe. You might think at first that it&rsquo;s all about ninja turtles, but nope, that&rsquo;s a completely different story. Octo Zamzey called for Japanese ninjas! Why them? It&rsquo;s simple: our heroes share not only the ninja&rsquo;s path but also a hobby&mdash;they love to cook!&#10;&#10;Octo Zamzey is super hot-tempured and an explosive slime ball at the same time (he&rsquo;s an octopus, duh!). It gets really spicy in the kitchen when he&rsquo;s angry. And, Octo is up to no good and has an axe to grind with the ninjas. His tentacles are always aiming to strike their heads and miso-souped their plans!&#10;&#10;Move around the kitchen and collect the essential ingredients you need to cook up a fantastic presentation. Roll out your creation to the jury so they can taste your masterpiece&mdash;and select the winner!&#10;&#10;In this game, you need to escape Zamzey&rsquo;s wrath while competing with the other players!  Move around the kitchen and collect the essential ingredients you need to cook up a fantastic presentation. Roll out your creation to the jury so they can taste your masterpiece&mdash;and select the winner! For greater variety, the game has several modes&mdash;just choose yours:&#10;&#10;     Yakitori duels: Play in teams of 1-3 people with friends and family.&#10;     Single Taiyaki: Solo mode to fight alone against Octo.&#10;     Together we are strong as sashimi: Fight together as a team against Octo Zamzey.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each mode, use the special abilities of each ninja and don&rsquo;t forget about basic skills like kicking ingredients above the tables. And be careful! The kitchen floor is full of obstacles that can influence the cooking process.&#10;&#10;Ninja Chef will surprise you with its unique mechanic of cooperative worker-movement that allows you to make splendid combos by interacting with the other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then, from the darkness they come &ndash; the skaven have arrived to blight the Mortal Realms!&#10;&#10;Chaos Battletome: Skaven is your guide to the evil ratmen who gnaw at the very fabric of reality. Serving the Chaos deity known as the Great Horned Rat, these sinister creatures seek to undermine the Mortal Realms, conquering with raw cunning, overwhelming numbers, and strange inventions.&#10;&#10;In this 128-page hardback battletome, you'll learn about the history of the Skaven in the Mortal Realms &ndash; from their origins in Blight City to their role in the Soul Wars, all illustrated with stunning and evocative art. You'll also find lore on their many clans and the brutal inner workings of skaven society. The battletome goes on to cover how the skaventide goes to war, showcased by several warscroll battalions, and all the warscrolls needed to field a force of ratmen on the tabletop. You&rsquo;ll be able to mix-and-match a variety of skaven clans to build a killer army to suit your tastes &ndash; slaying your enemies with endless hordes of Clanrats, blasting them apart with the terrible technology of the warp lighting-wielding Stormfiends, and unleashing vile monsters of arcane science like the Hell Pit Abominations. All are goaded into battle by the scheming, backstabbing members of the Masterclan!&#10;&#10;Battletome: Skaven lets you customise the leaders of the skaven with a selection of warpstone-infused artefacts and cunning sorceries. Their spells come from the Lore of Ruin, a collection of sinister curses, and the Lore of Warpvolt Galvanism, arcane arts that enhance Skyre units and incinerate your foes. The book is also a great resource for collectors, packed with examples of different colour schemes to inspire your own projects, as well as painting tips. The section on Path to Glory rules and a pair of bespoke missions are great for organising and playing your first games with this insidious army.&#10;&#10;This book contains:&#10;&#10;     Allegiance abilities for skaven, including a variety of battle traits &ndash; 6 separate types of artefacts of power and 6 types of command traits&#10;     2 spell lores &ndash; the Lore of Ruin (for use by Grey Seers) and Lore of Warpvolt Galvanism (for use by Clans Skryre Wizards)&#10;     2 battleplans&#10;     Path to Glory rules for creating a skaven warband for Path to Glory, including Champion and Followers Rewards Tables&#10;     8 warscroll battalions&#10;     40 warscrolls, 3 endless spell warscrolls and a warscroll for the Gnawhole scenery piece.&#10;     Pitched battle profiles for all units and Endless Spells featured in this battletome&#10;&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re starting a new skaven army or bringing your classic collection into the Mortal Realms, this battletome is your essential companion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is achieved by landing on the appropriate space and drawing cards, with the goal being to create a full set of items in the same colour. They can also land on someone else to pinch the piece they need. On top of that, they'll also need to find an invitation- best beware of the blanks!&#10;&#10;Chance cards add a twist to proceedings, with some helping and some hindering progress. A card could launch you just where you need to go to secure that last item, or they could make you wear the dreaded &quot;silly hat&quot;, which prevents you from picking up any items at all.&#10;&#10;Candles and Cakes is a simple game which relies more on chance than strategy, but which has colourful graphics, a novel jigsaw-style board, and scope for up to 8 players.

Each nation has its own skills which greatly influence the game and from which tactical strategies can be developed.&#10;&#10;Complete secret missions to get victory points and decide the game for you. But beware! The magic potion will also surprise you in the game and bring you benefits or maybe steal your points. With sesterces you can buy new missions and units that strengthen you in the game and bring you closer to your goal of becoming the ruler of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;So, will you be able to use your skills victoriously or will another leader emerge as a glorious winner?&#10;&#10;Get ready and brace yourself for the fight of a lifetime. With 2-5 players, ages 13 and up, you can muster your troops and join the defence of the conquests of Gaul or Caesar. You can choose from 2 different game modes. Distribute area cards evenly among all players and place your warriors on the field according to your cards. On your turn, you can attack neighbouring areas and, thanks to the various ports, even occupy coastal areas by sea. Roll the black dice to attack your opponents and use the red dice to defend yourself. If you manage to lead your attack profitably with the highest number of eyes, you can decide whether you want to keep fighting until you've taken out all enemy warriors or if you want to retreat first. This way, try to control as many areas as possible. 6 regions of different colours with a total of 45 areas must be conquered. Gaul with the largest land ownership wins the game. Potion Cards and Reinforcements provide special fun.&#10;&#10;So arm your troops and go with RISK Asterix in the battle for the Roman Empire and become a respected leader.&#10;&#10;",

One grid is used to track one's own plays and the other the opponent's plays.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins each player places three forts - 3x3 squares - on their grid. The forts cannot touch at all, even at the corners.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of stating an outside square to start at and a direction to cross the grid in (this may be diagonal). Every space in this line is hit and the target player states how many of their forts were hit.&#10;&#10;When a player thinks they know the locations of the opposing forts they announce this as their turn: if they can correctly name the center squares of the forts they win, otherwise they lose.&#10;&#10;",

A true tale of childhood and cowardice, presented as a dice-rolling geometric puzzle with various scenarios.&#10;&#10;A pen/pencil and four six-sided dice are required.

If you make it to 6am without letting your fear build up, you have outwitted the Grue and can tally your score.&#10;&#10;You are encouraged to play each scenario and aim to achieve the highest medal scores.

(The map is divided into six colored regions.) The player holding the foreign agent card may lie.&#10;&#10;There are a few airports on the board so to move more quickly an agent may move to one and then move along the arrows to get to another airport.&#10;&#10;There are at most 24 rounds in the game; after each round a clock hand is moved. Where the clock hand is determines the allowed moves, e.g. in the early hours only specific questions may be asked, near the end the foreign agent may not lie, etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game combines scientific and adventurous aspects. The game idea is based on the famous thought experiment formulated by the Austrian theoretical physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger. The experiment describes a cat that turns out to be both alive and dead due to circumstances and formalism of quantum mechanics. This unusual state makes the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat widely popular in contemporary mainstream culture.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to save the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat from inhumane experiments. Notwithstanding the long and complicated story of the cat, the basic rules are simple enough to understand by every person, even if he or she is unfamiliar with the paradox of the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. Nonetheless, science enthusiasts will definitely notice that the rules contain multiple allusions to the quantum mechanical world view.&#10;&#10;The game is represented as a labyrinth with the changing structure - the Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The winner is the player who managed to find the Schrodinger's cat in the labyrinth and led it to his starting point. The distinctive feature of the game is that all players can build and change the structure of the labyrinth the way they want. Specially elaborated system of action cards used on each player's turn is also of interest. Despite the randomness factor during a turn, it allows players to develop a unique long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;The labyrinth consists of 19 wooden hexagonal elements - the halls of Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The halls contain passageways connecting their different sides. At the beginning of the game, all halls are turned upside down and are not visible to players. During his turn, each player can move around the castle, gradually opening the halls and joining the passages as it suits him. However, as soon as a player leaves any hall, this hall is turned over, and the next player who comes to this hall will be able to open it in a convenient way.&#10;&#10;The turns are made by playing action cards (3 cards per turn). These cards allow you to move around the castle, prevent the empty halls from closing, rotate open halls and rearrange closed ones, open locked doors, and arrange baits for Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. At the end of the turn, the player collects up to 3 new cards. The game does not contain direct conflict between players, all interactions take place through the restructuring of a common labyrinth. Victory conditions depend on whether Schr&ouml;dinger's cat is alive or dead, this is also decided by the players during the game.&#10;&#10;The game has a colourful minimalistic design. The game board is made of embossed wooden elements. Game elements do not contain any text - all the necessary information is contained in the form of images. The combination of simple rules and richness of game situations resembles chess, however, unlike the latter, the game contains a significant role of chance in the gameplay.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Be careful where your opponent is, he can use one of his warriors to knock one of your warriors off the field.   The team that is able to push a colored boulder into their goal will earn the point value of that boulder.

Players each have a set of 5 dice, and the innovative combat system uses concealed dice rolls as the players attempt to outscore their opponents using holds and re-rolls based on the gladiator&rsquo;s skill level. The game covers all the known gladiator types who fought each other from the simple secutor with a shield to gladiators with whips and lassos. Record keeping is simple and kept to a minimum. The rules include a straight forward career progression system for both individual gladiators or training schools. Ideal for a quick game in an evening or a prolonged campaign over several meetings. As with all &quot;Wargaming for Grown Ups&quot; rules they include a comprehensive Quick Reference Sheet on the back cover.&#10;&#10;Includes full list of gladiator types and details, player records sheets and proforma arena grids.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each horse has several possible starting positions (determined by the bookmaker) and each has a different number of spaces in its lane.&#10;&#10;After odds are set for a race two dice are thrown and the horse corresponding to the higher die is moved one space, or two if doubles are rolled. The horses with higher numbers have more spaces to cover.&#10;&#10;At any given time one player is the bookmaker. Before each race they set the odds, which can be 4-1 for all horses or 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 6-1 assigned as they wish. They also choose where the horses start - the normal start, the handicap start behind this, or even ahead of the normal start. The other players then bet and after the race is over bets are paid off.&#10;&#10;",

The blue cards and matching black cards are placed face-up on top of these as the dealer chooses.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of picking up a stack of cards, revealing them, and then placing them on successive stacks in clockwise order. If a stack has just one or two cards in it the top card can be captured by placing a card of the same rank on it. There are a few additional rules, e.g. when capturing counterclockwise moves may be made.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round captured cards are scored; different suits score differently, e.g. the blue cards are 10 points each, black cards (the longest suit) score only for the player with the most, red cards score for sequences, etc.&#10;&#10;Four players play in partnerships; while the rules technically allow for play by four or five individuals, only three play at a time.&#10;&#10;Rules are provided to allow play with a standard deck.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, soon after take-off, the plane engine gives out and the pilot is forced to make an emergency landing in the middle of the jungle. Now, stranded in the jungle how will you &ndash; and your companions who you don&rsquo;t know &ndash; survive and escape? Can you trust them? Will you work together or splinter off on your own? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;In Amazon Peril, you and your companions will begin the game, lost somewhere in the jungle and you will have to use your skills to explore, survive and escape the jungle by finding the airstrip you left from. Each round is a day; you&rsquo;ll make plans in the morning, in the afternoon you&rsquo;ll execute them and in the evening you&rsquo;ll assess your thirst, hunger and health and prepare for the next day.&#10;&#10;Each morning, choose from these core actions: camping for the day (where you try to rest up and heal), scouting (where you&rsquo;ll cautiously explore the jungle around you) and exploring (where you&rsquo;ll move through the jungle, placing and revealing new tiles that can lead to many dangerous and exciting outcomes; maybe you&rsquo;ll stumble across an indigenous tribe, find ancient ruins or encounter dangerous wildlife).&#10;&#10;You may choose to go it alone for riskier encounters but more rewards; or journey in groups to lessen the risk but split the rewards. But be careful; desperate circumstances can bring out the worst in people. You might be tempted to steal supplies from your companions at night or they might steal from you!&#10;&#10;As you journey through the jungle, you can gain or lose renown points for the actions you take and the discoveries you make. It isn&rsquo;t just about survival; those who survive will have tales to tell and deeds to boast of - and whomever has the most renown points when the airstrip is finally revealed will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battleground Brawl is a tabletop, platform fighting game that pits fighters (players) against each other in an attempt to either deplete the opponents health, or knock them off of the play area, in order to score points.&#10;&#10;The play area consists of a board with a grid. This grid is the guide for where platforms and players can be placed. To set up the game, players agree on the placement of the platform pieces and then choose where to place their fighters. For round 1, the player with the lowest health starts, and each subsequent round the &quot;first player&quot; moves clockwise. Each round, players must first take it in turns, going clockwise from the &quot;first player&quot;, to move their fighters according to their movement field. If a player moves adjacent to another player, then that player is not allowed to move in this turn, as they are deemed to be engaged in battle.&#10;&#10;Once all players that can move, have moved, then the combat phase begins. Each player plays a card face-down from their hand and chooses a target opponent. A hand consists of 5 cards drawn from that players deck. A deck consists of a number of cards available to each fighter.&#10;&#10;Once every player has played a card face down and declared a target, flip the cards and resolve them in the same order as movement in that round. Some cards may be played out of order, as a reaction to other cards, for example: If Player 1 targets Player 4 with an attack card, but Player 4 played a dodge card, then Player 4 resolves this action before Players 2 and 3. If Player 2 (and/or 3) also targeted Player 4, they target that players previous location and therefore Player 4 dodges all attacks simultaneously, they do not target the new location.&#10;&#10;Once all actions have been resolved and health deducted/added where appropriate, the &quot;first player&quot; switches clockwise and the next round begins. Discard previously played cards and draw your hand back up to 5 cards. Declare your movement (if applicable), then your targets, then play your next card, and repeat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The mere mention of his name is enough to give even the most hardened criminals pause.&#10;&#10;Dredd has been appointed a temporary member of the Council of Five on several occasions. However, he is only truly content when patrolling the streets dispensing the law directly and his well-known dislike of bureaucracy keeps him well away from the Hall of Justice.&#10;&#10;If it is true that a man can be measured by the quality of his enemies then Dredd will take some beating. Over the years, he has clashed with mad Chief Judges, transdimensional denizens of Deadworld, super agents of the Sov Bloc, necromancers and powerful mutant pre-cogs. Yet it&rsquo;s probably safe to say that from Dredd&rsquo;s perspective bringing one of these individuals to justice is no more important than the prosecution of a citizen for littering or a juve for spraying graffiti on a wall. Everyone is equal in the eyes of the law!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some end up on the streets disenchanted and bitter at what might have been whilst for many Street Judges Resyk will be their final destination.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
