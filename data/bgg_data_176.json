    "Description": "Les Guerres de Bourgogne 1474-1477 (Wars of Burgundy) is a historical simulation from October 1474 to January 1477. One player plays the role of the Burgundian armies and their allies (Duchy of Savoy and Italian states), led by the famous Duke Charles the Bold, and the other player is in command of the Swiss Confederacy and its allies (Duchy of Lorraine and German states). The objectives are to take control of the Savoy and Lorraine territories, win pitched battles or major sieges, and neutralise the opponent's allies.&#10;&#10;This is both a strategic &amp; tactical game with armies and garrisons evolving on the main strategic map and units fighting on a tactical map featuring a typical XVth century battleground. Units are men-at-arms, pikes, bowmen, crossbowmen, halberdiers, hangunners, and early cannons, from 2,000 men at full strength, 1,000 horsemen or 200 cannons of all calibers. The &quot;chrome&quot; of that period is added with tactical chits (charge, harassment shots, raining arrows, ditch, fence, clash of pikes, cannon battery) and events such as rain, snow, minor ally, no fight or betrayal, no wing deployment. Optional rule includes a possible intervention of the French kingdom to support one side or the other. You will be able to fight the famous battles of Hericourt (1474), Grandson &amp; Morat (1476), and Nancy (1477), the latter involving a fatal outcome for Charles the Bold.&#10;&#10;The complete sequence of a turn:&#10;I/ Burgundy&#10;1) Reinforcement, replacement&#10;2) strategic move&#10;3) attrition phase&#10;4) combat phase (battles &amp; sieges)&#10;II/ Swiss Confederacy&#10;Same sequence&#10;III/ Diplomatic phase&#10;check for victory&#10;&#10;The game includes 108 die-cut counters, an A3 size strategic and an A5 size tactical map. One 6 sided die is necessary.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Swamped is a semi-cooperative game of adventure, peril and treasure in which players move through a swamp searching for a rare herb that can cure diseases. Each player takes a turn steering the boat to find the herb. But the swamp has many other treasures as well, so players may try to steer the boat away from its intended goal to increase their own wealth.&#10;&#10;Swamped is a game for 2-4 adventurers that plays in about 30 minutes and expands the vibrant world of Antidote. In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:&#10;&#10;1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.&#10;&#10;2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!&#10;&#10;3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.&#10;&#10;4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!&#10;&#10;5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.&#10;&#10;",

This aim of the design is ease of play while preserving a historical feel. Periods from WWI, WWII, Cold War, up to contemporary are covered. Each tank model represents one single tank. Each Infantry stand represents a fire teams of 3 to 6, centered around the primary weapon (such as an LMG or AT rocket) or the overall weapon type (such as automatic rifles or SMGs).&#10;&#10;With a module system (aka 'Drop-ins'), the rules allow players to decide how simple or how sophisticated they want the game to be. Some of the modules are Infantry, Artillery, Air Power, and other special equipments or terrain rules.&#10;&#10;The core rules contain only 'elementary' equipments for each of the periods. For example, only Germany, the USSR, and the US are represented in the WWII section. And only stats for 18 pieces of German equipment are covered, and the only tanks found (for the German) are Panther and Tiger. Players must be prepared to purchase additional data books or create their own stats.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Miniature armies - carefully painted and labeled with unit names, strengths, and abilities - have been found in Egyptian tombs, suggesting that &quot;wargaming&quot; goes back a long time.&#10;&#10;Of those miniature armies, no units take more precedence than the chariots - the &quot;panzers&quot; of their day. Keep in mind that horses of this period were too small to &quot;ride&quot; with a man on their back in a &quot;cavalry&quot; way. Only chariots offered a battle platform faster than sandals, and provided the &quot;shock troops&quot; of their day and a platform to designate the aristocracy and elite peoples. Alexander and the Roman legions might sneeze at chariot power... but not for another 900 years!&#10;&#10;Kadesh must be the chariot battle of all time. Sources conflict and disagree, but there may have been as many as 5000 chariots in this twisted, confused, and bloody battle, fought to determine the borders between Egypt and the Hittite confederacy...&#10;&#10;As an early example of &quot;spin,&quot; Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II claimed a tremendous victory and the total vanquishing of the Hittite army... although he also signed a peace treaty that left the disputed city of Kadesh in the hands of the Hittites and never returned. Hmm. (A later and more formal treaty between Ramses and the next Hittite king is reproduced on the walls of the United Nations, as one of the first recorded international peace treaties. Ramses did not get Kadesh with that one either.)&#10;&#10;Now you can take the reins and lead your lines/lions into battle. Day of the Chariot: Kadesh offers a classic design by Gene Dickens fully updated into a tactical view of one of the most-discussed battles of middle eastern history, with 320 double-sided counters, 30 minute turns, and everything you need to play a system emphasizing command control and flexibility (or the lack thereof). Three distinct scenarios provide the battle that did happen (according to Ramses), the battle that both sides had &quot;prearranged&quot; to happen, and the smaller, more confused battle that historians think actually did happen. (You may be surprised how different the &quot;same&quot; battle can be!)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players win points by being the first to correctly identify how the four numbers on the card can be manipulated using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division to arrive at the number 24.  Cards come in three levels of difficulty, with the easy cards being worth 1 point, medium cards worth 2 points, and hard cards worth 3 points.  Comes with &quot;puzzle sleeves&quot; that introduce the idea of variables (basic algebra) by covering up one of the numbers and making it &quot;wild&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the Dutch countries of Europe this game was introduced by putting them on the back of Flippos (which are caps with the Looney Tunes and Chester Cheetos on them). On the back of the Flippos with numbers 291 t/m 305 this game could be found, after which it became very popular in those countries. This made the sellings of the 24 Game rise. Strange enough this was only for a short term, while the game was thought to be associated with those Flippos.&#10;&#10;",

Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds, and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.&#10;&#10;Although Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools, and even favors &mdash; if there is truly honor among chemists!&#10;&#10;In the ten years since Compounded debuted, designer Darrell Louder and publisher Greater Than Games have developed and refined the design to streamline gameplay, increase player interaction, and include more real-world facts. Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition is a game about scientists grappling for recognition on the edge of known chemistry and getting credit for their discoveries, all while competing for limited resources and striking deals with the competition to ensure their work gets done.&#10;&#10;Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition features new compounds, new tool tiles and rules, revised lab fire interaction, redesigned lab benches, and more. Everything in this new build of Compounded has been tweaked in some way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spell Saga is a unique story-driven solitaire card game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world of fantasy. It contains themes of loss, identity &amp; purpose.&#10;&#10;While tactical thinking and no small amount of skill are needed to advance through the game, Spell Saga encourage its players to explore, rather than win. In this manner, the game is meant to be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;The major plot of Spell Saga is always the same, but the path to find it is up to you.&#10;&#10;The main story of Spell Saga is told in three acts, with each act split into a deck of cards. The story involves The Last Minstrel, who is searching the world for answers about how the world ended. Deck One ~ The Highlands serves as the Base Set of the game. The rest of the story is told through a limited number of expansions. These include Deck Two ~ The Forest &amp; Deck Three ~ The Caves.&#10;&#10;Advanced players will find a challenge with  ~ The Prelude ~ (an optional standalone beginning to the game) and  ~ The Endlude ~ (accessible only to those who have completed Decks 1 - 3).&#10;&#10;For Players craving even more mechanics, dynamics and lore, the optional Interludes (Decks 1.5 &amp; 1.2) will be released this year.&#10;&#10;Spell Saga is available in several languages, in both PnP files &amp; limited runs of physical editions.

On a turn, a player rolls the dice. The color result indicates the farm they should visit in this turn.

If they fail, the animal remains in the center of the table and the food flips back down.&#10;If the dice roll shows the wild card, the player can visit any farm they want.&#10;&#10;When one type of animal runs out from the center of the table, a player can still take the food from a farm to feed their own animals. If one type of animals runs out and player doesn't have this species, they can steal another's player animal in order to feed it, so they take the food from the farm and the stolen animal, which is placed in their game area. A hungry wolf also prowls among the farms, and if you run into the wolf, it steals your food.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when food runs out at one farm, then the player with the most food wins. In case of tie, the winner will be whoever has the greatest variety of animals.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher (Spanish):&#10;&#10;En Zampa la granja, los jugadores competiten por ser los mejores granjeros.

    "Description": "Before tomorrow evening, that army will be mine.&#10;&#10;So claimed Napoleon Bonaparte to his staff on the night of December 1, 1805, as he watched the Austro-Russian Allied army settle into its positions near Austerlitz for the battle that was certain to come the next morning. It was not an idle boast.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.&#10;&#10;The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...&#10;&#10;&#10;     A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen. &#10;     A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge. &#10;     Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves. &#10;     Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics. &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 150 yards / 137 meters&#10;Units: infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, when a player has a set of one card in each color, they score a &quot;pass pass&quot;.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the player with the most points wins &mdash; except that if a player scores three pass passes, they win the game immediately.&#10;&#10;",

Those characters often take the human form with wings and we call them Guardian Angels or RAGAMI.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player will play the role of a RAGAMI, winged human form, that travels around inside a city - the board. In this city, there are always people with problems, with their own internal conflicts, that need your help. There are also holy men and demons that can help or oppose to solving these conflicts.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible number of Virtue Points (VP). There are several ways to get VP, and consequently there are several strategies one can follow to win the game: solve conflicts, cause demons to disappear, help other RAGAMI, to be the RAGAMI who has solved the highest number of conflicts, etc.&#10;&#10;But helping people to solve their conflicts is what worths more VPs, and for this you need to have Points of Strength. As many as the strength of the conflict you're trying to solve, which can go from 1 to 6. There are several ways to get Points of Strength: white cubes, cards, holy men, the help of another RAGAMI, or a die.&#10;&#10;There are Action Dies (which allow to execute a certain number of actions, and it's placement will be made by the last player in the turn order) and there are Action Cards (that may be acquired during the game). In his play, Player can do one of the following actions: move his RAGAMI, move the holy men and the demons, pick cards or solve conflicts.&#10;&#10;Game ends in the turn when the places of conflicts ends or when a player hit's the 30 points score mark.&#10;&#10;Game to 2 to 4 players, 10 years up, 60 - 90 min.&#10;&#10;",

This sun-baked fishing community has a rich history of independence, commerce, and competition.&#10; Every September, in order to determine the fishing rights for the following fishing season, the gozzi (typical Ligurian fishing boats) of the four districts of Burgu, Ciassa, M&agrave;ina and Portellu run a regatta along a path of 1,600 meters, on fractions of 400 meters between the bouys.&#10;&#10;Not satisfied with this single form of competition, the merchant families of each district compete with each other to build tall red-brick towers as a display of their wealth.&#10;&#10;Their edifices to success give the town of Noli its distinctive look, though no merchant tower can hope to match the proud castle atop Monte Ursino, whose constant vigilance and defensive walls protect Noli from the raids of the Saracens and the assaults of envious neighbouring towns!&#10;&#10;Each game follows a series of rounds, in which players will secretly bid on four actions using coins. The player who bids highest in each action gains a bonus or gets one step closer to victory by building a floor of their tower.&#10;&#10;Between each bidding session players frantically roll dice in real time to simulate the famous Regata-dei-Reoni. The winner of the race gets to fish at the best spots, drawing from the best deck of fish cards, whereas other players must draw from worse decks with less fish. These cards can also have events such as &quot;saracens attack!&quot; and &quot;Storm!&quot; which shake up the game and set players back.&#10;&#10;If a player manages to build 6 tower floors, or have the most tower floors at the end of the game, they win!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Deal each player a turn order card at random, then place three bonus cards on the table, whether randomly or by choice.&#10;&#10;In each of the ten rounds, fill all market tiles by drawing three blocks at a time from the bag. Blocks come in five colors. All players simultaneously choose and reveal a card showing a market tile. If all players chose different market tiles, everyone takes the blocks from their chosen tile; if not, the tied player with the lowest turn order card takes their chosen blocks, while other tied players choose from what's left unclaimed, after which players exchange turn order cards.&#10;&#10;Use the blocks to create a pyramid bit by bit. All blocks must touch one another as you build. The bottom layer of the pyramid will be four blocks wide and long, and once you have four blocks in a 2x2 arrangement, you can place a block on top of these four blocks &mdash; but only if it's touching a block of the same color, whether below it or next to it. If you can't place a block, you must discard it. If you don't discard anything, you'll end up with a four-level pyramid of thirty blocks.&#10;&#10;At game's end, you score points for the largest visible group in your pyramid of each color. (Some blocks might be hidden, and they don't score.) In addition, for each bonus card that you satisfy &mdash; for example, having the most yellow blocks, having all five colors visible on the second layer of your pyramid, having the second largest group of blocks regardless of color &mdash; you score 5 points. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The map extends from Korea and Manchuria in the north to Indonesia in the south, to the Ganges River delta and Mongolia on the west. Each game turn represents three months. Units of maneuver are corps, armies, divisions and brigades, and they&rsquo;re presented in the form of 176 large-size, NATO-style counters, with the following types represented: infantry, light infantry, garrison, armor, mechanized, marines, airborne, special operations, cavalry, fortress, headquarters, tactical airbases, strategic airbases, supply, naval bombardment task forces, carrier task forces, and amphibious task forces.&#10;  &#10;The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of the game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of them. They expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play becomes a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.&#10;&#10;There are 12,446 words in the game&rsquo;s basic rules, and another 10,886 in the optionals (which will only be presented in the on-line eRules). That means two experienced players can complete the shortest of the game&rsquo;s three scenarios in about six hours. The game has been designed with two-player play primarily in mind, but solitaire play is doable.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Gazala, in May 1942, was arguably Rommel's most daring feat of generalship: British 8th Army had reached the limit of its supply line, but had heavily fortified the front from the Libyan coastal village of Gazala to the desolate outpost of Bir Hacheim, nearly 50 windswept miles to the south. The ever-resourceful Rommel, however, simply led the Afrikakorps still deeper into the desert, going around Bir Hacheim. Once behind the Allied defenses, the panzers became a threat to the overall Allied position. British tank units were immediately ordered to counterattack Rommel's panzers, resulting in one of the largest tank engagements of the desert war on a barren tract of desert that became known as the &quot;cauldron.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cauldron utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From mortars to howitzers, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by heavy mortars &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending an outpost. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the outpost, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Cauldron, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting around the cauldron. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;(from the Decision Games' website)&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player receives nine cards, then picks seven of them to arrange in a face-down row. On your turn, you must flip one of your seven cards (up or down), with some cards having effects that enable you to flip additional cards, including those owned by opponents. Cards depict animals in different types of environments, and they have different effects and point values depending on what's shown at round's end, such as the sloth which is worth positive points only if it's still face down. Aside from sloths and koalas, though, cards must end the game face up to contribute to a player's score.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;Great Tree&quot; variant for 2-4 players, five cards are dealt to each player and two turns are taken. Then a second set of five cards cards are dealt out which go above the first row and two more turns are taken, with the added wrinkle that players now control two rows and adjacency means up and down as well as side to side. Finally, a third set of cards is dealt out and players take a final two turns, then calculate their total score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Please note that factions are not static or fixed. With the Dual Faction card system, players may change their own or another Faction. This is absolutely a chaotic yet compelling faction game.&#10;&#10;Challenge your social skills and strategic thinking (or maybe your luck), and become a legend in the Kingdom of Catrolia!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns performing Appearance &rarr;Plan &rarr;Declare &rarr;Rest on their turn via cards.&#10;&#10;2. A Faction being revealed does not directly cause a player to lose the game or suffer apparent losses. A player's faction has the opportunity to change during the game, and the player needs to adjust strategies according to the current situation and their own interests to find the most advantageous faction. Yesterday's enemy may become today's ally.&#10;&#10;3. Attacking other players can cause direct damage and narrow the base number of players for &#10;Faction Fudgment, but Faction Cards can produce more effective results.&#10;&#10;4. Players only need to answer truthfully when showing faction markers and determining if the game continues. Players can engage in negotiations or bluffs with other players during the process.&#10;&#10;5. The game has a considerable strategy, and players should carefully consider the consequences of each decision.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.&#10;&#10;The map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.&#10;&#10;The game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins. The difference in points between the Commonwealth and Axis player determines the level of victory.&#10;&#10;Originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #105.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 1.5 miles&#10;Unit: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 16&quot; X 21&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

As the Publisher remarks, this game is ideal for beginners.&#10;&#10;Every player has a set of small detailed plastic figures made up of soldiers (nine per player), tanks (five) and artillery (three per player). The map is a representation of a desert (with some dunes, mountains and roads). Every player starts at one side and in the middle there is a river dividing the desert. This river is the frontier between both players. There are three bridges symmetrically distributed on the river. In every player's territory, there are three possible objectives for the enemy: the Oasis, the Polvorin (ammunition depot) and the High Command.&#10;&#10;Every player takes, at the beginning of the game, one objective card (three possible) and this is going to be his goal in the game: either introduce three units in the enemy Oasis at the other side of the river, or two units in the High Command or only one in the Polvorin (furthest objective). The shooting success is ruled by the dice and a round rotating table that gives the exact minimum dice value (between 1 to 6) needed on a throw with the dice based on the distance (in hexes) between the shooting unit and the objective unit. A user friendly wargame and easy to start playing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In ancient times, immortal vampires played games with people's lives and with real blood stakes. Now in card game form, no real blood will be spilled, but the strategy, tactics, and power-plays still abound. Based upon a game that exists in the True Blood universe, Night Eternal: The Game is a competitive card game of intrigue, power-plays and betrayal where vampires jockey for power, position and ultimate control of the rival factions: The Authority and The Monarchy.&#10;&#10;Players must ante blood from their pools to both factions each turn of the game. Players build up their hands by acquiring cards from a powerful, but temperamental Immortals deck and a willing and able Agent deck. The cards that a player chooses to play will determine the faction to which he or she is loyal...for now. In turn order, each player plays out one card (face up) during each of three rounds each turn, so you never just how much power it will take to seize control of a faction each turn.&#10;&#10;Players must pay attention to the cards their opponents are playing. It's more difficult to enable a powerful card's special ability if your opponents are playing weaker cards. Weaker card special abilities are easy to resolve, but weakness doesn't win the war. Special abilities might allow a player to steal blood from a faction or move it from one faction to another, so switching your loyalty to a new faction (by playing cards of that faction) might just throw off your opponents' best laid plans.&#10;&#10;In the end, power still rules the day. At the end of each turn (after three rounds of card play), the cards are scored. The player with the highest value of Authority cards earns that faction's blood pool. The player with the highest value of Monarchy cards earns that faction's blood pool. The key to victory is to have more blood tokens than any other player when the first player dies...by running out&#10;of blood.&#10;&#10;",

During that war the Finns recaptured the territory they&rsquo;d lost to the Soviets in the Winter War of 1939-40. They failed to take Murmansk, however, which would have seriously hindered Allied Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;TFF is played in sequential &ldquo;game turns,&rdquo; each of which is composed of interactive &ldquo;phases&rdquo; and &ldquo;sub-phases.&rdquo; During each Operations Phase, the players alternate picking markers from the command pool; each such pick thereby indicating which sub-command will be &ldquo;activated&rdquo; for movement and combat at that time. The High Command marker causes the Orders From The High Command Table to be checked. The player controlling a selected sub-command receives reinforcements for it, if any are available that game turn, and then moves and conducts combat with the units of that sub-command.&#10;&#10;The armies in TFF are divided into &ldquo;sub-commands,&rdquo; each of which operates as a semi-autonomous force within its overall army. Sub-commands are defined by abbreviations and colored stripes on the unit-counters. Pulling certain markers will allow a player to conduct operations simultaneously with more than one sub-command.&#10;&#10;Published in World at War magazine #5, 2009.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 month&#10;Hex: 23 miles / 37 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (228 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Zhukov&rsquo;s War rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-6&#10;&#10;",

It is thought to have been the first Shogi variant to utilize drops (a mechanic in the modern version of 9&times;9 Shogi and absent from the original 9&times;9 Sho Shogi).  Each piece is named after a type of bird.  The royal piece (King) is the Phoenix.  Other pieces include the Swallow (promotes to Wild Goose), Falcon (promotes to Eagle), Crane, Pheasant, and Quail.  The goal of the game is to capture the opposing Phoenix.&#10;&#10;Somewhat of an oddity is the fact that a player's two Quail pieces are actually asymmetrical, being designated as the Left Quail and the Right Quail, with their movement capabilities mirrored.  Drops are handled in a manner very similar to modern Shogi.  A third swallow cannot be dropped in a file that contains two others, nor can one be dropped on the last rank, where it would not be able to move.  In addition, a swallow cannot be dropped so as to give immediate mate.&#10;&#10;The promotion zone for Swallows and the Falcon consists of the opponent's back two ranks.  Promoted pieces revert to their un-promoted value when they are captured (for purposes of dropping back into play).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Against the Odds magazine #23&#10;&#10;Americans seldom notice the enormous changes that the Napoleonic Wars caused to the Western Hemisphere...things far larger and with much greater effects than our own War of 1812.&#10;&#10;The Louisiana Purchase really started it, as Napoleon sold Jefferson a large block of land that really &quot;belonged&quot; to Spain. In shifting their forces to try and limit American expansion, the Spanish-loyal authorities opened the door to losing the remainder of two continents. Guerra a Muerte depicts the 14 year struggle that saw Spain's possessions in the hemisphere change from &quot;almost everything not U.S.&quot; to &quot;Cuba and Hispanola.&quot;&#10;&#10;As in the American Revolution, the local population could be divided into &quot;patriots/revolutionaries&quot; on one side, &quot;loyalists/Royalists&quot; on the other, and a huge middle block of those who wished to stay out of battle--over which both sides exerted tremendous pressure, making these episodes as bitter as a period in history. The game title means, &quot;War to the Death,&quot; and comes from a proclamation Simon Bolivar made to all Spaniards in Venezuela--&quot;support us or else.&quot;&#10;&#10;Warfare took place from the remote northern border with America to the tip of the continent now shared by Chile and Argentina. Progress ebbed and flowed, with territories changing hands several times and the intensity and size of battles slowly escalating.&#10;&#10;The overall war is a fascinating struggle of varied elements, from Spanish and &quot;Royalist&quot; troops to formed patriot units, militias, armed mobs, Indians, and mercenaries. Actions include slave revolts, naval assaults, guerilla war, battles with a hostile environment, and the interplay of politics with economics...all depicted and intermeshed to affect overall play as they affected real events. The game offers a map from &quot;New Spain&quot; to &quot;Rio de la Plata,&quot; with area movement, one-year turns, and 280 half-inch counters.&#10;&#10;Guerra a Muerte offers a chance to understand a hardly-heard-of period of Western history, the effects of which are still with us today.&#10;&#10;A playaid sheet with additional optional rules are organized into one sheet and included on issue #27.&#10;&#10;",

Players control 3 ships and are racing to pick up cargoes from asteroids and return them to earth. Each ship has a speed from 0 to 5 must change speed by one unit each turn. The moon orbits the earth, and is a constant hazard. Attacks are permitted and send the loser out of control. Landing is a fine art of judging speed.&#10;&#10;Deadly Planet. 2-4 players. Each player has a team of astronauts stranded on a hostile planet and they have to reach specific pick-up point. Dangerous beasts roam the planet, some of which can be ridden; others exist only to attack astronauts.&#10;&#10;Invasion Earth. 2 players. The Ganoids are invading Earth's seas. The earth player using orbital missile satellites, submarine and surface fleets must track down and destroy the Ganoids spawning craft. It is a game of careful placement as the Ganoid player tries to over-extend the Earth player's resources.&#10;&#10;Galactic War. 2 players. The Krul vs the Stellar Federation. Players expand across the map capturing planets to increase their technology rating and dodging the randomly moving anti-matter cloud. Combat and conquest depends on the number of ships in the fleet. As only one ship can occupy each space, long snaking fleets stretch across the board. Some of the ships are annihilators - suicide bombers that destroy all neighboring ships. Ship types are kept secret from your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Exiled Legends is a strategic card game where mythical creatures wield incredible power. Play as an Exiled Legend, a powerful deity that rules over the desolate land to which they have been banished. Build your team of Heroes and fight to gain control in the Banesphere. Will you emerge victorious or suffer a bitter defeat?&#10;&#10;Fighters gather at the gates of the Banesphere waiting to be selected for battle. As a Legend, you start by choosing six fighters to serve as  your Heroes and to enter the Banesphere to test your team's prowess. Your team will have one Champion and two Supports at a time, fighting on your behalf. Each time your Champion is defeated, you will promote one of your Supports and bring in a new fighter to take the vacant Support position.&#10;&#10;When you run out of fighters, you must enter the fray yourself. But be warned: if you are defeated, your entire team must immediately retreat from combat and return to the barren wasteland until the next battle.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will manage Bane tokens, activate Hero abilities and attack their opponents' Heroes in order to ultimately destroy their champions and force the Legend into the fray. A Legend emerges victorious when they force their each of their opponents to flee back to the barrens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Necronomicon is undoubtedly the most emblematic book in the mythology of H.P. Lovecraft. In this game you will assume the role of Abdul Alhazred with the aim of completing all sections of the aberrant book. It is a game for 2 to 4 players with game modes for 20 or 60 minutes. Necronomicon is presented in a limited edition that continues The Writer, and comes with the amazing art of Fran&ccedil;ois Launet (Goominet), with exclusive Cthulhu pawns for the sanity count (collector&rsquo;s edition) and an impressive Necronomicon book case made by hand, in wood, in antique book format (Deluxe edition).&#10;&#10;How to play: The objective of the game is to complete the Necronomicon. Each player is dealt five cards at the beginning of the game. Each card represents part of a section of the book. Each section of the book is completed by collecting at least 5 cards from that specific section, identified by a symbol. The game is divided into several rounds, each of which ends when a player manages to complete a certain number of sections of the book (each round will be more complicated than the previous one). The complete sections of the book are marked with tokens until the Necronomicon is completed and the game is won.&#10;&#10;During a turn there are only two moves: draw card (to choose from the deck or the discard pile) and perform an action by placing a card on the table, which will serve to bring new cards into the hand or to get rid of others mainly. You'll have to decide whether to sacrifice an important card to take advantage of the card's action or to play more conservatively. The card that is played on the table is available for the next player, who in turn will decide whether to draw it or take a new one from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once a round is finished (managing to complete the sections of the book and discarding the remaining cards) the tokens are placed on the completed sections of the book and the players who have been left with cards in hand will lose sanity points.&#10;&#10;The rounds follow each other until all the sections of the Necronomicon are completed and the game is won.&#10;&#10;",
