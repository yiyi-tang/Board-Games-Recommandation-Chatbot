The trade conditions dynamically change every turn for every sector.  Players may also spend resources to upgrade their ship and to build mining outposts that passively collect more resources every turn.&#10;&#10;Every ship produces 'Powercubes' on every turn.  These 'Powercubes' are then spent to move across the galaxy and then allocated to the players ship systems such as Shields, Weapons or Thrusters.  These are used to protect the player from hazards such as Pirates and other players.&#10;&#10;First player to return six units of each resource that their home planet does not produce wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you play a card from your hand. These cards will let you draw more cards in 5 different ways. But, there&rsquo;s a little twist, to use the card, you must maintain a special pose/gesture (specified on the card) until your next turn. After drawing some cards, hopefully you will have enough to purchase equipments from the store. These equipments may help you in various ways or win you the game.&#10;&#10;The most exciting part of Style Up is AFTER the game ends. Because the Losers must make silly pose (based on the cards) and have their photos taken. Furthermore, those photos will be shared online for the world to see.&#10;&#10;There you have it, a simple relaxing game that&rsquo;s a fine combo of two trending hobby!&#10;&#10;And don&rsquo;t forget to #StyleUp when sharing your trophy (embarrassing photos of your friends)!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 2-4 + players based on the Jurassic Park universe. The aim of the game is to be the first team to find the kids and bring them back to the Visitor Centre &#10;without first being killed off.&#10;&#10;The board is an 8x8 grid in the form of a map of the island. In one corner is the Visitor Centre (safe start and end zone) from which the players&rsquo; teams start. In the opposite corner is the kids token. The map is populated with terrain in the form of 4 randomly placed lakes, 4 randomly placed mountains and 4 randomly placed valleys.&#10;&#10;Six dinosaurs are placed randomly on the board (but not adjacent to the visitors centre). These dinosaurs are selected at random from a table of 6 dinosaur types. Each dinosaur type is immune from one of the tactics that might be employed by the players (e.g. you cannot outrun the Velociraptors).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with an 8 member team.  Players roll 8 times on a Team Table to get the composition of their team. The 6 different types of team member have skills that improve the tactical abilities of the team. Results and changes are recorded with paper and pencil. During the game, players will lose and gain team members.&#10;&#10;Players share a Common Deck. The deck has 7 types of cards representing the tactics that can be employed to evade the dinosaurs: Hide, Run, Block, Trap, Shoot, Distract, and Special.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Equip Phase &#10;         Draw 1 Card from the deck and add it to your hand. Max hand size is 5 cards. &#10;    &#10;     Special Phase&#10;         Special cards not meant to be used in other phases may be played (discarded) for their effects in this phase. &#10;    &#10;     Dinosaur Phase&#10;         Pick 1 Dinosaur by random and roll once on the random movement table to determine how it moves. Dinosaurs move orthogonally but not diagonally and must obey a set of movement rules related to terrain and the location of other dinosaurs.&#10;         If a dinosaur enters the same space as a team, the team will be attacked. The team must attempt to escape. An escape attempt must use 1 tactic from the 6 available (Shoot, Run, Hide, Trap, Block, and Distract. Next, the player must make an escape roll using 2 six-sided dice. Add up the total of the 2 dice rolls and add to this the number of teammates with the matching tactic. Next, play (discard) up to 2 tactics cards and add their bonuses. At least 1 of the tactics cards played must match the chosen tactic. If the Total (roll + team bonuses + card bonuses) is equal to or greater than 12, then the team escapes with no casualties. If the total is less, the team loses a number of random team members equal to the difference. If a team loses all its members, that player is out of the game. &#10;         After the attack, the team must retreat 1 space away.  If you are attacked and you control the kids token you may lose control of the token.&#10;    &#10;     Move Phase&#10;         Move your team pawn 1 space orthogonally. You may play (discard) 1 special card to move the team farther per the cards instructions. Terrain will affect where the teams move to and teams cannot enter spaces occupied by dinosaurs or other teams. If you enter the space containing the kids you take possession of it. The kids token moves along with your team pawn.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s just one thing, the only way to earn your seniority is by trading for it; with office supplies. You&rsquo;ll need to recruit a team and search through desks on your break to find the supplies you need. Trade the supplies in the break room to the department requesting them and try not to break any drawers in the process. You have one work week to get your seniority and you&rsquo;ll need to get it by any means necessary or lose your job!&#10;&#10;Cubicle Raiders consists of 5 Days (rounds) and each Day there will be a number of Breaks(turns) determined by the Department card for that day. During their turn, each player will be able to pick 2 of 3 actions: Search, Trade or Recruit. To Search, a player will move their meeple to a drawer on one of the desk cards that has a supply they need. They will then roll the Search Die to determine if they successfully found the supply, did not find it or broke the drawer. If they found the supply they add the amount to their supply tracker, if they broke the drawer that drawer is no longer searchable. If more than 50% of a desk&rsquo;s drawers are broken that desk is no longer searchable, if 2 desks are no longer searchable the day is over.&#10;&#10;To Trade, a player moves their meeple to the breakroom and trades only the supplies the current department is looking for. Each supply is worth so many seniority points determined by the trade ratio on the players supply card. Each player can trade up to 5 Seniority Points worth of each supply during their trade action. To Recruit, a player must move their meeple to the breakroom, they can then recruit another employee by paying the recruit&rsquo;s seniority point cost, this is identified on the recruit&rsquo;s card. These recruits add special abilities to help the player in the game.&#10;&#10;After the last day is over the player with most Seniority Points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can even choose to play each area - three levels - as a mini-campaign! Players need not worry about the experience of their heroes or henchmen if they play later levels, either, for the skills and abilities of the adventurers are tied to the levels themselves.&#10;&#10;If Darkholds is played as a campaign, players can purchase certain types of mundane equipment or hire henchmen in between levels - effectively meaning heroes have a retinue they can bring with them to the next level!&#10;&#10;To succeed in their quest for eternal life players must overcome a horde of enemies trying to stop their heroes, gathering treasure, ancient artefacts and sorcerous weapons or armour to help them along the way. The Wihts, scampering grave spiders and huge, terrifying mound beetles, ancient G&#196;&#129;sta and shrieking Dr&#196;&#147;aguth all wish to deny the secrets of the Jutes to the outsiders, and they will do anything - including the destruction of their own halls and tombs - to stop them.&#10;&#10;Players must also understand that - whilst the game is co-operative - there will also be an element of selfishness to how each player plays the game, for each hero has his own secret quest and must succeed in it if he is to progress through Darkholds successfully...&#10;&#10;",

Turn by turn, each couple gets asked different questions from the &lsquo;Starters&rsquo; deck.&#10;&#10;Example: &ldquo;Who has the better fashion sense?&rdquo; The couples must decide on their answers without conferring. If they agree with each other and both write down the same name, they win 2 points.

If they predict correctly, they gain 1 point. If incorrect, they get 0.&#10;&#10;Once every couples has answered a &lsquo;Starter&rsquo; card, they move onto the even more awkward questions in the &lsquo;Main Course&rsquo; deck, before finishing on the painfully-awkward questions in the &lsquo;Dessert&rsquo; deck.&#10;&#10;The winning couple is the one with the most points at the end of dinner.&#10;&#10;",

Players move their pawn from the start space to the North Pole and back again.&#10;&#10;Players choose from one of 6 pre-defined expeditions or use a random method to generate their own expedition.  Each expedition has 9 stats: Men, Dogs, Food, Gear, Skill, Will, Ship, Time, and Hoax. These stats represent the composition, skills, supplies, start point, start time and legitimacy of the expedition &ndash; these may change during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;The board is a track 30 spaces long including a start space at one end and the North Pole space at the other end. Players share a 50-card common travel deck which influences how far an expedition will move during a particular turn.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn has 3 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Event Phase&#10;-   Roll once on the event table. Except for the blizzard result, all other results will require the player to make a test against either Gear, Will, or Skill. A test is resolved by rolling 1D10. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the value of the stat, you pass the test. If it is less, you fail the test which will usually result in a permanent loss of a stat or a penalty to your move total in the travel phase.&#10;&#10;2.  Travel Phase&#10;-   Draw 5 travel cards. You may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements. &#10;Add up the move values of all 5 cards.  This is your move total - move that many spaces forward. You must stop upon reaching the North Pole. &#10;-   If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s pawn that is not on its starting space, move it back 1 space. &#10;-   If you have 2 or more dog cards move an extra +1. &#10;-   If you have 4 or more trek cards move an extra +1.&#10;&#10;3.  End Phase&#10;-   Consume 1 food point. &#10;-   If there is no food left then -1 dog. &#10;-   If there is no food or dogs roll on the casualty table and resolve.  This will result in the loss of men, will or skill.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all expeditions return to their start point, or fail in the process.  Victory points (VP) are awarded as follows:&#10;-   1 VP for reaching the North Pole. &#10;-   An extra 2 VP for being first to reach the North Pole. &#10;-   1 VP for getting back (Surviving). &#10;-   1 VP for being the first to get back. &#10;-   1 VP for never failing a morale check. &#10;The player with most VP wins.&#10;&#10;",

Foxes are fluid; they ally with the fox spirit if it exists, otherwise they ally with humans. The game is played like UNO; players take turns playing a card which has the same color or number as the top card of discard pile. Each time a card is played, its effect is activated. Players could be forced to change their roles or even eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player gets rid of all cards in their hand, in which case that player wins the game. All of that player's allies win together, but only if there is an opposing side of the winner. The game also ends when the deck runs out, in which case the side with the lower total value in their hands wins the game if there are two sides. Otherwise the player with the lowest total value in their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;Sometimes you are required to co-operate to win as a team, but you win anyway if you go out. It is an effective strategy to focus on winning alone.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;UNO&#239;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#230;&#174;&#138;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#164;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#231;&#139;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#228;&#185;&#157;&#229;&#176;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#139;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#185;&#157;&#229;&#176;&#190;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#175;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Players involved may use 1 battle card per battle.&#10;     Redeploy: we have 5 movements to distribute as we wish between our ships. We can also make use of Seals of honor.&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout the game we will have to expand our empire by the board, facing the other players through different spaces, we will form fleets of ships and we can launch to the conquest of other planets.&#10;&#10;Different ways and ways to achieve victory in a game of strategy and management, suitable for the whole family and simple rules.&#10;&#10;",

You, your cards, and your opponents will determine what is in the canon - but it is up to you to be the player whose own canon matches the central one most closely and most often, to earn the most points.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a hand of five cards.  Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.  The game ends the turn after the draw pile is depleted.  Final scoring is determined by the number of cards in each player's personal canon that match the central canon.&#10;&#10;The Old Testament Edition includes passages from the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Torah.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The debates in the history of the church were heated, but the game based on them is fun to play! You, your cards, and your opponents will determine what is in the canon - but it is up to you to be the player whose own canon matches the central one most closely and most often, to earn the most points.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a hand of five cards.  Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.  The game ends the turn after the draw pile is depleted.  Final scoring is determined by the number of cards in each player's personal canon that match the central canon.&#10;&#10;The New Testament Edition includes passages from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Madcap is a quick game that pits two players against each other in a struggle to score more points.  Players do not own anything -- neither the runners that score nor the dice that power them -- so they must always think hard about their opponent's response in order to avoid a surprise score.  Despite the dice, there is no luck in the usual sense -- the dice simply set the stage and then are never rolled again.&#10;&#10;Players use the pre-rolled dice to move the three runners up and down the track.  They score points by landing one runner on another -- the higher up on the track, the higher the score.  Each turn one of the twelve dice disappears, so players have just six brain-burning turns to score more points than their opponent.&#10;&#10;",

The complete game is available here.&#10;&#10;Four factions fight to control the of the land of the Red Dragon:&#10;&#10;The Dwarves, who sell their treasury of artifacts to the highest bidder to fund their armies.&#10;&#10;The Elves, cunning and mysterious, who possess arcane magic that reveals future events.&#10;&#10;The Goblins, who's bloodthirsty mercenaries fight for gold, even against their own king. Their thirst for treasure finds them with a trove of artifacts.&#10;&#10;The Orcs, who control the wild lands of the west. They worship the mighty Red Dragon.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, buying artifacts to use in battle, recruiting forces and moving armies to collect gold and capture castles. All while a horde of wild dragons move through the land, decimating everything that comes before them.&#10;&#10;Battle plans are made in secret and simultaneously revealed. Magic artifacts are used to support your armies. Even the winner of a battle can suffer terrible attrition.&#10;&#10;Deals made publicly between players are magically bound, and must be honored, if possible. This, along with the tremendous cost of battle, adds a strong political component to the game.&#10;&#10;Players may ally and share their advantages, but there can still be only one winner. The first player to end a turn controlling 3 or more castles has won the game. If there is no winner after 8 turns, then the Red Dragon still rules the land, and it's patron, the Orcs, win the game.&#10;&#10;This game is licensed Creative Commons Share-Alike 4.0.&#10;&#10;",

And the legendary heroes that have appeared so far ... they appear in the game.&#10;&#10;Last year we published a game called HandsKit with social funding. Many gamers participated and released at the time.&#10;&#10;I am going to introduce a new game based on that experience. If the handkets were a difficult dexterity game that requires skill, this is a highly accessible Dexterity game.&#10;&#10;This game is a baseball game, and the key mechanic is a striking box.&#10;&#10;There is a wooden box with a hole in the center and a bevel inside the box. If the cube ball dropped from the top and entered the bore-shaped hole correctly, the blow was successful.&#10;&#10;If you drop it too low, it is likely to be a foul because there is not enough potential energy, so you have to fall as high as possible. It is the same principle as marbling when I was a child.&#10;&#10;The higher the ball is dropped, the farther the ball goes. But the probability of passing through the hole will be that much.&#10;It is a high risk high return concept using gravity and position energy.&#10;&#10;",

Questions are asked and based on your answers, you move your marker the respective moves on the board to hopefully be first to the finish/ Win!!&#10;&#10;The WINNER then selects a 'Perform or Pamper' card for themself and for the losing player, and all of this while receiving a 1 minute shoulder massage from the Loser. Each card has an activity they must complete within 14 days OR they have to give extra special attention to the other person, in whatever 'reasonable' way they want.&#10;&#10;Each game is designed to last 30 - 60 minutes depending on how much extra conversation ensues about the cards. The cards should give about 5 unique games, but many answers are unique, so it can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;The game content has been professionally reviewed by a psychologist for suitability.&#10;&#10;",
