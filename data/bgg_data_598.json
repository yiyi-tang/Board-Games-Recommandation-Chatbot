Throwing stars and bows are to be mastered. New rolecards add many new different options to the players. Markers especially in use for the daymio give him the possibility to play specials (hostages, family artefacts, ect.) on certain occasions.&#10;&#10;New landtiles with structures allow players to increase the value of their landscapes and to purchase additional abilities. Possible bonuses for provinces can be used to improve their power in defence and put some more reputation to your clan.&#10;&#10;To use the expansion you need the components from the corebox and the knowledge of the basicrules. All additions in the expansion are for optional use and should be brought into play step by step into your basic game of bushido. For the experienced gamer the most satisfactory result will be probably a bushidosession with all expansions included.&#10;&#10;We have provided an extensive overview on the last pages of these rules, which allow players to see all of the new rules implemented with the corerules.&#10;&#10;Please note: the term Samuraihonour was swapped for Warriorhonour! And now have fun to discover Tanin - the Stranger, the first expansion to Bushido.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Last Hurrah covers the Denikin's last successful counterattack of the Russian Civil War in February, 1920. After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.&#10;&#10;Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about one mile per hex. Each combat unit is one battalion\\brigade for non-AFV units. For Tanks ,Armor cars Aircraft, each counter is one AFV\\AC. A game turn represents several hours of time.&#10;&#10;",

The newest battle pack, Path of the Zealot, sees their chittering horde grow. Poison Wind Globadiers rain death upon the heads of their opponents, as they can corrupt to deal damage. The Chittering Horde tactic brings more Skaven into your fold, as it allows you to search a portion of your deck for ratmen recruits.&#10;&#10;Not to be outdone, the forces of Order gain the assistance of the Zealot Hunter, who destroys that which doesn&rsquo;t belong upon entering play.

Now it emerges onto the battlefield, to shield the sons of Grungi. The Gate of Sigmar bars the entrance into one of the most populated cities in the Empire, and the staring skulls carved into the doors greet any invader as they crash against its might. Each turn, it shall do the same for you and keep damage from reaching your noble home.&#10;&#10;Every zone sees new additions, and players will be forced to re-evaluate their plans. Will you devote the newest Empire hero, Gustav the Bear, to protecting your newly built Kingdom, or will he assist you in further developing your Quest zone? Dwarf Miners are an excellent unit to bring in later in the game. Their ability to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the part of your capital they enter can be a game saver, especially in the often targeted Quest zone. The deadly Bloodsworn make an excellent protector for damaged zones, as each opposing figure that falls restores their health.&#10;&#10;Speaking of the Quest Zone, a new Quest appears for the foul followers of Chaos, as they can now show themselves to be the Wolves of the North. Rumor has it that Valkia has personally found this quest to be most rewarding...&#10;&#10;The Path of the Zealot also increases the number of High Elves and Dark Elves, as the war spills over into their lengthy lives. The Repeater Bolt Thrower launches a wave of indirect damage at your foe, and gets stronger the more developed you are. Vaul&rsquo;s Unmaking removes the weapons from the hands of the enemy and leaves them with nothing. Dark Elves call upon dark powers and pul the very blood from their foes. Call the Blood can remove a damaged unit from play, a nasty surprise for the foes of Malekith. Dark Riders, wielding wicked swords, charge down upon those foolish enough to be in their way.&#10;&#10;This fall shall see some of the fiercest battles and desperate races to develop mighty empires. Legends will be forged. Will you be one of them?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Frazed is a strange social game designed for 4-8 players ages 12 and up. The idea of Frazed is simple, and a bit mischevious.&#10;Write a sentence or phrase that someone else would be unable or unwilling to say outloud one time through without stopping, within five seconds of recieving it.&#10;&#10;Frazed challenges the players' creativity, vocabulary, acting skills, social inhibitions, concentration, knowledge of their friends and their silliness tolerance all at the same time.&#10;&#10;Have you ever wanted to make your friends confess to a crime they didn't committ, make them sing out loud, stammer over the weirdest thing that comes to your mind, act like a fool or simply make the laugh till they are red in the face and crying? Well Here Is Your Chance!&#10;&#10;The game consists of two parts. The Fraze card which details a type of sentence category along the lines of tongue twisters, compliments, insults, confessions, secrets, gibberish etc and a second deck of cards called Exploits. Exploits are ways in which the sentence should be read, or act as a distraction while trying to read the phrase. Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.&#10;&#10;During any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.&#10;&#10;The Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.&#10;&#10;There is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.&#10;&#10;Buy a copy of Frazed Today!&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;* fraze Deck (75 cards)&#10;    * exploit Deck (71 cards)&#10;    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)&#10;    * frazed rules Document&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From The Game Crafter's website:&#10;&#10;&quot;MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries. You may play against each other, or cooperatively against the evil dictator Koen, and you may play individually or as teams. Either way, the goal is the same, to take control of the war torn tropical island of Tenagra.&#10;&#10;Tenagra is a wealthy country full of industries. Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.&#10;&#10;There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.&#10;&#10;MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.&#10;&#10;Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts. And don't forget that you can play as teams or individuals both in death-match and cooperatively. All of these variables ensure that you'll have endless amounts of fun playing MERC.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From The Game Crafter's website:&#10;&#10;&quot;It was a time of great corruption, and also of great wealth for those who knew the secrets of the court and could turn it in their favor.  In Laws and Disorder, you play noblemen in a land ruled by ever-changing laws, and must bribe and bully the court into passing laws which benefit you, or harm your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player has one of six different professions which grant them certain abilities.  The shrewd Trader may buy additional assets, while the cunning Thief can steal from other players.  The deck contains words which players combine into laws that everyone must obey.  The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.&#10;&#10;Things get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Laws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.  Package includes deck plus rules.  You must provide pocket change, play money or peanuts to use as game currency - I leave this choice up to you.&#10;&#10;Want to try before you buy?  You can also play Laws and Disorder in your browser on Whirled.com.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Land, air, and sea animals are all locked in a vicious struggle to dethrone the lion and be declared King of Beasts. In Untamed: A Rummy Revolution , you will compete to try to get the most animals into your own field--and it never hurts to have the winning animals on your side!&#10;&#10;Based on the familiar card game, Rummy, Untamed: A Rummy Revolution adds more player interaction and strategy through action cards and the concept of ranking melds. Each card has three characteristics. The more characteristics the cards in a meld share, the higher the meld is ranked. By playing higher-ranked melds, you are better able to attack your opponent's animals, herd animals into your own melds, and defend against your opponent's attacks. Watch out for the King of Beasts cards, though! If you can meld a set of three of them, you can prevent your opponent from scoring, but if they're left in your hand at the end of the round, they'll cost you.&#10;&#10;",

With a degree of skill and a small amount of luck, do you have what it takes to solve this appalling crime?&#10;&#10;In this themed rummy game, players lay sets of suspects while attempting to conceal vital evidence cards that point to the identity of the murderer.

Never fear though, as the astute sleuth, Inspector Moss, is always on hand to provide you with some assistance into your inquiries. If you are able to &lsquo;go out&rsquo; with your cards and are able to identify the murderer, congratulations, you will be rewarded handsomely in points, however, your opponents will not be so lucky.&#10;&#10;Inspector Moss Investigates is a free PnP rummy game developed for the 2009 Themed Rummy Contest (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3867905#3867905)&#10;&#10;",

The 1st clues are very hard (typically birth date alone), and get subsequently easier until the final 6th clue which actually tells you the name of the person!&#10;To start, a player (randonly chosen) looks at the first card (in secret). The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled. The roller then tries to guess the name of the famous sporting person. If guessed correctly the card is won by the roller, and then the pack and die both move clockwise for the next player to roll and the previous roller now gets to cross-reference the die score against the next card drawn.&#10;There are some gifts if you roll low, as these are the harder clues.&#10;If you roll 'one' you receive the first clue, but in addition you are allowed another roll to see if you manage to roll a 'two'. If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.&#10;The Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.&#10;If you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.&#10;The remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller. They either allow him to steal subsequent cards if not guessed correctly, or ask for extra clues, or whether the subject is male or female when it is his own turn in rolling and guessing.&#10;When all the pack is used up then the game is over and the player with the most won cards is the victor. However as this can last a long time (especially if knowledge of the subject is poor), time restraint can be imposed by pre-agreeing a number of celebs for victory.&#10;This is a U.K. game and therefore the sportsmen and women are predominantly famous to a U.K. audience either by virtue of being well-known domestically, and/or by having global reknown.&#10;&#10;",

BloodLust is a fast playing card game for 2 to 10 players using the vampire genre. Beautiful cards, rules, and board bring the game to life.&#10;&#10;Players add to their bloodline by staying out on the hunt, but the longer you stay out the greater the possibility of daylight; if you're out when the sun comes up then you could lose it all. Use your powers to best your opponents, or to help them, your choice.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a character card which has variable powers.  Cards are flipped from the play deck one at a time. The possibilities are a daylight card, which raises the possibility of sunrise; a card which increases a character's bloodline; a slayer card, which injures the character or reduces the bloodline; etc.  Before each card flip players must decide whether to stay on the hunt with the possibility of additional increase or loss to their bloodline, or to get out and hold their bloodline gains for that round.  If players stay in and a daylight card is drawn that brings the sun up and any players still in the round lose all of their gains for that round.  A number of rounds are played depending on the number of players.  Players can play their powers and, depending on the situation, help or hurt themselves or other players.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 30-60 minutes.

When both dice show a red dot, the player currently wearing the hat loses his or her current pawn. When he or she manages to move the current pawn next to another player's pawn, however, the hat is passed on. The players can also move bushes to protect themselves from the Schlafm&uuml;tze. The game ends when one player has no more pawns, whoever has most pawns then is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
