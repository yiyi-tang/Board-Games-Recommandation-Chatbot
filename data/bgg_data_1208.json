    "Description": "Trains are the pinnacle of transportation across the country. Start your train line, and compete with others as you try to get a juicy government grant to expand your business. It's not going to be an easy trip with bandits lying in wait, couplings coming loose, and other locomotives trying to claim the grant for themselves.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking one action: get deliveries, cargo, or caboose (end game goals) cards, discard specific cargo cards to make deliveries, or upgrade their locomotive (flipping it over) to increase their hand limit. When making deliveries, players will place their completed delivery(s) behind their locomotive card. There are also special cargo cards which adds some &quot;Take-That&quot; into the game allowing players to play the Bandit and steal from each other, or protect themselves from Bandits by playing the Marshal. While the Loose Coupler causes you to lose one of your cargo from your hand, the Wild Cargo card acts as any cargo from any location.&#10;&#10;Not only does Deliveries on Track feature both a standard and advanced mode of the game to challenge both younger and older players, it also has a unique game mode which allows players to choose which version of the game they'd like to play at the same time, creating a Mixed mode with minimal gameplay changes to the younger players. There's minimal text on cards, relying primarily on icons and drawings allowing younger players to be able to play with little issue.&#10;&#10;The end game is triggered when a player has at least 5 completed deliveries. All other players have one last turn. After, all players are able to put up to two completed caboose cards on their train. The winner is the player with the most deliveries including caboose card bonuses in Standard and Mixed modes, or the player with the most points including caboose card bonuses in Advanced mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But an accident exposed him to the refrigerant fluids he was working with, and it forever changed him, both mentally and physically.&#10;&#10;After the incident, he could only survive in subzero temperatures, so he built himself an insulating suit as a shield from the outer world. He took on the moniker, Mr. Freeze, and decided crime would pay more than science.&#10;&#10;Even though he lost his sense of morality, he was still a genius scientist and used his skills to create an entire arsenal of weapons including the impressive rifle that freezes its targets solid, leaving icy statues in his wake.&#10;&#10;Mr Freeze&rsquo;s reach just got longer.

Eventually he realigned himself with Batman, even though he favored using firearms over Batman&rsquo;s non-lethal force.&#10;&#10;This new profile sees Red Hood&rsquo;s mobility increased, and even though minigunless &ndash; he&rsquo;s still just as impressive with only his 2 handguns.

Any changes unique to the Republican phase of the Franco-Prussian War, the subject of this expansion set, are included for both the conflict overall, and the included battles of Coulmiers (a victory for the French) and la Lisaine (a defeat) scenarios.&#10;&#10;The AOV product line is sold direct thru digital distribution, though hardcopy versions are available from certain retailers. It is 34 pages long. Kindle formatted products are sold exclusively thru Amazon, while digital downloads exportable to PDF format may be purchased via Google Play.&#10;&#10;Online, public research portal for this game and its historical period (to include flags for miniatures, official histories, Public Domain military maps, images and publications - all copyright friendly and FREE to download) at https://tinyurl.com/AOV-FPW-Reference-Portal.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Presidents versus Trump is an action-packed, fun-filled, 30-minute card game for 1-4 players. The American presidents, from George Washington to Barack Obama, are so offended by Trump sitting in their chair that they&rsquo;ve all come back together to kick him out. But while the portal to the past was open, a rogue&rsquo;s gallery of villains from American history, from Benedict Arnold to Bull Connor, have come back to defend Trump. The battle for the honor of the American presidency is on!&#10;&#10;The game is shamelessly Ameritrashy, with keywords, variable powers, stuff from real history, light deckbuilding and lots of dice. It's suitable for casual play - with a partner, with coworkers and friends, as an offbeat filler option on game day, or during the commercials when streaming presidential election debates.&#10;&#10;The designer ran a successful Kickstarter to fund artwork for the game. Final art is expected before the November election. The images uploaded here on BGG are samples of the final art.&#10;&#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/presidentsvtrump/presidents-v-trump-relaunch-a-fun-filled-30-min-card-game&#10;&#10;The core of the game is 24 presidents, divided up evenly among the players. Every turn, you draw five cards out of your deck and play them. Each president has a presidential power based on that president&rsquo;s actual strengths (integrity, popularity, party building, policy leadership or maneuver). Presidents can also gang up to attack villains or recruit new cards into your deck.&#10;&#10;After the other 12 villains have been defeated by the players, it&rsquo;s time for a massive Final Showdown with Trump himself. If Trump captures all the presidents, he wins; if the players defeat him first, the player who is holding the most captured villains wins &ndash; but Trump himself counts as three villains for determining who wins. With this system, you can&rsquo;t afford to sit back and let the other players do all the villain-fighting during the game before the Final Showdown, but in the end, victory will still hang on how well you do in that Final Showdown!&#10;&#10;The game is already fully designed, playtested and web-published, so you can download it for print and play.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Soldiers of Rome is a full battle game, utilizing units of between 8-20 models (cavalry is 4-8 models), in either small fast moving Raids, Field Battles (the standard line-up and fight) or Siege Assaults (one sides gets a fortress to defend, the other attacks it).&#10;&#10;It is card-driven, using an action card deck (which will come with the rulebook), to give orders to each of your army's 'Battles'. A 'Battle' is a sub-division of the army, a third of it, either the left, centre or right Battle. These can all act together on the same action card.&#10;The way action cards and Battles interact is governed by your overall Battle Plan, which is a pre-chosen plan of attack (or sometimes defence), which dictates which cards your Battles get for this engagement. These set cards are then added to with random drawn ones, so each game gets an entertaining level of unpredictability, and the cards will never allow a game to be played the same way twice - even if you you used the same forces, over the same terrain, with the same battle plans, the game would still play-out differently.&#10;&#10;Picking a force is from one of the three army lists in the game, Roman Legions, Barbarians and Parthians, in a familiar way, except the scenario being played adds restrictions to this. So, Raiding forces look very different to fortress garrison forces or those deployed for a field battle. Each army can be further characterised by its Stratagum, helping, along with the action cards, to bring the character of the army to the fore. Siege Train equipment, ruses and tactics are also available, but only in Siege Assault games.&#10;&#10;The rules aren't scale specific, they will be playable at all scales, because the players pick the ground scale and measurements based on their miniatures collection and table-size.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the distributor&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This matching-sets-for-points game has been played by Nadine Chestnut&rsquo;s family for over 100 years.  It is a tale of two queens, and the historical fate of Scotland&rsquo;s Queen Mary.  Character Artwork has been meticulously painted to capture the likeness of each historical figure from one of the bloodiest stories in the history of Scotland and England, which ultimately shaped the world we see today.&#10;&#10;Instructions:&#10;&#10;Choose a player to shuffle and deal the cards. Start by dealing 11 cards to each player and finishing with one card turned up beside the deck. The person immediately to their left goes first and will be the scorekeeper. Each player takes turns dealing, in clockwise order. The first player to reach a cumulative score of 1000 wins. If 2 players cross 1000 on the same turn, the person with the highest score wins. Keep track of scores on a piece of paper.&#10;&#10;On each player&rsquo;s turn; you start your turn by picking up a card and you end your turn by discarding a card face-up on the face-up pile.&#10;&#10;When you pick up a card, you can pick up a card from the face-down pile or pick up the entire face-up pile, based on the most recent discarded card. To do this, you must have at least 2 cards (in your hand) that match the face-up card and place them down in front of you with this top facing card. The remainder of the cards from the face-up pile go into your hand unless you can place any of them down, either by making a new set or adding to an existing set with matching cards. You can only pick up the pile by matching to cards in your hand, not that which is already on the table. During your turn, you can choose whether to place down sets of cards, add cards to current sets, or hang on to cards. Your strategy will drive your decisions. When placing a set down, it goes on your side of the table only. At the end of a round, any cards on your side of the table count toward your score. Any cards in your hand are deducted from your score. You can only place cards down onto your own sets.&#10;&#10;Card values are indicated on the bottom right of each card.&#10;&#10;You can make a set of matching cards in front of you if you have 3 or more of the same card. You cannot mix and match cards unless they are part of the royal family (see below). You can place as many wild cards that you wish with a set, but the initial set MUST CONTAIN at least two matching cards or 2 cards from the royal family. You can add matching cards or wild cards to any set on the table in front of you during your turn.&#10;&#10;A round ends when a player can completely empty their hand by placing their last card with a set on the table or the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Scores are counted at the end of each round. It is possible to go into the negative and scores should be tracked accordingly. &#10; The royal family cards are indicated by a crown over the coin in the bottom right hand corner.&#10;&#10;Any member of the royal family can be paired with each other (including duplicates of King James). If placed down as an initial set, they can be matched with a wild card as long as at least 2 members of the royal family are placed down with the wild card. Royal family member cards are indicated by a crown over the coin in the bottom right-hand corner.&#10;&#10;The crown jewels are wild. This card can be placed with any two matching cards to form a set. It can also be added to any set that is already on the table. If this card is face-up on the discard pile, it may be picked up if you have two crown jewels in your hand. You must show the other players that you have two in your hand to qualify but are only required to immediately play the wild card that was picked up. You cannot pick it up if you cannot immediately play it.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;108 card deck &bull; Pen &bull; Pad of paper for keeping score &#10;&bull; Game Instructions and more about the key historical characters of this tragic story.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You won&rsquo;t even have to worry about getting knifed and thrown in the river&mdash;hopefully.&#10;&#10;Tooth &amp; Talon is a Rock-Paper-Scissors inspired game played with cards and can be played by 2-5 players in 20-40 minutes.&#10;&#10;All players have a hand of six cards with different available actions (two Rats, one Snake, one Hawk, one Fox, and one Net). On a turn, players will choose one of their cards and place it face-down. After all have chosen, players flip their cards and, beginning with the leader, choose to take one of the actions on their card. After three turns, players score all their accumulated cards. The player to the left then becomes the new leader. After the final round, and everyone had played as the leader, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;At present, the game only exists as print &amp; play.&#10;&#10;",

Players each have a deck of cards numbered 1-9 representing their gourds. 9 is the biggest gourd, and 1 is the smallest.&#10;&#10;To duel, two players each put one of their cards face down in front of them in their 'lock box', then announce to the other player which of their opponent's cards they want to destroy. if the named card is in their opponent's hand, it is put in the center of the table face down and removed from play.&#10;&#10;Finally, both players secretly compare the cards in their lock boxes. If those two cards are the same value, OR if their values added together equal exactly 10, both of those cards are ALSO put in the center of the table face down and removed from play. Otherwise, the lock box cards go back to their owners hands.&#10;&#10;All players continue dueling in this way, switching opponents evenly, until one player has 1 or 0 cards left at the end of a duel. This triggers the end game. Then all players finish out the current round of duels. Finally, all players reveal their highest value card, and the player with the highest value wins game! if there is a tie, the tied players add up the value of all cards in their hand, and whoever has the highest added value wins.&#10;&#10;This is a fun, frantic card counting game for 2-6 players and plays in no more than 30 minutes. It was independently produced by Omari Akil, and Matthew Everhart in 2019 with funding from incredible patrons on kickstarter.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In fact, each player must manage a microbial species, and make it thrive and multiply across the board colonizing habitats that can sustain its metabolism.&#10;Every species is characterized by a metabolism, a way in which it grows and multiplies. Metabolic features are chosen from a set of &quot;plasmids,&quot; cards that are picked by players at the beginning of the game from a starting deck. Plasmids belong to different groups, and choosing different sets of plasmids can yield different gaming experiences.&#10;During their turn, players can choose to spend energy for growth, to move, evolve or attack species living in nearby habitats. Since the goal of the game is to colonize the highest number of habitats, each player can tailor his/her strategy according to the special characteristics of his/her microbe.&#10;A player is declared winning when either is the only one left alone on the board or when he/she has colonized the highest number of habitats.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Like many climbing/shedding games, players can play single cards, pairs, and runs. What makes Gan Deng Yan different is following players play singles, pairs, and runs that are sequentially higher than the cards played before them. After everyone has passed, players then draw a card from the talon.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player has emptied their hand of cards. Each card left in opponents&rsquo; hands scores one point for the first person to go out. After a pre-determined number of rounds, the winner is the person who has the most points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each piece has a numeric value, based on a military rank, which is hidden from the opponent and only revealed when an attacking piece moves in front of a square occupied by an opponent's piece. In most cases, the piece with the highest value wins and the losing piece is removed from the board. Exceptions are the spy, who only takes the general and the mineur, who only defuses mines.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player finds the opponent's quille and takes it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In DrawBot, players take on the role of robot designers in the world-famous DrawBot Factory. They compete against each other to fulfill customer orders as quickly as possible - all in order to become the greatest designer in the Factory&rsquo;s history!&#10;&#10;DrawBot is a Roll &amp; Write game in which all players take their actions simultaneously with the roll of the dice. Players aim to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order before anyone else by drawing on their factory sheet the available robot parts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, the Workshop Manager rolls the 4 dice that determine the pieces available for robot manufacturing. He or she chooses one that only they can use. This piece is in limited quantity; the Workshop Manager keeps it exclusively for themselves. The other players can take any die other than the Workshop Manager's die. The same die can be chosen by multiple players. This reflects that these robot parts are available in larger quantities!&#10;&#10;As soon as the Workshop Manager has chosen a die, all players choose one action:&#10;&#10;- DRAW: The player the piece represented on the dice he has chosen&#10;- BOOST: The player uses 2 energies then draws any piece of their choice&#10;- ACCUMULATE: The player does not draw anything and circles 1 energy&#10;&#10;Players can only draw on the face in front of them. Before drawing, they can use 1 energy to TURN their Factory Sheet to access the workstation of their choice. The Factory Sheet can do &frac14; or &frac12; turn.&#10;&#10;The first one to finish an ordered robot scores 3 points. When a customer&rsquo;s order is fulfilled, the robot is removed and replaced with a new robot design. If a completed robot does not correspond or no longer corresponds to a customer&rsquo;s order, it is worth only 1 point. If two players finish the same robot at the same time, this robot design is worth only 1 point!&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment a designer finishes their 4th robot. They circle 1 bonus point for finishing first. At the end of the game, players score originality points. Each designer compares their four robots, including the unfinished ones. If pairs of robots having no symbol in common, the player scores 1 point. The designer with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

So, instead of the normal goal of the game to score points from mission cards, dominating neighbourhoods and scoring dice, the players goal is now to succeed with the Heist Card, as well as completing a private Role Card by having the depicted dice from the card on their Faction Board at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;However, the players can't reveal any information regarding what colors or numbers they need for their Role Card while the Heist Card is considered public information and players are allowed to coordinate around it. In order to make all of this work, all player abilities are replaced by allowing to change the value of a die in the city once per game. Also, when performing a neighbourhood action, players now have the option to instead change the value of a die in the city by +1/-1.&#10;&#10;",

Pick someone to go first, as randomly as possible!&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw one card from the deck, and then play one card from your hand. Just follow the instructions on the card! After you&rsquo;re done, play passes to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;Blue Cards: Instead of your turn, you may draw and play a Blue Card. You may only do this if you have already taken a turn and do not have a Blue Card in front of you. Do not look at the Blue Card as you draw it, and flip it face up tp any of the four sides. Read the part of it that is facing you.&#10;&#10;What's the Point?: Instead of playing a card on your turn, you may discard four cards from your hand and say &quot;What's the point?&quot; After a count of three, each player must point at another player. Then draw and read a card from this deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
