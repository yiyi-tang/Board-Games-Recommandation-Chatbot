When you collect The Rusalka, take one card at random from the hand of each player and add it to your harvest pile. Opposing players wait until after their next play to draw up.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But the spirit of freedom still lasts in Poles&hellip;&#10;Young conspirators are plotting against the oppressants by all possible means &ndash; the stake is the survival of culture, art and Polish language. In Old-Polish Glossary you take the role of plotters who want to remember about the Old-Polish language. Create sets of words and perform tasks in this marvelously &ndash; illustrated lexical memory game.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Staropolski wokabularz (&quot;Old-Polish Glossary&quot;) is a game for two people with about twenty minutes playing time. Players alternate taking turns. On their turn a player is manipulating his cards in order to gather a set of four cards of the same category one after another. Categories stem from various areas of medieval life (i.e. medicine, science, handicraft, cookery) which are represented on cards by Old &ndash; Polish words coming from medieval manuscripts. The game can be also won by realizing two out of four available task cards (in every game 4 out of 6 available task cards are being used). A player&rsquo;s turn is based on action points. A player can spend them in five possible ways:&#10;&#10;     Take another card to their stand&#10;     Exchange cards within their stand&#10;     Exchange cards between stands&#10;     Reject a card from their stand&#10;     Peek at any card in the deck&#10;&#10;&#10;What is interesting about Staropolski wokabularz is that players put most cards on special stands back to a player and what makes it easier to remember them are&hellip; colourful clips, which can be used to mark cards!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

From the ashes, rose the descendants of mankind. You are a leader among these peoples, a mighty warrior, forever bound to a powerful shard.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time to make a choice: Is it your fate to lead your people to victory or will you become the relic of some forgotten future? Choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Shards of Infinity: Relics of the Future is the first expansion to the popular deck-building game, Shards of Infinity. This expansion includes powerful cards known as relics that can only be leveraged by each of the leaders of the four factions when the player reaches 10 Mastery points.; when this happens, the player gains one of their two relics, with the other one being forgotten in time. The set also includes cards that can be used by any player, but when matched with the player's designated faction leader, the card receives an additional effect!&#10;&#10;In addition, this set includes three new ways to play the game. A three player mode known as &quot;Bloodbath&quot;: any damage dealt goes to both opponents rather than just one. In 2v2 Team Attack mode, players pair up to take on an opponent's team. A full solitaire mode, known as &quot;Nemesis&quot;, pits solo players against the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The majority of this Supplement deals with Next War: Insurgency. These rules will allow players to conduct an insurgency against the player occupying their country using new rules. Alternatively, they will allow an occupier to attempt to crush the insurgency in the country they've supposedly just defeated. A new Sequence of Play is provided which simplifies overall game play. Elements of both the Standard and Advanced Rules are used. For instance, air power is handled with a version of the Standard Game Air Points. The COIN player will get to have his HQs and SOF, but he'll also have to maintain supply lines. These rules will introduce new concepts such as unknown units (Direct Action Cadres and Political Action Cadres for the insurgent player) as well as Breakdown Battalions for the COIN player plus several other rules tweaks so that players can fight an insurgency/counter-insurgency campaign. There will be at least four scenarios in the final product*:&#10;&#10;&#10;     DPRK insurgency in an occupied North Korea&#10;     ROK insurgency in an occupied South Korea&#10;     ROC insurgency in an occupied Taiwan&#10;     Polish insurgency in an occupied Poland&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;NEXT WAR ADDITIONS&#10; &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Camp HumphreysThe United States is building a mega base in South Korea at Camp Humphrey's. These rules alter the way US reinforcements enter the peninsula and relieve the burden on Busan. It also offers opportunities for the DPRK player to interfere with those reinforcements.&#10; &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Patriots, S-300/400s, and THAADThis provides new, expanded rules for the use of these systems as well as providing all new updated counters. Players will be able to attempt to defend against Air Strikes as well as shoot down incoming Cruise Missiles (Patriot, S-300/S-400) or Ballistic Missiles (THAAD).&#10; &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DPRK NukesThe DPRK is deeply intent on weaponizing its missiles. These rules provide for that option, along with an &quot;Assured Destruction&quot; mechanism by which the DPRK can be incinerated for using them.&#10; The above three additions are meant to be used together, but players are free to pick and choose amongst them.&#10; &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Combined &quot;Sub&quot;-SystemStraight from a Next War player comes an excellent idea on combining the Submarine Marker rules from Supplement #1 with the Series ASW/Submarine Threat Level rules. This provides a framework for using the rules in that way.&#10; &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Submarine Marker Rules for Next War: PolandUsed either in conjunction with the combined rules above or stand-alone with the Submarine Marker rules from the Supplement, this will contain new counters and rules for applying those rules to the situation in Next War: Poland.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Additonal Cyber Warfare Markers&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Updated Order of Battle for the PRC in Next War: Taiwan&#10;SPECIAL&#10;&#10;This entire supplement* eventually will be available for free download via the Next War Series Support Site, including PDF files for the required counters (which will be DIY). This P500 item exists for those of you who wish to have GMT produce it.&#10; &#10;     The Insurgency rules available online will contain only a single scenario. Other scenarios will be available only with the printed product.&#10;&#10;&#10;Supplement Inventory:&#10;One Next War: Supplement #2: Insurgency 24-page rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (384 9/16&quot; counters - Insurgency, Next War Series additions &amp; errata counters)&#10;One dual-side printed Player Aid 1 (Next War: Insurgency Sequence of Play)&#10;One dual-side printed Player Aid 2 (Next War: Insurgency Tables)&#10;&#10;",

Then the players each choose one of the two character cards handed to them to play with and return the other to the box.

    "Description": "Kombination is one of several horse racing games created by Swedish designer Jan Jang&ouml;. He would later combine elements from this game with an early 1956 incarnation of J&auml;gersro to produce Glada galopp.&#10;&#10;Kombination is a mechanically fairly simple game where players roll and move horses (which are not controlled by individual players) around a linear, looping track. After moving, a player may purchase a bet on a specific pair of horses, if they both occupy spaces indicating a value. The price of the bet is the sum of the values of the spaces occupied, those values increasing towards the goal spaces.&#10;&#10;Once one or more bets have been acquired, a player must &quot;score a combination&quot; by moving the horses corresponding to a bet into goal spaces. (This may require some amount of rolling and looping, since any other player can move a horse past the goal spaces on their turn.) Once this is accomplished, the player scores a point and turns in the bet, again making it available for purchase.&#10;&#10;There are several modes of play suggested depending on number of players and desired game length, but in the basic game, the first player to reach three points wins, obtaining all funds used to purchase bets (which may be just a flavour statement or hint at a possible metagame or gambling proposition).&#10;&#10;The length and width dimensions given are for the folded board, while the depth is that of the folded board (0.6 mm) plus that of the box (2.2 mm). The width and length of the box itself are 17.3 x 13.7 mm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It is a murder/mystery game which plays with virtually identical mechanics to Clue, with some notable exceptions.&#10;&#10;The object is to deduce who committed the murder of an unnamed victim, with what weapon and in what room. There are 6 possible suspects: Madame Rubie, General Umber, Mrs. Azul, Mr. Pine, Sir Use, and Dr. Rose; 6 possible weapons: Cast Iron Pan, Golf Club, Butcher Knife, Revolver, Wrench, and Hammer; and 9 possible rooms: Entrance, Game Room, Spare Bedroom, Master Bedroom, Garden Room, Theatre Room, Sitting Room, Dining Room, and Kitchen. Cards representing these elements are shuffled separately, with three randomly drawn from each category and placed in the center of the playing board, with the rest dealt to the participating players.&#10;&#10;Three to four players take on the role of detective and roll a single die to move around the board via a delineated path, moving separate suspect tokens and weapon tokens into the rooms as they make suggestions. The player to the left must reveal any cards they may be holding to disprove the suggestion, until all players have passed.&#10;&#10;The game itself measures 10.5&quot; square, with miniature playing cards, and &quot;token&quot; cards representing the 6 suspects and weapons. Four player pawns are included in Red, Orange, Blue and Green. Thought there are substantial similarities to Clue, there are some notable rule differences: the corner rooms no longer provide a &quot;secret passage&quot; to the opposite room in lieu of a move; and players may now land on the same space occupied by another player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game cards are placed in a grid, and on each player's turn, they choose to gain all cards in either a row or a column, after which the grid is refilled. However, the refill is irregular and as the game proceeds, each row will be of differing lengths, causing the players to sometimes gain fewer cards, sometimes more. Some cards have special powers that trigger depending on the number of gained cards, even on other players' turns, causing chaotic chain effects.&#10;&#10;Once the deck runs out, players get final bonus points depending on a balance between gained &quot;children&quot; and gained &quot;candy&quot;. Points are also awarded during the game. Most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The ladies are numbered 1 to 6.&#10;Everybody chooses a lady to represent. Having chosen a lady by using the appropriate die, he uses the other two dice to turn over one or more of her flaps. This is done by using the two individual die numbers to 'open' two flaps or one flap using the total of the two dice.&#10;Further choices are that he may re-clothe his own lady, utilising the dice as described earlier.&#10;If a lady is stripped completely, the 'owner' puts a token representing a life into the 'pot'. If a player loses 3 lives he is out of the game. The winner will be the last player with an unstripped lady.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Then the next player's turn in clockwise order starts. Players need to collect as few cards and as few victory points as possible. To do this, they have to be very tactical, and say &quot;Dudab&quot; with proper timing. The player who can lead everybody else by the nose and collect the fewest victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a reprint for the original Dudab and contains sixteen extra cards that comprise two expansions.&#10;&#10;",

This period is known as the Klondike gold rush, and an estimated 100,000 people were prospecting gold during that time. The gold rush was over almost as quickly as it came, but the people that live there believe that the river still contains plenty of the shiny ore.&#10;&#10;In Yukon, you want to be the smartest prospector and collect the most of that valuable gold. But be aware, others also vie for that ore you laid eyes on, the quickest and most vigilant fortune hunter will win.&#10;&#10;The playing area consists of a 7x7 card grid. The starting player may decide to take a card from the row or the column that the gold digger is standing in. This card is placed in front of the player, and the gold digger is moved to the spot the card occupied previously. This ends the player's turn. The next players may always take a card moving in a perpendicular direction from the previous movement. The gold digger always moves to the newly freed spot.&#10;&#10;The game contains the townsfolk expansion that includes 30 extra cards (10 characters, 3 of each) and 9 gold nugget tokens.&#10;&#10;",

The second phase is using the fighting hand to win the battle!  Once players are able to get rid of their fight cards, they can play their identity card on their next turn.  If a Superhero saves the world, all the Superheroes win.  If a Villain achieves world domination, all the Villains win.&#10;&#10;Players try to improve their hand in the first phase by drawing and discarding cards.  Once the BATTLE card is randomly flipped up from the middle deck, the battle begins (second phase).  The player that flipped the BATTLE card will lay down a numbered card.  The next player must match or beat the number laid.  There are action cards mixed in to keep things interesting!&#10;&#10;",

All our cards are large 2.75 x4.75 inches (standard tarot size) with high-quality materials. One vs. One, Light vs. Darkness, opposing powers and conflicting factions compete to shape the future of Planet Lyra.&#10;&#10;Galatune is an anime battle tabletop card game set on the fantasy planet of Lyra. The United World Government maintains peace and prosperity through the monopoly of advanced ancient technologies, but utopia comes at a steep cost. Will you join with the government to protect unity, or will you join the rebels and fight for freedom and independence?&#10;&#10;2-5 players each lead a Champion warrior into battle and earn a Victory Point each time an opponent is defeated. You win the game by being the first to earn 3 Victory Points by defeating 3 opponents. BUT there's a twist! The game doesn't end for you when your Champion falls in battle. Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.&#10;&#10;Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.&#10;&#10;Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros!
