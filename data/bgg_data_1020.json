The dealer draws a card from the stock, and then passes one of their cards to the left, so they are only left with 3 cards.  The next player then chooses a card to discard to the next player, etc.  The last player discards their card to a discard pile, and then the dealer starts the next round by drawing the top card from the stock again.&#10;&#10;Play continues until a player collects all 3 cards from a scene, and displays it on the table, winning the game.&#10;&#10;This game closely resembles a Children's Card game called My Ship Sails played with a traditional deck(s) of cards, but players try to match suits in that game instead of picture scenes.&#10;&#10;This game was included in a 6 pack of Children's Card Games by Bicycle Playing Cards.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to score the target amount of Cheers.&#10;&#10;Setting:&#10;In the year 2130 humankind was saved by the most disruptive technology of the third millennium: the hyper-local gravity engines, capable of bending the universal law of gravity at the will of its creator - the Newton Corporation. The new technology quickly became an essential part of everyday life, tackling overpopulation by exponentially increasing living space and solving famine with vertical cultivations: in a matter of years, Newton Corporation became the most powerful and notorious company in the world.&#10;&#10;Despite all the good done by Newton Corporation, there were protests, strikes and even revolts of thousands of people who believed that these technological advancements were dangerous for the human species. The strong reputation of Newton Corporation convinced the world leaders to denounce such acts of violence and defend the many research facilities by the military forces.&#10;&#10;Many years passed and with them the protests faded. However, a group of fanatics kept on nourishing their anger and plotted an assault on the headquarters leading to the murder of the Newton Corporation founder and CEO. The military arrested the culprits who were immediately sentenced to a public execution, to be aired across the planet as a warning against rebellion towards such a global benefactor.&#10;&#10;The execution was followed live by 99% of the world population. This exorbitant share is what pushed Newton Corporation to sponsor a spectacular and bloody event every year. Their goal was twofold: commemorating the punishment inflicted to the rebels and provide a single outlet for violence, so as to experience peace for the future year.&#10;&#10;With the blessing of all world leaders and population, Newton Corporation developed new technologies capable of cloning the executed rebels, enhancing their abilities and peculiar traits. Four teams were created and sentenced to battle against each other for eternity, in the name of peace.&#10;&#10;From the ashes of those rebels new Champions were created: the Zero Gravity Tournament was born.&#10;&#10;",

The other player is in charge of the German defenses (fighters and AAA). Each turn players commit their forces to the different map sectors secretly and then air battles are fought first between fighter sweeps and defending fighters, then between fighter escorts and remaining defending fighters and finally the latter against bombers.&#10;&#10;Victory is measured in how many months the war in Europe is shortened or lengthened compared to May 1945. Victory Points are accrued by the US player for destroying targets and achieving air superiority in the most sectors, while the German have to hinder those efforts before the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pedigree is a board game based on actual genetic biology and real-life decisions of animal breeding to produce show ring champions and top-dollar animals. Each player is a breeder trying to make the most money by raising the best animals and building reputation through winning trophies. Your ability to breed champion stock will be determined by your management and mating decisions, along with the luck of genetics. You pick the best animals based on their phenotype (appearance), but their phenotype is an imperfect predictor of their genotype (DNA). You won&rsquo;t find out the true genetic potential of the animal (prove the animal) until they produce offspring; unless you use DNA testing in advance.  Each generation you compete for the Trophy against other players in the Show Ring, and champions build your breeder reputation causing your animals to command higher prices.&#10;&#10;A hand-management game where you're managing two hands of cards. Your Action Cards allow you to choose to mitigate disease, advertise, use biotechnology, hire a groom to help you win the trophy, plus other useful actions.  Your Animal Cards are where you choose which matings to make and which offspring to sell or keep for breeding.  You play one of four unique player roles (Manager, Showman, Technician, Veterinarian), each having a slightly different set of Action Cards.  The genetic-based game mechanic means that you are often faced with the decision to breed a proven animal or take your chance with an unproven animal.  The game is played over five years with each year consisting of six season:&#10;&#10;     Planning season - choose your action cards for the year.&#10;     Breeding season - breed your females to your own sire or pay another player to use their sire.&#10;     Gestation season - pay your annual feed bill, find out if disease hits.&#10;     Birthing season - prove unproven parents and birth the new offspring.&#10;     Show season - take your best new offspring to the show and compete against other players for the trophy.&#10;     Market season - decide which offspring or parents you will keep versus sell to the bank or other players.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Action Cards that you play in one year must be discarded at the start of the next year, until you choose to play the Hired Hand card which retrieves all discarded Action Cards back to your hand. There are five trophies total, one is awarded each year, and when the trophies are gone, the game is over and whoever has accumulated the most wealth wins.&#10;&#10;The base game includes a cattle Animal Card deck, but future Animal Card decks may include horses, dogs, sheep, goats, and others, including specific breed decks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This fun and social game accommodates any number of players, mixing elements of role-playing, sci-fi, and tabletop strategy. Each player designs a &ldquo;freejumper&rdquo; &ndash; a small, privately-owned multi-purpose, self-aware spaceship.&#10;&#10;The players then have &ldquo;adventures&rdquo; as they search for valuable cargoes to beg borrow or steal, alien artifacts, wrecks to salvage, or get hired as mercenaries in a variety of roles. Like a role-playing character, your ship can &ldquo;learn&rdquo; and grow if your adventures are successful. You can purchase new software and systems for it, upgrade weapons and defenses, and perhaps eventually sell it and buy a larger and better ship altogether.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will fight a variety of battles. Sometimes all of the players cooperate against a single threat. Sometimes the players divide into teams trying to complete tasks. And sometimes there is a free-for-all, as every freejumper is trying to get home with the most loot and goodies.&#10;&#10;Each ship is controlled with a single small &ldquo;interface&rdquo; no bigger than a poker card, and a hand of &ldquo;system cards&rdquo; that represent the ship&rsquo;s various capabilities. Gameplay consists of playing cards to do various sorts of moves, attacks, and defenses, all the while trying to load up as much cargo as you can and get away without too much damage. A typical game lasts about one hour.&#10;&#10;",

The person telling the story can also choose to answer with &ldquo;Not Important&rdquo; if players start getting too far off track.&#10;&#10;Mind Maze allows players to test their skills of deduction and investigation, and to get to the bottom of the mystery with as few questions as possible. Players take turns asking questions, and lose a point for every question they ask. Points can be gained by asking specific key questions which also help players to figure out the true version of the story. This encourages players to think carefully about the questions they ask and to work together.&#10;&#10;This is 4th edition of Mind Maze, edited especially for Polish market.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Wieje nud&#196;&#133;?

It's a wacky race where all the players are the &quot;Dick Dastardly&quot;!&#10;&#10;In the Rasher game all players manage cards that can be actions against opponents (&quot;Take That&quot;), defenses for attacks received or to move around the track. The number of cards caught at a time, offers many strategic possibilities for the player to decide his next actions. But the player can also leave some cards stored for later use.&#10;&#10;There are 1, 2, 3, or 4 house motion cards that can be combined with other actions like jumping obstacles, stealing opponents' cards, using side saws, and more. Even if your car is damaged by missiles or collisions, you can still use repairs to continue running, non-stop.&#10;&#10;The modular board allows you create a racing circuits with number of laps defined by the players: whoever arrives first wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With limited resources can you complete more pizza orders than your competitors before the end of the game? Need some help along the way? Great! You can bring in managers and even The Boss to help out! Let&rsquo;s just hope that they don&rsquo;t get fired before they serve their usefulness. To win, you&rsquo;ll need to play the right cards at the optimal time.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two decks of cards, the &ldquo;Boss deck&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Order deck&rdquo;. The two decks work in conjunction with each other. The &quot;Order deck&quot; determines what toppings you need on your pizza. The Boss deck provides the toppings and all the little things needed to help your business along the way.  If you play your cards right you might even disrupt your competitors. Once you order is prepared it must be cooked.  Be wary--until that order is done and the money is in your pocket that customer could still decide to cancel. That's just how pizza life goes, right? Health inspectors, cancelled orders, not having what you need in stock - these are all possible disasters that could happen. But there is also the good things - helpful managers, a boss willing to lend a hand or customers who pay for their order early. Explore all these things and more in Pizzeria Boss.&#10;&#10;",

On this day, our city, our beloved Titan City, is crawling with these menaces! Each one, with their own agenda and their own way of possibly terrorizing the good people of the earth's mightiest city. But this editor in chief of yours will not simply sit idly, letting these vigilantes take the law into their own hands without being held accountable. I will be reporting daily from the front lines so stay tuned!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Titan Front Newspaper. Read by the entire city. For years it has painted the picture of Alphas being with its editor and chief as the main sounding board. The truth is, some Alphas are bad. Some use their powers for their own personal gain, or &quot;just to see the world burn&quot; as they say. Some just want to keep to themselves or... save themselves.&#10;&#10;Some though... some hear the calling. Some believe that their abilities have with them, the responsibility to make the world a better place. A safer place.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of Alphas, a world where the super powered are a regular sight.&#10;&#10;Alphas is a super hero miniatures game for 2 to 4 players! The game uses a unique combat dice grading system paired with an Activation Deck System. Players can play the game 3 different ways!&#10;&#10;Story Mode: Story mode takes the players through the graphic novel styled story, with a powerful narrative and an evolving story novel to novel. This mode will appeal to families and game groups alike as it can be played cooperatively!&#10;&#10;&quot;Head to Head&quot; Mode: This mode involves building a team of Alphas and squaring off against 1-3 other teams of Alphas in a random 1 of 6 different objective based missions! This mode will appeal to any who like playing tactical competitive games, and will be supported with organized play after its release.&#10;&#10;&quot;One Shot&quot; Mode: These modes will be expansions in the future that feature smaller story arcs for players to play through. The first of which will be &quot;Alpha Hunters&quot;, a story where a shadow government group and it's giant mechanized creations hunt the Alphas, hurting cities and civilians in the process. These too can be played cooperatively, and yet... also competitively, because who would we be if we didn't let you play as the giant &quot;miniature&quot; Alpha Hunter Robots?!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One-Minute Che Guevara is a microgame attempting to portray Che Guevara gerilla campaign in Bolivia in 1967 with a small map and a limited number of counters. One-Minute Che Guevara is a solitaire challenge and the entire campaign can be played in a minute or two. However, the game offers a player most of the political and military choices available to Guevara in 1967.&#10;The player represents Guevara and guerilla units represent small groups approximately the size of a platoon. Bolivian army units represent elements of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at the company level. Historical factors like propaganda, supply shortages, and Guevara's limited tactical options are contained in the rules. The political phase is played on a map of Bolivia; the military phase is played on a separate battlefield map. Event Cards are used to guide the narrative but several different outcomes are possible. Victory is determined by the level of Guevara's political and military success ... if he survives.&#10;&#10;(Excerpt from the Rules booklet)&#10;&#10;",

Some story cards provide variation in groups creating teams allowing for one individual to be a traitor or just add plot depending on player's decisions.&#10; There are two main locations presented through separate boards where players can search item cards, pool resources and work together to survive. A timer is set designating when The monsters will arrive. Once that is complete more traditional game rounds commence as each player and monster take turns with various actions available to each.&#10;&#10;Crafting is available in the form of barricades and health packs. Weapons are found through searching with the more High value ones requiring multiple parts to assemble.&#10;&#10;",

A muddy field waited for the battle to begin.  Near the small village of Agincourt, two armies faced each other in the chill of the early morning.  Archers, Footmen, Scouts, and Cavalry ordered themselves for battle.  The land was the prize that was sought.  The cost must be paid in blood.  Welcome to the Fields of Agincourt.&#10;&#10;Agincourt is a combative tile-placement game for 2-5 players.  The map will form as the game is played, with each player fighting for position for the final battle.  The goal of the game is to defeat your enemies and claim the most victory points.&#10;&#10;Playing Fields of Agincourt consists of two game stages:  &#10;Marshalling the Troops:  Players take turns placing tiles, recruiting troops, and claiming Bastions.  Once all the tiles are placed, the Final Battle will begin.&#10;The Final Battle:  Players are vying for superior battle positions within Bastions.  Contested Bastions are resolved one at a time, with the winning player receiving victory points.  The player with the most victory points will win the game.&#10;&#10;",
