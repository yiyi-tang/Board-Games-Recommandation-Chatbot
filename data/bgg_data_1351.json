The player with the most chips adjacent to a card wins that card, which is worth the printed number of points.&#10;&#10;Some cards have special abilities; for instance, in a player wins the 1, 2, and 3 cards, they achieve an auto-victory. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Killwager is an extremely tactical, small-unit based, realism focused Ultramodern and Near future tabletop game. Minimal tokens, full on narrative. It takes you from the modern day to a newly colonized planet 80 years into the future. The only consistencies? Cash and Violence..&#10;&#10;Lead a hard team of near future mercenaries as they do the bidding of several powers in the area. Blazing a corpse soaked trail of glory, cash, and spent casings across intense &quot;End of the movie&quot; style direct action engagements.&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player has one model perform (or two if they are within 4&quot;), which consists of moving, shooting, taking cover, interacting with terrain, and many other measures. Any model performing can be targeted by a reactive measure. Moving across the battlefield can give your opponent an opportunity to stun, or eliminate outright, your moving asset. It's very simple and breaks down into individual actions with no math. Only increasing difficulty in performing your actions. No more adding 2 or three different modifiers together. Just one flat target number to roll a D10 and add your single stat to. That's right. One stat for the entire game&#10;&#10;A game of Killwager can end in multiple ways. Typically, you want to get the most objective points, and exfiltrate off the battlefield, while trying to deny your opponent the same outcome. However, one player can be forced to end their play time prematurely if they hit pullout conditions specific during a scenario. Often times this is having too many assets killed. Once pullout conditions are met, a player must move all of their forces off the board edge or face capture by their opponent or death at the hands of 3rd party AI.&#10;&#10;A player wins when points are counted up after a scenario or a chain of scenarios. Capturing objectives matter on the battlefield, and count towards your overall score. However, losing assets, including very important ones, or accidentally eliminating non-hostiles, will give you negative points. So even if you have the most people alive at the end of a match, you might not be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was invented and drawn back in 1934! Its author is Vladimir Mikhailovich Golitsyn from the famous Golitsyn family. In his youth, he was a sailor and sailed in the northern seas. Later, the sea became the main theme of his work. This version of the game has been significantly improved and made in a new graphic design (by KoTdeSigN).&#10;&#10;The game uses both currents and wind force and shallows with rocks. From 2 to 9 people can play at the same time.&#10;&#10;The players are divided into 2 teams: the Spaniards, whose task is to transport gold from South America to their homeland. And the pirates, whose task is gold, respectively, to take away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players are apprentice Spring fairies, tasked with bringing the cherry blossom (Sakura) to flower. Both fairies don't want to let on that they are apprentice, and so do not talk as they work. The more flowers they can make bloom, they better they succeed.&#10;&#10;The game title Sana is a contraction Sakura Narabu, meaning Line Up Blossoms. The kanji &#229;&#132;&#183; (Narabu) is remarkably obscure. Hence the publisher has added the more simple hiragana &#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#170; to help readers as a furigana (pronunciation indicator).&#10;&#10;The board shows ten open spaces for Sakura, each space being for five petals. Players will build up complete flowers on the spaces to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has a number of petal pieces, showing 1 to 4 petals. They secretly take a petal in hand and show them together, without discussing what they are choosing.&#10;&#10;If they have chosen different pieces, then they each place their chosen petals on the board. But an existing piece must be taken off the board to a storage area.&#10;&#10;If they have chosen the same pieces to play (butting), again they place their pieces, but may now bring a piece from the storage area onto the board.&#10;&#10;When places their pieces, the players can talk so to get optimal placement. But they cannot discuss what pieces they have left, not what to choose next turn.&#10;&#10;There are also some placement conditions depending upon the number of petals. For example, a 3 petal piece can only go to an empty space.&#10;&#10;Once a flower is complete, it cannot be changed. Pieces that cannot be placed are returned to hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends in certain ways:&#10;When a player runs out of pieces.&#10;When all ten flowers are complete.&#10;When the storage area has five pieces.&#10;&#10;Then the players see how many flowers they have completed and praise or chastise themselves accordingly.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Choose the action from one of your CPUs for your next devious plan and share it with your fellow actors. If they do not approve you will need to rethink and try again, but once you have impressed them, use the die to find out if you plan succeeded. Beware - failing may damage your CPUs, removing them from the game. Achieve your goals or outlast the other actor-bots to win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Before play begins, all players must agree together on what the premise of their robots' adventure in this game will be. To do this they must answer three simple questions:&#10;&#10;     Where did they travel to?&#10;     What year did they travel to?&#10;     What are they trying to do?&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player will select a robot type and take all three CPU cards. Select a player to set the scene with a short narration and then play begins with the player to their left.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will take exactly one action from your available CPU cards actions. Once you've chosen your action, explain to the group how you are going to use that action and the outcome you hope it will achieve. The player to your right will then decide if your proposed action is reasonable.&#10;&#10;If your action is denied, you must choose a different action or a different resolution. If your action is approved, rotate the card so that a new action is available and roll the die to see if it succeeds. Your odds of success are based upon which CPU your action is coming from.&#10;&#10;If your die roll was successful, you plan works. The player to your right narrates your success. If your action fails, they narrate exactly how you ended up failing. Then they narrate some consequences.&#10;&#10;If you fail, roll a six-sided die to see if your failure results in any damage, by losing a CPU of your choice.&#10;&#10;If a player loses their last CPU, they are dead and out of the game. Play continues until either you all accomplish your goal or everyone dies by losing all their CPUs.&#10;&#10;",

The choice is yours, and only you can determine the right or wrong way to go about this unique encounter.&#10;&#10;Shades of Ink is a solo role playing game where you will look at inkblots, note what you see, and then fight to destroy the shades that manifest from your visions. As you accumulate knowledge, the spirits' power also accumulates until it coalesces to form one final encounter.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to overcome the Shades to escape the nightmare?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Yet even as the Inner Sphere adjusts to a new sense of normalcy, questions remain about whether the Blakist threat is gone for good or merely hibernating.&#10;&#10;Once a disorganized collective of hobbyists and academics backed by the idle wealthy, Interstellar Expeditions has emerged from the fires of war to take up the mission once claimed by ComStar's Explorer Corps: to search for the elusive hiding places where humanity's enemies might have gone. From the dead worlds within the borders of the Inner Sphere itself, to the distant, uncharted reaches of the Deep Periphery, IE relentlessly searches for the answers to mysteries dating back to mankind's first ventures into deep space, while simultaneously watching for any sign of the zealots who so recently waged the most horrendous interstellar war in modern history.&#10;&#10;Interstellar Expeditions: Interstellar Players 3 describes the organization and efforts of Interstellar Expeditions as it continues to search within (and beyond) human-occupied space in the BattleTech universe. First introduced in Interstellar Players, IE's operations have now gone truly universal, seeking answers and treasures not only from the lost and forgotten worlds of humanity's distant past, but also the distant colonies and civilizations that have risen--and even fallen--beyond the boundaries of the Inner Sphere. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these groups and discoveries may actually bear fruit, and which are the misdirections left behind by the surviving leaders of the Blakist war machine. Whether from this sourcebook or the gamemaster's own imagination, these discoveries can become the ultimate villain, ally, or unique new setting for any type of BattleTech campaign!&#10;&#10;",

Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of many major Inner Sphere, Periphery, and Clan factions. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Inner Sphere and Clan powers of this critical period in history are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set in this era, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.&#10;&#10;",

You must choose where and how to focus your warriors' actions and control the battle&rsquo;s impetus. The battle is partly fought on the tabletop like other miniature wargames but is also fought just as hard on the Tactics Chart, providing an additional mind-game against your opponent.&#10;&#10;Command your units to move and fight in the areas of the battlefield you wish, but leave the actual process of fighting to your units' commanders. This is represented by the random factor of dice and each of your units&rsquo; abstract but often-decreasing Battle Rating. Because of this, your focus is kept where it should be &ndash; out-thinking your opponent by using superior tactics and exploiting their weaknesses on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Age of Penda is not intended as a heavy simulation of medieval warfare but as an enjoyable, simple, and fast-playing battle game themed around seventh-century warfare.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll find that much of the action is stylized and streamlined. Don&rsquo;t think of &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in the usual wargaming way &ndash; in each turn your units may fight or move several times, countered by your opponent after every action, creating a very fluid game but at the same time making cohesive planning difficult to achieve.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lucky Dog is a dice game where the dog always wins. There are two ways to play: A free-for-all 2-4 player version, and a 2 player cooperative version.&#10;&#10;In the free-for-all version players take turns revealing 5 cards with parameters (such as 3 of a kind, 3 in a row, two pair, etc.) The player rolls 5 six sided dice and then may discard and reveal one new card. The player then gets an opportunity to reroll any of the dice up to twice, trying to fulfill the parameters of as many of the cards as possible. When they are done re-rolling, they take and score any of the revealed cards that the dice fulfill the parameters for. Players take turns in this manner until a player reaches 20 points, then the player with the most points at the end of the round wins.&#10;&#10;In the 2 player cooperative version, each player will have 2 hidden cards in their hand. The player who's turn it is rolls all five dice and choose to 'keep' any of the dice, but must choose at least one. The second player takes and rolls any of the un-kept dice, then they can keep any of the dice, but must keep at least one. Players roll dice back and forth like this until all dice are kept. As soon as that happens, both players can score any cards in their hand that the dice meet the parameters for. If the players collectively score at least one card, they may keep playing by drawing up to two cards and starting a new round. If they can't score a card, it's game over with a total score equal to all the cards scored.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "All but one of the villainous faces should be covered with the villainous images. The pictures are placed upside down and the cards are placed randomly.&#10;&#10;It's about finding face pairs. In turn, you turn over the cards, compare with the image on the board that becomes visible and put the image back if it is not a pair.&#10;&#10;If you get the right card, place it with the image facing up in the box with the same image. The box where the card was located will now be open and it is important to find that face. So you continue until all the face pairs are found. For each pair you get one point. If you find a pair, you have to try again. If you do not find the right face, the tour continues. The one with the best memory and the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This game was included in the comic book &quot;Kalle Anka &amp; C:o&quot;, no. 39, 20 September 1996.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game we find ourselves playing the opponents of the superhero. The title includes up to a maximum of four players, who can however choose from the most iconic villains of Gotham City: Bane, Joker, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler and Harley Quinn.&#10;&#10;Each villain will have a Criminal Plan to carry out, developed in different missions (such as taking control of specific territories or making certain results with the dice). Achieving a certain number of objectives will activate the character's special powers, giving the player various advantages during the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;While the villains compete for the districts of Gotham City (following the traditional RisiKo dice-rolling mechanic!), our hero is not standing idle. When five 1's are rolled during a turn, Batman goes into action, clearing one or more territories on the board and wreaking havoc in the fight for control of the metropolis. Especially in the initial stages it will not be easy to watch, but it will always be a great emotion to swoop into our opponents. It will be less pleasant when it's our turn to face the Dark Knight, but that's part of the challenge too.&#10;&#10;In addition to conquering all of Gotham, you can take home the game by completing one of three objectives, common to all participants. However, every time a criminal empire is definitively defeated, the player who accomplished the feat can choose to eliminate one of the conditions.&#10;&#10;",
