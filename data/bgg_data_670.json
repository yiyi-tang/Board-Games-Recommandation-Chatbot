The code is input by turning two knobs on the board until the correct numbers are displayed.  A random question from the question book is read out which all players can answer,  The player to give the correct answer can choose to take either the prize card, or go for the cash prize displayed on the Money Machine.  If they select to go for the cash, a dial on the Money Machine is spun to determine the outcome.  Getting a question wrong means a player loses a life, and when all three are lost, they are out of the game.  There is also a jackpot prize to be played for.  The winner is the player with the most money and prizes at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;From the box: &quot;Another Chad Valley Television Game: For Love or Money - With the 'Magic Flying Shilling' Sign.

The unit list is generic boxes with no artwork for the counters.  The scenarios cover a wide variety of ground, the East and west fronts, Sicily, Africa and the Pacific and span from 1939 to 1944.  For better or worse,  many of the scenarios do feature German SS units.&#10;&#10;In a departure from the typical 2 player scenarios, Scenario 7 - Slaughter at Shanderovka, has explicit victory conditions set up for 3 and 4 player games.  Scenario 2, Bydgoszcz Coup, and German armed civilians trying to stage a coup, to take over a city to hand over to the invading German Wermacht.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Charlie's Year Redux (CYR) is the second of a set of four games covering the War of the Austrian Succession. From 1741 to 1748 this relatively unknown conflict raged on the continent of Europe. The primary land actions took place in three theatres: the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Charlie's Year covers the famous Jacobite Rising of 1745-46, which was instigated by the French, partly as a plot to topple the Georgian regime and partly as a ploy to divert the British Army from its operations in Flanders.&#10;&#10;From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.&#10;&#10;Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Charlie's Year Redux is a remake. Like its predecessors, it is a two player strategy game. You play one of the royal contenders, with all of Scotland and England as your battleground. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike. But you also have command of any immediate battlefield, and must array your forces for battle, deciding when to employ the cavalry, when to release your reserves, or whether to launch a fearsome 'highland charge'. Technically CYR can be rated as an operational game for scale, but at that time there was no operational theory of war: individual regiments were temporarily banded into armies for a single campaign (often with no clear purpose beyond the seeking of glory by an aristocratic officer corps), and the army commander, or even the King himself, would be in charge on a battlefield still small enough to see his entire command.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of turns, each representing one month, and broken into a series of discrete 'operations' by your mobile forces, using garrisoned fortifications as bases and pivot-points. As the seasons change, a variety of weather conditions will plague your decision making. You have many sources of assistance, but their employment in this 'sideshow' may ruin your chances of victory elsewhere and thus lose you the game. The primary focus is on the campaign game, but there are also shorter historical scenarios covering portions of the Rising and even individual battles. The campaign game is quite flexible in its victory conditions, allowing you to experiment with different ideas for victory. There are also variant campaign rules.&#10;&#10;",

(PKG) is a study of two hypothetical events in the history of the Jacobite Movement: the plots to overthrow the Georgian regime of Britain by landing Swedish, or alternatively, Spanish troops in Britain.&#10;&#10;The famous Swedish monarch, Charles XII, was sympathetic to the Jacobite Cause, and in the years 1717-1719 was not that far away, fighting the Danes in Norway. Rumours have it he was preparing a base of operations for an invasion of England or Scotland with 12,000 men; James Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, would be set up as a puppet king. In the event, Charles XII was killed in 1718 and the plots came to nothing, but what if he had not died?&#10;&#10;With the death of the Last Viking, the Jacobites were forced to look for another backer, and found it in Spain, where the shifty Cardinal Alberoni was engineering a war against France that would ultimatey drag in the Empire and the English. (It should be noted that the Jacobites' traditional supporter, France, now under an insecure and anglophilic Regent, the Duc d'Orleans, was uninterested in helping them. Indeed, d'Orleans offered a brigade of French troops to help England stave off the threat of a new Spanish Armada!) In the event, the Armada was wrecked, but a small independent party of Jacobites and Spanish soldiers did land on Scotland's rugged west coast, even fighting a battle with loyalist troops before surrendering.&#10;&#10;Either invasion could have succeeded. King George I of England took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. Furthermore, Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, and many in that country were unhappy. The Swedes and or the Spanish would be seen as liberators (the Swedes with the advantage of their Protestant faith, the Spanish with the advantage of closer ties to James Stuart, Scotland's &quot;true&quot; king).&#10;&#10;",

When a round of play begins, the first player draws a card and does whatever the card tells her to do: Touch something red in the room; recite her name backwards; place the card on her head, squat, then stand again without dropping the card, run around the table, and so on.&#10;&#10;As soon as the player finishes her action, she passes the card deck to the next player. If the timer buzzes while you're holding the deck, you receive a lightning marker as penalty.

The standard pack comes with a collection of four card games. The four games are funny as well as educational, as the game rules abide by the laws of physics. The four games included are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Anti (2 players): Players try to get rid of their hands of cards playing them on the table and recognizing pairs of particle-antiparticle on the table, which annihilate themselves.&#10;     Quark Matter (any # of players): All cards are placed randomly on the table, face up, representing the primordial quark-gluon plasma. Players must be quick to grab the particles according to the correct sequence in the first moments of the universe after the Big Bang: first neutrinos, then lepton-antilepton pairs and lastly quarks and antiquarks to form baryons and mesons (which must be correctly formed). The player with most lepton-antilepton pairs and mesons and baryons is the winner.&#10;     Quark Matter Memory (any # of players): Memory-type game in which players have to find hadrons and lepton-antilepton pairs.&#10;     Find Your Higgs (any # of players): Memory-type game in which players could also search for Higgs decays.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules of other games that can be played with the deck are at https://getyourhiggs.com.&#10;&#10;The game is available to buy at https://getyourhiggs.com.&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with two types of pies, lemon and cherry.&#10;&#10;Game #1-&quot;Beginners Game&quot;&#10;One player makes cherry, one makes lemon.  On each turn, the player uses a spinner to determine the piece they will get, and puts it on their pie plate.  Only one pie at a time is made.  If a piece is too big to fit, the player can discard it or remove other pieces to make it fit. If the size spun isn't available, the player can take the equivalent number of pieces to add up to the fraction. First player to make 3 pies wins.&#10;&#10;Game #2 for two or three players&#10;Each player spins and places the first piece in their pie.  On subsequent turns, the player can place the piece, exchange it for a piece already on their plate, or discard it.  First player to make a whole pie wins the round, and 10 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game comes in print-and-play format as well as a Vassal game module. &#10;One player commands the Roman forces under Scipio, the other player commands the Carthaginian army under Hannibal.

The game comprises a 'master' board with 72 different images upon it, a corresponding set of 72 picture cards and a set of pegs.  Each image on the playing board has a peg hole next to it.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round two images are eliminated by shuffling the picture cards and placing two of them face down over the matching images on the board.  Players then place pegs into the board in whichever spaces they like to mark images.  Everyone has 10 seconds to memorise which images have been marked before the board is  covered up by the box lid.  The picture cards are then turned over one at a time to players in turn.  If a player thinks the image on the card was marked on the board, they take the card.  At the end, players get a point for each correctly taken card and lose a point for each wrongly taken card.  The winner is the one with most points.&#10;&#10;From the box: &quot;The Memory Game That Really Makes You Think!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the company website)&#10;&#10;Guam is a large island for a Pacific island battle. However, it has the fewest exclusive rules of the three games currently in the series (Saipan &amp; Tinian and Attu &amp; Kiska). This means that it should be the easiest and quickest to learn. The large size of the island allows both players to employ a wide variety of strategy options. As with most of the other games in the series, the victory conditions do not focus on geographic locations. The situation is simply a fight between both sides.&#10;&#10;Planning is the first step, and quite possibly the most important one too. The US player has to examine the Japanese dispositions, by looking over the map and using the limited intelligence rules to try to figure out where the Japanese main defenses are. Next in the planning cycle is to pick landing locations and then select the composition and order of your beachheads and landing forces. Once the US player lands on the island he has to eliminate the Japanese units. That is a pretty simple goal, but it may not be as easy as it sounds! You have to do it within the game&rsquo;s time limit. He will have to find that perfect balance between time, maneuver, and combat. Too slow, cautious, or methodical and you run out of time. Too impatient and aggressive and you will suffer too many casualty points to win.&#10;&#10;In Guam the Japanese player has many options; the most of all the games in the series. You still have many of the same conditions as the other games, such as fortifications, being outnumbered, defending against an overwhelming invasion, and your opponent has air and naval superiority. However, you have a large enough force on a large enough island to allow far more opportunity for maneuvering. The Japanese player also has a variety of terrain types to incorporate into his defense. The clever use of dummy positions can fool the US player, making him attack unmanned positions or chasing scattered dummy units all over the map. But as in all the games, the Japanese player must have a well thought out plan with several courses of action in mind. Fortifications and dummies must be well placed in anticipation of US player moves.&#10;&#10;The Series&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion.&#10;&#10;Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours.&#10;&#10;The Pacific Island Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands. The series includes Saipan/Tinian -Vol. I,  Guam - Vol. II and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.&#10;&#10;Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.&#10;&#10;The focus of the series is on the land battles of the Pacific, therefore all naval and air forces are abstract. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.&#10;&#10;This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.&#10;&#10;Game features include:&#10;&#10;1. Limited intelligence.&#10;2. Amphibious Landings&#10;3. Weather and Night rules&#10;4. Banzai attacks&#10;5. Coastal Defense units&#10;6. Beachheads and Replacements&#10;7. Fortifications&#10;&#10;",

Louis Riel, who had fled to the US following the Red River Rebellion in 1870 had been called back by the Metis of Saskatchewan to make their case before the federal government. The result was the Northwest Rebellion, which started with the Battle of Duck Lake in March and ended with the Battle of Loon Lake in June. In the meantime, 5,000 government soldiers covered thousands of kilometers and fought four pitched battles against various First Nations and Metis opponents. Fish Creek was a meeting engagement that caused the government forces to re-evaluate their strategy against the Metis. Cut Knife Hill was a reconnaissance in force, which almost cost the government a &quot;Custer&quot; like tragedy. Frenchman's Butte was an assault on a prepared position designed to free hostages and capture the hostiles of Big Bear's Cree band. Each was a near run affair, and each was a battle of the Northwest Rebellion. Each game is grand tactical in scale, with units representing companies (or their equivalent) per unit (10 men per strength point), and each hex represents approx. 100 yards.&#10;&#10;The game includes the following 5 battles, each with it's own map and counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Fish Creek - April 24, 1885&#10;     Cut Knife Hill - May 2, 1885&#10;     Duck Lake - March 26, 1885&#10;     Frenchman's Butte - May 28, 1885&#10;     Loon Lake - June 3, 1885 &#10;&#10;&#10;",

There goal was to take territory in an effort to put pressure on the British government.&#10;&#10;In 1866, a large, well armed and organized Fenians launched an attack on Canada West (Ontario) to put pressure on the British government. In June of that year, 1,000 Fenians, many of them Civil War veterans, marched into Ontario and were confronted by an equal number of Canadian militia. The Battle of Ridgeway ensued, and ended with the Canadians leaving the field to the Fenians. British regulars were on the way, so the Fenians had to make their escape back into New York. Four years later, the Fenians tried again, this time in Quebec, but things had changed. Canada was now and independent country and the militia system had changed as well. The Battle of Eccles Hill showed how militia could stand up to an invader - the Fenians were repulsed. The Last Invasion is a grand tactical game, with each strength point representing 10 men and each hex representing 80 yards at Ridgeway and 30 yards at Eccles Hill.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the company website)&#10;&#10;The British invasions of the Rio de la Plata were a series of unsuccessful attempts to seize control of the Spanish colonies located around the La Plata Basin in South America (today part of Argentina and Uruguay). The invasions took place between 1806 and 1807, as part of the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain was an ally of France.  The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British Army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. In 1807, a second force occupied Montevideo, remaining for several months, and a third force made a second attempt to take Buenos Aires. After several days of street-fighting against the local militia and Spanish colonial army, in which half of the British forces were killed or wounded, the British were forced to withdraw.&#10;&#10;THE WATERS OF OBLIVION is an operational level wargame of the British attempt to conquer the River Plate area in 1806-1807.  There are two players in each game. One player controls Spanish and Platense forces, the other commands the British forces.  The game uses a simple, but realistic, system to model Napoleonic operations at this scale. Basically, each player's turn consists of the following components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reinforcement: Place new units on the map.&#10;     Siege: attempt to reduce enemy fortresses by using siege units.&#10;     Movement: attempt to move friendly forces by using the March Table; (since command control in this area was limited at best, movement itself can be problematic).&#10;     Combat: friendly forces adjacent to enemy forces may attack them.&#10;     Logistics: out of supply units may be removed from the map.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Except the opponent's Bana.&#10;The Bana is the most important piece : the Bana cannot be captured, and the Bana cannot capture pieces.&#10;Your goal is to threaten spaces where the bana could advance : in this way, you can prevent the opponent's bana from moving towards your own line.&#10;&#10;",

Once three animals have been auctioned, players move around the Market Square spaces before the market closes.  Players then return home and play restarts from the starting square.&#10;&#10;Each player places any animals they obtain onto their personal farm board.

There were two battles outside this tiny Missouri town, one in 1862 as the Confederacy sought to tap the agricultural produce and mineral resources of the surrounding region, and another in late 1864 when Sterling Price&rsquo;s Army of Missouri sought a brief rest during its retreat after the Battle of Westport. Each scenario exemplifies a different tactical situation.&#10;&#10;I Newtonia shows a Federal &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; against the town. A &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo;, in Civil War parlance, is a threatened attack on a stronger enemy which doesn&rsquo;t actually intend to get heavily involved. Demonstrations are economy of force missions, occupying a larger enemy to support other operations. Here, a &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo; simply reminds the Confederates that there was an active opponent in the areas.&#10;&#10;II Newtonia is a classic delaying action. Both armies are fatigued and at the limit of battle worthiness. In addition, Confederate morale was low because of their defeat at Westport, lack of food and absence of any meaningful time to rest. The Federal army is buoyed up by their victory, but is equally tired and hungry.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gothic Checkers is an old German draughts variant (known as &quot;Altdeutsche Dame&quot; in Germany), which was influenced by Turkish Draughts. It is played on an 8x8 square board. Each player starts with 16 stones, 8 on each of the two back ranks. Soldiers move one cell diagonally forward and capture in any of the five cells directly forward, diagonally forward, or sideways. Soldiers promote on the last row. Kings may move and attack in any of the eight directions. Kings can only attack adjacent pieces. The player who captures all enemy stones wins. If there are several choices, the player must capture the largest number.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;&#10;Kings move and capture in any distance like the so-called flying kings in Dama (Turkish Draughts) or International Draughts.&#10;&#10;",

Space include positive and negative dollar amounts, making this a watered down children's version of Monopoly, though there is no buying or selling involved. Occasionally cards are drawn which will augment or deplete a player's cash reserves.&#10;&#10;When players amass a million dollars, they may enter the winner's circle by exact count.  The first person to get there wins.&#10;&#10;Based on the original comics (as opposed to the 80's cartoon) the game is extremely rare and, outside of the first few comic book issues, has become one of the most sought-after Richie Rich collectibles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In fantasy literature, wizards cast spells, control weather and call forth otherworldly creatures. In the real world, however, the &quot;wizards&quot; are actually mathematicians, who use their magic powers of multiplication, subtraction and other operations to transform numbers into a different form.&#10;&#10;In Math-A-Kazam! players try their hand at this math wizardry, using a magnetic wand to pull magnetic number chips from a bowl and creating equations as they do so. The game includes sixty regular number chips (six each 0-9) and ten &quot;gold-rimmed Magic Jewel&quot; number chips (0-9).&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has 30 seconds in which to create an equation. Players must pull chips from the cauldron one at a time and state the equation as they draw each chip, although they can change the equation in mid-play if they can't find the number they need or come across better chips. Equations are created strictly from left to right, ending with the sum or product of the equation with the operators mentally added by the active player. (A variant for math fiends suggests following the order of operations instead of reading the equation from left to right.)&#10;&#10;If a player drops a chip while drawing it from the bowl or fails to create an equation before time runs out, then the player returns all chips to the bowl and ends his turn. Otherwise, he keeps all chips used in his equation.&#10;&#10;Math-A-Kazam! ends once all the chips have been claimed or no more equations can be created. Each normal chips is worth one point; each Magic Jewel chip worth two. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nguyen Hue is a play-by-mail wargame for two players. A map is provided on which players indicate their positions by either writing on a plastic overlay or sticking in pins. On each of the twelve game turns, the Communist player sends in orders which are executed, with the results then sent to the Allied player, who then sends in his or her orders. Each game turn represents one week.&#10;&#10;The game is of moderate complexity, with rules for attritional vs. direct combat, multiple ways of moving Allied troops around, etc. It is possible to win via a political, morale, or territorial victory.&#10;&#10;While the game is designed to be played by mail, this is just to facilitate limited knowledge of opposing unit positions, so it could be played face-to-face with suitable double-blind movement rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A car race simulation. (Any race car type, such as Formula one or FIA GT Dodge Viper). The racetrack supplied is short, with a couple of high speed turns, and a slow chicane. But it is easy to design your own track.&#10;&#10;Main goal of design is speed of play (faster than other games, ref. Formula D) but still with as much simulation as possible. You must set your gearbox (6 gears) prior to race, select tire type and spoiler. On the track your stamina, tire wear, and fuel weight will have an impact on your driving. There are no &quot;artificial&quot; rules to the game, only rules reflecting real racing.&#10;&#10;The name Next Generation is based on a couple of innovative design mechanisms, never seen before. Most significant is the lack of spaces on track to control movement. Instead you gain distance by adding chips, or cubes, or similar to your pool. With no spaces to count, you finish your turn almost instantly.&#10;&#10;A Print and Play (15 pages) simulation. You find the files here in BoardGameGeek file section. (TBA when core rules have been brushed up. Contact designer for current revision if you want them).&#10;&#10;Some hardware needed (Dice, cars and cubes/poker chips)&#10;&#10;Designer:&#10;O.Eker&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Object Of The Game:&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for a player, or partners, to be the first to complete the four corners of a square of any size with pegs of his own color. Such a square is called a King-Square. The first player, or partners, to complete five such King-Squares have won the game.&#10;&#10;Instructions For Two Players:&#10;&#10;Opposing players use different sets of colored pegs. Players take turns alternately in playing a peg in any unoccupied position of the playing field. They continue to do so until one player has completed a the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color. As soon as a King-Square has been made the successful player records the square on his score board. All the pegs are then removed from the playing field and the loser starts play to build another King-Square. This process is repeated after each square is completed until one player has build five such squares with pegs of his own color. The first player to to do so has won the game.&#10;&#10;Building King-Square&#10;&#10;The first player to complete the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color has a King-Square. It makes no difference how many pegs of his own color, or of his opponent, are inside this square - or on the sides of the square - or in between his pegs on the four corners of the square - all that matters is that all the pegs on the four corners of the square are pegs of his own color.&#10;&#10;Squares made at an angle do not count. A King-Square must be parallel to the sides of the playing field and the rows and columns of holes. A square must be made up of four sides of equal length. A square is a figure having four equal sides and four right angles. A rectangle is not a square.&#10;&#10;Partnership play - four players&#10;&#10;As in Bridge, four players can play as two pairs of partners, each pair sitting opposite each other. Each pair uses pegs of the same color, dividing the pegs between them at the start of the game. All four players take turns alternately in placing their pegs, going clockwise around the table. As soon as a King-Square has been made it is recorded and a new square is started. As with two players, the game is won by the partners who are first to complete five King-Squares.&#10;&#10;",
