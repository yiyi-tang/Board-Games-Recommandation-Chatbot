    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;In March 1939, the small nation of Slovakia declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and immediately became a satellite of Nazi Germany. Slovak troops became the first Axis forces to fight alongside the Germans, joining in the invasion of Poland in September 1939. They also marched into the Soviet Union in 1941. After five years as the most minor of allies, the Slovaks turned against the fascists and fought with the victorious Allies in the last year of the war.&#10;&#10;First Axis is a 64-page book supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focused on the battles of the Slovak Army against the Hungarians, Poles, Soviets and Germans. There are 30 new scenarios plus background articles on the armies and weapons involved and unit organization diagrams. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game, Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game and White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book to enjoy all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;First Axis includes 88 die-cut and mounted playing pieces. Almost all of them represent Slovak forces, including the small country's surprisingly large array of tanks. There are also a few new Hungarian tank pieces included. The book's format is the same as our very popular White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book and Fronte Russo: A Panzer Grenadier Expansion Book books.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A red light starts to blink and a nasty wailing sound is played. Then, suddenly, the light will turn green and sound goes silent. At that point, players must push the button in their handle. The LAST player to do that gets an electrical shock. Players will also be shocked, if they push the button while the light is red.&#10;&#10;&quot;Extreme&quot; mode : in this mode ONLY the fastest button pusher is safe, while the rest are shocked. Obviously this only makes a difference with 3 or 4 players. With 2, it plays identical to the original.&#10;&#10;&quot;Revenge&quot; mode : in this mode each player chooses who they would like to shock if they were to win. Press the button on the handle until the red light on your base control is targeting your chosen victim. The 3 lights correspond as follows : centre is the player opposite, left is the player to your left and right is the player to your right. Start the game and the fastest finger gets to shock their chosen victim.&#10;&#10;The game uses three AAA batteries, so the shock is not dangerous, but it certainly adds an element of tension to the otherwise rather simple test of reacting speed.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Lightning Reaction&#10;    Lightning Reaction Extreme&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Best estimates today have it that the war in Europe most likely would have continued for about 24 months after February 1944 had it not been for the cumulative effects of the Allied strategic aerial offensive against the Germans. That means the war was most likely shortened somewhere between 13 and 15 months by the effects of that campaign. We say &quot;most likely&quot; and &quot;somewhere between&quot; because we can't be more certain. That is, starting at the end of 1944, the Western Allied and Soviet ground advances began to add their resource-denying effects to the successes being scored by the bombers. Where precisely the effects of the one effort picked up and the other left off is, and will likely always remain, a matter of debate.&#10;&#10;We can, however, use that December 1944 cut off date to our advantage in this game. We know for certain that prior to that time any collapse of the German war effort would mostly certainly have been due to the bombings' effects. If the &quot;Bomber Barons&quot; were to prove they could win a war with their planes alone, we can now see they had to do it by that date. Thus the would-be Bomber Barons in today's wargame hobby must also bring their efforts to fruition by that time in the game in order to win.&#10;&#10;In general, each &quot;game turn&quot; represents the cumulative effects of one month of aerial operations. Note, though, Game Turn 3 represents two calendar months. That's because a large portion of US aircraft strength was drawn away from this campaign during that time in order to assist in the battlefield preparation for the D-Day landings. There are a maximum of 10 game turns to each campaign.&#10;&#10;The large-size, fully iconic, counters included with the game (176 total), are by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi. They represent air groups and wings, along with German FLAK brigades and divisions. Aside from all the formations historically involved in the campaign, an extended German Me-262 order of battle is included. That will allows players to determine, once and for all, exactly how many of those remarkable planes it would've taken to have finally and fully stopped the American onslaught.&#10;&#10;Each large hex on the map represents 33.33 miles (54 Km) from side to opposite side. The game is of intermediate complexity, is intended for two players, and takes about six hours to complete.&#10;&#10;",

The units consist of two sizes of tanks (small and large), both made of wood.&#10;&#10;Each player has 10 small tanks and 8 big tanks. The tanks may move diagonaly in every direction. The small tanks have a moving range up to 6 spaces, while the big ones may move up to 4 spaces. Immediately after moving, the tanks may shot at an enemy tank. Shooting is only permitted straight ahead in the direction of the enemy encampment. The small tanks have a firing range of exactly 3 spaces, the big ones can shoot at tanks that are 3 or 4 spaces ahead. The dark green spaces can't be moved on, but can be shot over. When a tank is hit, it is removed from the game. If a tank neglects to shoot at an enemy, it may be removed by the enemy player. A tank, which has a friendly tank in the space in front of it, is protected from beeing shot at. If a tank reaches the enemy encampment, it reverses it's direction and attacks from the back. This makes a pincer tactic possible. The player who destroys the whole tank force of his opponent wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
