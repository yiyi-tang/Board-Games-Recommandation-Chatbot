    "Description": "Freedom Rings is a game based on the idea that an economy is a community that can be free and fair to all. The richest don&rsquo;t always win and victory is what you choose it to be. The game board is inspired by a thriving city; with the greatest land values in its heart, medium land values in the suburbs, and the lowest land values in the rural areas. Freedom Rings&rsquo; blends economics, ease of play, and short time to finish.&#10;&#10;Each player receives the 7 goal cards and chooses a single goal card to secretly play.  The game is played with the 3 playing pieces, one for each of the three property rings. Before each turn, the player must choose which ring to play. The first time a player plays a ring, if it&rsquo;s with a die roll, the playing piece starts at the Pay Interest Street.  The playing pieces move clockwise around the board. Every turn, except for the first turn and power plays, requires a die roll. The die roll isn&rsquo;t to determine what property you claim, but to keep players moving around the board and to see if rent is due to another player.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, all players have no money, no property, and no debt. Acquiring property is the way for a player to achieve their goal. The community is the bank, so players will volunteer to watch the flows of cash and debt as needed. Turn by turn, players accumulate properties. Tactics to win can include the following: acquiring properties after a die roll, purchasing other property, consolidating properties, trading acquired property for vacant property trading with other players.  Other tactics become available as the game&rsquo;s economy grows and include earning the ability to change production point values, interest rates, and even your chosen goal. Only the wiliest will make the most of what is freely given in this game.&#10;&#10;A player wins by achieving a goal chosen from seven goal cards available. Victory can be had with much wealth, or little wealth,  depending upon the chosen card. Players claim property squares on the board with every turn until they&rsquo;ve acquired what&rsquo;s needed as stated on their chosen goal card. Final scoring is calculated with the value for each property square, less the player&rsquo;s debt.&#10;&#10;",

Players win by completing the scenario objectives (rescue the hostages, survive 4 turns, breach the door, etc). At the start of each round, the players will decide on their activation order (called Squad Formation). This determines that player's Initiative and Action Points. On a player's activation, that player can play Skill Cards from their hand to perform actions (move, shoot, melee, etc) or equip permanents into play. Combat is resolved using our dice-less Dual Weapon Ammo Deck system.&#10;&#10;",

The terrain will make it a difficult task. If they fail, the Allied forces will launch a counter-attack with the aim of driving the Japanese into the sea.&#10;&#10;The system focuses on the effect prolonged periods of combat in difficult terrain had on combat units. Units which fight for too long without respite are vulnerable to counter-attack. Each side must manage their forces with respect to fatigue, which represents combat exhaustion and ammunition expenditure, and the inherent logistical difficulties this campaign posed.&#10;&#10;Can the Japanese capture Port Moresby? In this simulation they can, but it is difficult.&#10;&#10;Also challenging is the task of crushing the Japanese beachheads on the north coast.&#10;&#10;Purchase via direct digital download at : https://www.wargamevault.com/product/379181/Operation-RI?src=hottest&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The nuclear apocalypse has struck, leaving the world's culinary supply in shambles. Choose a Survivor to battle it out for new nuclear delicacies while wielding hilarious makeshift weapons fueled with ridiculous visual puns to combat your opponents.&#10; Hostile Hoarders is a game of war and self preservation for 2-5 players. Each survivor plays 4 weapon cards face down in front of them. Choose from one of your attacking weapon cards and pair it with an opponent's defending weapon card. Compare your attacking power to their defending power. The winner of the battle has prevailed and collects their reward. If the attacking player has conquered, they receive a meal that day, collecting one ration card. If the defender has bested the battle, they flip their defending weapon back face down and steal thee attacker&rsquo;s weapon for their own, adding it to their hand.&#10;&#10;Various instants can be added to aid in the skirmish.&#10;When you have depleted all of your fellow survivor&rsquo;s defense, go in for the kill. Attack a player with no facedown cards in front of them, and collect their survivor card as a reward. No food, only glory. When all other survivors are eliminated or a player has collected 10 ration points, you are the glutton of the apocalypse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zip Zap Zop is a unique combination of deck-building and trick-taking that allows players to play a trick-taking game where they decide what cards they get dealt. This new concept gives the agency and strategy of a deck-building game, while maintaining the quick-paced, tactical nature of a trick-taking game.&#10;&#10;The theme is integrated throughout, with players taking on the role of comedians in an improv show. The card play has the players interacting with each other in an improv scene and the new cards they buy are suggestions from the audience for the next scene.&#10;&#10;Zip Zap Zop&rsquo;s trick-taking follows the rules of a standard trick-taker, with a few differences:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You may be able to play more than 1 card to the trick.&#10;     Some cards are modifiers that modify a played card.&#10;     If a player ever plays the same number as the previous card, then that player may play an additional card to the trick. The played cards then add, forming a new number.&#10;     After playing tricks, players will buy cards using the number of tricks they won as currency. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players earn ring cards at launching pad locations spread across the board. Once at one of these locations, players draw a corresponding ring card and successfully complete all instructions listed on the card. This usually requires players to make one or more successful tiki tosses. A tiki toss consists of a player swinging a metal ring, so that it catches on a hook attached to a tiki pole in the middle of the game board. As players move along paths to and from the different Launching Pads, they will encounter tiki heads that may help or hinder their progress.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Your Village is in trouble with the Tiki Forces that be!  They are angry and demand 5 Precious Rings in order to spare the Village.  Two to Six Villagers are chosen to brave the dangers of Tiki Toss Adventure Island but there can only be one Hero! Can you be the first to collect the five rings (Gold, Silver, Ruby, Emerald, Coral) and return them to the village?&#10;&#10;In order to collect the 5 rings, Players must embark on a journey through Quicksand Beach, The Isle of Fire, The Fourth Sister, The Ghost of the Galleon and Head Hunter Hill.  Along the way, Tiki Toss skills are essential! Although each player must beware of Sirens, Eruptions, being sentenced to the Pit and more, the biggest challenges can come from an opponent! You may be skipped, reversed or have a ring stolen by an opponent at any time! Trust no one. The stakes are high and the race back to the Village is on!&#10;&#10;To be the Hero requires a balance of Luck and Skill!

    "Description": "Suipi is a classic Samoan card game played using a standard deck of cards, similar in play to &quot;Casino&quot; or &quot;Scopa&quot;.&#10;&#10;Play starts with four cards being laid face up in the middle of the table, and eight cards being dealt to each player. The goal of the game is to capture the most points by matching cards and building stacks of cards. While regional rules may slightly alter how the game is played, some standard rules apply.&#10;&#10;To gather a card from the table, players play a card from their hand which matches a table card in number, or matches the sum of two table cards (if the player has a 9 in their hand, they can gather a 5 and 4 from the table for example). Additionally, cards can be stacked (built) and taken as a stack on the next turn, but only if the player has the stacked number in their hand (for example, a 7 could be built onto a 3 to create a 10, allowing a player with a 10 in their hand to gather the whole stack on their turn). Face cards have no value and can only be gathered using matching face cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, if a player plays a card which matches several cards, stacks, or sums of individual cards on the table, the player may take all those cards. For example, if a player plays a 10 and there is on the table a 10, a stack of 3 &amp; 7, and individually a 6 and 4 the player may take all of those cards as their 10 matches the first individual card, the total stack number, and the sum of the individual 6 and 4 cards.&#10;&#10;If a player can not gather a card, they must 'drop' a card onto the table from their hand. If all cards are removed from the table, the player who removed the last card immediately scores 1 point and proclaims 'Suipi!'. The other player must then drop a card to continue the round. &quot;Suipi&quot; is played over 3 rounds, with each round ending when both player's hands are exhausted. Cards on the table remain there between rounds. At the end of the 3rd round, when cards run out of players hands', any cards remaining on the table go to the player which completed the most recent match.&#10;&#10;Points are scored per round as follows:&#10;Most cards = 3 points&#10;10 of Diamonds = 2 points&#10;2 of Spades = 1 point&#10;Most Spades = 1 point&#10;Aces = 1 point each&#10;Each Suipi = 1 point (scored during the rounds)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Note: depending on the village the game is learned in, scoring may be slightly different&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was made by wholesale store &quot;Makro&quot; (or &quot;Metro&quot; in Germany) for their 25 year anniversary in the Netherlands. You play this trivia game with 2 to 4 teams of each 2 to 4 players in it. Every team put their pawn (a brain) on the start position. The first team to reach the finish wins.&#10;&#10;During your turn you will pick the top card from the pile. On each card there are 2 themes, one on each side of the card, and you have 10 seconds to decide which side you want to play.&#10;&#10;After choosing the side you want to play, you get 60 seconds to guess the words written on the card which belong to the theme on the top of the card (Dutch writers, capital cities, Makro employer titles, types of cheese). The team to the right of the playing team is the control team, which tallies how many correct answers are given.&#10;&#10;The answers are written on the card but have a red coating over them which makes them almost invisible to read, the game also features a pair of sunglasses with red-tainted glasses which can see through the coating and can read the correct answers (this pair of sunglasses is for the control team).&#10;&#10;If no correct answer is given in the first 30 seconds, the first answer is given by the control team as a hint, this answer does not count towards the score. After the 60 seconds are over, the playing team moves their pawn as many spots as their score and then the control team becomes the new playing team.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, some spots on the board have a special action like &quot;Go back 3 spots&quot;, which goes into effect immediately when a team lands on it, or &quot;if you can at least 5 correct answers next turn, move one extra spot forward&quot; or &quot;Lose a turn&quot;, which goes into effect on their next turn. The board has 48 spaces, including the start and the finish space.&#10;&#10;",

The player on the turn rolls the dice once and moves on by the number of dice rolled, whoever rolls a 6 may roll the dice again and move, foreign figures are skipped, there can be several figures on one field. At the end of the turn, you perform the event that belongs to the square you landed on - on some squares you get cards that bring you to Gargamel's castle or save you from it. The first player to get his figure back to the start/finish square is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hooks are in the game, but the game has no hook, but works well! How? Well, you are supposed to fish for the most points and this happens with the longest words possible. In the game there are hooks with two ends, each hook carries a letter, the 74 orange hooks the common letters with value 1, the 14 green hooks the already somewhat more difficult letters with value 2 - B, F, G, H and K - and the 12 red hooks provide the problem cases with value 3 - C, J, P, Q, V, X, W and Z. The underlines on some hooks are wildcards for every other letter. The underscores on some hooks are wild cards for every other letter.&#10;&#10;In turn, everyone thinks of a word, preferably with the reachable letters, takes the first letter from the pile, holds the hook vertically and fishes the next letter from the pile with the lower hook, until you have formed a valid word. The letters must be strung in the correct order and direction, otherwise the turn ends. If a letter falls from the hook, the turn also ends without points, letters are always put back. As I said, you can only use reachable letters and must not shuffle the pile. If you have a valid word, you keep it. If all letters are used up or no meaningful word is possible anymore, you win with the most points from the collected words.&#10;&#10;A creative variation of the word-building games! Of course, it gets harder as more and more letters go out of play, but in return you may be able to form shorter but more valuable words as difficult letters are uncovered. Creativity, vocabulary and a steady hand are required and deliver fun!&#10;&#10;",

Players use their item cards to move a princess onto a matching space on the board. The princesses don&rsquo;t share spaces, so players can get the princesses really moving by playing the same item card twice and jumping over the other princesses. Mixed into the item cards are obstacle cards. These obstacles take time to overcome and when a player draws an obstacle card, the leaf token falls one space closer to the ground. Players must get all of the princess heroes back to the castle before the leaf token reaches the ground and the castle curse cannot be broken.&#10;&#10;The bright and colorful image-based gameplay makes Princess Heroes easy to learn and fun to play! Once players know the rules there is no reading required, which makes this a fun way for kids to use basic strategy skills and reduces competition by having the players work together to beat the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now the God-Emperor of Egypt must deliberate who will fill the position.&#10;&#10;After a revealing dream, where the God-Emperor has a conversation with the God Khepri himself (Scarab God of Ancient Egypt), it is decided that the way of election must be by confronting the Priests to a battle of cunning and strategy that will leave one of them on top.&#10;&#10;In Khepri, players play the role of an aspiring Priest of the Order of Khepri. The winner of the game will be elected the new High Priest.&#10;&#10;Khepri is a board game for 2 to 4 PLAYERS, where there is no chance, therefore what prevails is strategy and logic. It is an abstract game where the number of players, per game, forces to change the strategy to win. Duration: 30 min. to 45 min.&#10;The rules are very easy to learn, as they occupy only 1 sheet of paper. Three types of maneuvers, movement and how to score.&#10;&#10;The game has been completely designed by Pere Martinez, who already has some other experience in this game world, such as Kao.&#10;For the magnificent illustration of the box and the design of the board we have counted on Amy Kitsune.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

Deceive your opponents until they shout out Poppycock! Clever meets crafty in this tactical game guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.&#10;&#10;Choose a player to answer the first question. That player rolls the dice. The player to their right reads them the question from the category shown on the dice. If the dice is blank, the player answering the question may choose whichever category they want. The question, and multiple-choice answers, are read out, without the questioner turning over the card. The answering player must declare whether they know it or don&rsquo;t know it. If they don&rsquo;t know it, the turn ends, the questioner turns the card over and reads out the answer, and play continues clockwise. Discard the question card that was used and pass the dice to the next player.&#10;&#10;If they declare they know it, the player must declare how many spaces they are playing for. The player can declare 1, 2, or 3 spaces. This represents how many spaces they will be allowed to move if they get the answer right, or if no one challenges their answer. Additionally, this number represents the number of spaces other players will be allowed to move if they correctly Poppycock! the player answering the question (i.e. if they can determine that the player is trying to bluff). Once the answering player has declared whether they know it, and how many spaces they are playing for, players take turns to say Poppycock! if they do not believe them, or Persuaded! if they do. Starting with the player to the left of the answering player, each player must declare Poppycock! or Persuaded!&#10;&#10;If all players are Persuaded!, the answering player will move their declared number of spaces, without having to provide an answer. If any amount of players shout Poppycock!, an answer must be given by the answering player. This answer is checked by the questioner on the reverse of the card. If the answering player was correct, they move forwards their declared number of spaces, while each poppycock-er moves backwards that number of spaces. If the answering player was incorrect, they go back their declared number of spaces, while each poppycock-er moves forwards the declared number of spaces. When all moves have been resolved, discard the question card that was used and pass the dice to the next player. Proceed in a clockwise direction, with the player to the answering player&rsquo;s left being the next player to roll the dice and answer a question.&#10;&#10;",

One circle of each player is placed in the center together with the circle of the other players so that these circles touch each other, so to speak, form a square. The remaining circles are laid out in a circle around this center square with about a hand's width between them; there should be space between the circles and circles of the same color should not be directly adjacent or too close together. The 36 shape cards in six colors - yellow, orange, blue, purple, dark green and red - are laid out in an unordered pile, with each shape once per color.&#10;&#10;The active player rolls the dice and takes any shape card of that color and places it on the table so that it touches a circle or another already existing shape card. If there is no matching shape card left in the supply, take any card of that color from the table and place it somewhere else. In this way, each player tries to be the first to connect his own circles with shape cards. The player who succeeds first is the immediate winner.&#10;&#10;Cheerful, colorful, simple and an enjoyable, loose practice of spatial imagination and use of space; for example, you can put the fish and the starfish mouth to tip, or put the head of the gobbler in the crook of the starfish or mushroom - so you can overcome long distances, or avoid making it too easy for the other players to connect their own circles faster.&#10;&#10;",

What neither of them know: They contracted the new NOSO virus (STILL SO a virus) while on vacation! Only after three days of incubation do they feel sick and stay at home. But how many residents have the two infected meanwhile unnoticed?&#10;Can a major virus outbreak still be prevented?&#10;&#10;Virusalarm in Bleibhausen is a free game for children and adolescents from the age of 12 that was developed with scientists from IST Austria and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. By reenacting the spread of a fictional virus in a city, players will explore and understand what countermeasures can take to contain viruses. In the Home Edition for the home, the players slip into the role of scientists ( game variants &ldquo;simulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccination &rdquo;), or into the role of politicians who have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of restrictions on public life ( game variant &ldquo;Challenge &rdquo; ).&#10;&#10;Chips symbolize people, yellow ones are sick, white ones are still healthy. They are distributed in different buildings on a game board that depicts the fictional city of Bleibhausen. If there are white chips with yellow ones in a building, e.g. the restaurant, they become infected and turn yellow.&#10;&#10;Players try to minimise the spread and earn points depending on how well they control the disease.  The player/team with the most points, wins.&#10;&#10;Es ist ein sch&ouml;ner Fr&uuml;hlingstag, als im 100-Einwohner St&auml;dtchen Bleibhausen zwei Leute vom Skiurlaub zur&uuml;ckkommen.

So, that's why we've come up with 130 ridiculous scenarios that will embarrass everyone one card a time and you'll find yourself belly laughing on the ground not caring that someone just pee'd there.&#10;&#10;The game goes a little something like this:&#10;&#10;Person A picks up from the deck and reads the card aloud to everyone &quot;What are the Odds?&quot; Person B (The person to their right aka righty) chooses the odds to make this between. This cannot be any higher than 10 or any lower than 2. The closer to 10, the less chance of the odds being chosen. The closer to 2, the more change of the odds being chosen because yeah...it's a one in two chance.&#10;&#10;Person A &amp; B think of a number between those odds set by Person B.  Everyone counts 3,2,1....then at the same time Person A &amp; Person B say the number they were thinking between those odds given.&#10;&#10;If they say the same number, then Person B must do the task for the points or risk loosing points. If they don't say the same number, then it moves on to Person B pulling a card and reading it to Person C. (or back to Person A if you are playing with 2 people)&#10;&#10;The name of the game is to get the most points and win. You decide on how many points that is as a group before starting.&#10;&#10;",
