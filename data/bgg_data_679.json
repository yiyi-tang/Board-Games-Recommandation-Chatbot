    "Description": "El Salvador Spel is a game about the El Salvadoran Civil War and the events leading up to it, in abstracted form. Players each receive a role card - roles include military, guerrilla, plantation worker, and Archbishop &Oacute;scar Romero - which determines how they play and what their goals are. Play takes place on a large square grid with areas designated as guerrilla camps, plantations, mass demonstrations, etc. Players roll dice and move their pieces and pieces representing resistance movement members in order to occupy the various areas; occupying an area provides a benefit depending on the type.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 24-page booklet containing the rules, historical background, &quot;news&quot; items and military tactics for use during the game. In addition, there are cardstock sheets bound in to the booklet. These are cut apart to create the role cards and cards depicting the various board areas. The players have to supply the board, dice, pawns, and resistance movement markers.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 13 players (one of whom runs the game and one of whom is in charge of the news), but can be played with more or fewer by doubling up players or roles. No specific minimum or maximum numbers are given.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "48 cards, 16 with a number on them (1,2,3 or 4) and the other cards are illustrations of flora and fauna. The numbered cards are all examples of what not to do in the country. I do not have the rules sadly but an educated guess is that it is a game related to Beat Your Neighbors, the traditional children's card game. The cards are dealt equally amongst the players. In his turn, a player turns over one card. If it does not have a number on it, the next player turns over a card, and so on. If a numbered card appears, the next player must turn over cards equal to that number. If that player turns over a number when doing this, the next player must turn over cards. If no number is turned over when 'paying the penalty', the person who played the number collects all the cards and puts them at the bottom of his stack. The winner is the one who has captured all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "52 cards in 13 sets of four. They are all illustrated with characters from a specific country and they consist of, for example, Mr America, Miss America (both in colour) and a Mr America and a Miss America (not in colour). The object is to win tricks by the pairing of two cards relating to the same country. The pairs maybe a wedding pair, a pair of spinsters or a pair of bachelors. Each pair has a value in points. A 'Society' Wedding (the two coloured cards of a country scores 5 points. A 'Quiet' Wedding (The two non-coloured cards of a country or one with colour and one without) scores 3 points. A Pair of Spinsters or Pair of Bachelors (from the same country) scores 1 point. If you can collect all four cards from a country, you can score bonus points; Two Society Wedding Pairs 15 points; Two Wedding Pairs - no Society Wedding 10 points; Pair of Spinsters and a Pair of Bachelors 6 points.&#10;The game play is interesting. Players draw a card and place it to start to form rows of cards face-up. Five such cards are permitted in a row. If two cards from the same country 'touch' each other (vertically, horizentally or diagonal) then that pair is taken by the player. If a pair is taken the remaining cards are moved to the left of their row. If a card reaches the left end of a row and needs to be moved it is added to the right end of the row above.&#10;Play several hands and the first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&#10;A solitaire variant is also reccomended in the rules.&#10;Undated but it was probably in Austerity Britain in the 1950's (The rules say that there are only limited numbers of the game available, due to quota restrictions).&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to that long-sought item, the Machine will work now. It will take you to London in 1888, where and when the forever war between good and evil is fought. The most extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen are already gathering there, writing the fate of mankind in crimson letters.&quot;&#10;&#10;Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is a fast paced skirmish boardgame that takes you to the Victorian Capital.&#10;&#10;Assemble a league of your 3 to 6 favourite extraordinary Ladies &amp; Gentlemen and fight your opponents' leagues in a challenge with London herself.&#10;&#10;Its simple rules make Smog, the Thirteenth Hour a fast and easy to board game, whereas its unique 88 action cards set and wide range of original characters make Smog as instinctive as tactical.&#10;&#10;Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is a miniature board game for two players or more set in the 1888 Victorian capital, the theatre of fierce fights between the most extraordinary characters. Characters of Smog, the Thirteenth Hour are ideally materialized on the board by miniatures from the Smog, a Victorian Fantasy range published by Smart Max. Each miniature from Smart Max represents a fantastic character from the Smog universe. For more information about our little madnesses, visit www.smartmaxstore. com&#10;&#10;If Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is your first miniature experience, imagine a weird chess game where each piece is a unique character, with dreadful fighting skills and likely to cast magic spells. Each of these pieces is played turn after turn, until a player claims victory. More than a game, Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is an open door on your own imagination. After assimilating the rules, you&rsquo;ll be able to create your own original adventures as well as design your own extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen.&#10;&#10;Most of the time, eliminating all of your opponent&rsquo;s miniatures or a large proportion of them will bring you victory. The scenarios proposed in this booklet present different set-ups, including variant rules and particular victory conditions.&#10;&#10;",

Now, warlords ruling  multiple star systems seek to add to their domain through conquest of other sovereign  planets. Their weapons of choice are gigantic robots, 10 20 meters tall, fully armored and  bristling with guns. The pilots of these &quot;mecha&quot; are the new knights of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Note: to use these rules, you will need a hexagonal battle map and figures or markers for  the mecha. If playing with miniatures, assume all distances are in inches rather than hexes,  and changes of facing can be up to 90 degrees instead of a single hex face. &#10;&#10;user summary:&#10;War of the Mecha is a minimalist Mecha-themed tactical  micro-wargame.  War of the Mecha reduces the level of complexity of combat as compared to BattleTech, offering a lighter set of rules (one-page for the 1.0 version) while retaining the flavour of the genre.&#10;&#10;",

Disgust  with the &quot;Wars of Succession&quot; spurred the General into self-imposed exile, far  outside the Known Sphere of systems. There, he created his own society, based on a  caste system ruled by the bravest and brightest warriors of the Star Federation's  military. Organized into clans, taught to place honor before and above all else, the  General's followers drilled and trained for generations, knowing one day they would  return to human colonized space, unifying all the squabbling warlords in a single,  bloody Jihad. That day has arrived!&#10;&#10;Note: these rules are a supplement for the one-page micro-game War of the Mecha.  You will need War of the Mecha to use these rules. These rules are ADDITIONS to the  War of the Mecha standard game.&#10;&#10;user summary:&#10;This supplement to War of the Mecha adds rules for clan-level engagements: increased pilot skill, mecha build variations, additional rules of engagement and guidelines for orders of battle.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, each card has its own twist. Sometimes, a player may overshoot his goals and go from the most liked, to the least. In addition, players have gold that can be used to pay off the executioner from getting them this round, but that is only a stay of death. And the gold can be used to buy special cards.

Players reveal these cards simultaneously, then they must quickly determine which animal is victorious among those revealed &ndash; elephant, cat, mouse, &quot;no winner&quot; &ndash; and grab the correct coconut. If a player does so, he claims the cards revealed; if he goofs, he receives a penalty point. Collect three of these, and you're booted out of the jungle.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score three points for each marmoset collected, one point for each other animal and negative one point for each penalty. High score wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes two variants: In one, six &quot;disguise&quot; cards are mixed into the deck, and when a disguise is turned up, then for that round all cats are instead mice (or elephants are cats, etc.) In the second variant, the disguise cards are used along with defense cards, such as an elephant depicted with cheese; in this case, the cheese distracts the mice, so the mice will lose to elephants. Four cards are revealed each round instead of three.&#10;&#10;",

Each card represents one of 54 different gods and the three most important aspects [represented by icons] that each God represented. Each player represents a Temple Priest and starts with 3 cards, 5 scarabs [money], and a player card referred to as the TEMPLE. Each turn, players draw one or two cards, which are played to that player&rsquo;s Temple. The card icons determine where they may be placed on the Temple in order to maximize sets of Canopic Jars. For each matching icon you receive one Scarab. For each SET of Scarabs you receive 2, 3, or 4 Jars. At the end of each of the three rounds of play, for each set of four different Jars - you gain one Pharaoh. Rounds stop when the deck is emptied or three cards with special CHAOS icons are showing. At the end of the game, the Priest with the most Pharaohs wins.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-4 players, but comes with 15 extra cards and an extra Temple to add a 5th player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is as simple as the name. The whole of UNLOCKED is based around the theme of skeleton keys and their many components.&#10;&#10;UNLOCKED features 2 decks of cards. There are the key cards, and the key component cards. The key components can be assembled to create any of the keys on the key cards.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the dealer (who has already dealt every player a hand of cards). The dealer then flips the first key card over. He then draws 2 cards and then plays or discards 2 cards. Cards can either be played to build the key or can be played to do nasty little things, like destroy another players key or remove the flipped key altogether.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, each player takes turns building their keys to match the one flipped. After the first key is made, 2 additional keys are flipped. The longer the key, the more points it is worth. The first player to 25 points wins.&#10;&#10;It is the subtle details in this game that add to the strategy. The special cards and bluffing the other players each have their own strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives 8 cards, the rest forms the draw pile. One card is then flipped over from the draw pile, and the start player tries to place one of her cards so that the colours line up with this card. Play then proceeds with the next player trying to line up one of his cards with one of the face-up cards. If a player cannot line up any of his cards, he draws cards until he can; if the draw pile has run out, he misses his turn instead. The game ends if one player manages to get rid of all her cards, in which case she wins, or, if no more cards can be placed, in which case the player with the fewest cards left wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Strategic Campaign of The English Civil Wars. Includes Historical and Hypothetical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Game designed to be playable and fun and concentrates on the strategic elements of the war. Some tactical elements do come into play with differences between Pike, Musketeers, Dragoons,Forts, and Navies. Another aspect to the game is the Scottish dimension and trying to keep Scotland in the war.&#10;&#10;Included with the game are secret order cards, either General Direction cards, or, Orders to the Armies.Once played, players are committed to a certain move or order thereby adding to the Fog of War.&#10;&#10;The game comes in `Kit` form which means some preparation is required.(Cutting counters and adding 10 sided dice ).All counters are Regiments of Pike,Musket,Horse, etc&#10;Players recruit armies from either an historical or free set up.Army Commanders are then deployed to units (5 per Royalist and Parliament).Orders are then issued secretly to armies stacked only with Commanders from a pool of movement tokens ( i.e North, South, West, East, South East, North West, etc).&#10;Movement is up to 3 areas for Foot, 4 for Horse, and 1 for Guns. Players then roll a die to reveal who has the turn initiative and players then reveal their orders and move units checking for possible contacts with the enemy.  If contact is made with the enemy, tactic cards come into play, each side either playing, Search,Hold, or Evade and rolling a 10 sided die for the outcome, which may still lead to armies not engaging in battle. If battles do occur, then they are resolved using  10 sided dice and cross checking a percentage number for units engaged (Pike,Musket,Dragoons,Horse,Guns,Siege,Ships) on a Fire and Melee table. An example of Pike on Melee is 60%, so if 3 Pike regiments were involved in a battle on either side, 3 10 sided dice would be rolled and would hit on a roll of 1-6.&#10;These rolls can be adjusted by terrain the defender holds, and the Commanders used, who gain battle experience the further the game goes on. Most Commanders start at experience level&#10;0 or 1.Both The King and Cromwell start at 0 experience.&#10;The game is played in weekly turns and starts from Jan 1642 and lasts till September 1650 (a possible 36 turns ).Players may also recruit further armies during recruiting phases in&#10;1643, 1646, and 1649.&#10;&#10;",

Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and chooses one of the four characteristics (courage, creativity, coolness, musicality) which all have a specific score. After choosing the category all players turn the card and place it on the gameboard so that everybody can see it. Now the players compare the score of the chosen characteristic. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. If there's a tie, then the cards remain on the board till the next round. The winner of the next round also gets those cards. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.&#10;&#10;For collecting purposes people have made their own interpretation of the game or let the winner choose a card from one of the losers decks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Duel Masters is an abstract two-player game in which each player (starting at opposite ends of the map) must reach the opponent's starting position by building a chain of game pieces.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a square grid rotated 45&deg;. The pieces are played on intersections, like Go. Each player puts 3 of her pieces in her starting position, then players take turn playing three pieces at a time. Pieces can be played anywhere as long as they are connected to another of the player's pieces. The opponent's pieces can be taken by playing another piece on top of them, which can sever the opponent's chain. Once a piece is taken, the space it's in can't be taken again, it remains in control of the player who took the piece.&#10;&#10;Once an uninterrupted chain is built between the two starting positions, the player who built the chain is declared winner.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to win two rounds wins the game. If you assemble a 333 cube from nine blocks or in a single color, then you win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of four games in the Subbuteo racing series, which also included &quot;Table Speedway&quot;, and &quot;Horse Racing&quot; and &quot;Cycle Speedway.&quot; All were dexterity games, designed by Peter Adolph, the inventor of Subbuteo. They used a ball bearing rolled down a tube to propel a Subbuteo style base around a racing track.&#10;&#10;This version of the racing game was an attempt to simulate automobile racing. Like all games in the series, the rules were very similar to those of the parent game, but varied somewhat from those of &quot;Table Speedway&quot; in order to allow for the representation of the sport.&#10;&#10;According to Peter Upton, the game variations were as follows:&#10;&#10;&quot;The game was played with a minimum of two, and a maximum of six players. So there could be six cars on the track rather than just the four bikes in speedway. The number of cars is divided by the number of drivers (players), so 2 players get 3 cars each, 3 players get 2 cars each, or you could have 4, 5, or 6 players with a car each.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Drivers drew for positions on the start line. (although there is nothing to stop you from having qualifying laps)&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A race could consist of one or more laps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The different size ball-bearings still signified different gear ratios, but drivers could select any one they wished at their turn.

    "Description": "Subbuteo Horse Racing (also simply called &quot;Horse Racing&quot;) was the third in the family of Subbuteo racing games, which also included &quot;Table Speedway&quot;, &quot;Table Motor Racing&quot;, and &quot;Cycle Speedway.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was a dexterity game. All games in the series used a very similar mechanic: a ball bearing was dropped down a tube and used to propel a playing piece around a racing track. This particular game simulated horse racing, and the pieces were horses and jockeys mounted on Subbuteo style bases. This used the same basic rules as other games in the series, with some variations to account for the sport being represented.&#10;&#10;The variations were as follows:&#10;&#10;&quot;The race track may be regulation size, or possibly you may care to improvise its shape, but movement areas should not exceed 8&quot; in length. This measurement should be taken on the inside of the track.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When the horse has reached the distance post (two movement areas before the Winning Post) no horse is allowed to cross directly in front of another horse. If a horse crosses another in this fashion and within this area and subsequently finishes first, second, or third, the jockey on the crossed horse may lodge an objection, which will be automatically sustained. The offending horse is then placed last and the other horses naturally move up to fill the vacant place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Once round the track will be a Five Furlong Sprint race. Twice round is regarded as the Derby course, and three times, the St. Leger course.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each race may be regarded as complete in itself, or may become part of a series of races known as a Meeting. The winner of a Meeting will be the owner of the horse, or horses securing the largest amount of prize money. Prize money is allotted as follows: Winner &pound;100, Second &pound;60, Third &pound;40.&quot;&#10;&#10;There were also advanced rules for steeple chasing.&#10;&#10;",
