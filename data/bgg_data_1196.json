A neutral Princess playing piece is placed on the Castle square in the centre of the board.&#10;&#10;There are a number of plastic chips representing gold and silver coins (seemingly three of each) which are placed in a provided draw bag labelled &quot;Olde English Swag Bag&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns in drawing a coin out of the bag, and moving their piece accordingly.  Coins are of two types - silver and gold - and the player must move his piece to a square of the same kind that is adjacent to the one he is on (orthogonally - no diagonal moves are allowed). If a legal move is available, it must be made, even if the player feels it is disadvantageous; if no legal move is available, the player does not move his piece.  The coin is then returned to the bag, and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to rescue the trapped princess from the castle, and to be the first to carry her away to safety.&#10;&#10;As well as the four corner squares, Princess's central castle, and gold and silver coin squares, other spaces are marked with taverns, witches, fighters in various poses, a dragon (occupying 5 squares), fallen log (2 squares), broken bridge (2 squares), and ?river gorge (3 squares).  The purpose of these squares is unknown.  Also unknown is why the game appears to be equipped with a total of nine character pieces, some of which appear to be duplicates.&#10;&#10;Also known as Gaymer's Old English Chivalry Game - the manufacturers of Gaymer's Olde English Cyder also promoted a Compendium of &quot;Inne Games&quot; at about the same time, comprising dominoes, a cribbage board, two packs of cards, and poker dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Kalevala and its 50 runes have been translated to over 60 languages, but it's mythological world is still unused as a board game theme. The game mostly focuses in the most well-known tale from Kalevala, the rune regarding the capturing of the legendary artifact called Sampo.&#10;&#10;Description: Kalewala: Tale of Sampo puts players in two opposing teams controlling fascinating demi-gods in an immersive narrative set on the epoch of Kalevala. The tense interactions are amplified by the use of a vertical game board separating the two sides and by a clever hidden movement mechanism utilizing magnetic pieces on its central map. Use your limited card resources wisely, as they diminish rapidly, simultaneously revealing information to the opposing side. The earlier decisions during gameplay will bite or reward you on the inevitable event of game's combats!&#10;&#10;Victory terms: The side of Vainola tries to reach their home, but only the Sampo-bearer (comparable to the significance of the Ring in LOTR) can win the game by reaching the pre-chosen destination. The other side, Pohjola, aims to deduce their current location from Vainola's movements in order to challenge the Sampo-bearer to combat. The game is played in a maximum of 12 rounds utilizing the trap components of Pohjola as a dynamic timer, with Pohjola winning if the Trap deck gets depleted.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 1-6, can be played with up to 12 players with two game copies&#10;&#10;Target audience: Players interested in flexible strategies, interaction and thematic tension, prior gaming background isn't mandatory&#10;&#10;Level of difficulty: Medium (BGG scale), the rules can be learned in 5-10 minutes before starting and while playing but players need to be analytical or focused during gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Take your forces into sunken shipwrecks, shark-infested reefs and lost cities in campaigns of multiple scenarios where each member of a warband can gain advancements as they win battles and gather treasure. But beware of wild creatures that roam the Shadow Sea, as they have their own AI rules that allow them to hunt any model on the board, hungry for blood. The book comes complete with all of the core rules as well as descriptions of all weapons, armor, tech artifacts, magic and special abilities for all characters and has the roster for the four main forces as well as all wild sea creatures. In addition, it includes a section detailing the different environments that players can explore and do battle within and descriptions of all of the different terrain types that can be encountered. Finally, there is a complete toolkit in the back that shows how to build your own custom characters or edit existing ones using a simple point calculation system.&#10;&#10;&#10;     RULES BASED ON AWARD-WINNING SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES by Ganesha Games but with extensive additional rules, weapons, armor, technology items (akin to magic items) and new combat and movement options. Deepwars include a detailed combat system and multiple combat options with wound tracking for different body part or subsystems. The activation system allows players to choose a basic free action or gamble on rolling dice for more complex actions. Game cards for miniatures are tarot sized (4.75 by 2.75 inch), giving room to include all of the descriptions of Special Abilities, Weapons, Armor and Tech Items. This means much less referencing the rulebook and faster gameplay for all. Sets of game cards can be downloaded in PDF format in the Download section of the website.&#10;     3D GAMEPLAY: In Deepwars, all models are capable of swimming or movement through the water column, which gives the game a distinct three-dimensional feel. Model can pass over and under each other using specific Depth Levels, which are indicated by markers or on a clear acrylic Swim Stand (available in the AMG store). Rules are included for movement across depth levels, where hasty changes in depth can cause deadly barotrauma. There are also rules for the effects of variable visibility and light levels and for models that can easily navigate through the darkness using echolocation.&#10;     INTENSE COMBAT, MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY in the abyssal depths of the Sea. Breach submarines, uncover undersea temples, battle with schools of sharks and dodge torpedoes while recovering artifacts that hold the secrets of the ethereal void. Spellcasters can wield multiple magical spell types, including elemental magic that causes hydrothermal eruptions and dimensional magic that allows unsavory spellcasters to call forth beings from the ethereal void. Scientists can discover artifacts with tremendous power or design and improve upon their own ether technology to upgrade and create new items.&#10;     SKIRMISH WITH RPG FLAVOR: Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. The game can be played in single sessions of an hour, or as a campaign where warbands salvage ancient technology, design their own new tech items, enhance abilities and generally become powerful lords of the deep.&#10;     FOUR COMPETING FORCES: Battle with four unique forces below the waves. The human Fortune Hunters are encased in diving suits and utilize salvaged technology to help them control the seas. The Dark Mariners are corrupted beings that summon ethereal beings from the dimensional void. The Ancients of Atal&aacute;n are the remnants of an advanced undersea civilization trying to reclaim their former glory. The Scaly Horde is a loosely organized faction of scaly draconids, fish-men and monstrous creatures that intend to expand their control of the sea, while earning gold selling their services to other forces.&#10;     TOURNAMENT RULES &ndash; The rulebook has an entire section on running tournaments, complete with scoring and timekeeping, as well as new Special Operations that each player gets for a scenario. The Spec-Ops are special missions that a warband can accomplish during a scenario to gain bonus Victory Points.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You and three other players run around the Tri-Piques Waterpark With one goal, experience every attraction the park has to offer and escape, all while streaking and avoiding capture by the lifeguard.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling and moving about the board in a non-linear fashion. The goal is to reach each of the ten locations on the board. Some spots on the board require one to draw a 'Flasher' card which can cause the player to move locations, miss a turn, escape from jail, ect. Once they have done so they may mark it off of the scorecard. Once all ten locations have been visited, the player must escape the park via one of it's two exits. One player plays as the lifeguard. His objective is to chase down each player. Once he has reached a player, both are moved to the jail. The lifeguard then continues on to try and catch the others. Players can be let out of jail by others if they can reach the jailhouse location on the board. The game ends when either everyone has escaped or everyone is captured. The winners are those who escaped or the lifeguard if anyone remained captured at the end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The rut markers change the racing surface so that each racer must choose his line with greater care. The variable number and location of the ruts means that each race will be unique in its own right. Whether you play a single race, one night's worth of races or a season of races, the decisions you make will matter even more. The best part is that the rut rules are an extended application of the existing rules; not a change.&#10;&#10;Dirt Track Saturday Night is very playable, yet challenging. The Starting Field Expansion just adds more of that &quot;it just feels right&quot; character that all gamers desire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warfare has been described as protracted boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.&#10;&#10;The core rules of Moments of Sheer Terror are focused on the individual infantry of the mid 20th century to the mid 21st century. Blaster weapons as well as conventional slug throwers are the stock in trade of the infantry in this time period. Fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft are included. Futuristic vehicles such as grav boards that hover 6 to 12 inches above the ground are available as well for individual troopers.&#10;&#10;Moments of Sheer Terror is a skirmish level game that operates on an initiative based system for the troops to take action. When you take certain actions, such as firing a weapon, there is a chance that one of 64 random events will occur. Some events will help you, other events will help your opponent.&#10;&#10;The rules are written to avoid vertical exaggeration by having the figure scale match the ground scale. Buildings, trees and other features are meant to be played as they are modeled. &#10;There are charts included for 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm, 25mm and 28mm figures.&#10;&#10;One turn equals 30 seconds. &#10;The combination of the ground scale and turn length means that air support is handled with elegant simplicity. (In 6mm scale a soldier figure moves 6 inches in one turn. A ground attack aircraft would move 88 feet.) Just choose the altitude; high or low. Then put the aircraft where you want it on the table.&#10;&#10;The charts are where the detail is in the game. This means the core rules can be used for different eras with slight modification for that era.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Use multiple boxes when playing with more than 2 players.&#10;&#10;Deal 10 Kosmos (starter) cards to each player. This is their draw pile, placed in their play area.&#10;&#10;Give each player a Dominance card and place it with the Cortadoo logo facing up.&#10;&#10;Shuffle all Sins cards together face-down, from the box sets of your choice. Place the cards in the center of the table to form the Realm.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a card from the top of the Realm. The highest card-number is the active player (repeat if there is a tie). Destroy these cards. Destroyed cards are placed back in the box.&#10;&#10;Then, draw 5 cards from the top of the Realm, into the center of the table, face-up.&#10;&#10;All players draw 5 starting cards into their hand from their draw pile (this is their hand limit).&#10;&#10;The active player starts the game and takes their first turn.&#10;How to win&#10;When a player reaches two dominance, that player wins the game and the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;You get dominance by resolving opposing despair in the Status phase, and you give despair by attacking your opponents in the Attack phase.&#10;&#10;The Dominance card in front of each player has numbers from zero to three. If you&rsquo;d like to play a longer game, you can optionally play until a player reaches three dominance. For a short (coffee break) game, play for one dominance.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Infected is a collaborative-competitive horror adventure for up to six players to control the scientist survivors of a savage disease outbreak on an isolated Antarctic station.  The adventure is collaborative because you will have to work together if anyone is to make it to the hangar bay and safety.  It is competitive because there is no way everyone will make it out.  There is also a victory objective to compete with the other survivors to be the &quot;hero&quot; of the event in the public's eye, rather than just a survivor.&#10;&#10;The major obstacle to getting out is disease-infected former colleagues with a newly acquired taste for blood.  These monsters are controlled by a set of behavioural rules, so you can even play the game solo.  By trying to maximize hero points and minimize how infected the survivors become, there is good replay solo value as you try to beat your best performance.  &#10;And in team play, there are rules for eliminated players to take over the monsters ... Yeah, thanks guys.  I'll show you my, &quot;Let Dave go in first!&quot; now ...&#10;&#10;The .pdf comes with the following:&#10;&#10;Complete setup for 4-5 encounters in the complex - maps, laydowns, situational rules.&#10;    QILS stats for bad guys and good guys (six scientists, and two arctic guides), plus guidelines to convert from our free QILS game to any other gaming system.&#10;    Simple A-Frame paper figures for the monsters and survivors (in case you don't have a bunch of 28mm scientists in parkas lying around).&#10;    Modular 2D and simple to construct optional 3D terrain templates for everything you need to run the adventure (and they're pretty useful for other industrial environments, too).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These spaces include a house icon. A white space with an icon is the house of a Company Captain. If a Captain is mustered, the entire company is deemed to be mustered.&#10;&#10;Six spaces on the game board require the Rider to draw a Dispatch Card to determine what occurs after the Rider lands on the space.&#10;&#10;Ten spaces on the game board require the Rider to draw a History Card. Up to 100 additional points can be earned by correctly answering the cards.&#10;&#10;",

As you perform actions, you pay hours to accomplish each one. You are searching for food for the trip, robots to navigate the alien ship you must steal, other captured aliens to help you carry all the stuff, and weapons to deal with inevitable guards you will encounter. Early in the game the food and robots are plentiful and cost very few hours to find--alien friends and weapons take longer to find.  As the game progresses food and robots become harder to find and aliens become easier to recruit. Weapons also become easier to find as the guards become aware of your plans and bring in more firepower. As you draw items (cubes) you may also trip an alarm. This means that all sources of food, robots, hiding places, and weapons will be moved to new locations and you will have to face guards. As you carry more things, you move slower, but alien allies can help. They can help you find items more quickly, fight guards, carry items and scout new supplies. Your struggle ends when you find the escape ship and have enough food and robots to leave. But this may not be the end of the game.  You must still defeat the guards watching the ship.  Then other players can still beat the first player to escape if they can spend less hours to get out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NATO Goes Nuts: The Coming Polish-German War. As America withdraws from the world, there will be vast repercussions. In Europe, the international security guarantees put in place in 1945 will be gone. That will mean the old national rivalries that twice in 30 years sent the continent into world wars will reemerge. The scenario here covers Central Europe, where the presumed near-future emergence in Germany of the ultra-nationalist AFD as the majority party ignites fear and loathing in Poland.&#10;&#10;The Poles understand the overarching fact of their national existence is this: if Russia and Germany are both strong at the same time, independent Poland is doomed. Russia is already relatively strong and armed with atomic weapons; it&rsquo;s therefore too late for anything to be done about that.  To the west of Poland, an AFD-run Germany would no doubt soon rearm and become strong. The Poles therefore resolve to act before that happens. They strike into eastern Germany with the objective of taking Berlin and setting up a compliant and friendly regime there. Alternatively, we can also postulate a Poland that continues its own recent drift toward the far right, culminating in a quasi-fascist government in Warsaw. That regime might act in order to forestall a nascent far-right German regime, or it might move against even a moderate-left German regime in order to forestall further Muslim immigration into Central Europe.&#10;&#10;The game uses a battalion-level evolution of the alternating action system from America Falling to model this near-future war in Central Europe. One large-hex 34x22&rdquo; map covering all of eastern Germany at five miles per hex (8 km), along with one sheet of 228 medium-size (9/16&rdquo;) counters. Rules cover such things as the possibility of Czech intervention on the German side and a Turkish-Islamist uprising in Muslim sections of Berlin. Playable by two people in one sitting and also solitaire adaptable.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;Map Scale: 5 miles (8 km) per hex &#10;Playing Time: four to six hours&#10;&#10;",

You need to load cubes for several course cards up to the next checkpoint.&#10;&#10;Use the square on the left side of the machine card.&#10;Stack cubes along this area.&#10;&#10;The stacked cubes are judged from two directions, from directly in front and directly above, so you can deal with them with inspiration and ingenuity!&#10;&#10;Let's start the race!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Storm: Stalin's Barbarossa   What if the Soviets Attacked First in 1941?&#10;&#10;Operation Storm is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic simulation of the campaign that could've resulted had Stalin agreed to Gen. Georg Zhukov's plan for a preemptive attack against the Germans. The Soviet player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win the game by seizing key objectives within the territory of the Third Reich. At the same time, though, the situation allows for--and at times demands--the launching of sharp counteroffensives by the German player.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with a few units of other organizational sizes. Each full game turn represents from two weeks to two months, depending on the season. By telescoping time in that way, the turn-by-turn movement and combat capacities of the units can held as a constant. The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the border area between the Third Reich and the USSR in mid-1941 when viewed at these time and space scales.&#10;&#10;The initial orders of battle for both sides are drawn from the forces historically available to both sides in early June 1941. Similarly, on the Soviet side, the reinforcement schedule is based on what was generated by them during the historic campaign, minus only the historic emergency mobilization of the militia divisions.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player is generally on the offensive, striving to win by seizing important areas on the map while causing heavy casualties on the opposing side. The German wins by preventing his opponent from fulfilling the Soviet victory conditions. Unless one player assesses his situation to have become hopeless, and therefore capitulates to this opponent, victory is only judged at the end of Game Turn 10. There are no &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; victories in this game. Soviet performance in that regard is based on that side side&rsquo;s accumulation of victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of the &quot;stone draw&quot; mechanic used in the original version, the Knucklebones Edition uses dice. We created this edition due to many requests for a streamlined version of the game that just uses good old dice.&#10;&#10;Battles Before Time is a prehistoric fantasy miniatures skirmish game for 28mm figures (as well as plastic dinosaurs &amp; giant mammals that more or less fit with 28mm cavemen). The game is set in an alternate prehistory where our Human ancestors &ndash; the Early Modern Humans, or Emohs for short &ndash; rub elbows with Neanderthals, Dino sapiens (dinosaur men), Florz (small Emohs), &amp; other species. Dinosaurs, huge mammals, &amp; monsters also roam the Earth, &amp; shamans can use powerful magic.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two parts. Part One is 26 pages long; it contains the rules (the core rules are only seven pages long) as well as a guide to the cavemen &amp; creatures that will make up your warband. Warbands include cavemen or dinosaur men who can purchase special abilities, weapons, armor, cavepunk items, &amp; spells. Warbands can also include heroes, dinosaurs, mammals, prehistoric &ldquo;birds&rdquo;, aquatic beasts, &amp; prehistoric monsters.&#10;&#10;Part One begins with an Introduction &amp; Game Overview. Next, scale, items needed to play, &amp; information on setting up the game are presented. The rules themselves have the following sections: Game Turns &amp; Actions, Actions When Activated, Darwinian Measurement, Movement, Going Prone, Language (or the Lack Thereof), Action Rolls, Contests, Combat, Doing Damage, Area Effect Attacks, Panic, &amp; End of the Game/Victory!&#10;&#10;Next, Part One covers how to make your warband. There's information about units &amp; unit types (mostly Packs of Grunts), crew &amp; riders, &amp; heroes. After that, you'll find out about how to use beast masters to control the huge variety of prehistoric beasts included.&#10;&#10;To defend your cavemen against these creatures, you'll find lots of prehistoric weapons, armor, cavepunk technology, standards, torches, &amp; watercraft. You can also include shamans who cast magic spells.&#10;&#10;Part Two contains detailed instructions on how to create your warband. Players can use one of the pre-made warbands provided, or can create their own balanced warbands using a simple point build system. Part Two is 75 pages long &amp; includes templates, more than 100 unit cards, all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need, a terrain placement guide, &amp; measuring sticks. You supply the cavemen, dinosaurs, &amp; other prehistoric figures, &amp; we'll give you a fun excuse to play with them on a tabletop!&#10;&#10;So, stop shaving! Stop bathing! Grab a club, and let&rsquo;s rock &amp; roll!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Normally, hero characters have one set of custom dice that is balanced for them to have a particular play style. However, villains are a bit more slippery than that. With class dice, you can change the way your character plays. Want to play The Joker as the traditional slick footed trickster? Then use the &quot;Wildcard&quot; dice! Want to switch it up and show how deadly he can be with a blunt object? Then swap in the &quot;Brawler&quot; dice (better watch out, Robin). Combining different Rogues Gallery class dice with your character's various hero skill cards generates even more ways to customize their play style.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 12 new dice, the Villains Upgrade Pack comes with 10 Hero Sheets: The Joker, Mr. Freeze, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Penguin, Scarecrow, Jervis Tetch, and The Riddler, a set of Hero Skill cards for those 10 characters, totaling 72 new Skill cards, 9 A.I. Villain sheets for Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Commissioner Gordon, Detective Montoya, Detective Bullock, Nightwing, Tim Drake, and the GCPD beat cops, and 25 initiative cards.&#10;&#10;On top of all that, the Villain Upgrade Pack also contains a new mission book. Based on the episode Almost Got 'Im, this mission book delivers a new campaign type: a skirmish campaign. Skirmish campaigns have multiple hero players and multiple villains players using all characters on the board in their hero playstyle, rolling dice and strategizing with their teammates. In Almost Got 'Im a team of villains and a team of heroes will square off to settle the score once and for all. Players that want to keep things strictly cooperative can play this campaign in the cooperative A.I. mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is the wargame you've been searching for. TACTIX is a wargame that allows for ultimate customization for each and every model in your collection while providing a balanced and streamlined ruleset for you to use for any genre or type of wargame!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;TACTIX is a generic system that supports two or more players using any type of forces, from historical to science-fantasy.  A simple procedure is used to assign individual models several ratings, including Assault, Shoot, and Quality.  Models' size is determined by the physical base size of the figure, and is divided into seven categories (each category other than Normal has an assigned Trait).  A relatively simple method is then used to calculate the model's cost in points, and players take (roughly) the same number of base points for their army.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in turns, round-robin style.  Games have a pre-determined length and end when the time is reached (or when all but one player concedes).  Games have pre-determined objectives with associated points; alternately, victory can be determined by remaining model points.  During their turn, players have several options available for each model, depending on the model's individual Trait(s).&#10;&#10;The game is distributed as a rule book only.  Models used during play can be derived from nearly any source, as desired, and may be of almost any scale, though 32mm through 400mm bases would by typical.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gone Caving is a card game in which you and your friends are exploring an underground world together. You can compete with each other, or choose to work together to discover the most passage possible. During your journey you&rsquo;ll discover beautiful cave formations and curious animals.  There will be challenges along the way, but you can overcome them and then find your way back to the surface.&#10;&#10;Players first find a cave entrance, then explore cave passages, overcome challenges, and exit the cave safely to end. Score points by tallying the lengths of cave passage explored; get bonus points for specializing in one or more areas of cave research such as geology, biology, or cartography. Each of 104 cards is illustrated and based on accurate depictions of the formations, animals, and equipment that cavers encounter in the underground world. On each turn, a player draws a card and plays or discards a card. They may: play a card in their own play area to gain points or skills or to resolve a challenge;&#10;or play a challenge in another player&rsquo;s area; or discard a card with no effect.&#10;&#10;A large portion of the proceeds from the game benefit the National Speleological Society (NSS).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A high energy, tactile but strategic board game that will see players Kersplatting opponents&rsquo; creative masterpieces in the quest to be the first to get two play pieces home.&#10;&#10;First players have to get creative and make their own play pieces with the modelling dough provided, then it is all to play for! Taking it in turns to turn over a card, players try to advance their play pieces as far as they can around the board whilst trying to stop their opponents from reaching their Home square first.&#10;&#10;There are three types of card: a Coloured Number Card allows you to advance your play piece to the nearest empty space either matching the colour of the card or the number on the card. A Choice of Two Colours Card allow you to choose the colour that advances you the further around the board. The third type of card is the Kersplatt or Colour Card; with this card you can choose to either advance to the further colour space or take your hand, starting from your own start space, travel along the path until you reach the first opponent&rsquo;s play piece and Kersplatt it! Once a play piece has been Kersplatted it remains on the board making that area a dead space that cannot be landed on.&#10;&#10;Kersplatt! is a fantastic 2-4 player family board game where strategy and tactics definitely come into play.  Perfect for players age 6 years and over. (/Description from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
