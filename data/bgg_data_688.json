    "Description": "9 Kingdoms is a miniatures adventure game that combines elements of roleplaying and wargaming. It provides a unique interpretation of the common fantasy races and monsters for game play. The game can be scaled from a small handful of figures up to several dozen.  Players can customize their own figures, individualizing them with skills and building them up with experience both within a single game and from game to game. The rulebook provides a variety of scenarios, including everything from straight up battles to dungeon crawls to an assault on a wizard's stronghold.&#10;&#10;Unlike other miniatures games, a figure is not killed with 1 or 2 wounds. Each figure is given a specific set of points sources that represent both its health and effectiveness. As a figure is wounded, it becomes less effective throughout the course of the game.  The combat system is simultaneous and figures make opposed rolls for both offense and defense to determine combat results.&#10;&#10;In addition to the point sources, figures can be &quot;trained&quot; in different skills including weapons, armor, magic, and many other types of special abilities. Figures with different skills can be combined in an endless variety of ways to create effective combat and adventuring squads. Each of the 10 major species in the 9 Kingdoms has its own special racial abilities which makes the different teams original and dynamic.&#10;&#10;All scenarios also incorporate an element of exploration in the form of encounter tokens on the board.  These tokens can be flipped during the game to uncover treasures, traps, powerful artifacts and even wandering monsters.  This adds an element of risk and unpredictability to the game as an encounter could turn out to be either be dangerous or profitable.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a new series based on the Death Ride game system.  This series will be comprised of a base game, 16Pz, with the rules, charts, markers, dice, etc that enable play of the other modules.  The other modules will include 29PzGr, 16Pz Expansion, and Herman Goering/15PzGr.  Each of these will focus on about a divisions worth of Germans and Allies and include the maps and unit counters specific to those elements.  The entire beachhead will be covered when the entire series is complete.&#10;&#10;The total game package will have the equivalent of 7 and a half 22 x 34 map sheets.  Most modules will have just (2) 22 x 34 maps.  Each module will have a number of scenarios that allow for smaller table space and game play duration.&#10;&#10;The system has some enhancements with unit counters, such as the use of silouhettes for tanks and color coding of the different organizations for ease of tracing command and control.  The rules are well written and efficient.  They are clear and easy to read.  They are organized in a manner that aides learning.  They are structured along the 7 Battlefield Operating Systems which are Command and Control, Maneuver, Fire Support, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, Mobility and Survivability, and Air Defense.  This provides a real world view of the rules as opposed to a gamers view of the rules, but will greatly ease the learning curve and put the rules into proper context.&#10;&#10;The units are modeled as Platoons for the Germans and mostly Companies and some platoons for the Allies.  Units have Secondary and Primary weapons and may use these in conjunction with each other or separately against the same or different targets.&#10;&#10;A key feature of the game system is the Operations Phase.  During this time most of the action occurs.  One player may perform movement, fire, overrun, go into reserve, or setup in overwatch, and do it in any order the player wants.  This allows for a free flow of action that more closely resembles combat and the execution of smaller parts of the overall plan.  The non-phasing player must keep a close eye on the enemy as they may use opportunity fire to slow or stop the movement they don't like.  They may also use reserves to bolster the defense.  Players will see that this gives them maximum flexibility and gives both players something to do at all times.&#10;&#10;Both sides in this series of games will have some time on the attack and on the defense.  The Germans are defending at start and on the 13th Sept they change to the offensive as they try to force the Americans off the beach.  This helps make sure that you aren't only being pummeled and can pummel the other guy a little too.  As the allies you get a big advantage with air and naval support to help keep the Germans at bay and you even get to drop the 82nd Airborne to help secure the beachhead.  The battle starts on 10 September, the day after the landings, and there are scenarios that start at the beginning of each day to allow for smaller, shorter games.&#10;&#10;",

He secretly looks at that card, which has an artifact with some special power on it. At any time during the game, he can choose to reveal his Artifact card and use its special power. Some artifacts, like the Cloak of the Prince, provide a direct benefit to the player with the artifact. Others, like the Cudgel of the Old Hag, impact other players. And still others, like the Ring of Truth, provide information about another player in the game. Some artifacts might not be to your benefit to use right away, like the Claw of the Werewolf, but others, like the Ruby of Kismet, might cause someone to reveal and activate an artifact anyway!&#10;&#10;What this ends up doing is providing a whole new layer to Ultimate Werewolf games, adding new strategies and tactics to your games.

    "Description": "Ultimate Werewolf: Night Terrors contains six new roles that all impact the nighttime of Ultimate Werewolf.&#10;&#10;First is the Insomniac. Here's a villager who just can't sleep at nighttime, try as he might. The good news is that in his hazy non-sleep time, he learns if one or both of his neighbors was up during the night doing something. He's not alert to know if it was indeed just one of them or both, and if only one of them which one it was, but he knows if someone was up and about during the night. Each night. It might be a werewolf out looking for prey. It might be the helpful Seer who is trying to find werewolves. Or it might be any other number of nighttime active roles in the game.&#10;&#10;Much more alert at nighttime is the Beholder. She wakes up the first night and sees who the Seer is! What she ends up doing with that information is anyone's guess, but hopefully she'll figure out how to help the village and prevent the Seer from being lynched by the crazed mob.&#10;&#10;And then there's everyone's favorite numerically-aware goth, The Count. He's got his spreadsheet open, and he's, well, counting all night. He knows how many werewolves are on each side of him in the village because he counted. &quot;One Werewolf. Two, two scary hairy werewolves...ah ha ha ha. Three, three three evil lycanthropic werewolves...mwa ha ha ha.&quot;&#10;&#10;Possibly the most mysterious creature of the night is the Thing (that goes &quot;bump&quot; in the night). This nasty, furry, slightly smelly creature is helping out the village by bumping people in the wee hours of night. What will those people do with the information garnered from the Thing? What is the Thing's ultimate purpose?&#10;&#10;But not everyone is out to help people at nighttime. There's a new werewolf in town, though she's a little...sleepy. The Dreamwolf takes it easy, not bothering to wake up with the other werewolves unless one of her sister werewolves is killed. Then she's all about taking out her revenge on the village. Watch out!&#10;&#10;Finally, the most feared night monster of all, the Bogeyman, rounds out the roles in Night Terrors. Take too long at nighttime and the Bogeyman gets to kill someone. He kills indiscriminately, with a winning condition that totally fits his role.&#10;&#10;",

Combat is fast and furious and there (again depending on which of the many games you choose to play) are even supply issues to deal with while you shoot, bomb, and shell your adversaries.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An old war game made during or after World War II. The game is a simple dice game where up to four players moving a playing piece towards an enemy city. Each player is allowed ten raids to the objectives of their choice, with the highest score tabulated at the end of the game declared a winner. If a playing piece lands on a black square during a raid, the piece is removed from the board and that turn is lost. The high ratio of black squares (40 out of a possible 179 spaces) is a depressingly accurate reflection of the high casualties facing wartime bomber crews.&#10;&#10;The original wartime edition was printed in brown on thin beige cardstock, while the post-war version had a glossier red board with black squares. Both versions fold out to a size 16&quot; x 11&quot;. The coloured playing pieces are made from 1/4&quot; painted wooden dowel and the die is wooden as well. Game instructions are printed on the face of the board.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first player to use all of his chips or all of his rings.&#10;&#10;Anytime a player gets to form a row (orthogonally or diagonally) with 4 rings or 4 chips, he is allowed to put a new chip on the board.&#10;&#10;A player can put a chip over an opponent's chip, but be aware: the third chip played in a single stack is the last one, and it allows the player to change the color of the ring - blue player can take a red ring from the board and put a blue ring in the same space if he got to play a blue chip as a third one in that stack.&#10;&#10;There are also 4 white neutral rings in the start of the game, used to give even more replayability.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Copied from the official webpage:&#10;&#10;Clash of Empires is the new tabletop wargaming rules from Great Escape Games.  Clash of Empires  is a full colour, hardcover book  Here are some key features:&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;We mainly play with 28mm figures but the rules are adaptable to 15mm and 20mm armies as well.&#10;&#10;For a typical sized game of Clash of Empires, number of models will vary by army &ndash; our own Carthaginian army has 155 men and our Early Imperial Romans 125 men.&#10;&#10;There will be plenty of dice to roll.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is: Orders Phase, Movement Phase, Shooting Phase, Hand-to-hand Phase and Combat Outcomes Phase.&#10;&#10;SOLDIERS OF ANTIQUITY&#10;&#10;Troops&rsquo; profiles are:                                                                                                                Movement Rate; Shoot; Attacks; Hand-to-Hand; Defence; Kill; Hits; Discipline; MoralE.&#10;&#10;Troop morale is vital but troop discipline is a separate characteristic and can be just as important.&#10;&#10;Units have profiles to determine how good they are but may also have Unit Special Rules such as Cantabrian Circle (Skythians), Expert Swordsmen (e.g. Legionaries) and Shieldwall (e.g. Saxon infantry) to name a few.&#10;&#10;Different weapons are well represented according to their historical uses - the pilum is used as a thrown weapon before combat disrupting the enemy formation, and the pike enables more attacks but suffers if the unit is pushed back in combat.&#10;&#10;ARMY LISTS&#10;&#10;Army lists are very expansive and you choose your unit size by individual models within set minimums and maximums (e.g. a Roman auxiliary infantry unit has 10-30 models in it).&#10;&#10;Units within the army list are 'flavoured' for that period so that a Roman Legionary is different to a Viking Hirdman, rather than both being superior Heavy Infantry.&#10;&#10;Generals and other characters command, they are not super killing machines. This can be a good excuse to do diorama bases for your leaders if you are so inclined.&#10;&#10;Clash of Empires even has a use for those casualty figures you never painted!&#10;&#10;THE RULEBOOK&#10;&#10;In the rulebook will be lists for the Early Imperial Romans and its enemies in the west &ndash; Ancient Germans, Ancient British, Caledonians and Dacians.&#10;&#10;The first army list book will cover Early Achaemenid Persia to the death of Alexander.&#10;&#10;Many army lists will be free to download from the web. They will be official but will be living lists reviewed by us and the wargaming community.  Some of these will go to print but many will stay on the website as free downloads.&#10;&#10;The rulebook also contains rules for four different scenarios including elements such as terrain placement, terrain types, army initiative and flanking manoeuvres.&#10;&#10;",

If an illustration is yellow, the players must make an action appropriate for the image; if blue, the player must make an appropriate sound; and if green (i.e., blue + yellow), the player must make both sound and action.&#10;&#10;Whichever player first makes the appropriate combination of sounds and actions in the right order claims the card.

Foutrak est un jeu d&rsquo;observation et de rapidit&eacute; compl&egrave;tement farfelu qui vous propose de faire des bruitages et des mimes. &Agrave; chaque tour a lieu un duel entre 2 joueurs.

The two players, called &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot;, alternately take turns placing their pieces on the playing field, or stacking them on their previously played pieces. Once a piece is played, it is never removed from the board. Splay is a game where the players are constantly battling for territory acquisition. A space which has a player&rsquo;s piece(s) on it represents a unit of territory which is owned by that player. A &quot;tower&quot; consists of one or more like-colored checkers stacked on top of one another. A tower represents potential for acquiring additional territory. Players who utilize their towers effectively will gain a territorial advantage. Towers can also pose a liability so they must be developed with care.&#10;&#10;Splay was inspired by the process by which borders are formed between competing entities.&#10;&#10;Please refer to the included &quot;Splay_Rules.pdf&quot; for a complete description of the rules.&#10;&#10;Splay placed first in the 2011 rec.games.abstract stacking games contest.&#10;&#10;",

The components are items created from two jigsaw puzzle pieces each, plus some tiles which show the entire shape of an item and a kobold figure. There are various game ideas included.&#10;The youngest children just assemble the items. The second stage of the game includes finding a shape that matches one of the items, then places the kobold on another shape which the next player has to identify. &#10;In the most advanced game, some items are laid out on the table and the tiles are placed into groups. Now a shape tile is flipped open and the players check whether it matches any of the items currently open. If yes, the item is placed on the tile and a new item is added. If not, the kobold moves on. If the players manage to put all the items on the tiles before the kobold is back in its original position, all players win.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

Your squad is ordered to make contact with French Resistance fighters who have arranged to link up with U.S. forces in order to pass off a downed B-17 officer that needs to be escorted through friendly lines.&#10;Along with your normal choice of weapons your squad will be issued Rifle Grenades and two adapters. Rules on the use of these are included with the mission. You also receive 14 new soldier cards printed on hard cardstock. There are 6 pages of new paragraphs and 2 conditions also printed back to back on hard card stock. Set includes one minor vehicle (a horse drawn wagon), and a counter for this vehicle is included.&#10;&#10;This is a long mission as far as time to complete is concerned. Quite a lot of game time is spent in Rounds instead of operations, which tends to slow things down quite a bit. This mission can also turn deadly very quickly. If you're using a squad built up during the course of the entire series be extra cautious, don&rsquo;t win at all costs. Proper tactics will aid you during this mission.&#10;&#10;",

Mission #3: Toll Bridge&quot;: produced by &quot;BOA Publishing&quot;, this unofficial expansion of the Ambush! family of wargames requires both Ambush! and a map from Ambush! Purple Heart to play. This stand-alone mission is the third installment of a planned 4 part series.&#10;&#10;Toll Bridge is an airborne mission. Your squad has been handpicked for a night drop into a lightly guarded area containing three bridges.&nbsp;You must secure at least one bridge, all three if possible, and hold until dawn when reinforcements supported by tanks will cross. The bridge garrison is small and reported to be staffed by old men and boys. As long as surprise is on your side your men shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem...&#10;&#10;You may take your Medic (from Follow Me! - Mission #2) along for the ride. You also receive two Engineers to help with any explosives placed to blow the bridges. You'll even get some heavy weapons to aid you along the way.&#10;&#10;In addition to Ambush!, this mission requires half map B from the Ambush! Purple Heart module&#10;&#10;This mission includes the following:&#10;- 4 new vehicle summary cards&#10;- 21 new soldier cards printed on hard card stock (these must be cut out)&#10;- 10 pages of new paragraphs&#10;- 2 mission cartridges with 3 conditions&#10;- 6 page mission summary with several special rules&#10;- 1 wooden building overlay counter printed on hard card stock to be placed on the map.&#10;&#10;This mission is the most complex of the series to date and it was designed so that it could be enjoyably replayed many times. There are several small events that probably won't occur on every playing and some activations create random placements of enemy forces on the map. (In this way no replay of the mission should be exactly the same and your forces won&rsquo;t be able to set up ambushes for the Germans as you replay the scenario.) There are even a number of optional objectives that can be achieved in various ways.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;",

Play commences on the American Megafauna map as players evolve their species.  Upon reaching Era 1, their species is some form of &quot;human&quot;- perhaps of reptilian descent, and must focus on evolving their brain as in Origins: How We Became Human.  Once their brain is fully evolved, players continue through the subsequent eras, working towards unique victory conditions.&#10;&#10;Animal Farm is an epic abstracted simulation that spans the intervening millenia between the Mesozoic Era to the rise of modern humans.  Players will take on the roles of species, language groups, cultures, and, finally, ideas.&#10;&#10;The game features two new brain maps representing humanoids descending from reptiles and humanoid descendants of mastodons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Basketball G.M. is a card game in which each player is the General Manager of his/her own basketball franchise.  The GMs (human players) put together their teams through a fantasy-style draft and attempt to take their teams to the championship.  In addition to basketball players, each GM will choose a coach and use Strategy cards to boost player abilities.  The GMs must also contend with play injuries, suspensions, and other hindrances.&#10;&#10;Each game begins with a fantasy draft, either auction style or through a &quot;pick and pass&quot; method, and then the season begins.  Each game turn represents several weeks of a basketball season.  GMs earn victory points based on their teams' total ability from their players, plus a small random factor of 1-3 dice.  The teams with the most victory points at the end compete head to head in a championship game or series.&#10;&#10;After the draft, GMs can improve their teams through the course of the season by trading with other GMs or through the trading block.  The trading block is an auction in which GMs make trade offers for players from the player pool.  Because only a fraction of the players in the game will be available for the initial draft, there is still a lot of talent to acquire over the course of the season.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Touchstone is a violent sport played by fantasy races. In Touchstone: Oubliette the game has moved from the sunny stadiums of the Braying Fields to an underground dungeon where the walls are constantly shifting and dancing around the players in an attempt to trap and crush them.&#10;&#10;Touchstone: Oubliette is played with a 28 card deck made up of walls, paths, portals, and creatures. It plays in under 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;You are the teams coach and take control of the individual players that must attempt to make their way through the Oubliette in order to score points for the team. These attempts are called a Drives. The deck represents the living maze and the opposing team's players that are trying to stop you.&#10;&#10;Core strategies:&#10;&#10;In order to escape from the Oubliette the player must evade the creatures and shifting walls attempting to block his path, locate a key, and finally find the one door that leads out of the maze. If the player finds and escapes with the Touchstone then he gets extra points. If the player hasn't escaped before the last card is drawn then they are lost in the Oubliette and fail that Drive attempt.&#10;&#10;If the Drive isn't going well the players will have to use portals to buy more time. Portals shift not only the players position in the maze but they also propel him backwards or forward in time (either removing cards from or returning cards to his draw deck).&#10;&#10;There are also four types of items that can be used to outsmart the creatures or illuminate the dark Oubliette. diamonds, torches, keys, and skulls.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the beginning of the 19th Century, war was a serious matter; monarchies, budding new nations and new forms of government tore at Europe&rsquo;s economic and political fabric for two decades. Conscription was constant. Larger and larger armies clashed on battlefields across the Old Continent, led by noblemen, princes, aristocrats or heroes emerging from the ranks.&#10;&#10;Put yourself at the head of an army and become the nobleman or hero accomplishing the mission you have been assigned. You have at your disposal enormous masses of infantry, fast-moving cavalry formations and powerful cannons, backed up by elite forces and legendary warriors. You will have to make quick and daring decisions, take advantage of the favourable positions and terrain features the battlefield has to offer, all to defeat your adversary and obey the orders sent by your superiors.&#10;&#10;In Napoleon at War you command your forces, the size of a Division, and try to accomplish your assigned mission in a game played on a gaming table, with an array of magnificently painted miniatures, while a good friend at the other side of the table tries to thwart your efforts and crush your forces.&#10;&#10;To play Napoleon at War you will need:&#10;&#10;First of all, an army, organised according to one of the Campaign Manuals, and made up of a good number of 18mm Napoleon at War miniatures.&#10;&#10;The rules.&#10;&#10;An adversary, since the game is for two or more players.&#10;&#10;A battlefield, consisting of a flat surface on which you can place terrain features to represent important terrain features  such as woods, villages, hills... of the type that can be found anywhere in Europe.&#10;&#10;A measuring tape and a good number of dice. Typical six-sided dice or D6s as they are commonly known.&#10;&#10;With Napoleon at War you can recreate important battles of the Napoleonic Wars in your own living room. You can command a terrible Division of French Cuirassiers or a firm red line of determined British infantry. Which is your favourite army?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Lake Wanapulachit!&#10;&#10;Take the Bait is a light, Euro-style tile collection game featuring teams of four whimsical fishermen competing to bring in the biggest catch. Do you rely on sheer fishing talent, or do you break out the Banjooki 2000 Platinum-plated Turbo Reel to haul in the monster fish? The choice is yours!&#10;&#10;Take the Bait plays up to four players, and features a game board laid out like a lake with the game sections arranged around the lake in a semi-circle. The players take on the roles of four fishing teams at a tournament, lead by some whimsical characters with special abilities from which the players can choose.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into three days (rounds), with three turns each round. Players begin the first, third and sixth turns at camp, in tents. They visit the campground canteen and, depending on certain circumstances, choose a coffee for the day, which will determine their turn order. Of course, the coffee that gives the biggest kick allows a player to go first but it also costs the most. Then it's onto the tackle shop to buy some equipment - some items are mundane, but cheap, while others are a bit more special but may require players to spend more cash, which isn't easy to come by.&#10;&#10;Next, it's time for fishing. According to certain character powers, equipment mixes, etc. the players take turns drawing fish (tiles) out of three areas of the lake. The area closest to shore is the easiest to fish in, but it's where all the smaller fish dwell. The middle body of the lake has some bigger fish but requires a pier license to reach. The third is the deepest and most costly in which to fish, but it's where the big daddies live, including one monster catfish that has never been caught and has fueled tall tales for years at the lake. Mixed into the tiles in each of the sections are also various bits of detritus such as old boots, lost bikinis and such that always seem to latch onto hooks during any fishing trip. They'll hurt your score at the end of the tournament, but some may very well be of use to someone if they, or an opponent, have a matching item...&#10;&#10;Then there's the market, where fish can be sold for money to buy bigger equipment, or held until the end of the current day (round). The market prices fluctuate from day to day and there's a catch of the day that brings a bonus, so players will have to decide whether that fish is best kept for score or sold for cash.&#10;&#10;The final station for each turn is the lodge where teams can hire a guide - an extra hand that will help them fish for the day. The guides get cheaper as the tournament draws to an end, so players will need to decide whether they pay a premium for that extra help in the beginning or save their money for one last push at the end. Teams can also check the weather for the next day while at the lodge, giving them a little insight at the weather patterns that could influence fish migration.&#10;&#10;The next turns continue until the end of the day when there is a weigh in, which scores points for players. The player who has the most points at the end of three days wins!&#10;&#10;Teams can also freely trade among themselves. This trading keeps the game lively and social, as players tempt each other to &quot;take the bait.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Every turn is timed, so think fast and get out in front of your wily opponents. But watch out for those potholes, oil slicks and pesky squirrels or you'll be digging out splinters from the ditch!&#10;&#10;Soapbox Derby features a deck of 45 cards, with four soapbox racers on each card in different configurations that represent race positions (i.e., first, second, third, fourth). There are three face-up card stacks that represent stages of the downhill course, a face-down draw deck, and two face-up cards next to the main draw deck for card options during play. Each turn a player chooses one of two face-up option cards, or one random from the face-down stack, and chooses one of the three open race stage stacks on which to play the card. Placing a card on the first stage stack has no special effect on the race, but placing a card on the second stage stack allows a player to choose one card from the first or third stage stacks and take it out of the race and back to the &quot;pit&quot; - the two option stacks next to the main deck. Placing a card in the third stage stack forces the player to swap the position of that stack with the first or second stack.&#10;&#10;The race is timed - three minutes for each heat. Then players score points for the positions of their racers when time runs out. Three heats decides the winner!&#10;&#10;",

(Unless you played your &quot;1st Player&quot; one-shot action token to get out of a hellish situation -- or take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime impending ram-o-thon...)&#10;&#10;The game features no weapons, so you MUST ding up your own car in order to inflict damage to the opponents' cars. In fact, managing that self-inflicted damage is at the heart of the game. (And there's only so much a factory-installed ramplate can take.)&#10;&#10;Once a third of the cars have been wrecked -- either because the armor is completely gone from one section or the car sustained one too many critical hits -- whoever has scored the most points (i.e. inflicted the most damage to opponents) AND is still alive is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Developed by a real-life fur trapping couple, Fur Out was marketed as Canada's first &quot;family wildlife game.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game, not just a simple roll and move affair, features three different types of characters (Trappers, the Game Warden, &amp; the Anti-Trapper). Trappers set traps and score points by catching &amp; selling furs. As they accumulate wealth, trappers can buy and build cabins on the board to set trap-lines to make even more money. Trappers can also tamper with each others traps and even steal them. However, if the Game Warden (only one allowed per game) catches them they can end up in jail. The Game Warden is also a trapper, so he can cash in on any poached game he seizes, as well as set traps himself. (However, as a lawman the Game Warden can't tamper with other player's traps.) The Anti-Trapper (only one allowed per game) scores by stealing traps from the Trappers and generally making life miserable for them.&#10;&#10;Players navigate the unusual snowshoe-shaped board by rolling 2 six-sided dice and traveling along the showshoe's webbing. Different spots on the board allow players to set up traps for various game animals. (These spots are always on the edges of diamond or hexagonal areas that frame the illustration of the animal to be trapped.) Some animal hides are virtually worthless (like the lowly Skunk) while others pay top dollar (like the mighty Grizzly Bear). Only one trap may be set per square. A player must return to the square by landing on it with an exact die roll to successfully make a catch. Unfortunately, other players that land on the square may &quot;steal&quot; a catch from the trap. However, the offending player may be sent to jail for poaching if the Game Warden lands on the spot while they're still there.&#10;&#10;Initially trappers are restricted to the first level of the board, but when they successfully trap an animal, they may progress another level down the board, repeating the process as they bag bigger and better game. Cards from the Fur In deck (collected when traps catch animals) make movement, and therefore scoring, more predictable. Cards from the Fur Out deck (collected when larger traps catch bigger animals) allow players to slowly collect letters to spell out the names of the animals with the biggest ticket furs... and to eventually make top dollar. A deck of event cards, name Yellowhead Cards (after the nickname of a famous Iroquois trapper/trader named Pierre Bostonais) can significantly alter a player's turn. This deck is activated by landing on particular spaces spread around the board. (Interestingly, the Anti-Trapper player is instructed to interpret the Yellowhead Cards to the best of his ability from his perspective. Some Yellowhead Cards simply won't apply to the Anti-Trapper.)&#10;&#10;Players are allowed to trade or sell any in-game items to each other. This even applies to things like players combining Fur Out cards so that they can divide up a big score.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, players can buy Cabins to effectively take over certain game spaces for themselves. However this becomes an attractive target for the Anti-Trapper who'll want to burn the cabin down (as long as he can stay out of reach of the Game Warden).&#10;&#10;The game may be played to a time limit (Trapping Season) or to any other method of conclusion that they players can agree on. The winner is the player with highest cash value of combined resources (traps, cabins, and, of course, furs) when the game ends.&#10;&#10;The game includes the following components:&#10;- 1 Showshoe Playing Board&#10;- 7 Colored Playing Tokens&#10;- 6 Colored Sets of 50 Traps each&#10;- 10 Wooden Trappers Cabins&#10;- 1 Pair of Dice&#10;- 3 Different Sets of Cards (Fur In, Fur Out, &amp; Yellowhead)&#10;- 1 Pad of FUR Out Scoresheets&#10;- 1 FUR OUT Rules Booklet&#10;- 1 FUR OUT Player Aid Sheet&#10;&#10;",

These three foods are in three sizes: small, medium and large.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the die, then everyone races to place their hand on the animal that most wants the food rolled, i.e., the animal who has that food largest on its plate. The player who does this first wins a lion coin, then places a food tile in this animal's plate to show that it's been fed. If that same food is rolled again later, players must locate the plate where that food is medium-sized. Since this animal is also fed, ona third roll you find the animal who has the small version of this food. On a fourth roll of this food, you race to grab the Glutton character in the center of the circle, removing all the food tiles of this type after doing so.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect five lion coins wins the game.&#10;&#10;Lecker oder Gemecker! includes five variants, some of which are simple play variations while one is more involved, using the obverse of the lion coins, most of which have a special rule that affects which food or animal players need to find after the die is rolled.&#10;&#10;",

The battlefield is the lands and skies of Hyperborea, an exotic continent rich in natural resources, with a wide variety of ecosystems and full of amazing and terrific creatures. &#10;During thousands of years Hyperborea has been under the uncontested control of the Draconians, but now the Technocrats have arrived to the shores of the continent and they claim what once was theirs. The control of the land is what will bring victory to one or other. The Draconian extract their magic power from the earth, consuming the live and the natural resources around them. On the other hand, the power of the Technocrats comes from carbon and steel, both equal abundant in Hyperborea.&#10;A battle for supremacy over Hyperborea has begun and one thing is clear, no matter who wins, the scares in the lands of Hyperborea will last for centuries.&#10;&#10;Draconian Wars is a Non-Collectible Card Game where each player selects their deck of 50 cards in secret. Then, players take turns trying for their opponent to run out of resources. They can accomplish this by controlling as much areas of hyperborea as they can, or just crushing the opponent in battle.&#10;&#10;Players have a mixture of ground and air units to spread terror across the lands of Hyperborea. Also, they have a lot of surprises that can change the fate of any battle.&#10;&#10;The core set will include all you need to play, all the cards, all the challenges and all the fun you expect from a strategyc card game.&#10;&#10;Future expansions will include new cards (units, actions....) new challenges and more escitement to your games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Katalyka is a board game for 1-4 players that focuses on what it feels like to live as a member of the Stellar Consciousness of a Galaxy. It all starts with one Star for each player, and the goal is to invest your Stellar resources in the smartest strategic ways to build planets, then cultures that help grow your consciousness across the Galaxy! This is not a &quot;typical space opera shoot-em-up&quot; type game. Katalyka's system uses 'by the turn' customisable visual reference chart for deployment of Stellar resources into a full range of different gameplay styles. To truly master the Galaxy, you have to do more than just build space ships and lasers, in fact... right now those are relatively unimportant advancements in this game.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is similar to a cross between Risk and Magic The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Play should only take a few minutes to learn how to play, but the complexity of the strategic possibility increases nearly exponentially as the gameplay deepens.  There are 13 different types of interactions possible when interacting with an opponent, each of these pathways offers a different style of gameplay, and each one has been mastered by a different culture of the Galaxy.  Each group has different weaknesses and strengths, and can be seen as a hero, or a villain... depending on your game strategy.&#10;&#10;Learn trade and master transportation in The Circle of Life, master data archiving and planetary engineering in The Order of the Singularity, and befriend multidimensional predators or hire anarchist hackers in The Forgotten... as you try to build a culture rich enough to become a member of The Elite, mysterious beings with capabilities and resources spanning every level of life.&#10;&#10;This is a game unlike most others. I agree with those who said that a good strategy game takes minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. There are elements of this system that I have been working on developing for over two decades.&#10;I think that the loss of magic and mystery we experience with some of our scientific observations may be restored, and a more healthy balance of life can be found through respecting the Macro Organic life and finding new ways to interact with them... also learning to respect the old ways in a new light.&#10;&#10;This manual is divided into two sections, the quick start section (for those who want to just dive right in and start playing), and the Galactic Primer (for those of you who enjoy learning about the deeper backstory of the Universe of Katalyka).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If they match, she claims the sand chip and turns the forest chip face-down again, then the next player takes his turn. If they don't match, she hides the forest chip again, then rolls the die. On a red result, the robbers advance, moving the wagon forward with another sand chip falling through the hole in the wagon and adding to the trail; on a yellow result, the robbers are resting, so the good guys luck out and don't fall further behind.&#10;&#10;If the players reach the wagon &ndash; that is, if no sand chips lie between the players and the wagon &ndash; the robbers are captured and the players collectively win, with the one who collected the most sand chips receiving special commendation.
