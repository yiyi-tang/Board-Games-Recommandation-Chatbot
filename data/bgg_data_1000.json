    "Description": "Italia 1918 - A Farewell to Arms is an operational wargame which simulates the fierce fighting which pitted the troops of the Entente (Italy, France, Great-Britain and USA) against those of the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany) during the period between the Battle of Caporetto (Oct 1917) and the Villa Giusti Armistice (Nov 1918).&#10;&#10;Two A1 maps, printed front and back, are included. The &ldquo;global&rdquo; one covers the terrain between the Adige River and Trieste, to allow the players to simulate the whole campaign from Caporetto onwards. The &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map, with enlarged hexes, covers the terrain from Adige to the Adriatic sea in order to concentrate on the main combat zone after the Italian retreat: the Piave River, the Monte Grappa Massif, the Asiago Plateau and the Trento area &amp; for the second one the zone of the Austro-German offensive on the Isonzo that has been immortalised under the name of the battle of Caporetto. The 2 &frac12; countersheets include a complete OB for all the belligerents, from tenacious Italian &ldquo;Alpini&rdquo; to the redoutable German &ldquo;Alpenkorps&rdquo;, along with Austrian &ldquo;Kaiserj&auml;ger&rdquo;, Hungarian &ldquo;Honv&eacute;d&rdquo; divisions or French &ldquo;Chasseurs des Alpes&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Basic rules allow the players to tackle 6 variously sized scenarios, from 1 to 6 hours of play, using either a part of the board, or the map in its entirety. 5 of the scenarios are designed to be played on the &lsquo;zoom&rsquo; map, in order to take maximum advantage of the improved play experience provided by the larger hexes. Advanced rules allow the players to simulate the whole campaign; they introduce the reconstruction of destroyed units, the management of strategic reserves and the use of random events cards (50 for each side) with various effects and evocative titles such as &ldquo;Rommel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hemingway&rdquo; or &ldquo;I ragazzi del 99&rdquo; (&ldquo;The boys of 99&rdquo;), for example. Optional rules will allow players to explore several &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; possibilities.&#10; The campaign game is played on the &ldquo;global&rdquo; map, beginning with the Caporetto offensive and lasts 23 to 36 turns. &#10; &bull; Boxed game&#10;&bull; 2 A1 double-sided maps&#10;&bull; 1 A1 single-sided map&#10;&bull; 700 counters&#10;&bull; Rules booklet in english&#10;&bull; 24 pages campaign rules booklet in english&#10;&bull; 1 set of 100 event cards&#10;&bull; 2 A3 double-sided player aids [ Allied screen, Central powers screen ]&#10;&bull; 3 A4 single-sided player aids [ Strategic reserves for both sides &amp; other tracks ]&#10;&bull; 4 A4 double-sided player aids [ Scenario setups ]&#10;&bull; 2 A4 single-sided player aids [ Reinforcements &amp; Terrains ]&#10;&bull; 4 dice&#10;&#10;(from Nuts Publishing website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two new star players, Grombrindal, the white dwarf and his arch-nemesis, the Black Gobbo, are taking the pitch in Blood Bowl. Stats and rules for these two new star players are in the May 2017 issue of White Dwarf magazine as well as in a downloadable PDF.&#10;&#10;Grombrindal&rsquo;s reputation is almost mythological. Tales abound of his shrewd tactical advice on the field of battle; on the Blood Bowl pitch this translates to a mastery of team strategies and the ability to draw the very best out of the players around him.&#10;&#10;The Black Gobbo is legendarily devious, as evidenced by his countless elaborate schemes to undermine the White Dwarf. Before he even thinks about setting foot on the pitch, it&rsquo;s a given that he will have already established a web of bribery, hostage taking and other sneakiness that ensures the cooperation of the match officials.&#10;&#10;Legendary heroes, this Star Player duo can be used in games of Blood Bowl as long as one player has a Dwarf, Halfling, Human or Norse team and the other has a Chaos Renegade, Goblin, Orc or Underworld Denizen team. They&rsquo;re not hired in the same way as other Star Players &ndash; things like contract negotiations, legal issues or basic civility are pretty alien to them, honestly &ndash; and both must appear in your game.&#10;&#10;Grombrindal is looking in fine form: his miniature features a splendid shock of white hair and a magnificent beard covering a purposeful scowl, with plenty of Dwarven iconography appearing on his kit. The Black Gobbo is appropriately robed and behatted, with sneakily studded armour beneath the robes &ndash; and a bomb. He&rsquo;s clutching a bomb. That probably isn&rsquo;t going to end well.&#10;&#10;These resin miniatures come as 8 components, and are supplied with 2 32mm Blood Bowl bases.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Pincher (OP) is an alternative history wargame, designed by Ty Bomba, which allows two players to investigate the strategic parameters that would&rsquo;ve been in place in southeastern Europe and the Middle East had Stalin attacked there at that time, most likely in conjunction with a drive into Western Europe. His goal in starting such an operation would&rsquo;ve been to blitz to the oilfields and Allied base areas in North Africa and the upper Persian Gulf. That would&rsquo;ve effectively broken the geostrategic back of the British Commonwealth of Nations, disrupted Europe&rsquo;s oil supply, and delayed the US from being able to mount an atomic bombardment campaign into the USSR.&#10;&#10;The scenario is based on the actual &ldquo;Pincher&rdquo; series of defensive plans drawn up in the Pentagon from 1946 through 1949.&#10;&#10;There are rules for US atomic bombs, but their use is constrained by politics. That is, the late 1940s marked the arrival of the anti-imperialist (&ldquo;third world&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonaligned&rdquo;) movement on the world stage. So, if the Americans try to win by using enough bombs to blow to bits Stalin&rsquo;s attacking horde, they do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that victory in the strategic sense.&#10;&#10;The extra-large-hex 34x32&rdquo; map covers from Albania and Thrace south to Benghazi and Kuwait and east to Tehran and the Caspian Sea. Each hexagon represents 60 miles (97 km). Each of the eight full game turns represent two weeks of &lsquo;real time.'&#10;&#10;Communist units of maneuver are Soviet and satellite-nation armies (plus super-elite Guards Airborne divisions) along with Allied armies, corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments. There are no US units on-scene at the start of play, but army &ldquo;regimental combat teams&rdquo; and Marine Corps regiments and a brigade rush in as reinforcements. Air power is abstracted, with counters and rules showing the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary air superiority over portions of the map.&#10;&#10;Since this is a secondary theater (in regard to a presumed main front in Western Europe), the Communist player is never certain exactly what his order of battle will be until set up. He knows, however, it will contain a total of 12 to 14 Soviet combined arms, mechanized, shock and tank armies, along with 10 satellite-nation corps and armies (and possibly three to seven divisions of ultra-elite airborne divisions).&#10;&#10;Each match generally runs through three phases. In the first, the Communist juggernaut drives deep across Turkey and into Mesopotamia. Only the Turkish and Israeli Armies, and the use of a-bombs by the US, can slow the advance. As Soviet losses mount and US prestige sinks, the middle stage begins. It&rsquo;s characterized by both sides maneuvering, seeking to hold or take still-contestable key areas. The Soviet guards airborne force is most likely to make its appearance. A-bombs are still going off, but their targeting has to be ever more selective and there are fewer such attacks. During this period a well executed Soviet campaign will achieve its victory objectives. The end game sees an Allied counteroffensive, as that player throws in everything he&rsquo;s got to try to take back from the Communists enough victory hexes to overturn what will otherwise be their end-of-play win on points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 2137. The crew and equipment of the Time-Space Research Station, Chronomega One, have been emergency-ejected into outer space. You play one of the surviving scientists who must collect pieces of floating research tech and combine them into Electromagnetic-, Gravity-, and Time-bending tools to help bring Chronomega One back under control. You have no idea which member of the crew is responsible for the emergency protocol lock-down and crew ejection, so you can&rsquo;t trust any of them!&#10;&#10;The player's goal is to collect a full set of the three types of Computer cards (all values 1, 2, 3) to unlock the Station Key Code, and reach the central Computer portal of the station first (and in advanced play, before the station explodes).&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a rotating space station board and transparent hexagonal tech cards that represent the four 'suits' of the game, Electromag, Gravity, Chrono, and Computer. The players get three actions each turn to move about the board or play cards. They'll want to collect the floating tech cards during their turn and utilize them for different effects. All the tech cards consist of one of the four suits and are valued 1-3.&#10;&#10;If a player encounters another player on the board, they'll utilize their tech cards to engage in a showdown. This consists of each player bidding one of their tech cards. The bids are then revealed and winner determined based on the tech suit played. Certain types of tech defeat others: Electro defeats Grav, Grav defeats Chrono, Chrono defeats Electro. If two types of the same suit are played, higher values defeat lower. All suits defeat Computer, unless their values match (e.g. Grav 3 vs Computer 3), in which case the Computer suit player wins. The winner takes the card that was bid and may push the opposing player 3 spaces (if in outer space), or up or down one level of the space station (including out into an airlock).&#10;&#10;All tech cards have a basic function they may be played for as an action, such as move an extra space or to force another player to discard cards. Two transparent tech cards also may be combined and over-layed to activate a catalytic effect, which grants different powers based on the combined card's values and suits. If a full three-part set of tech cards are collected of the same suit (values 1, 2, and 3 of a single suit) they form a POD. These grant the most significant abilities in the game. The more powerful card effects require the player to be standing upon an appropriate research portal to use, either one of the permanent portals within the rotating space station or from a floating portal out in space that they cobbled together from another high-value tech card of the same suit.&#10;&#10;The space station itself is surrounded by trapped airlocks which make simply entering the station a risky endeavor. While inside, every time a player ends a turn within the space station their ring level rotates 90 degrees, lining up different portals and pathways with the inter-level Grav chutes. Furthermore, other players may cobble together Electro catalyzers from floating tech cards to try and teleport players into other areas of the station, spend Grav tech to pull cards away from other players, or utilize Chrono tech cards to cause the addition or loss of turns and actions.&#10;&#10;Once a player with a full hand of Computer cards reaches the inner Computer Portal of the station, they deactivate Chronomega One&rsquo;s self-destruct sequence and win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Westfront is a company to battalion level game for WW1 forces, designed for 1/72, 15mm or 10mm miniatures. Smaller scales could also be used.&#10;&#10;Westfront is designed with simplicity in mind, but since it represents communication issues, orders from above, random events like units becoming lost, as well as the actual movement and attacking of the various types of forces, it can become quite in-depth.&#10;&#10;Westfront has a fairly free-form army list composition; allowing players to choose infantry, cavalry, vehicles, various types of artillery, fortifications and barbed wire at their will. Units behave historically, and 4 different theaters are available to play in. Some will have a higher chance of poor weather, and if the entire tabletop is mud units like armored cars simply wont be able to function. Thankfully season is determined before players write their army lists, so they will know ahead of time what to expect.&#10;&#10;Westfront covers the evolution of the war and the changes in doctrines and units involved;&#10;&#10;Early war (1914 - 1915) will have only the most rudimentary artillery usage in preliminary bombardments, and only the basic units available (no tanks!).&#10;&#10;Mid War (1916) will see the standardization of the creeping artillery barrage (which really works in-game: artillery provides cover as troops advance, and causes enemies to keep their heads down if it explodes near them), indirect machine gun fire and of course the introduction of the first Mk.I tanks.&#10;&#10;Late war (1917 - 1918) will see advanced infantry tactics like Germans advancing machine gun teams through creeping barrages to set up in no mans land, and the introduction of more refined tanks and German anti-tank rifles.&#10;&#10;Westfront provides army lists for the Allied forces and the Central Powers, covering most of the units available. 3 qualities of infantry and cavalry are available (sup-par, regular and assault/veterans), and artillery is broken into 4 categories: Trench mortars like the minenwerfer or stokes mortar, flat-firing field guns like the 37mm maxim, and the various 77mm German guns (these have varying ranges depending on the specific gun), howitzer batteries like the 18-Pdr or 15cm SFH, and heavy howitzers like the 42cm M&ouml;rser or the BL 12-Inch. Fortifications are covered, with shallow and deep trenches, dug outs and pillboxes all available&#10;&#10;Westfront aims to give fun games around 2 hours long and to give a WW1 feel for the players. Much research has been done based on the accounts of actual combatants, attempting to implement some of the important features for those on the ground. For example a forward unit on the attack may start to run low on ammunition, so could send a runner back to request supplies, but the runner may get killed along the way... Another example might be a friendly unit capturing an enemy trench, only to get shelled by friendly artillery controlled by H.Q. They desperately send a runner back to their lines to tell the barrage to stop, but it will take a few turns for the order to get through...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While Canadian publisher Somerville clearly licenced the name Easy Money from Milton Bradley, it published a very different version of MB's 1935 game during WWII and for a short period of time afterwards (dropping the word wartime from the title). The Monopoly-like mechanics are the same: roll and move, buy properties and businesses and make money. In this version of Easy Money a player keeps playing/moving their token until throwing a &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;While the MB board had 48 spaces, the wartime Canadian game has only 28 spaces (six spaces and only two properties per side plus four corner spaces labelled &quot;Town Square&quot; (start); Hospital; Victory Bonds; and Income Tax. In addition, there is an inner Chance Circle of 24 spaces, each tied to one of the side spaces. Players who throw doubles on 2D6 take the result from the corresponding inner circle space without moving, and then roll again.&#10;&#10;The theme of wartime sacrifices is strongly represented: even when collecting $200 for passing the Town Square, $100 must be donated to the Victory Bond space, and a player landing on Victory Bonds takes only half the money there. There also are spaces for Blackout Regulations, Air Raid Defense Plan, Soldiers Welfare Project, War Project and Red Cross Project on the outer square, and spaces for Buy War Savings Stamps and Extra Call for Victory Bonds on the inner circle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Story&#10;&#10;Thornhill Mansion holds many secrets. Just before the turn into the 20th century Irwin Biddle purchased the house and turned it into what he called an orphanage care facility. But his severe governorship of the orphanage made the home for lost children anything but a haven. A fire in 1939 nearly destroyed the Thornhill Mansion. All but 13 children escaped the blaze. It wasn't until 1956 that Arthur Holland, a mining tycoon, purchased the Thornhill and footed the bill for a full renovation. However, it became clear within weeks of moving his family into the Thornhill that the Victorian mansion was far from settled. Holland's personal account of his family's stay in the Thornhill tells of unexplained children's voices, the sounds of little feet running through the night, of moaning heard inside the walls, even of parts of the house shifting. After leaving the Thornhill, Holland declared, &quot;The place is a house of the dead. No sane person can live well within its walls.&quot;&#10;&#10;13 ghosts live in the Thornhill, victims of the devastating fire that happened so long ago. As a ghost hunter, you welcome the chance to stay in the ghostly orphanage. Will you be the one to finally put the children to rest? Or will the malevolent child spirits drive you insane?&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;In Children the game, you wander around the Thornhill Mansion trying to trap ghosts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you deal the 13 Ghosts deck face down off to the side on the table. You then deal the 13 Toys cards face up over the 13 Ghosts cards, creating 13 2-card stacks. Each player gets 5 cards (the hand limit at the beginning of the game) from the Children deck.&#10;&#10;Players collectively build the Thornhill Mansion during their turns by placing room cards face up on the table in a grid pattern. The mansion is built in 4 levels--basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, and 3rd floor. Each room card indicates on which floor it must be placed.&#10;&#10;You search for toys and helpful devices by moving your pawn from room to room throughout the mansion. Each time you enter a room, you draw a card and add it to your hand. With a 5-card hand limit, players are forced to leave cards in rooms by placing them facedown beneath room cards. Players may also leave traps beneath room cards. You look at left-behind cards when you enter rooms. Left-behind traps spring immediately. You may add other left-behind cards to your hand.&#10;&#10;You place ghost cards into the mansion when they appear at the top of the draw pile. Ghost cards are placed face up beneath room cards so players can read ghosts' names and see the toy icons on the tops of the cards.&#10;&#10;To trap ghosts you must have Toy cards. Each ghost card is marked with a toy icon. If you are in a room with a ghost and you have its corresponding toy in your hand, you immediately trap the ghost and put it, along with the toy card, in front of you to keep score.&#10;&#10;When you trap a ghost, you must see if another ghost in the house becomes enraged. To do this, flip over the 2-card stack you made at the beginning of the game that corresponds with the toy you used to trap the ghost. If the revealed ghost is in the mansion, flip its card over to its enraged (red) side. Every enraged ghost in the house reduces the hand limit by 1 card. If the hand limit reaches 0 cards, no players win. The ghosts take the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The objective of this strategy game is to have conquered more fields than the opponent at the end of the game. Various game modes (victory conditions) are available. Played on a play area with 151 hexagonal squares, of which 139 can be conquered. Each player receives three tokens and 100 field marks. The game is turn-based. Each turn consists of the following four phases:&#10; 1. Move 2. Draw commands-cards 3. Capture by rolling 4. Capture by commands,&#10; which are always played in this order.&#10;When a player has completed his turn, the second player has his turn. This is repeated until one of the players has won the game mode determined by both players at the beginning. &#10;The player has to move each of his token one field every turn. He rooling the dice for each token and destinkt so how many fields he can conquer surround his token. If the player roll a five he can conquer or free five fields.   &#10;The player conquer free fields or free conquered fields. If a field with a token is conquerd, the token go back to the spawn.  &#10;Each time a player move on one of the 12 fields with a star (wich can not be conquerd) he has to draw a command-card.&#10;With this command-cards he can supply for example his movement, instead of one movement turn per token he has by playing the command &quot;move +1&quot; two turns for one token. The command-cards are very different. Some have supply effects for the movement other supply the conquering and others are traps with negative effects. Some of the command-cards ask the player to roll the dice. For example how many fields a player lose by drawing a trap-card.&#10;Some commands (max 5)can be collected in the &quot;depot&quot; and played as a chain.&#10;&#10;There is also an assist app available in Google Playstore&#10;&#10;",

They then place their fielders on the board in setting that matches this type of bowler. Then outcome (and runs scored) of each delivery is determined by drawing a card from a deck of cards. Each card has six possible outcomes, however the outcome is determined by the bowler type (fixed for this over) and therefor is typical to a batsmen playing a delivery from that type of bowler. A well placed field by the bowler should ensure lower scores from the batting team.&#10;&#10;Each over consists of four deliveries, so each innings is therefore 200 balls.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with or without a scoresheet as a simple magnetic scoring grid (with markers) is printed on the game board.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who amasses the most runs.&#10;&#10;From the rules booklet &quot;To play a Board game of cricket in the true spirit of the cricketing tradition.

The orbits are further divided into regions of varying economic and strategic value. Additionally, there are 5 transit hubs which facilitate jumping between orbits. The  object of the game is to eliminate the other players through conquest or, alternatively, to successfully monopolize all transit hubs for an economic victory.&#10;&#10;Holding regions of space are the source of income in the game. The value of regions can be increased by constructing and upgrading space stations. To protect valuable regions, force fields may be constructed. Isolating regions behind force fields, however, diminishes their economic output. A player must, therefore, strike a careful balance between security and trade.&#10;&#10;Players may attack adjacent regions with their fleets of space ships. There are three types of space ships in Sunship. Combat is played out on special cards on which the placement of space ships is significant. Depending on the type of ship, the player may select difficult to hit positions, cloak their attack, or attack from the rear. The combat system is elegant, versatile, and based on basic bit math.&#10;&#10;",

You build your Ass out of 5 cards, Tail, Back Legs, Middle, Front Legs, Head.&#10;&#10;All the while, you play cards to Kick someone&rsquo;s Ass which makes them lose pieces of their Ass and drink so it get&rsquo;s better the more ass you kick.&#10;&#10;There are also defensive cards such as Kiss My Ass that will prevent this and force the kicker to drink.&#10;&#10;",

On each side is rectangular block of colored numbers, with 1-35 on one side and 36-70 on the other. There are illustrations of fighting in the four corners, with uniforms representing the then-recent Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.&#10;&#10;To start, the players each put an agreed amount into the pot to fund the war. They then take turns rolling a single die, and advancing that many spaces on their respective tracks. The first to reach space 70 wins the war and the pot.&#10;&#10;The color of each space has an effect on play. If a player lands on a green space, the opponent must drop back to the nearest red space. A player who lands on a blue space must pay one mark to his opponent. Landing on a gold space means paying a mark into the pot, while landing on a lilac space grants another roll of the die.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a sheet of paper pasted onto thick cardboard. A second game is pasted onto the reverse side.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to block all tetrahedrons of your rival.&#10;&#10;In this game there is no captures or direct confrontation of pieces. During the game the number of pieces is not changed, all tetrahedrons are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. The compact starting position of pieces passes through various irreversible metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its &quot;energy&quot;, freezes as a result. You can play with 18, 24, 30, 36 or 42 pieces. The more pieces, the harder the game will be.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated color. Players alternate turns. All tetrahedrons must be connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a piece to move if doing so disconnects the remaining pieces, even if they would be reconnected after putting the piece into its new location. Each tetrahedron always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 12. Tetrahedrons are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby triangles. Neighbors are divided into two types - orthogonal and diagonal. The piece can be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The piece can also be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move. When both players lose moves consecutively it's a draw.&#10;&#10;",

The admin aims to fix vulnerabilities in a computer system before hackers steal too much information.&#10;&#10;The admin wins by acquiring a certain number of progress tokens based on the number of players, and to make progress, the admin must perform &quot;operations&quot; multiple times successfully while avoiding interference from hackers.

    "Description": "&quot;War in the Megacity&quot; is a two-player simulation of hypothetical near-future battles fought in metropolitan areas with populations of 10 million or more, and it&rsquo;s designed by Joseph Miranda. The objective is to show the spectrum of conflict &mdash; conventional, special operations and unconventional &mdash; used in this type of fighting on the grand-tactical level. There are two sides, both controlled by a player, the Insurgent, who wants to seize control of the city. Opposing him in that effort is the Government player.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Infowar Index&rdquo; is central to play. Each player has one, which indicates how successful he is in achieving his goals &mdash; and representing the amount of overall public support each side is getting.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents from two days to two weeks of &lsquo;real time,&rsquo; depending on the tempo and scope of the activities conducted in each one. The various units represent force sizes &ndash; most either task-organized or spontaneously generated at street-level &ndash; varying in size between battalions and brigades: anywhere from about 500 to 5,000 personnel.&#10;&#10;Megacity has a number of unusual subsystems. For one, victory in battle isn&rsquo;t always reckoned in terms of physically destroying the enemy but, rather, in fighting him in such a way as to get the media&rsquo;s reporting squarely on your side. Another important aspect of the game is that certain combat results cause units to get stronger, as they gain in cohesion and tactical expertise.&#10;&#10;The system has antecedents in earlier games, in particular, Jim Dunnigan's &ldquo;Chicago, Chicago!&rdquo; It presented the first wargame approach to confrontations between police and demonstrators during the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was one of the first attempts to model modern urban warfare, albeit in a &ldquo;battle&rdquo; in which no one was killed though there was plenty of havoc in the streets.&#10;&#10;Counterfact magazine #9&#10;&#10;",

It's full of things you need, and there is treasure to be found. But beware! The forest is also full of monsters!&#10;&#10;In The Forest Dragon you will create a fantasy world from cards, and then explore it. In a round of the game players lay out rows of cards that make up the world they are going to explore. They take it in turns to reveal one card at a time, and follow instructions on the card: Resources are collected in your backpack. Adventure items also go in the backpack, but help with the adventure. Monsters will end your expedition, sometimes taking items you've collected! You can chose to head home at any time and bank your finds. Or keep going, risking it all! Pushing your luck and knowing when to stop are key.&#10;&#10;With amazing art from Rory and his little brother Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!&#10;&#10;",
