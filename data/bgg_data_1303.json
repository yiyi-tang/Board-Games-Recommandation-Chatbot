    "Description": "Yoru is a chaotic and quick party card game. Players battle fiercely to get the eternal scrolls and win the match. In the game there are 5 ninja clans that hold the scrolls. Each clan has unique cards with different powers. Use the cards wisely and don't forget if you run out of cards, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning, all players receive 1 objective card at the beginning of the game. The player's objective card cannot remain in his hand, and must be turned over until the victory condition is reached. Then the main deck is shuffled and all players are dealt 5 cards. An objective card is face up. The player who has the most black pieces of clothing begins.&#10;&#10;Players lose if they have no cards in their hand, or if they have more than 15 cards in their hand. The player wins if he has all the scrolls of the symbols on his objective card.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fan Fu Football is the live action fantasy football card game designed to play along with live or recorded football games.&#10;&#10;Fan Fu Football brings 1 - 4 players into direct fantasy competition at every kick-off. Football is a game of &quot;Touchdowns&quot; and &quot;First downs&quot;. Our simple game mechanics grant our players drive by drive action without infringing on watching the game.&#10;&#10;Turn on a game, deal 5 cards, and on kick-off put fantasy cards &quot;In Play&quot;. Immediately redraw to a 5-card hand (draw after every card put in play).&#10;&#10;On every subsequent first down, put more cards in play. The first &quot;Drive&quot; always begins with a kick-off and player also play on first downs, so each game usually starts with two plays, to start a &quot;Drive&quot;. Stack your cards of the same position or diversify your position cards to get maximum points on each drive of the game. Star and Rookie cards can be played at any time and can perform different actions and bonuses, as well as score points.&#10;&#10;A &quot;Drive&quot; ends with a punt, turn-over, field goal or touchdown. If a &quot;Drive&rdquo; ends with a punt or turnover, score the points for the cards in &quot;In Play&quot; and discard them. When a &quot;Drive&rdquo; ends with a field goal or touchdown, score the points for the cards in &quot;In Play&quot;, discard them, as well as your hand, and draw a new hand. It's just that simple.&#10;&#10;Pick up and play on certain drives, per quarter, half, or a whole game. The easy scoring system helps keep track of the score.&#10;&#10;Are you a gamer who loves sports too?  This game was built by gamers and requires strategy. Gameplay is based on live events, guaranteeing each round of Fan Fu Football will be unique.

    "Description": "In the realm of the Grim Reapers, it is the Joker&rsquo;s party who rules, for now. They oppress the reapers and banish the heretics. The banished Grim Reapers wish nothing but regaining their power, so they assemble secretly, endeavoring to take back their control over the Reaper&rsquo;s Realm through a mysterious sacrificial ritual. However, the assembly room is already penetrated by the Jokers --- the orders of the offerings are disrupted, and the real class of the offerings can&rsquo;t be identified! The clock is ticking, and the right moment for the ritual is about to pass. The Exilers have no choice but to start a &ldquo;Life-and-Death&rdquo; battle with the Jokers&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;&quot;Vitamors Conspiro&quot; is a social deduction game of hidden loyalty. Players take the role of either the &ldquo;Exiler&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Joker&rdquo;, through &ldquo;Offering Up a Sacrifice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Start the Ritual&rdquo; to attain victory. Players may start the ritual whenever the number of the character cards on the altar meets the requirements; however, to start the ritual successfully, the combination of the character cards have to be correct, too. That means players may also win the game by cheating their opponents, misleading them to start the ritual with a wrong combination and cause the ritual to fail. When there are 9 character cards on the altar, yet the ritual hasn&rsquo;t been started, the Jokers automatically win the game (they are already in charge of the Reaper&rsquo;s Realm, after all).&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#185;&#131;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#145;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#229;&#190;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#165;&#130;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#163;&#147;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#231;&#156;&#190;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#231;&#148;&#152;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#150;&#188;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#229;&#175;&#134;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#229;&#156;&#150;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#141;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#173;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#229;&#165;&#170;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#232;&#128;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#229;&#183;&#178;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#145;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#230;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#131;&#133;&#231;&#141;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#173;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#229;&#186;&#143;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#228;&#186;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#231;&#165;&#173;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#175;&#166;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#232;&#190;&#168;&#232;&#173;&#152;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#231;&#156;&#188;&#231;&#156;&#139;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#233;&#140;&#175;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#145;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#230;&#136;&#176;&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#232;&#172;&#128;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#141;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#148;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#168;&#177;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#232;&#168;&#138;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#233;&#154;&#177;&#232;&#151;&#143;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#136;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#168;&#177;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#146;&#176;&#231;&#175;&#128;&#233;&#156;&#128;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#161;&#168;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#160;&#230;&#173;&#164;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#187;&#187;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#229;&#128;&#153;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#232;&#168;&#142;&#232;&#171;&#150;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#232;&#168;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#185;&#171;&#229;&#138;&#169;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159

    "Description": "Stress Botics Odyssey expands the heavy eurogame experience in 5 axes, while maintaining the basic rules and rhythm of the base game.&#10;&#10;The first enhanced axis is the main room (the room where Alpha Bot currently is). Odyssey&rsquo;s alternate board contains a zoom of the main room, and thus players will have to take into account their positioning, in order to fight against the cylindroids and defend Alpha Bot from them. If Alpha Bot does not reach the surface, deliveries to ships will be much more complex to execute!&#10;&#10;The second enhanced axis are the Cylindroids. When the players eliminate an entire wave of enemies, a Cylindroid Elite will appear. This powerful enemy is Alpha Bot&rsquo;s nemesis, and boasts its own AI and complex behaviour.&#10;&#10;The third enhanced axis is Alpha Bot. Beta Bots will be able to access the interior of Alpha Bot through a new type of action. Once inside they will be able to control Alpha Bot's AI in order to speed up its behavior, change its direction to crush enemies or avoid obstacles, repair shields, collect resources or equip objects, among many other things. However, players will have to be cautious when interacting with AlphaBot... If it receives damage while being controlled, it will activate its other temperamental AI revealing one of its multiple aggressive behaviors, such as going back to an already explored main room or indiscriminately attacking any robot next to it!&#10;&#10;The fourth enhanced axis is the Solo Mode. By adding Delta Bot, a small robot that will accompany us to fulfill our objectives, adventurous players can play the game on their own. Odyssey includes an additional board to be affixed to the player's blueprint in order to expand management during the maintenance phases, as well taking care of Delta Bot. If the little companion accumulates too much stress it will explode, making the game much harder for the solo player.&#10;&#10;The fifth enhanced axis is additional content. Odyssey adds more items to the current sets, including a new type of item: the boxed items.  Those can be dynamically equipped from the main room to be used more immediately, adding a touch of improvisation both to combat and to the strategies that structure the game. In addition, Odyssey includes modular boards that expand the detail of several mechanics and include unique characteristics in each player count.&#10;&#10;",

From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was colonized by Japan. In that time, Japan heavily invested in modernizing Taiwan&rsquo;s railway system around the island, with bold plans including building tunnels and tracks through mountains. In the Taiwan map for Mini Express, the white company represents Japan. Players are seeking to expand tracks across the island, especially to the 6 major cities; however, mountains pose a logistical problem. Players can at any time invest in Japanese modernization, and it indeed comes with benefits. However, the more players do business with Japan, the tighter the restrictions are in the game. Soon, you might find your influence in a company reduced to nothing if you&rsquo;re not careful. Fulfill your dreams of steel and steam!

The game ends when the Winter Wraiths are defeated and the Boilers in the forest are reignited.&#10;&#10;Karukinka was designed for the Financial Education Department of the Social Investment and Solidarity Fund (FOSIS) of the Ministry of Social Development of the Government of Chile. Its use was initially implemented in schools in five regions throughout Chile. Within the framework of a campaign to strengthen the value of savings in 14-15 years aged children.

K. Ferguson, Drew Tucker and many others), innovative mechanics and a sophisticated game system about survival. And it's unbelievably fun to play!&#10;&#10;RTA is set in a near future, a prophetic future. A future in which the world has been devastated by a terrible Total War. And from the ashes of war a dreadful disease spread out, a plague which affects both men and machines: it is called the RUST.&#10;&#10;In this rotten, shattered world, humanity has been decimated... and the survivors have gathered into 4 factions, to the four corners of the Earth, fighting each others for survival.&#10;&#10;Among the survivors, there are some chosen ones, a few special individuals who seem to be immune to the plague and who soon become heroes for their peoples.&#10;&#10;They are called: the Masters. And you, as a player, will be one of them!&#10;&#10;... description from the official website (www.rusttheafterworld.com)&#10;&#10;",

It's a two-day spot sale, and the players want to clean up and grab all those bargains. The goal is to clear all their hands of all cards before the game ends. If any player is left holding a card at the end of the game, they all lose.&#10;&#10;The game has a deck of 48 cards numbered 1-48. The cards are in sections each with their own theme, 1-9 (Kitakuba), 10-19 (butterflies), 20-29 (eyeglasses), 30-39 (yokai), 40-48 (fanzines).&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and seven cards are dealt out face-down to each player. Players sort their hand and then choose a hand card, placing it face-down. Once everyone has chosen, they reveal their card, and the lowest card is placed first in the centre (onto an imaginary zero), and then the next card and so on (similar to Take 5. Cards are played into a pile, and lower cards are hidden and not to be examined later.&#10;&#10;Then each player draws a card so their hand is back to seven, and play continues in the same way.&#10;&#10;At any point, even at the start, a player can call for a trade, and all players pass a card to the left. Successive trades can be made in the same round, but only six trades are allowed in the whole game. A marker is moved along a track on the rear of the game box to count the trades.&#10;&#10;Discussion is allowed in the game, but is limited. Players cannot say or imply a specific numbered card, but can talk in general about their cards. For example, 'I have two 20s', or 'I have zero Kitakuba'. In this way, players can work out which cards would be good to trade or keep in hand.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot play a card to the pile legally, the first day of sales ends and the pile is set to one side. Play continues for a second day, starting at zero again. If a player cannot play legally again, day two ends and the players all lose.&#10;&#10;If the players succeed in clearing their entire hands before day two ends, they all win.&#10;&#10;(Note: this game was published in Japan in 2016, before The Mind in 2018).&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In four locations you will position witches out of your hand and attempt to take control in small and larger scale confrontations, with the mysterious Gatekeeper playing a merciless referee using some unique dynamic mechanics.&#10;&#10;When positioning a witch of a specific element at a location, columns are formed. A new witch will compare her spellpower with that of the opposing witch, with the higher value &quot;dazzling&quot; the weaker party. In dazzled state, witches are vulnerable for the vicious Gatekeeper that is now activated by the Gatekeeper value on the last played witch, moving X-number of locations in a set cycle movement. In the location she lands in, she will check if a dazzled witch is present and eliminate her from the contest.&#10;&#10;Next, she will activate a rondel and move a marker to the next position, activating the next Element Gate in line.&#10;By activating the gate she awakens all the witches of this element present at the location, triggering a larger scale confrontation, with the player holding majority inflicting damage equal to the number of withes they have present. The defending player can however fend off part of the attack with opposing witches.&#10;&#10;Each witch also cast 1 of 10 unique special spells, each manipulating parts of the duel in devious ways. This additional layer creates tough decisions in an already challenging duel of wits.&#10;&#10;Will you control the Astral plane by lowering the mana level of your opponent to &quot;0&quot;?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Both races contribute a set of unique cards (used for actions and conflict resolution) and their Fleet (represented by a miniature with a functional tray to put your armies on).&#10;&#10;From the first turn of the game, you partake in a &ldquo;Fistfight in a space elevator&rdquo; of a kind. All around you&rsquo;ll have bloodthirsty neighbors waiting to strike. It is crucial to pick your battles and keep tabs on opponents - to know when to push back and when to tactically retreat.&#10;The aim of the game is to achieve the eponymous Final Fusion, a feat of cosmic engineering on par with building a death star. This task requires getting Void Particles (VP for short), either by extracting them, colonizing locations, or dominating your opponents. While at it players strategically buy new technologies for their decks, gain Traits, and man their fleets to prepare for massive space battles.&#10;&#10;Beware! The more VP you have, the easier it is to complete Final Fusion, but if you wait too long, another player might initiate the Fusion before you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There's the solo betting mode, where it's just you and your wagering savvy matching wits with tonight's card. Or, get friends together and make a night of it, each making your own bets to see who's the top dog. Nobody available tonight? You can still make it a party, matching wits with one or more of our card stock fronton-fans, who will place their own bets as you place yours. Or, you can skip the betting entirely and create your own professional jai-alai tour with a regular season, playoffs and a league champion!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Paradise-Opoly is a nostalgic and detailed memoir of the small mountain town of Paradise, CA that was devastated by wildfire in 2018. The games base mode uses classic monopoly mechanics and is completely redesigned and re-themed around Paradise culture, history and community. The process of whittling down what would be represented from the town involved hundreds of community members suggesting and voting online what should be included. The result is a rich and well-rounded portrayal of our little town. My main purpose in the design of the game was for it to really give someone that feeling of home when they play it, whether you are from there or not. Nearly every person who was in Paradise that day lost everything. Not only their homes, pets and even family members, but they lost their community. The town was completely changed forever in a matter of hours. My intent is to capture the spirit of Paradise that so many love, cherish and miss dearly.&#10;&#10;I am not a game developer, by any means. I just had an idea, shortly after the fire, to create this game to commemorate the town. Since that idea I have learned many things and the idea has grown into a beautifully designed and well thought out game. I am currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign and fully expect to reach my funding goal so I can produce 3000 games. 100% of the net-profits from my company sales of the games and merchandise will be donated back to non-profits aimed at immediate rebuilding projects for lower income residents of Paradise. I intend to represent my town and help in any way I can.&#10;&#10;The game features fun, vibrant and colorful artwork and design by Traci Van Wagoner and Kurt Keller of Imagine That! Design in New York. They have done an amazing job with conveying the detail and nuance I wanted in every illustration and design. All of the metal game miniatures are custom designed by the very talented 3D sculptor, Chad Hoverter, and represent somethng special and unique to Paradise. Even the old &quot;houses and hotels&quot; are now Miner's Tents and Log Cabins, one of the many references to the very prominent gold rush history of the area. All of the &quot;Property&quot; cards contain a short story or description about the landmark or place they contain. Included is a full color information booklet with extended versions of the stories. For some playing that weren't locals or for kids who may not know all the history of their town the game serves as a fun learning experience of the towns culture and beginnings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two games in a wooden box&#10;&#10;1. Factors Game&#10;The playing board is a grid of hexagons with number on each space. Players take turns throwing a dice and moving their markers to an adjacent space that is a multiple of the number on the dice. First to reach the finish wins.&#10;&#10;2. 45 Game&#10;The board is similar to the one used in the Factors Game except the numbers on each space are different. Players add the number shown on the dice to the number their markers are on. If the sum is a number which is adjacent to the space they're on, they can move to that new space. First to reach the top (45) is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
