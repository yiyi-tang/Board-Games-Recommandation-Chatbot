    "Description": "In this original and distinct game expanding from the world of XIG: The Four Elements, players challenge each other to complete a Sorcerers Sword while battling to control the rings of the four elements: Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.&#10;Each player begins the game with 36 shuffled tiles. Each tile is potentially a piece of their sword which requires only 30 tiles to complete. Every tile represents a different Sorcerer. Specific Sorcerers allow the players to cast spells as the tiles are put into play, as well as displace their opponent's tiles.&#10;Tiles can be linked together in many combinations as long as they don't break elemental rules (for example: Water cannot be linked above fire since fire would then be extinguished). Element combinations allow the players to obtain, or steal rings which can give the controlling player certain game advantage.&#10;The first player to complete their sword wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From Firefight Games website)&#10;&quot;Resistance is not Futile&quot; covers the Insurrection of the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1943. With most of its remaining population already having endured years of privation and growing squalor, mass deportations, and learning that soon the Nazis would be back to send the remainder to Concentration Camps, an insurrection broke out on the eve of Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s birthday. Local SS commander, Jurgen Stroop, believed the troops he had on-hand would make for a quick end to this impudent act of defiance by the Jews and the Polish Home Army members who choose to rise up against the Third Reich. His underestimation of the Jewish and Polish defenders was a costly mistake, as the fight lasted for weeks and cost the Germans and their fascist allies dearly.&quot;&#10;&#10;Firefight Games had to suspend sales of this game.&#10;&#10;Map scale: 100 yards per inch&#10;Counter scale: squad/platoon &#10;Game turn: 2 or 3 days&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the round, tally up you points and see whose words are worth the most!&#10;It takes a combination of luck, skill, and fast reflexes to score big at Scrosswords.

Holes are rated for their effect on scoring, and have been painstakingly rated to account for the major hazards and features that will challenge golfers.&#10;&#10;The game includes an optional (but highly recommended) weather system that modifies dice rolls for weather and wind, pin placements, and user setting of rough (although a die roll could also make that determination).&#10;&#10;There is also a QuickPlay system that allows players the ability to play a round in just three dice rolls for each golfer.  This gives players the opportunity to complete entire tournaments in a reasonable amount of time.&#10;&#10;And the best part about the QuickPlay system is that you can mix-and-match the three QuickPlay options (full round, nine-hole version, and six-hole version) to QuickPlay some of each round, then switch to the regular game to play out exciting finishes.&#10;&#10;The game comes with the following:&#10;&#10;-- 2005 men's golfer set (202 cards)&#10;-- Six courses (Augusta, Baltusrol, The Belfry, Pinehurst, Sawgrass, and St. Andrews)&#10;-- Weather and Course Condition Cards&#10;-- Suspense Charts&#10;-- QuickPlay Charts for all six courses&#10;-- Rules&#10;&#10;The game is available in two formats:&#10;&#10;1) E-Game Format via Hot Stove Games:  We send you the files, you print the components using your own equipment or local print shop.  E-mail us at hotstovegames@yahoo.com for ordering information.&#10;&#10;2) Printed Format via Downey Games:  You receive a full-color, printed version of the game with die-cut golfer and course cards, sent to you in a sturdy storage box.

Players then plot the movement of their forces for the 15 turns constituting the year.  Orders can be changed under certain circumstances (e.g., if your kingdom is invaded).&#10;&#10;Combat is conducted using a deck of cards, with the number drawn for each side being determined by their strengths.&#10;&#10;There are some optional rules, including rules for ambushes, capturing enemy leaders, a 7th and 8th player taking the roles  of pirates or bandits, and wizards, a new type of unit who can cast a variety of spells and create magical creatures such as dragons.&#10;&#10;The game components are:&#10;26-page rulebook&#10;17&quot; x 21.75&quot; color map&#10;50 combat resolution cards&#10;112 very small cardboard chits (16 each in 7 colors, lettered A-P)&#10;2 small black and white copies of the map&#10;2 movement programming sheets&#10;2 dice&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Conquest is a strategic space exploration and conquest (naturally) game for 2-4 players.  Each player starts in a system at a corner of the map and expands outward from there.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a different spacefaring race/organization - the Terrans, the Olso Empire, the Federation (changed to the Confederation in the second edition), and the Tholians (changed to the Lothians in the second edition).  Each has a different set of units they can build, with varying capabilities - ships are rated for space combat, ground (bombardment) combat, drive system, and what kind of damage they take from the various combat results.&#10;&#10;When a star is explored a card is drawn which determines the class of the inhabitable world found there and, if inhabited, its attitude to each of the players.  In addition to the attitude the value of each kind of planet varies by player.&#10;&#10;There are three different long-range movement systems in the game - warp drive, jump drive (similar to warp drive but much less accurate), and stargates, which have to be built and carried to where you want to use them.  Each player uses one of the three systems for their ships.&#10;&#10;The second edition, in addition to changing the names of two of the races, changed some of the ship designs which were similar to Star Trek and Star Wars ships. It also changed the name of the game to The Conquest and Exploration of Space.&#10;&#10;",

The next player may then take this card or selects another. Play continues; should a player turn over a card the he already has, play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to cover all his characters on his playing board.&#10;&#10;FOR OLDER CHILDREN: If a player picks up a card he does not need he replaces the card face downwards on the table. The other players then have to remember where that card was replaced if they need that particular character.&#10;&#10;",

The instructions detail the dice version of CORX, which adds the element of chance, and the no-dice version (which involves moving your game pieces a pre-determined number of spaces each turn) that will appeal more to the serious chess, checkers, or go players.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to march your games pieces across the game board, capturing other players' corx, avoiding capture of your own, and trying to capture another player's &quot;Base&quot;.&#10;&#10;Game pieces can be moved in any direction. Players can protect their own game pieces by forming &quot;Blocks&quot;, and the player who occupies &quot;Center Space&quot; has special privileges.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a base is captured, and players then add up their points. The player with the highest score wins (which is often not the player who has ended the game by capturing a Base).&#10;&#10;&quot;Match&quot; play involves playing 3 games, with the person who has the most match points winning the Match. Match points are awarded for each game won, and for having the most total game points. It is highly recommended that CORX be played in matches, as that adds another strategic dimension to the game. Because the winner of a match is determined by who has the most &quot;match points&quot; (instead of whoever wins 2 out of 3 games), players need to assess the &quot;big picture&quot; before making the decision to end a game.&#10;&#10;Corx with dice works best with 3-4 players.

All units are company size.&#10;&#10;The scale of the battle for Kasserine Pass differs from the original 2 miles/hex. The map is zoomed in on the pass itself and is scaled at 0.35 miles/hex. This also led to a change in time scale. Every turn is now 4 hours (instead of half a day in the original game).&#10;&#10;A few minor alterations in the original rules have been made to accommodate the change of scale.&#10;&#10;",

Each set of colored chips is segmented into 3 sets (10 each) of 1, 2, and 3-minute activities. Play starts when each player antes up a corresponding minute chip and 5 cards are dealt (a 1-minute ante must be matched by another 1-minute ante and so on). As play progresses, each player may elect to call, raise, or fold. Players bet by choosing among the chips that contain the activities that they would be willing to perform in the event they lose. At showdown, the player with the best poker hand will get to receive all of the chip activities that were bet from the other player. For example, if the guy wins the hand, the woman must now perform all of the activities contained on the pink chips that were bet into the pot. When you ante up, you are not deciding what you want done to you; you are choosing what you will do for your partner. This way, players own comfort level will dictate how 'hot' things get. Choose your own variation of poker or stick with the standard 5-card draw. Poker rules and a hand-ranking sheet are included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crushed by the initial Nazi onslaught, the Red Army reeled back across hundreds of miles. But as resistance stiffened, it became clear that some highly-motivated units fought better than others. These became the Guards, first named in September 1941. They became the Red Army&rsquo;s best troops, with better training, equipment and pay than the regular army.&#10;&#10;Red Warriors is a supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focusing on these elite fighters and their exploits. It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front, Road to Berlin and Battle of the Bulge to play all of the scenarios.&#10;While the Soviet Guards are of excellent quality, the supplement also includes German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ground troops of rather dubious merit, plus German Army forces.&#10;Scenarios cover actions of these units in the first two years of the Great Patriotic War, many of them focused on the Soviet Operation Mars, also the subject of our Red God of War game at the operational scale. This supplement lets you explore the same battle at a more detailed level.&#10;&#10;The pieces and half of the scenarios appeared in our Heroes of the Soviet Union game, released in 2001 and long since retired to Valhalla. Each scenario from the older game has been completely revised to make use of the many boards and pieces we&rsquo;ve published since they first appeared. Each scenario is fully laid out on its own scenario card rather than the booklet used in most of our games.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Battle of the Bulge: Platoon Level Combat in World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are colored and there are bonuses for using only one color in a word and laying it in the section of the board of that color.  The playing area is cross-shaped, with each arm of the cross a different color.  The center section contains dual color areas.  Words are played trying to reach the end of an arm for a bonus.  Once the bonus is awarded, play is towards the next arm of the cross.  once the fourth bonus is taken, the game ends and highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",
