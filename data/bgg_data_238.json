The board consists of a (very sketchy) schematic of the battle area overlaid with arrows indicating the troop movements, much as one might see on a diagram of a battle.&#10;&#10;The arrows are divided into spaces - on a turn, a player rolls a die and moves a piece (infantry or cavalry - the artillery does not move) along the appropriate arrow (which arrow or arrows it can use depends on where it starts).  Landing on certain spaces may let you advance further, or may destroy the piece (there are a number of the latter spaces on the Light Brigade&#039;s paths).  Getting to the end of an arrow destroys an enemy piece, generally, but sometimes has other effects on the opponent.&#10;&#10;There are special rules for each group indicating what its orders are or what it actually did in the battle, more or less (some can traverse the arrows more than once, etc.).&#10;&#10;While the box says that either 2 or 4 people can play, there is no provision in the rules for more than 2, and no obvious way to accommodate this.&#10;&#10;Greensmith designed a similar game for Palitoy on the battle of Waterloo.&#10;&#10;",

The Sagas of Conquest (First edition 2001) was chosen Italian Game of the Year 2001 in LuccaGames, the most distinguished Games Fair in Italy. In the same year was chosen best Independent Production 2001 in Acquicomics Fair.&#10;Note: Tempus Draconis is the Multilingual edition of Millenarocca (Italian boardgame 2003); But this version have some better changes in the material, pieces and components. Rules in 5 Languages: Italian, French, English, German and Spanish!&#10;&#10;The game develops in 4 phases:&#10;&#10;* To set the eight prisoners free&#10;    * To complete your own Amulet&#10;    * To defeat the Monster&#10;    * To come out of the Millenarocca&#10;&#10;1 - The Adventurers must set all the Prisoners free, and each Prisoner will give them a piece of Amulet. The first Amulet on top of the pack of cards must be given, you cannot choose. The prisoner freed last will reveal to which element the Monster belongs and this time he will give a piece of Amulet with a sign contrary to that of the Monster, no longer a piece chosen at random.&#10;&#10;2 - After freeing the last prisoner, add the remaining pieces of Amulet to the &quot;Room&quot; pack of cards, so that every player can complete his/her Amulet. You can attack the Monster only if you have 4 pieces of Amulet and after all the Prisoners have been set free. Re-shuffle the pack of &quot;Room&quot; cards and also the pack of the &quot;Runes of Power&quot;.&#10;&#10;3 - Chase the Monster and, if you are able to get it, give it a sound beating! The life points of the Monster are given according to the Monsters Table. It is not at all certain that you will be able to defeat it at the first attack. N.B. The Adventurer that defeats the Monster is teleported out of the Millenarocca, he is safe and he leaves the other players busy with phase 4 of the game.&#10;&#10;4 - The Adventurers left must reach one of the exits and they must avoid perishing in the collapse of the Millenarocca.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the winners are those able to come out of the Millenarocca.&#10;&#10;",

These clue cards are played on another player's board by placing them on a &quot;scale of relevance&quot; ranging from &quot;Exactly&quot; to &quot;Not at all&quot;.

Speed is a predecessor of the popular game UNO and a contemporary of Whot.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of cards (6 cards for 2 or 3 players, 5 cards for 4 or 5 players). Players play cards by matching the set of the previously played card (Aeroplane, Train, Ship, Motor or Animal), or by playing a card bearing the same number in the top corner (the Animal suit has 2 numbers per card). When a player is unable to do either of these, he draws a card from the draw deck.&#10;&#10;'Lightning' cards act as wild cards, allowing the player to call the next set to be played.  There is one 'Extra Turn' card that can be played in addition to a normal card (hence the only chance to get rid of 2 cards in a turn).&#10;&#10;When the first person has finished, the others score penalty points equal to the sum of the numbers on the cards they have left in their hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hollywood Card Game is a fast and simple card game from Bruno Faidutti and Michael Schacht, designers of such games as Citadels, Coloretto and Fist of Dragonstones. This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.&#10;&#10;The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.&#10;&#10;Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins.

Players have escaped the modern-day zombie hoard only to find themselves transported back in time and faced with a whole new set of problems!&#10;&#10;Game play is fairly straightforward.  Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.&#10;&#10;Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.&#10;&#10;This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!!

You must be alert at all times, prepared to use the spiritual weapons acquired throughout the journey to defeat the enemy and receive your final reward.&quot;&#10;&#10;Similar to &quot;Life,&quot; you walk through stages of a spiritual (Christian) journey facing the obstacles as described in John Bunyan's book &quot;Pilgrim's Progress.&quot; The four pawns are &quot;pilgrims&quot; each having &quot;burdens&quot; that are removable. The object of the game is to remove the burden as fast as possible with game cards (i.e. Faith, Encouragement, Armor of God, etc...).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Medo is a minimalist 2-player strategy game inspired by the idea of flowers competing for space in a meadow.&#10;&#10;It was designed as part of the author's long time effort to create accessible games with emergent complexity.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;One player owns dark and light blue stones, and the other player owns dark and light red stones.&#10;&#10;The players take turns, placing stones on the initially-empty board, trying to capture groups of opponent stones. You capture opponent groups either when they&rsquo;re surrounded or they&rsquo;ve grown too large. The first player to capture a certain number of stones (depending on board size) wins.&#10;&#10;",

She started by tearing apart and jamming back together ACTUAL Claptrap units, but the sounds of their protests and complaints got a bit annoying. After consulting Princess Fluffybutt and Sir Reginald she opted for a card game instead.&#10;&#10;So grab some crumpets, drink some tea and join Tina in torturing (and building) Claptraps of 5 varieties. Along the way you&rsquo;ll enlist some help from Brick, Mordecai, Moxxi and Earl to mess with your opponents and find what you need to win.&#10;&#10;Featuring brand new original art and character designs never seen anywhere else; Borderlands: Tiny Tina&rsquo;s Robot Tea Party is the first wide release tabletop game ever set in the Borderlands universe.

Unfortunately, humanity was no match for its own creations and armies of terrifying monsters were soon out of control in their destruction of civilization. In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.&#10;&#10;This is the world at the start of Teratozoic, a light deck-building game. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their gene pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.&#10;&#10;The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.&#10;&#10;",

Proud to be the host for this august world body, Switzerland invites its champion axe-juggling troupe, &quot;Les Bella Lieben Jolie De Von Giorno&quot;, to entertain the assembled delegates. Unfortunately, halfway through the demonstration, the Troupe goes insane and begins hurling axes into the audience, splitting head after head. The Secretary General calls for calm, but before he can order a recess, his cranium is split as well.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Oh My God! There's An Axe In My Head.&quot; The Game of International Diplomacy, the remaining Great Powers use the confusion to pass the gavel between themselves, conduct international business amidst the chaos, and generally try to shift the balance of world power while escaping a bunch of armed psychopaths.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a simple Oh Hell! variant. There are four suits -- Archie, Edith, Gloria, and Mike -- of 10 cards each, plus two special cards. Players use their &quot;Ding Bat Tally&quot; wheel to predict how many tricks they will take that hand of 7 cards. If they're right, they score 10 points. You must follow suit if possible; if not, Archie cards are trumps. The two special &quot;Ding Bat&quot; cards, which are ranked 0 and 11 in the Archie suit, allow the trick's winner to give the trick to any other player, or keep it for himself, allowing for some opportunistic hose-age of one's opponents.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;A Message from Archie: &quot;In my neighborhood, we ain't much for playing Contact Bridge or cannestoga or any other leftist games, so we play my card game. Even Edith plays it, so ya know it's gotta be real simple to learn. Meathead plays it too, but he's got trouble counting so we gotta stop to coach 'im. I highly recompense this Ding Bat card game for all youse right-thinkin' Americans.&quot;&#10;&#10;The message comes with the following disclaimer: &quot;The above quotation from 'Archie' is printed the way he talks on the famous 'All in the Family' TV Show. It is not intended to be correct English.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
