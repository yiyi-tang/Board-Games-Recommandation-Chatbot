    "Description": "Hamertjesspel (Dutch for &quot;The Little Mallet Game&quot;) is a traditional pub-game that was popular in the Low Lands of Belgium and the Netherlands and can be traced back as far as 1750. It could be regarded as an early form of Pinball, but despite its erstwhile popularity, it was all but forgotten in the latter half of the 20th century. Recently replica boards are making a bit of a comeback, and &quot;het Hamertjesspel&quot; can be seen again at village f&ecirc;tes and other occasions that encourage nostalgic throw-back entertainment.&#10;&#10;Four players sit on each side of a square wooden board with raised edges, defending their goal. A marble or small lead ball is dropped in the centre, either by hand or, on the more evolved board versions, through a &quot;fair&quot; central dropping device. Players try to get the marble into an opponent's goal, and keep their own one safe, by using a small wooden mallet (&quot;Hamer&quot; is Dutch for &quot;Hammer&quot;). To make life difficult for the players, the goal is split up in two by a centre isle, and spanned by a rail, so that it is impossible to block both halves simultaneously, or swap the hammer between goal sides easily. The board itself has a few obstacles (usually exposed nails) that deflect the marble.  Game play is best typified as frantic fun.&#10;&#10;The boards tend to have a slight slope towards the centre point. The square versions commonly use 4 wood sections in a pyramid style. The &quot;Karrewiel&quot; (Cart Wheel), which is the round board version usually had more panes to create a nicer circular slope. Occasionally it would also be able to accommodate more than the standard 4 players, or have each player's goal area split in three gaps, rather than two. Most boards would have only one marble in play, but, reportedly, there are variants that had multiple balls simultaneously in the battle arena. If less people were playing, parts of the board could be blocked off using temporary wooden walls.&#10;&#10;Traditionally, the first player to lose a certain amount of goals would have to buy the next round. Like all pub games, it was also played for money, and onlookers placed bets on the game's outcome.&#10;&#10;In 1995 Battle Dome appeared, which is a modern flipper version of this traditional game, with a few added bells and whistles. In 2000 Felsburger produced the traditional Karrewiel version under the name Ch&uuml;ngel. Needless to say, most versions of the game keep coming from the Low Lands wood crafts cottage industry, that is slowly &quot;rediscovering&quot; this lost gem. And since the dimensions have never been standardised, quality and appearance are as diverse as the woodworkers making them.&#10;&#10;",

There is no board.&#10;&#10;There are 19 distinct tiles which make the 26 letters plus the blank tile. Eight of the tiles are ambiguous and can be read as two different letters, depending on orientation. For example, an upside-down A is a V, and a sideways N is a Z. Three of the tiles may be used as the same letter in more than one orientation (O, S, and X). A tile may be used as different letters in different words at the same time, even in the same play.&#10;&#10;Each letter has a different value and scores are calculated according to the letter played. Players receive bonuses for using a previously-played tile as a letter it wasn't used as previously, for changing the orientation of a word, or for using all seven tiles on their rack in a single play.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.puzzazz.com/wim&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The field is laid out on a 30 by 21 grid. Play alternates between the Offense and the Defense. The ball is advanced by passing dribbling and heading. When a defensive man is within specific distances from the ball and attempt can be made to tackle or intercept. The result is determined by throwing a die, but strategic placement of the men can affect the odds. Goal tries are similarly determined by die throws adjusted to the positioning of the goalkeeper and other defensive players.&#10;&#10;From Designer's Notes:&#10;KICK-OFF Soccer has been developed to follow as closely as possible the real game of soccer.  The strategy and tactics are the same, as are most of the rules.  Soccer is not a complicated game.  There are very few set plays, these mainly arise on Corners, Free-Kicks and Throw-Ins.  The game is played through with the skills, flair and innovation of individual players working together as a team.  And so with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, by using simple Basic Moves, the flair and innovation has been left up to the individual player.&#10;After playing one or two games of &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, the method of play becomes easy and only brief reference is necessary to player and ball movement, and die throws.  The die throws do not determine the outcome of the game, they merely simulate the chances played in real soccer.&#10;&quot;KICK-OFF&quot; has been play tested by enthusiastic &quot;youngsters&quot; aged from eleven to adult.  For the young enthusiasts, some adult assistance was found advisable at first, but once advised, they were at home with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot; as they were on the real field!&#10;&#10;",

In Phase 1, which lasts from 792 until around 834, each raid involves a few ships and lasts only a few days. In Phase 2, from around 834 to around 850&ndash;864, raids are larger. In Phase 3, from around 850&ndash;864 until 879, the goal is conquering land with armies and creating permanent settlements.&#10;&#10;In the standard game, each player represents an ever-changing group of Norwegian and Danish chieftains. Optional rules allow for the historical division of territory between Norwegian and Danish groups, allow for limited combat between the two players, and provide for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;One twelve-page rulebook&#10;Two 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; maps&#10;One Player Display&#10;342 counters&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster, and Ernie face off in this slightly atypical memory matching game.  Each player's goal is to have the longest chain of tiles at game end.&#10;&#10;There are two notable differences from most memory matching games.  &#10;1. Rather than two tiles being matched to each other, this game has players matching tiles to the symbol resulting from a spinner&#10;2. Instead of ending when all tiles are matched, the game ends when the fourth stop tile is drawn.&#10;&#10;Twenty-nine tiles are laid face-down on the play surface.  These tiles interlock like puzzle pieces, making a chain of tiles when credited to a player.  The game includes a spinner with, six spaces.  Three of the spinner spaces show one shape (triangle, circle, or square), while the other three spaces have two shapes.  Players take turns using the spinner, and then selecting one tile.&#10;&#10;If the tile says &quot;free spin&quot;, then the tile is added to that player's chain, and the player immediately takes an additional turn.&#10;&#10;If the tile matches the shape(s) on the spinner, then the tile is added to the player's chain of tiles, and that player's turn ends.&#10;&#10;If the tile does not match the shape on the spinner, the tile is shown to the other players, and then returned face-down to the available tiles.&#10;&#10;If the tile says &quot;stop&quot;, then it is attached to the top of the spinner.  When the fourth &quot;stop&quot; tile is drawn, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

The cubes have pictures numbered 1-5 on all of their sides except one, which holds a large red X on it.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to to acquire five X's in a row, like a bingo game.  However, this game is much more complex in its variant forms.&#10;&#10;Initially, the base setup is for each person to turn all of their picture cubes to the 1 numbered picture--the easiest items to spot.  Goal: Spot five items or a picture of each of the five items, revealing 5 X's which form a straight line.&#10;&#10;Rise To The Top:  In this variant, each person does not reveal the X upon sighting a 1 numbered item.  Instead, the person will turn the number two picture to the top.  This continues until the number three item is sighted, and the X is turned up.  The first person to five X's in a row wins.&#10;&#10;Go For Points:  Similar to Above.  Attach a time limit or mileage limit to the game.  At game end, total the numbers of the photos as points, scoring each X as a 10 point item.  Highest total wins.&#10;&#10;This can be played as a solo variant, with a solo player trying to accomplish point goals per number of miles, or trip duration.&#10;&#10;The Handicapper:  In a child versus adult game, using the base game rules, the adult would adjust their numbered pictures to a 4 or 5 starting point.&#10;&#10;One Block At A Time:  Start with all X's showing.  Each person will take out the first block in their container.  As soon as either player sees one of the five items, they replace the block in their container with the picture showing of the item spotted.  They then move on to their next block, until all 25 blocks are gone through.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one person is done with all 25 blocks.  Total all points of exposed pictures.&#10;&#10;Get Nasty:  Each player arranges the cubes of their opponent, using the number five pictures of each number (5-5's, 5'4's, etc...) and arranges them in a way which is thought to be most difficult to achieve 5 in a row.  Same as base game otherwise.&#10;&#10;Composite Game:  Start with all number 1's.  As you see each item, turn that cube over to X.  When you get five X's in a row, turn that row over to the number two pictures.  Continue with the same goals, turning five in a row over at a time until you get the five numbered pictures.  The first person to turn over five number five pictures, revealing the final X's, wins.  A complicated variant, indeed.&#10;&#10;",

If a partner is needed to accomplish the stunt then the player spins a spinner, the male who has that color representing him is the girls partner for the stunt. There is a time limit to accomplish each stunt. The stunts are childish (this game is appropriate for perhaps 8 to 12 year olds).  Some examples of stunts that need to be done;  You and your partner eat a potato chip at the same time and immediately whistle Yankee Doodle. First one to whistle the first line wins the points. Or Standing back to back with your partner, remove his or her jacket or sweater and put it on yourself without turning around. The successful completion of a stunt in the given time limit results in winning a certain amount of points. First player to reach 500 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spion (=Spy) is a 2-player strategy game with an unusual victory condition: you must find two hidden points on the opponents half of the gameboard. These hidden points are secretly marked on a paper copy of the gameboard; a whole pad of copies is included.&#10;&#10;The gameboard has 2 halves of 64 hex-fields each and the armies of the 2 players contain 6 defenders, 4 little spies and 2 big spies. The defenders are single colored, while the spies show both colors, because they can be turned over when captured! Defenders cannot leave their half of the board. Spies can move everywhere and they are therefore needed to find the 2 hidden points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board is 8x8 in size and every player has 4 playing pieces. Object of the game is to move 2 of the 4 pieces on the opposing side of the board.&#10;&#10;The name of the game comes from the moving mechanism of the playing pieces: they can move 1 field in all 4 directions, but they are flipped over every time when they move (I guess they &quot;flop&quot; when moving to the left or right side).&#10;&#10;All playing pieces are numbered from 1-4 on one side and from 5-8 on the other side. Since the pieces are always flipped over, the value of the pieces is changing with every move and it needs much thinking in advance to find the best moves.&#10;&#10;Another problem is, that the pieces should always look in the same direction. To assure this, each piece has 2 dots on the front and 2 on the back, but when comparing the pieces on the game-box with the ones included with this game, it is obvious, that this designing problem is not solved very well.&#10;&#10;",

You have investment money of 1.2 billion dollars to finance your coming mergers and acquisitions.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to buy other companies at a relatively low price compared to their value. If you control that company, your company's profits will increase as well.&#10;&#10;The basics of the game:&#10;&#10;There is one more business than there are the number of players, each with different company values. Players each have 14 chips with investment values printed on them (4 X 5, 3 X 10, 3 X 50, 1 X 100, 1 X 200, 1 X 300, 1 X 400). They (usually) secretly place these one at a time near a business they wish to invest in. The 2nd, 5th, and some later investments made in each company are made publicly (everyone sees the investment amount).&#10;&#10;Players gain control of a company by having more invested in the company at the end of the game than any of the other players (and get more points for having more than all the other players combined). The tricky part being that a player will almost always need to have control of 2 or more business to win, but there's not enough businesses to be able to do so easily, so each player *will* have to out-invest another player, which involves bluffing them as to where your high-value investment chips are.&#10;&#10;Each player also chooses an 'investment strategy' card at the beginning of the game, and plays it at some point during the game, changing things like making the value of a company halved, or giving them extra shares in a company, etc.&#10;&#10;",

The rectangular tiles could be stations and the tiles around them and joining them could be services and track. This was way back in 2006.&#10;&#10;Over the years the design has been revisited many times and the game developed.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player must lay a tile and may move their train. If the train is on connection between two stations it must move back to a station to re-coal. If the train is at a station, it may move onto a track connection to make a delivery. Deliveries are payed out based on the goods at the source and the type in demand at the destination (timber, sheep, ore). All stations have spaces for goods to be delivered too. When these are full, that station can receive no more goods. However, space can be made for more goods by delivering passengers.&#10;&#10;The tiles players lay represent track, which they are paid to lay (land grant railway style). Country tiles which provide goods for carriage. Plus passengers which consume the carried goods as described above.&#10;&#10;The game also has station tiles which are owned by the players. Players start with one station, but may lay extra as their existing stations are properly surrounded. Owning a station also earns players a small income as other player use the facilities there.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one of the tile stacks runs out.&#10;&#10;The latest version of the rules and tiles are May 2019. If you have been playing an earlier version, the designer suggests at least looking at the improvements and/or viewing the &quot;how to&quot; video section here on the geek.&#10;&#10;",

These settlers fought the Britons and one another in an attempt to establish permanent kingdoms. It was a time of economic breakdown, when the Roman coinage was replaced with a system of barter, and also a time of spiritual confusion, with the Christian church coming to dominance in an age of superstition and violence.&#10;&#10;In Saxon Shore, two to five players struggle to become the dominant kingdom of the British Isles.

If it&rsquo;s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace. As soon as a child has succeeded in completely threading his shoelace, he wins the game. If he can then also tie a knot, he&rsquo;s laughing. The others can practice via the illustrated instructions.&#10;&#10;Ages 4 and up. Artwork: Kerstin V&ouml;lker&#10;&#10;",

Naval Rules for Fleet Sized Combat for Miniatures&#10;&#10;So now that you have the ships how are you going to fight with them?  There are only just a few rule sets out there and all but one are mired in detail and lend themselves to small actions of four ships that is if you want to finish the battle in the same day.  Battle Stations is different in that its emphasis is on medium to large sized battles which can be completed in a day or even in hours.  The designer reckons for each ship involved in the game it adds ten minutes of playing time.&#10;&#10;Have it all in one package!  Inside you will find ship stats for all the naval powers which fought in World War II: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Soviet Union, and United States.  All of the major naval aircraft are here too like the US Hellcat, the Japanese Zero, the Re 2001 (for the Aquila), the British Swordfish, the D520 for the French carrier Bearn.&#10;&#10;The ship charts include a comprehensive listing of ship classes ranging from aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, escorts, commerce raiders (all the German raiders are here), merchant ships, MTBs, submarines and even the experimental battleships like the German H39 class, the improved Gneisenau class with 15&rdquo; guns, the Graf Zeppelin and Seydlitz German aircraft carriers and the not to be forgotten Italian aircraft carrier Aquila.&#10;&#10;But that is not all, you receive extensive listings of the number of ships in each class, when the class became available and when certain ships in the class were sunk.&#10;&#10;Damage and speed is kept track of on the game table eliminating extensive paperwork.  Two sided counters tracking speed and damage are provided.  Each turn represents a half hour of time so action is fast, furious, and realistic.  Rules are very comprehensive covering fleet morale, surface combat, mine warfare, torpedo launches, carrier combat, submarine warfare as well as surface combat and damage control (which varies by nation as well as by year). Charts are intuitive, easy to understand and speed play.&#10;&#10;Components: 82 page rulebook (17 pages of rules, 31 pages of ship stats, and 10 scenarios), two card stock combat charts, one card stock sheet of templates, 140 counters for marking damage, speed, and submarine depth.&#10;&#10;Ten Scenarios: River Plate 1939, Montevideo 1939, Punta Stilo 1940, Spartivento 1940, Sinking of the Hood 1941, Sinking of the Bismarck 1941, Java Sea 1942, Cape Esperance 1942, Guadalcanal 1942, Komandorski Islands 1943.&#10;&#10;",

The children in the boat on the cover art are not wearing any life vests and I seriously doubt if the little girl is really holding the jib sheet.
