Each is very different and all are playable by between 1 and 5 players, with ingenious rules to take care of the &quot;neutral&quot; powers; those that aren't being played by a real-life player.  Very suitable for solitaire play, as well as being interesting for multiple players, you'll even take in a bit of history to boot!  The game is played in Seasons, and each season brings its own challenges.  Unique features such as pleas for &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and &quot;Royal Marriages&quot; make the game that little bit different.&#10;&#10;This game is a reimplementation of King of Kings, replacing the hex-based map with area movement.&#10;&#10;",

It was the only major battle fought in Florida during the war.&#10;&#10;Union General Truman Seymour had landed troops at Jacksonville, aiming chiefly to disrupt Confederate food supply. Meeting little resistance, he proceeded towards the state capital of Tallahassee, against orders, assuming that he would face only the small Florida militia. Confederates in Charleston sent reinforcements under General Alfred H. Colquitt and the two armies collided near Olustee Station. The Union forces were repulsed and retreated to Jacksonville where they stayed for the remainder of the war.&#10;&#10;Following the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, Seymour led his 5,500 men in the direction of Lake City. At approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of February 20, the Union force approached General Finnegan's 5,000 Confederates entrenched near Olustee Station. Finnegan sent out an infantry brigade to meet Seymour's advance units and lure them into the Confederate entrenchments, but this plan went awry. The opposing forces met at Ocean Pond and the battle began. Seymour made the mistake of assuming he was once again facing Florida militia units he had previously routed with ease and committed his troops piecemeal into the battle. Finnegan and Seymour both reinforced their engaged units during the afternoon and the battle took place in open pine woods. The Union forces attacked but were savagely repulsed by withering barrages of rifle and cannon fire.&#10;&#10;The battle raged throughout the afternoon until, as Finnegan committed the last of his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finnegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. However, the Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the rear element of Seymour's forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of black soldiers. The Confederate cavalry commander received criticism for failing to pursue the retreating Union forces.&#10;&#10;Uses a slightly modified version of SPI's Blue &amp; Gray rules, called Battles of the American Civil War that started with Seven Days Battles.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #166, along with Savage Station.&#10;&#10;Note: Some replacement counters for this game, and the rules necessary to use them, were included in S&amp;T 170: Atlanta Campaign.

    "Description": "For Fame &amp; Fortune (F3) is an addictive card-drafting game of high stakes Fortune Hunting. The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.&#10;&#10;Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.&#10;&#10;The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.&#10;&#10;To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player. The game's challenging scoring system provides many ways to score bonus points to showcase playing skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;To win cautiously or attempt to shoot for the moon, your Fortune is in your hands!&#10;&#10;",

(Quanto has 110 cards, with one copy less of each card.) Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four cards are laid face up on the table. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Lay down one card, then collect all cards of the same number (including the one played) and two or more cards that sum to this number, placing all of these cards in a personal score pile.&#10;    Create a &quot;build&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Quanto&quot;) by laying down a card, taking one other card from the display, placing them to your side, then taking the matching number tile to mark this build; you can take two or more cards at the same time that sum to this value and place them in your build. In the future, you can play a card of this value to possibly add more cards to the build, then move all of these cards to your score pile.&#10;    Discard a card to the face up display. If you discard a 1, each opponent must give you a card from her score pile; if you discard a 2, you play a second card from your hand, once again taking any of the three actions; if you discard a 3, you reveal three cards from the deck, use one to perform an action, then discard the other two.&#10;&#10;&#10;After taking an action, you refill the face-up display to four cards and your hand to four cards. If you use a rainbow card for action 1, you can claim another face-up card of your choice; if you use one for action 3, then you add an additional card to the display.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out and all players have emptied their hands, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;Sloop includes partnership rules that allow partners to add to (but not claim) one another's builds and to swap cards with one another during play.&#10;&#10;",

Trade goods on the space lanes, work for crime lords, or engage in your own piracy&mdash;the big bucks are for those who can smuggle past orbital customs stations.&#10;&#10;Use your credits to upgrade your space freighter and find other special equipment. Freedom of movement and diversity of choice don't keep Smugglers of the Galaxy from being a simple and easy play.&#10;&#10;Some of the many options for players include: Space Trading, Smuggling, Piracy, Bounty Hunting, and Starship Upgrades.&#10;&#10;SPACE TRADING&#10;Every planet has different demands for Food, Robots, Weapons, Luxuries, and Medical Supplies. Buy low on one world and sell high on another. Expand your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity and upgrade your Lightspeed to make credits quick&mdash;but watch out for pirates on the space lanes.&#10;&#10;SMUGGLING&#10;Some goods are illegal on some worlds&mdash;but that means big bucks for those who can smuggle them past customs! Larger worlds generally have larger starports&mdash;which means better security but also better profits. Crime Bosses offer the biggest payoffs but you&rsquo;ll regret it if you fail them. Find friends and technology that will help you smuggle because you don&rsquo;t want to get caught with a shipload of illegal goods.&#10;&#10;PIRACY&#10;Become a space pirate yourself by arming your ship and blasting unsuspecting merchant ships (and other players) for their cargo. Be careful though&mdash;as your bounty stacks up, tougher bounty hunters will become interested in you.&#10;&#10;BOUNTY HUNTING&#10;So other players have bounties on their heads? Go after them and collect! But making powerful enemies in the galaxy may be your undoing. A good bounty hunter must know when and where to strike.&#10;&#10;UPGRADE YOUR SPACESHIP&#10;Whether peaceful merchant, shifty smuggler, or ruthless warrior&mdash;everyone could use a better ship. Upgrade your Lasers, Engines, Lightspeed, Shields, and Cargo Pods and keep your enemies off your back and increase your money-making potential. In addition to these standard upgrades, be on the lookout for unusual technology, such as cloaking devices, secret compartments, telepathic orbs, and more.&#10;&#10;FREE EXPANSION : Alpha Expansion&#10;&#10;Taken from the announcement : A free expansion called &quot;Alpha Expansion&quot; is available as a PDF download at dtstrain.com/smugglers.

    "Description": "From the publisher: &quot;The game is about a group of snakes wandering in the woods trying to eat the apples that fall down from the trees (and avoiding eating the poisonous mushrooms). The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to &quot;pilot&quot; them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).&quot;&#10;&#10;SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.&#10;&#10;Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.&#10;&#10;If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.&#10;&#10;But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.&#10;&#10;Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.&#10;&#10;The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well. The rules need a little proof-reading but were clear enough. Snake Lake might be better for 3 or 4 players than 6 though, it got very crowded very quickly, even on the large side of the board.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, 36 of the 45 Object cards are placed face-up on the table to form a 6 by 6 grid. Each card shows three different types of objects. Each player, on his turn, takes a card which he then places face up in front of himself; this continues until all of the cards have been claimed. At the end of the game, only the players who have sole majority in a family of objects (no ties are allowed) score any points.&#10;&#10;Broc &amp; Troc is a captivating strategy and observation game where good choices have to be made in order to win.&#10;&#10;In 2006, Broc &amp; Troc was re-released as Versailles.  The rules of the game remain the same, but the game now includes rules in four languages.&#10;&#10;",

It includes background on gods, limited magic (from gods or magic places), sample races, and pre-generated characters from the Argonauts (the game is clearly aimed at reproducing the feel of the movie Jason and the Argonauts).  It uses a skill-based system, with point-bought character creation.  There are three combat systems: Noble (i.e. dueling), Melee, and Naval.  They are fairly complex, although Melee is fairly fast.&#10;&#10;(Entry extracted in part from the RPG Encyclopedia, http://www.darkshire.org/~jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/)&#10;&#10;There was a second edition in 1983. This was identical to the first edition with the exception of these changes: the box was deeper and had different cover art, a blank character sheet was included, a Different Worlds article reprint (&quot;Thieves of Sparta,&quot; on integrating the game with Thieves' World) was included, and a pack of miniatures (a ship and three figures) was included.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, there are two &lsquo;tools&rsquo; available: they are plastic pieces that are placed over the balls on the board. The smaller of the two grabs 3 balls (in a triangle), while the larger one has seven openings &ndash; one in the middle and six around the edges. The middle opening must be placed over a ball of your own color. Once positioned, the tools can be rotated, moving all of the balls around. If a player manages to arrange it such that a green ball is surrounded by nothing but his own color, then he can take that green ball from the board. It&rsquo;s replaced with one of your own color, which means you have a slight advantage. The first player to get 2 green balls is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Competition with other temp agencies is fierce, though, so establishing a solid reputation as a reliable and dependable agency can bump your workers towards the front of the employment line.&#10;&#10;Worker Placement plays in about 45 minutes and is suitable for 2-5 players, ages 10+.

    "Description": "Start buying, repairing and selling real estate. Competition is tough but your ability to make quick decisions and your speed of execution are real assets. Finance your purchases by collecting rents and hope to be able to send everything for a walk, to finally leave you to rest under the sun for the rest of your days.&#10;&#10;House Flippers presents a lifetime of hard work condensed into minutes. Each hourglass represents a property generating periodic income, with players investing in new decrepit properties to renovate them, then sell them and generate a profit that they'll reinvest. The goal of everyone is, after having worked so much, access to a dream life under the coconut trees.&#10;&#10;In House Flippers, there are no game turns. All players act simultaneously and as quickly as they can, and the game includes four possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cash a rent,&#10;     Buy and renovate a new property,&#10;     Hire an expert in lucrative real estate, and&#10;     Grow your savings.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Ten animal chits are placed at random at the top of the game board. On a turn, a player has up to three sliding steps to recreate a particular animal; if he does, he claims any matching chits above the game board, then more chits are drawn so that ten are always available. These chits are worth one point each, and whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;For younger players, you can use only half the game board, which holds parts for five animals.

This simple game (Ages 8 and up) is part of the then successful James Bond franchise of Victory Games. It was an attempt to create a simple 2-player game which would also appeal to kids (in contrast to their more complex efforts like the faulted &quot;James Bond Assault Game&quot;). It is basically the race from the movie &quot;Live and let Die&quot; - James Bond uses a motorboat to escape the evil henchmen of Kananga. Simple Action-System with small stand-up-boats and an abstract and slightly boring (small) board. Not a total waste of time - it actually works as a fast 2-player game.&#10;&#10;",

As survivors are eliminated, they become part of the growing zombie problem. Those who avoid becoming zombified are the &quot;winners&quot;, but only if they survive the final draw!&#10;&#10;The game is played in four segments called &quot;reels&quot;. Each reel has a designated number of cards to be played through. As these are revealed in a central three-card hand, players have the option to take them on their turn to build their survivor or zombie hands. In addition to cards, the Shuffling Horror system uses two six-sided dice (2d6) to resolve conflict actions, such as when a zombie attacks a survivor. The game includes two sets of dice. The Zombie Master makes many dice rolls and reserves one set as his own, while the players should pass their set as each player completes her turn.&#10;&#10;Spoints &ndash; short for survivor points &ndash; are the final component of the Shuffling Horror system. These counters track the survivors' vitality and luck, and survivors use spoints to cheat the system.&#10;&#10;Pittsburgh 68 is a game that revels in zombie mayhem. As such, its outcome varies greatly. Our advice is to just let the zombies run amuck.&#10;&#10;Well...not quite run...&#10;&#10;Shuffle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Risikard is similar to Risk in that players are warring over global territories. However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.&#10;&#10;There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.&#10;&#10;Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.&#10;&#10;The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.&#10;&#10;In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.&#10;&#10;The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.&#10;&#10;",

After all, what self-respecting zombie doesn't dream of becoming a ghoul?&#10;&#10;Zombie Rally depicts zombies at their competitive best.&#10;&#10;Zombie Rally is a non-collectible card game of zombie foot racing to two to six players ages 10 and up.

In their turn, a player throws two dice. For each die they can move one of their mice towards the cheese. If they manage to outstrip other mice or land on the same space on the table, they catch these mice and the mice's points count for them at the end. They earn also points for every mouse that managed to get to the cheese. The game ends when one player has no more mice on the board. All caught mice and all owned mice at the goal count their points, all mice that were caught by other players count negative. The player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The console calls out the number, color or instruction (reverse, skip) and you have to react quickly.  Press the wrong button, the button you've already eliminated, or forget to hit the Uno button when only one light is left, and the console will dole out the punishments (while mocking you with a snide laugh). The goal is to eliminate your four colored &amp; numbered lights. A fast dexterity and memory game.&#10;&#10;",

They might take the treasure from you and win the game!&#10;&#10;A constantly changing game due to the spinning mechanism and the numerous cards, which provide unlimited diversity, challenge and joy!&#10;&#10;The game is a circular spinning maze. The maze is divided in a number of circular zones which end up at the center of the maze, the treasure chamber.&#10;&#10;Each player picks 6 pawns of the same color, 1 &quot;Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; card and 5 &quot;Events&quot; cards. Initially, 4 pawns of each player are placed at the first (outer) zone of the maze.&#10;&#10;Each turn is comprised of four steps:&#10;&#10;     The first player uses his cards&#10;     Then, he moves his pawns&#10;     The other players do the same moves one by one, according to the game order sequence which is defined by the &quot;Gods &amp; Heroes Cards&quot;&#10;     When all the players have done their moves, the walls of the maze are rotated one step and the layout out the maze changes radically.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The pawns can move peripherally, towards or away the center of the maze, but only one step (field) at a time, unless otherwise indicated by the cards.&#10;     The &quot;Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; cards give a specific ability to each player that can be used in each turn throughout the game. The &quot;Events&quot; cards describe certain actions, but when their effect is accomplished they are discarded from the game.&#10;     The &quot;Beast&quot; card is triggered when the treasure is picked by a pawn from the Treasure chamber. This card has an effect that may change the game scenario and lasts thereafter, until the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to claim the treasure with one of your pawns and escape from the maze with it.&#10;This is not as easy as it seems though! The mazes walls are impossible to pass and as they are rotating, your pawns may get trapped and be killed! The Beast which lurks about may overturn the game! Your opponents are also trying to block you, steal the treasure from you and escape the maze with it!&#10;&#10;Can you face the secret dangers of the maze and be the winner?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
