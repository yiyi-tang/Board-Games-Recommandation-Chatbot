If the bid is met, you score three points for tricks bid and taken, plus one point for tricks greater than the bid.  If the bid isn't met, it's minus one point for each trick missed.&#10;&#10;The game comes with clear rules that also give instructions for additional players.  A nice score pad in also included.&#10;&#10;",

What a great combination: the big league thrill of baseball and the Word of God. Cheer your friends and family on as the knock one out of the park. You&rsquo;ll have a great time and will also learn about the Bible.&#10;&#10;The pitcher has hundreds of questions about God&rsquo;s Word and the right answer can get the players on first, second, or third base. They can even get a home run! The colorful newly designed game board and pieces help keep track of who is on which base as well as the score and the number of outs. All that&rsquo;s missing are the hot dogs and peanuts! Bible Baseball is great for family fun, but it also is helpful in the classroom or Sunday School setting.&#10;&#10;",

It incorporates an entirely new concept which is sophisticated and considerably more attractive than conventional board games. (i.e., chess or backgammon).  The game is played on a 15 1/2&quot; x 15 1/2&quot; Maneuvering board where each player has twenty-four ships to protect and defend.  To start the game, these ships are positioned in the first three rows of the board (as shown).  For each turn, the player rolls two dice.  He then moves 2 ships, one for each die the number of spaces indicated by both dice.  The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's ships or to win by trapping your opponent's ship(s).  The first player to complete one of the game objectives is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

According to the rules, the pieces represent small corps or oversized divisions.  Some units also represent commanders that can command other units.  Fortresses are also represented by pieces.&#10;&#10;The sequence of play is fairly standard for a wargame - &#10;1) Negotiations &#10;2) Rebuilding Cadres&#10;3) Supply Determination&#10;4) Movement and Combat&#10;5) Reinforcements &#10;6) Adjustment of Revenue &#10;7) Move game turn marker&#10;&#10;When playing one of the campaigns (i.e., not the full Napoleonic Wars), skip Negotiations, Rebuilding, and Revenue.&#10;&#10;The Movement phase has a unique mechanic that requires units with lower (worse) leadership to move before those with better leadership, regardless of which country controls the unit.  Units which don't move when it is their turn may only move later if led by a commander with higher leadership.  A player may use his highest rated leader to preempt the movement of another player's lower rated leader.&#10;&#10;This game was sold as a stand alone game with a paper map.  The game could also be played by combining the pieces and mounted maps from the other three games in the series (Napoleon's Italian Campaigns, Napoleon's Russian Campaign, and Napoleon's Peninsula Campaign) and adding the extra rules and pieces from Expansion Module 2.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From publisher:&#10;PBI is a game of company level combat in WW2. PBI is an infantry game with armor present as support. Artillery and the like is off table.&#10;&#10;A set of WW2 company level rules. The game is played on a 4 foot by 4 foot grid, split into 6&quot; squares. A company would typically consist of 3 tanks and 25 bases of infantry.&#10;&#10;The scale is 1 to 1. This means that a base of three figures represents three men. A tank model represents a real tank. The tabletop scale is 10m to the inch.&#10;&#10;The Overall concept.&#10;&#10;PBI is intended to provide a two hour wargame. All of the dice used are simple D6. All of the mechanisms are intuitive. PBI uses a gridded board. This means that all movement, range and areas are described in terms of squares. Because the player takes the role of the company commander, the squares of the grid allow him to get soldiers to &quot;go over there and do that&quot;, rather than measuring distances and engaging in single figure management. By using a grid it is very clear what scenery type the figures are in. There are three types of square. Closed (buildings and woods), Partial (hedges, walls and fences) and open (no significant cover).&#10;&#10;The rules generate a scenario which both players have a fair chance of winning. The game is always of the attack/defense style.&#10;&#10;PBI uses a lot of D6 (a typical section shooting would roll 10 dice). This helps give a feel for the massive amount of ammunition expended and allows the probabilities to even out (the more dice you roll, the more predictable the result).&#10;&#10;The aim of PBI is to create company level engagements which players can win by use of better tactics. The game is focussed on the player being a company commander so those are the tasks given to the player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An exciting game of Travel &amp; Trivia using a factual world map as your playing board.  Players start with airline itineraries &amp; travelers checks and need to be the first player to visit all the cities on their itinerary, collecting the appropriate visa, and return to their country of origin all the while managing their money, navigating detours &amp; diversions.  The first player to collect 10 visas and return to their country of origin is declared the winner.  PLAY:  Players must announce their intended destination before the role of the die which will determine the amount of the fare.   The die role will determine the destination and the cost by displaying full/half or free fares.  If a player rolls divert, transit, geography or general knowledge then they must take the appropriate card from the board and their travel is suspended or diverted depending on the instructions of the card.  Many times players may answer trivia questions about their particular region to allow their flight to continue to their previously stated destination, however, a wrong answer usually keeps the player grounded or relocates them to an undesirable location.   Money is collected by opting not to fly and answering trivia questions or a combination of both.  The Australian game designer recommends this game for ages 12+.&#10;&#10;",

Pawns which reach the opponent's back rank must promote to a previously captured piece.  Foxes which reach the opponent's back rank may optionally promote to a Guard.&#10;&#10;According to Eric Greenwood, the game's author (in an article on ChessVariants.org), the correct spelling of the game should be &quot;Renniassance&quot; (the first &quot;n&quot; doubled and the &quot;ai&quot; reversed).&#10;&#10;",

After finishing the inner College round, the route goes further around the outer board. The first player to reach the circle numbered 66 is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;On several places on the board there are things happening which can influence the course of the game. Some duals have to be solved with the aid of &quot;Special&quot;-cards, or questions have to be answered from the stack with &quot;Fairy, Witch or Specialist&quot;-cards.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Magical&quot;-cards  represent  the ingredients needed for the spells.&#10;&#10;",

Certain spaces on the board have a color &amp; symbol that might affect scoring or word placement.&#10;&#10;Some of the games are simple and suitable for young spellers, while other games are more complex.  The winning condition for most games is either (1) to score more points than opponents or (2) to use more letter tiles than opponents.  Players face their own letters in the upright position based on their seat at the table, and, in most games, your letters cannot contact opponents' words.  When scoring is based on points, the letter value is based on its color -- one point for blue, two for green and three for pink.&#10;&#10;",

Challenge the five pirates - Pollus, Hot Tin Pan, Oomalat, Dummerkopfen and cook O'Malley - into a dice duel on the gangplank. You'll also need gold coins from the island to bribe them. If you win the pirate you'll get to push him into the sea - but if you lose, it's YOU who'll end up in the drink, and need to swim back to the island for some more coins from Pippi's famous suitcase! Once you get to the ship itself, you need to face ALL the remaining pirates one after the other - unless you're lucky and they're all swimming already, in which case you win an instant victory and get to hoist the flag in Hoppetossa's mast!&#10;&#10;",

Pieces may move individually or in battalions. A battalion is the group of each piece type, e.g. 4 bishops are a battalion. Battalion movement is all pieces making the same move (e.g., three diagonally northwest). It's like station keeping in naval fleet movement. Or battalions can move in a chain, each advancing forward to take the place of the other, like marching forward. All pieces have to spaced apart equally for chain movement.&#10;&#10;It was a commercially available game. The map provided was a roll up chess board. The pieces were of good quality plastic in the traditional Staunton chess piece style.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This very early game from McLoughlin Brothers of New York was produced just as automobiles came on to the scene as viable transportation. The map showed the U.S., southern Canada, and northern Mexico with major cities such as New York, New Orleans, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Quebec depicted.&#10;&#10;In this game, players race across the country. The cars are moved by spinning a cardboard rondel.&#10;&#10;The game was a simple spin and move game which featured spots on the board where one might lose a turn because of breakdowns or repairs.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to win ribbons and trophies which at the end of the game are converted to points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a set number of cattle are auctioned off to the players. During the game, players may purchase more cattle from the sales barn, sell animals back to the sales barn, or trade or purchase from each other.&#10;&#10;There are also random event cards drawn during the game that operate much like &quot;Chance&quot; or &quot;Community Chest&quot; cards in Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Players move around a board depicting a fairgrounds, at the center of which is the show ring. Any time a player moves his token into the show ring, a competition begins. At this point players must pay an entry fee for each animal they wish to enter in each show class. First, second, and third-place winners are determined by combining die rolls with stats on that animal's card.&#10;&#10;The first three rounds of show competition are considered to be State competitions, and the fourth a National competition. After the fourth round, all award ribbons are converted to points, and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;",

At the point of the game, the Cybrids had established a final base around Pluto from which they began a new invasion after the humans started fighting amongst themselves.&#10;&#10;There are not many 'scenarios', but the production values are pretty decent - and the game box includes a bucket of miniatures.&#10;&#10;The gameplay features unit activation as a combination of laying chits by units and rolling a die, and the combat has some very elegant twists that make it resolve FAST - only 2 dice (one determined by range, the other determined by skill of the firing unit) for are needed to resolve all damage from an attack.  As a result, the game is not very &quot;nitty gritty&quot;, like Battletech, but takes a higher-level view of action.  Scenarios played with a dozen units would be over in half an hour, easily, and scenarios with many dozens of units would be playable in an afternoon.&#10;&#10;Boxed set includes:&#10;&#10;     96-page rulebook &#10;     29 vehicle data cards&#10;     Master Equipment/Master Weapons Reference Card&#10;     Meeting Engagement Scenario Setup Card&#10;     FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Sheet&#10;     80 full-color die-cut counters&#10;     5 full-color die-cut templates&#10;     5 dice (4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-sided) &#10;     18 unpainted miniatures&#10;&#10;&#10;Imperial&#10;- 4 Talon Scout Hercs &#10;- 4 Obsidian Hover Tanks &#10;- 1 Minotaur Herc &#10;Cybrid &#10;- 4 Seeker Scout Hercs &#10;- 4 Manta Hover Tanks &#10;- 1 Shepherd Herc &#10;- 4 hills (thermal plastic, flocked, from 2&quot; to 7&quot; across)&#10;&#10;",

Once the ball is in play and the location has been determined, the defensive player moves the fielders to the ball before arrows push the ball past.  The offensive player moves the batter until the play is resolved.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Ee J. Frankel, Play It Again: Asian Games and Pastimes&#10;&#10;&quot;The incense game or incense ceremony (k&ocirc;d&ocirc;) probably had its origin in the Heian Period when such aesthetic skills as the identification of fragrances became part of the training of aristocrats.  Gradually, literary themes became associated with certain fragrances.  Sometime in the following Muromachi period (1185-13??), the game evolved into a complicated pastime that required a larger variety of scents than previously used, and accommodated up to ten guests as participants.&#10;  By the early Edo period, the game reached new heights of popularity, probably due to the formalization of the tea ceremony, that also included the burning of incense.  During the eighteenth century, possibly because of a shortage of imported scented woods (k&ocirc;boku), the incense ceremony survived only among the very rich and wealthy merchants who also introduced a modified version of the game and its accoutrement's.  What follows is a description of the typical components of the Incense Game of the very early part of the Edo period (1615-1867).&#10;  The game is customarily played with four fragrances (in the form of pieces of scented wood), three of which are supplied by the host and one by a guest.  The three house scents are each divided into four portions that are placed in individual packets, making a total of twelve packets of house fragrances.  The guest fragrance is put into one packet, making a grand total of thirteen.&#10;  In the preliminary round, the three house fragrances are introduced and identified for the players (the guest fragrance remaining a mystery).  Then the game begins and is played out in ten rounds, during which each of the players attempts to distinguish the four possible scents they are currently being given to identify.&#10;  In the simplest form of the game, the preliminary round begins with the guests or players (usually highly literate people, sensitive to poetry) seated close enough together for the burning incense to be passed among them easily.  The host, who has prepared small pieces of burning charcoal in a larger burner, or k&ocirc;ro, lifts a piece of the red-hot charcoal with the proper tool, and buries it within the lacquered, ash-filled kikik&ocirc;ro (a special metal-lined container for this purpose), leaving over it only a thin covering layer of ash.  The ash is then smoothed and rounded into a cone with a spatula-like tool.&#10;  When the guests appear comfortable, the host opens one packet of the three house fragrances, gives it an identifying name such as &quot;Fragrance One&quot; and then places the perfumed wood on a mica square that is in turn placed on the heated ash.  The burner is then passed around for the guests to acquaint themselves with the fragrance.  Fragrance Two and Fragrance Three are then introduced and identified in the same manner.  After all three pieces of scented wood have been gently sniffed, each is placed on one of a set of plum-blossom-shaped rests provided for this purpose.  Then the game proper begins.&#10;  At this point ten packets of fragrance remain -- nine of house fragrances and one unknown -- and the players will now have to identify them without being told which is which.&#10;  Each player will have been provided with a set of counters or ballots, all of which have that player's identifying token (some tree or flower) on one side, and a possible choice (Fragrance One, Fragrance Two, Fragrance Three, or Unknown Fragrance) on the other.  As each new packet is opened and its contents placed in the burner and then passed around, each player chooses a counter that matches his or her guess about its identity and drops it into a receptacle provided for that purpose.  The burner is passed around again, the fragrances inhaled, and their identities guessed ten times.  Sometimes these actions may be accompanied by the scent or alluding to the floral picture on the player's ballot.  As the closed room quickly fills with lingering odors from previous rounds, the game becomes increasingly more difficult.&#10;  After each round the ballots are examined, and the players' guesses are written by brush on a record board. (Sometimes the ballots are put in an envelope until the game is completed and the guesses registered on the board at that time.) The winner is often awarded the record board.  Depending on the time available and the number of guests, a recess may be called and food served in another area.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Cargo can be gained or lost by moving to ports, fighting other ships, and bribing, extorting, or trading with other pirates.&#10;&#10;Dice rolls determine which port you can stock up at next, how much cargo you load, how far you move, and whether your cannonballs hit the ship you aim at. You may also attempt to take &quot;The Treasure&quot; which may be used as a bribe that can't be refused, to buy an extra die for movement, or to buy an extra cargo die with the ability to overload your ship. Possession, not expenditure, of the treasure allows docking at any port.&#10;&#10;A ship hit with more cannonballs than it has crates sinks to Davy Jones' Locker, and the losing captain is out of the game. The victorious captain may expend his own crates to keep the ship from sinking and control an additional ship himself, or allow the previous captain to stay on in a subservient role and continue to play the ship if &quot;he/she swears an oath o' allegiance&quot;. This can be used in many cases to keep all players involved in the game to the end.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;AVAST YE!&#10; Welcome te Sea Rats!&trade;, the most excitin' pirate board game this side o' the Ivory Coast. Where old salts and landlubbers alike sail ships on the high seas, battle with their enemies, stock up at ports o' call, an', best of all, steal The Treasure&mdash;Arrrghhh!&#10;&#10;Send yer buddies down te Davy Jones' Locker.

    "Description": "Not Tonight Josephine is a historical trivia game. The game includes glass bead gaming pieces, a colorful board and question cards, many of which are also in color. There are two boxes for the cards, and cardboard coins, as well as dice.&#10;&#10;There are 30 different question categories on the board, which uses a circular track with a hub layout. The question categories some are more traditional like &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Royalty&quot; and &quot;American Civil War&quot;, others are of a quirky nature such as &quot;Famous Exits&quot;, &quot;Cockney English&quot; and &quot;Submarines&quot;. Players draw a card which will have a choice between two categories from which to answer, all questions are multiple choice with three possible answers. If the player gets a question right they can roll again, if the question is the same category as the space the player is on they also receive a coin. The four special Double Trouble space on the board give the player a coin if they can answer both questions on the card. The player with five coins who then returns to the center of the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

A game conducive to language development and communication and also good for shape comprehension and for training fine motor skills.&quot;&#10;&#10;Essentially a two-player game, this can be played with more players by forming two-teams.&#10;&#10;The two players (or teams) sit opposite each other and each player is given an identical kit with 26 wooden elements (cubes, prisms, bridges, etc).  The lid of the game box is setup as a vertical screen between the two players so that their wooden pieces and building projects in front of them is not visible to the other.&#10;&#10;One player is chosen to be the master builder and the other is the apprentice. The master builder begins building a structure with his/her pieces (not visible to the other because of the screen) and verbally describes it as precisely as possible, as the building progresses. The 'apprentice' tries to follow the description givenby the master builder and attempts to build a replica of the structure with the pieces on his/her side of the screen.&#10;&#10;Its exciting to compare the buildings when the screen is finally removed.&#10;&#10;A further version (for players with practice) is &quot;sign language&quot;, whereby the players may only use their hands to communicate.&#10;&#10;",
