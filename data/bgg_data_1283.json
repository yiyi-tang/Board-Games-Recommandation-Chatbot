You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters.

You bet!&#10;&#10;2 to 6 players spin a paper spinner to move about the board and may claim a monster if they land on it. If you land on an already claimed monster, you must battle the owner for control by betting one of your own monsters against theirs- the highest spin wins them both! As a side option, players may also offer to trade monsters to other players during their turn.&#10;&#10;This is one of five somewhat tongue-in-cheek games from Warren magazines (publishers of Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella and others) featuring rad 70s monster artwork.&#10;&#10;Monster Match was released in Creepy Magazine #56 (September 1973), Eerie Magazine #51 (September 1973), and the &quot;Famous Monsters Game Book #1&quot; magazine from June of 1982 as &quot;cut out and play editions&quot;, as well as available separately in a bundle as &quot;Warren Monster Madness&quot; games by mail order (#2661 for $2.50).

Players, representing major European powers, compete against each other to shape the future of the Continent. The innovative and elegant game system allows a historical recreation of the conflicts, but better yet, can also create plausible alternative histories. The Alliances may take different forms, the campaigns may be fought along different lines of approach, but what the players witness is still a believable version of history.&#10;&#10;Coalitions brings the whole continent of the Napoleonic Wars into a fast, playable system.  Multiplayers&mdash;with NO downtime. Each turn, EVERY player is doing something&hellip; but doing something &lsquo;different.&rsquo;  This sets up an unexpected cycle like nothing you&rsquo;ve ever played before.  Cool wooden pieces, or a &ldquo;Deluxe&rdquo; version with some of the most beautiful miniatures you&rsquo;ve ever seen. Kickstarter backers get exclusive sculpts, an extra player expansion, plus an extra game covering a slightly different period!&#10;&#10;Throughout the period, Britain formed coalitions with almost any nation that would stand against France. Whenever a coalition was defeated, Britain sought to form a new one with states that would carry on the fight. Nations also had other motives to fight wars, often seeking to expand their own borders at the cost of their neighbors. Britain itself fought the French in Portugal and Spain and, with almost total control of the sea, sent military expeditions wherever there was a chance of harassing the French. Can the Emperor of Austria protect the German Reich and Northern Italy from the Revolutionary Armies? Will the Prussian King and Russian Tsarina join as allies or not? Will the Ottoman Empire be able to protect Egypt, the Balkans and Caucasus from the aggressive neighbors?&#10;&#10;When you play Coalitions, you decide the destiny of Europe; your decisions will make history. Will you guide France to greatness? Will you galvanize and unite Europe to bring an end to the infant republic and restore the Ancien R&eacute;gime? Or maybe there is a Metternich in you, able to deceive others and bluff your way to victory with a cunning smile?&#10;&#10;Each player controls one of six asymmetric factions: France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia or Turkey. They then try to form an alliance, insisting that it will be beneficial to all, although only one player can actually win. Throughout the game, players try to capture and consolidate key positions, which will earn victory points during the relevant phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Chronomasters are 12 time-traveling apes who return from the future to save the Earth from disaster. This faction, similar to the Sentinels is a game changer faction that will definitely turn the usual game concepts upside down. Using time travel markers, they can protect their territories in a very special way and use their time paradox attack to teleport entire armies back to their home territory - as if they had never left. Be surprised how the Chronomasters bring exciting new ideas to the game, while adding and changing the game in the usual Tsukuyumi manner.&#10;&#10;As always, this faction is compatible with all previously released expansions and also includes cards for 2-player mode, 5 faction event cards and the ever-popular mascot.&#10;&#10;Two years before the Moonfall, a spaceship with an experimental propulsion system was tested. Just six years later, this ship returned to Earth, with highly evolved apes aboard - the great-grandchildren of the six apes who had been trained to test the drive.&#10;Three generations later, the ship that created the black hole - the source of the drive - again traveled through space and time and returned to Earth. The ship was now populated by 40 apes who had converted the ship into a large space ark. They will come back to Earth to save it from what lurks in the future. There is only a small window of time for this, as there is already a wreck of their ark on Earth under tons of sand.&#10;&#10;The Chronomasters are here to protect the Earth from the future, equipped with high technology and the knowledge of things to come.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Die Chronomaster sind 12 zeitreisende Affen, die aus der Zukunft zur&uuml;ckkehren, um die Erde vor der Katastrophe zu retten. Diese Fraktion, ist &auml;hnlich den Sentinels, eine Game Changer Fraktion, die durchaus die gewohnten Spielkonzepte auf den Kopf stellen wird. &Uuml;ber Zeitreisemarker k&ouml;nnen sie ihre Gebiete ganz besonders sch&uuml;tzen und mit ihrem Zeitparadox-Angriff ganze Armeen in ihr Heimatgebiet zur&uuml;ckteleportieren - als w&auml;ren sie nie losgelaufen. Lasst euch &uuml;berraschen, wie die Chronomaster spannende neue Ideen in das Spiel bringen und dabei in gewohnter Tsukuyumi-Manier das Spiel erg&auml;nzen und ver&auml;ndern.&#10;&#10;Diese Fraktion ist wie immer mit allen bisher erschienen Expansions kombinierbar und enth&auml;lt auch Karten f&uuml;r den 2-Spielermodus, 5 Fraktionsereigniskarten und das allseits beliebte Maskottchen.&#10;&#10;Zwei Jahre vor dem Mondfall wurde ein Raumschiff mit einem experimentellen Antrieb getestet. Nur sechs Jahre sp&auml;ter kehrte dieses Schiff zur Erde zur&uuml;ck, an Bord hochentwickelte Affen - die Urenkel der sechs Affen, welche darauf trainiert worden waren, den Antrieb zu testen.&#10;Drei Generationen sp&auml;ter reiste das Schiff, welches das Schwarze Loch - die Quelle des Antriebs - erschaffen hatte erneut durch Raum und Zeit und kehrte zur Erde zur&uuml;ck. Das Schiff wurde nun von 40 Affen bev&ouml;lkert, welche das Schiff in eine gro&szlig;e Raumarche umgebaut hatten. Sie werden zur&uuml;ck auf die Erde kommen, um sie vor dem zu retten, was in der Zukunft lauert. Hierf&uuml;r gibt es nur ein kleines Zeitfenster, da es auf der Erde unter Tonnen von Sand bereits ein Wrack ihrer Arche gibt.&#10;&#10;Die Chronomaster sind hier um die Erde vor der Zukunft zu sch&uuml;tzen, ausgestattet mit Hochtechnologie und dem Wissen &uuml;ber die Dinge, welche noch kommen werden.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (German)&#10;&#10;",

Spread the remaining cards face-down. Each player receives either the Red &amp; Gold, or Blue &amp; Silver set of diver tokens. Gold &amp; Silver are experts, and let you adjust your dice roll by +/-1 on the turn they are added to a card.&#10;&#10;ON YOUR TURN - The lowest dice roll goes first. Place 2 amateurs or 1 expert token on any face-down card (or face-up card that you control) per turn. Roll both dice. If either dice matches the back of the card, flip it and place your token on a free square. If the roll total matches any face-up cards with your diver on them, take the action shown and end your turn.&#10;&#10;DISCOVERIES - Each player may have a diver on a card back, however only the player who discovers it may add their tokens once the card flips. The losing player&rsquo;s token is returned to them. If you place divers on all available spaces on a card, on your next turn you may take the card as a Discovery Point, and retrieve your divers.&#10;&#10;INJURIES &amp; ACCIDENTS - Dangerous creatures can injure your divers and send them to the RV. Once &lsquo;healed&rsquo; after 3 turns for injuries, or 1 for accidents, they can be placed again.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN - Collect 8 Discovery Points to win.

The most avid reader assembles the tower and then goes first. Play passes to the left. On your turn, carefully remove one block from anywhere below the highest completed story of the tower. Use only one hand. Then stack the block on top of the tower at right angles to the blocks just below it. As the block is removed, read the question on it out loud. Answer the question and let the conversation flow as you stack the block on top of the tower. You can touch blocks to find a loose one, but if you move a block out of place, you must put it back in place using one hand only before touching another block. While stacking, always complete a 3-block story before starting a higher one. Your turn ends 10 seconds after you stack your block or as soon as the next player touches one.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At just 103,027,000,000,000kms from Earth and orbiting a tiny little star in the constellation Virgo is a planet we call Ross 128b. The rest of the galaxy however know it as Sorr, named after the Sorras who today became the first Alien civilisation to make direct contact with Earth. In an ominous and undoubtedly mocking tone, their message, 'The Sorras are approaching. Your planet we are poaching.' immediately caused people to wonder if the rhyme was intentional, or just a lucky coincidence. Seconds later it plunged the world into chaos.&#10; When will they arrive? What do they want? Will they ever leave? No one knows. One thing's for certain though, they're not just coming for a cup of space tea.&#10;&#10;Alien Frenzy is a wildly chaotic and suspenseful card game that plunges players head first into an Alien Invasion. The game unfolds in two thrilling phases with game play designed for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;The game begins in the Preparation phase, before the Aliens have invaded. Here, players take turns playing and drawing cards to improve their hand and mess with opponents. However, the tension builds as players desperately try to avoid drawing a dreaded UFO card, as this triggers the Invasion, and places that unlucky player at the forefront of the action.&#10;&#10;During the Invasion phase, players take turns playing cards, and revealing Invasion cards. Here players come face to face with the Aliens and must fend off their attacks with Character cards. Once a player has no Character cards left, they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Who will be the last player standing amidst the frenzy of the Alien Invasion? Only the most strategic and resilient will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Win in one turn at any time. You&rsquo;re never out of it. Features a novel scoring system.&#10;&#10;Air Master is a unique Push Your Luck game, where you fly your way to victory by navigating favourable winds.&#10;&#10;But catch the bad ones, and make no progress, or even be blown backwards!&#10;&#10;Note the ones that work and find the easy routes to lift the SAVVY crown.&#10;&#10;Occasionally during the game, strong headwinds occur, and any gains are lost.&#10;&#10;In the final rounds, tropical storms can wreak havoc, and force you further back from where you started.&#10;&#10;You have options though, of sitting out potential storms by backtracking, and waiting for it to pass. Or to backtrack at certain stages, and check out alternative flight paths.&#10;&#10;You can see the wind strengths you face at each moment of your turn, represented by numbered playing cards.&#10;&#10;Taken into consideration with the accompanying wind chart, which shows which cards have already been played, you can see before you call, the success of any choice you make.&#10;&#10;The combination of chart and numbered cards make it a very exceptional, and accurate weather forecasting mechanic. Outcomes are based on known probability before you make a call and not random luck.&#10;&#10;After each successful forecast, you can call again, and your plane can keep moving forward. However, you must judge when it&rsquo;s time to bring that part of the journey to an end, as a subsequent wrong weather call will blow you off-course, and lose the progress you have just made.&#10;&#10;Misjudging the weather for first calls on turns in the closing stages, equivalent to heavy storms will force your plane back, up to five rows from original starting positions.&#10;&#10;There are also random squall areas where you must backtrack a row if wanting to shelter.&#10;&#10;Being in the lead is not a given for success. Your progress is never certain, planes can go forwards, and backwards too. Any player can go on a run at anytime and win the game in one turn.&#10;&#10;Due to the high average call success rate, (over 75%), it&rsquo;s very easy to rack up quick points, but you have to put your main focus on when to stop and bank those gains.&#10;&#10;Air Master is a non-confrontational game, apart from tactically leaving difficult weather cards for the next player to deal with. However, you are still competing against each other to hit the winning line first. Risks have to be taken, but when?&#10;&#10;This is a simple game with odds judgement that will tax even the brightest minds, and levels of addiction that compel you to get involved with other player decisions.&#10;&#10;You may find yourself encouraging players to go for it, when really you want them to blow out and drop points. Oh there&rsquo;s humour alright.&#10;&#10;But when the same players then go on long winning runs, you actually want them to succeed. There&rsquo;s a natural impulse to take interest in other players turns.&#10;&#10;Then there&rsquo;s your playing style. Are you an odds calculator who plays the  percentages?&#10;&#10;(If you&rsquo;re into maths and probability, this is right up your street, and you will find good methods of play).&#10;&#10;Or are you an instinct player who gets the feel of the cards and plays accordingly?&#10;&#10;(Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see a lopsided number chart, and know a change is coming).&#10;&#10;Or never mind all that, you feel lucky and call whatever comes into your head; it's your day right?&#10;&#10;( Only when all the luck is with you!)&#10;&#10;Or should you play a mix of all three?&#10;&#10;Air Master is a game where you sometimes have to step outside your comfort zone, no matter what your base impulses are. &#10;Have you got the nerve to go against your natural instincts if it may win you the game?&#10;&#10;So  back to the game, do you play, or pass and give the next player something to think about? No thanks there!&#10;&#10;Get it wrong and there are penalties. Get it right and you&rsquo;re on a roll.&#10;&#10;Correct calls win points. Fifteen will win it. You can be nearly there, and then start dropping back.&#10;&#10;Can you handle the sympathy?&#10;&#10;Then there is the fantastic help from your fellow players.&#10;&#10;If you want to follow it, dream on &ndash; you&rsquo;re in the wrong game.&#10;&#10;Banter has no boundaries here, and some of the advice on offer would make your progress very backward indeed.&#10;&#10;Sometimes you will remember a game for the laughs you had, the winner is irrelevant,  well nearly. That&rsquo;s how game sessions go.&#10;&#10;Lots of humour and constant dilemmas. &lsquo;&rsquo;Air Master&rsquo;&rsquo;is a one-off rollercoaster.&#10;&#10;For 1-6 players, aged 8 and upwards, and a playing time of 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;The solo mode is limited by the number of plays through the deck. Ten minute playing time.&#10;&#10;All age groups can understand the easy game mechanics, and many game plans can be devised, from simple hunch and feel, to varying degrees of mathematical strategies.&#10;&#10;Experienced pilots judge the moments well, win more and earn the SAVVY crown.&#10;&#10;Components: Game board, number chart, Duo board, 36 playing cards, 6 planes, 6 position markers, 1 squall disc, 1 crown, 35 markers.&#10;1-6 players, 8+, 30-60 mins.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Setup: Look through the cards and note the first number from 10 to 14. Place the blue squall disc on this same number on the game board.&#10;&#10;Place a plane and position marker on the zero row for each player.&#10;&#10;Place the SAVVY crown on the Win row.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and put one card aside face down. Lay the deck face down and turn over the top card and place beside it. Cover this number on the chart using the green marker.&#10;&#10;(When the deck is depleted during the game, shuffle all the cards, including the card put aside, except the last turned up card, which becomes the new starting point).&#10;&#10;How to Play: Choose a player to make first call as to whether the next card is higher or lower. There is a smoother game flow experience if one player manages the cards.&#10;&#10;Choose a player to manage the number chart.&#10;&#10;After each successful call, move the marker one row forward. If you then make an incorrect call, the marker  is returned to the plane, and no progress has been made.&#10;&#10;After successful consecutive calls, you may choose to stop, and move the plane forward to join the marker.&#10;&#10;After unsuccessful calls, the turn is ended, and play moves clockwise.&#10;&#10;Rows 0-3:&#10;&#10;You may call again after an incorrect first call, one Free Go per turn.&#10;&#10;You may pass your turn on rows 1-3 without penalty.&#10;&#10;Rows 4-9:&#10;  &#10;At the start of your turn, before calling, you may choose to change the top card. However, move your plane and marker back a row.&#10;&#10;You mass your turn without penalty.&#10;&#10;(If you change the top card and then pass, you will have moved back one row).&#10;&#10;&#10;Rows 10-14:&#10;&#10;If you make an incorrect first call, move your plane and marker back to row 9.&#10;&#10;You may choose to change the top card but move your plane and marker back a row.&#10;&#10;You may pass on your turn but move your plane and marker back a row.&#10;&#10;(If you change the top card and then pass, you will have moved back two rows).&#10;&#10;If you change the top card and then make an incorrect first call, you move back to row 9.&#10;&#10;Blue disc: This represent a squall. If you elect to stop when on one of these rows, you move back a row.&#10;&#10;If you want to pass or change the top card, and that action puts your plane back to a blue row, you move back another row.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the Win area claims the SAVVY crown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Plunder Busters is a board game for 3-4 players, where each player takes the role of a budding archaeologist trying to achieve glory in their field. They will do this by exploring new excavation sites, digging up artefacts and researching new relics.&#10;&#10;In Phase 1 (Build your Dig Site!), players will place tiles on their Dig Site board in secret before embarking on Phase 2 (Plunder!); where players will explore each others&rsquo; Dig Sites, attempting to claim Relics and Artefacts whilst avoiding the Traps set by the other players.&#10;&#10;Players will earn Reputation by uncovering tiles which contain Artefacts (worth 1, 2 or 3 points), or prized Relics (worth 4+ points); the locations of which are indicated by 'clue' cards that players will compete to collect. However, following false leads and uncovering a Trap tile will cause a player to lose Reputation (-5 points) at the hands of devious opponents. The adventurer with the highest Reputation when the available clue cards have been exhausted will win the game!&#10;&#10;The game begins as a tile-laying/&rsquo;build your own board&rsquo; adventure, before shifting to an exploration of your opponents&rsquo; dig sites: through the cunning use of action cards and a quest to find hidden Relics, only the most successful adventurer will prevail!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Roleplaying as the mangers of a civilization, players make progress across an advancement track split into four eras of time, with each era requiring a player to construct four unique buildings which either produce resources, create an engine to produce new resources, or effect the way in which those resources are managed.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is given eight terrain tiles, two of which are placed at the start of the game. As each player advances to the next era, they place two new terrain tiles creating a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot;. Over the course of gameplay each player will place 16 buildings before constructing the final monument, winning the game for that player.&#10;&#10;In addition to the placement of buildings, each turn players draw either a &quot;rise&quot; or a &quot;ruin&quot; card depending on their leaderboard position. These cards have random effects which balance gameplay for those who are lagging behind or have snowballed ahead, which can be omitted for purely strategic gameplay. As well, players move up to two merchant pieces with the ability to duplicate the production of the building or resource triangle they are standing on, including the buildings of their opponents.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players collectively take part in open trade where they are able to trade: resources, constructed buildings, rise cards, their status tokens, and can make promissory agreements for future payment which they are not required to fulfil. The game is played until the first player constructs their monument, which determines the winner of that game. The game can be continued to determined second, third, place players if desired.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The highest bid gets the land.&#10;&#10;During the second phase, farmers get a weather prediction and then have to decide what crops to grow. The more of one crop the group as a whole grows the less valuable it becomes. Weather also affects each crop differently. Once farmers decide what crops they are growing, the weather is decided by a dice roll that affects all farmers equally. Then crops are revealed and the value of the crops are adjusted based on the number of fields grown.&#10;&#10;Farmers collect the amount of money they have made for each crop and then start the second round. 3 rounds later the game ends and the farmer with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

How many aeons have passed, in silent darkness, since they were last used?&#10;&#10;Artefact shifts the focus to the perspective of a single magical item, and its history as it passes through the hands of many different keepers. You&rsquo;ll feel the weight of time as the item is lost or abandoned again and again, the dust &amp; decay piling around it until it&rsquo;s found again by someone new.&#10;&#10;It's a great way to spend an hour; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique items for tabletop games like D&amp;D, with detailed histories far more vivid than any you'd typically find in a compendium.&#10;&#10;",

It serves to represent either a lovely little farmhouse in either Tanland or Greenland, complete with tractors, wells, haystacks, plenty of trees, supply crates, and what's that? &#10;TWO NEW CHARACTERS? Why yes! After all, no Fury Farm Battleset is ever complete with a set of new characters to send into battle alongside your Green Guard and Tanzer Elite veterans!&#10;&#10;- For the second detail of what this product is, you'll find the agreeable Sergeant &ldquo;Shooty&rdquo; Sean representing the Green Guard, a rather light-footed fellow who is well known for his proficiency with the submachine gun. A good chap for all the sticky, tough jobs, Sean is also quite a card-player and is known for enjoying any and all types of Green Tea. Get it? Green tea!&#10;And for the Tanzer Elite we have the mysterious, gas-mask wearing Sergeant &ldquo;Shadowy&rdquo; Sylvia, one of the few Tanzer Elite soldiers who made it through the Battle of Tanky Meadows and the Retreat Through Popsy Pass with all of her bits intact! Quiet, evasive, and somewhat eerie, she is known to other Tanzer Elite troops as a bit of a lone wolf, yet commands great respect due to her distinguished military career. Oh, and despite the rumors circulating amongst the Tan forces, she is not Sergeant &quot;Blast&quot; Belle, who also survived both Tanky Meadows and Popsy Pass, has many of the same combat distinctions and honors, and also hails from Tanzington.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
