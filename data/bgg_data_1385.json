The Ukrainian forces were in a near win position after months of fighting, having cut the main arteries for supply used by the DPA. While it looked promising, there remained one main highway used by the DPA that supplied those forces in and around Donetsk, a large urban-like area they controlled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Disputed Land covers the flashpoint war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Armenian controlled territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was won in 1994.&#10;&#10;This territory was Azerbaijan's prior to 1994. The loss was never agreed to and remained a bone of contention between the two countries. As time went on, Azerbaijan became sovereign country and quickly built up its former Soviet army. Russia remains allied to both countries now but has a defense pact with Armenia. It also sells both countries its military weapons.&#10;&#10;While Azerbaijan built up its military forces that are superior to Arme-nia, Armenia did could not match them due to the fact Azerbaijan used revenue from oil. By 2020, it was time for Azerbaijan to reclaim the disputed loss area.&#10;&#10;In late September of 2020, Azer forces made a surprise attack across the Nagorno front positions and slowly made in roads. The opposing forces were fewer but it was the terrain that would determine success. But the war did bring into view future warfare using deadly armed drones that Azer forces bought from Turkey and Israel. Unable to shoot them down, Armenian tanks and radar were decimated within a week losing 173 T-72 tanks, 257 APC, 67 rocket launched artillery, 23 SAM, and 14 radar. It was a staggering blow and great military feat of future warfare tactics.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Armenia agreed to a ceasefire in mid-October. Azer forces took the time to redirect their offensive and unleash its 1st Corps along the Iranian border on the 18th. This was a brilliant move catching the Armenian forces off guard in the Fuzuli\\Fizuli area. the Azer armor and mechanized formations raced deep into Nagorno territory coming with-in 20 km of the key town of Lachin in the mountains. If taken, Azer would cutoff the only supply road into Nagorno. As Azer forces cau-tiously approached, Armenian military units in Goris began to counter-attack halting further advance. Being that the two lane road was sur-rounded my 4000 ft. mountains, Azer forces pulled back on Oct. 24.&#10;&#10;Now, Azer forces switched to another attack from Fizuli towards Shusha and the Nagorno capital. This main attack was a slugfest due to the mountainous terrain. Armenian troops fought tooth and nail but by Nov.4, Azer forces were within 10 km of Stepanakert and nearly sur-rounded Shusha. If either fell, again, the main supply road would be cut. Bitter fighting and artillery fire continued until Nov. 9, when Shusha fell to Azer.&#10;&#10;It was now Armenia agreed to Russia's peace plan. Estimated losses were up to 8000 men, well over 300 tanks lost total and hundreds of artillery guns or rocket launchers.&#10;LESS&#10;&#10;",

When he crossed paths with me, he took my arm tightly and showed me a worn and half-torn map, with drawings and nonsensical phrases that filled each sheet.&#10;&#10;Then, out of the blue, he burst out laughing, left me the map and said goodbye shouting into the wind: &quot;And that's how I ended up with a sardine on my head!&quot; Since then I have had time to look at that old nautical chart many times, and I have always been curious to know what they meant, and what meaning those phrases and drawings had and, of course, what relationship they had with a sardine on the head of a man.&#10;&#10;Maybe you are able to make sense of this story... Or not.&#10;&#10;In addition to this witty story, the game brings a series of images and texts that will make sense when you put your imagination to work. There is only one question: What is a man doing with a sardine on his head? but countless possible answers. From the cards and their combination, you will be able to create a new story every time. Perhaps it will be a long story; maybe small or even a single scene. But you will take the helm, in the way you want on each occasion.&#10;&#10;The proposal of this game arose as a search. The original idea was to make a book album as open as possible: that each person, when reading it, would create their own meanings, make their own plot. This is how this book-game was born that proposes you to establish the reading rules, play with visual and written language to shape the narrative, create connections that only you will know and enjoy a different way of reading.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wolves of Odin is a strategy card game with deep gameplay and great replay value.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one of several available actions, for example you can play a Viking card to create or grow your own squad of warriors. Or, you can play a Viking card on an enemy squad to kill enemy warrior (to discard this card). At the end of round, players will summ the strengths of their squads of warriors and player who creates strongest squad will receive victory point(s). The game is played up to 5 victory points.&#10;&#10;Instead of play a Viking card you can sacrifice your warriors to summon ancient gods with powerful game-changing abilities.&#10;&#10;The game consists of series of rounds, as result of which one of the players scores 5 victory points and ends the game, so it is important to correctly calculate strength of your cards in each round.&#10;&#10;Wolves of Odin has simple rules, but serious dilemmas arise every turn. Multiple layers of strategies create a wealth of tactical possibilities. There is also unusual passing system in the game: when a player passes, he draws new 4 cards into his hand from the deck, and every time his turn reaches him, he again draws 1 card into his hand and then discard 1 card from his hand. Thus, while other players are depleting their strength in the current round, passing player is building up power for the next round...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players try to use the revealed letters to mentally form words with at least three letters. The letters of the words already formed on the table can be used to create new words with the letter tiles of the round. When a player forms a word, he must say aloud the NUMBER of letters that word has. From there all players can keep trying to form words for as long as 1 minute. During this time, whenever a player is able to mentally form a word with an equal or greater number of letters than previously spoken, he must say that number aloud. The player who assembled the highest word wins 1 point or 2 points if he uses all 6 letter pieces in the round. The game ends when a player scores 5 points, winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

Elimination: Reveal a target card, and each player chooses one of their 10 bigrams to make a word with it. The one with the highest-scoring word gets the points of all the cards revealed.&#10;&#10;3. Winner Takes All: Each player chooses one of their 3 letter cards and takes a bigram to go with it. The one with the highest-scoring word gets the points of all revealed cards.&#10;&#10;4. Scoop Five: Each player takes five bigrams, one for each of their five letter cards.  Each player scores the points for each of their words made.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LockDown is a word game where players collect letters to build successively longer words as listed in their secret, anagrammatic manifests. Players may alter others' words, and lock down their own words to prevent alteration. [adapted from the rule book.]&#10;&#10;LockDown has 106 letter cards, 6 bonus indicators, and 20 manifest cards, each of which has four lists of four successively longer anagrams, e.g. SEA, EAST, DATES, TASTED, or RUT, ROUT, TROUT, TRYOUT. Each player is dealt 7 letter cards, one manifest, and one bonus indicator.&#10;&#10;In a turn a player may do one of these: &#10;- Draw 2 cards. &#10;- Trade a card from the hand with another player. &#10;- Play one or more cards to make words on the table. &#10;- Add a card to another player's word to make a different word. &#10;- Take a card from another player's word. &#10;- Lock one of your words by flipping its letters face down. &#10;- Gather one or more letters from your words, making any words you wish, and placing unused cards back in your hand.&#10;Then they draw or discard so their hand has 7 cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when someone plays an End of Round card, or plays their whole hand out and declares the round over. Then players score positive points for their words that are listed on their manifest, and negative points for their words that are not on their manifest.&#10;&#10;",

If the counter finishes on a line bearing an opponent, the throw passes to the other player.&#10;&#10;The method of scoring goals is for the counter to fall exactly on Line 12, but if it should fall on or go past Line 13, a goal kick is awarded, the counter being placed on Line 11, on the spots indicated. The centre line is a neutral line, and if the counter falls upon this line, the player continues to throw.

Experience adventure with 12 unique Heroes as you navigate through dozens of guided Encounters with dangerous Monsters, intriguing Scenarios, and mesmerizing Locations; all with plenty of Loot and ever-changing Qualities to ultimately face the deadly Boss waiting at the end of the Round. No session is quite the same with dynamic, journey-altering gameplay and creative Quests. There's no time to waste, gather your party and embark on your own Hero's Journey!&#10;&#10;The game is played with cards, dice, and tokens in a series of Rounds with a set number of Encounters in each and concluded with a Boss fight. Each player takes a turn as the Revealer, to flip an Encounter card face up to resolve combat with a Monster, make decisions in a Scenario, or feel the effects of a new Location. Play then continues with a new Revealer each Encounter until ultimately facing a Boss at the end of the Round.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, Qualities and Loot will play a huge part in the success or failure of the Party's journey. There are intangible Qualities that provide new active Abilities or passive Positive/Negative Traits with lingering effects. Additionally, there are physical Loot objects with powerful one-time or on-going effects. Players can never be too comfortable with their load-outs as these elements of the game are constantly changing.&#10;&#10;This is a new take on the well-loved fantasy RPG genre allowing for solo or group play with up to six players who may all enjoy the experience simultaneously. The self-narrating story provides an opportunity for everyone to be a part without a game master or hours of preparation. The design allows for simple set-up and a low learning curve including jump-in-jump-out play without compromising on the amount of depth the experience provides. With 148 cards in the base deck and character perma-death, you'll never play the same adventure twice thanks to the well-thought out rogue-like mechanics.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Figures can move around freely, although they will benefit from the presence of Leaders. Figures are activated for movement, combat and shooting by hex (so some or all of the figures in a hex may move, shoot or fight when activated).&#10;Each army has a Warlord and some Leaders. All rules applying to Leaders also apply to Warlords.&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms:&#10;All dice used are normal 6 sided dice.

The picture on the back of the cards is of a wind surfer on Lake Okanagan, and the box features a cartoon of Ogopogo, the legendary creature inhabiting that lake.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two decks, each with 51 letter cards and 2 wild cards named for Ogopogo. There are rules for five games:&#10;&#10;1. A rummy-like game. &#10;Players are dealt 7 cards, and on your turn you may:&#10;- Play a word of 3+ letters from the hand, 4+ if you haven't played a word yet. &#10;- Take a letter out of any played word of 4+ letters, rearranging the remaining letters to make a word, and using the taken letter with letters in your hand to make a new word.&#10;- Replace Ogopogo with the letter it currently stands for and use it to make a new word from your hand.&#10;- Draw a card. You may use it to do any of the plays above. &#10;When one player uses up all cards in hand, the hand ends and each player gets one point per card in hand. After a certain number of hands, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;2. A children's game reminiscent of Rack-o.&#10;Each player has 5 cards in hand, and on their turn draws from the draw or discard pile, and discards. The first player to have 5 consecutive letters in hand wins.&#10;&#10;3. A Gin Rummy-like game with growing hand size.&#10;Deal N cards to each player, who in their turn draws and discards, and lays down their entire hand to spell a word if they can, after which everyone else gets one more turn to try to do the same. Each player who lays down a word gets one point for the hand.  The number N of cards dealt (and hence the length of the target word) starts at 2, and increases one per hand until N=8.  The highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;4. Themed words.&#10;The dealer declares a theme -- e.g. animals, colors, girls' names, etc. -- and deals each player 7 cards. Players draw and discard as in game 3. The game ends when a player can lay down a word of any length that fits the theme declared by the dealer.&#10;&#10;5. Solitaire.&#10;Draw 5 cards, and try to make and lay down a word of 3 or more letters. Draw cards as needed. You win if you can use the entire deck making legal words.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Science officers brought back a strange alien fungus from a survey mission to an asteroid. Following the usual protocols, the fungus was placed in quarantine, but its explosive growth when exposed to the warmth of the ship caused it to break out of its containment area, shattering the glass and releasing spores into the ventilation shafts.&#10;&#10;Now, the alien fungus, dubbed the &quot;Phage&quot; by the ship's scientists, is infecting the crew, turning them into lurching, zombie-like horrors that are taking over the ship! The central power grid has failed, and half the crew are either infected or still in cryosleep.&#10;&#10;As captain, it's your job to make the life-and-death decisions. You need to get as many crew members off the ship as possible, but you cannot allow the Phage to escape. You'll have to wake the remaining crew members from cryosleep, power up the lifeboat hangar, keep the oxygen flowing, and initiate the self-destruct sequence. Consult your science officers to gain insights into how the Phage works. Send your engineers to jury-rig mechanisms to keep the Phage at bay. Task your operations personnel with keeping the oxygen flowing and the power online. Order your security officers to cover the retreat of your crew. How many can you save from humanity's first encounter with the Phage?&#10;&#10;In this strategic solitaire game, you play cards that represent your crew members to different areas of the ship. The game also plays &quot;Phage&quot; cards representing the ever-advancing influence of the alien fungus to the same areas. Using a simple trick-taking mechanic, you quickly determine whether the humans successfully achieve their goals (such as powering up the Bio Lab or restoring the oxygen supply by repairing the oxygen scrubbers), or whether the Phage have killed off the humans attempting to do so.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;station&quot; on the ship provides different winning and losing effects, and managing these effects in the face of the onslaught of the Phage is the key to rescuing crew members from the ship. You win by activating the self-destruct sequence and destroying all of the Phage. You lose if the Phage escapes the ship. Your score at the end of the game is how many of your crew members escape.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Welcome Aboard, Captain&quot; is a solitaire science-fiction tabletop roleplaying game.&#10;&#10;In this game, you take the role of a starship captain, recruit a crew of bridge officers (science, engineering, etc.), outfit your ship, and head out into the galaxy to go on missions.&#10;&#10;The game is a print-and-play game; you only need to print the starship sheet and the bridge officer roster to play, although there are some handy reference sheets to print as well.  The game comes with a pre-made ship and crew if you don't want to create your own.&#10;&#10;The game features a procedural mission generator, where you roll dice to define a mission for your starship captain, and then you perform a series of &quot;command decisions&quot; that the generator reacts to, allowing a dynamic adventure to unfold based on tables you roll on in the book.&#10;&#10;Challenges are met by rolling dice from the ship and crew against threats that the procedural generator creates; whichever die is highest is the one that determines what happens.  As you work your way through the mission, you'll be rolling to advance your mission until it is completed, but surprise revelations and other unexpected challenges can throw plot twists into the narrative.&#10;&#10;In addition to the core gameplay, there are three &quot;gamebooks&quot; with the game that let you play the game with the same mechanics but through pre-written adventures. One of them, &quot;Charon Wormhole&quot;, is a learn-to-play adventure where you are introduced to the mechanics of the game while playing through a tense adventure about taking your first command.&#10;&#10;The core game also includes optional extension materials for advanced play, adding excursion vehicles, companions, vignette missions, and nemesis enemies.&#10;&#10;",

The first player who gets a total score of 100 or more wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crokinole Imperium brings three brand new experiences to the classic game of crokinole, by introducing new cards and rules that are combined with rich Medieval-Latin lore.&#10;&#10;SUB ROSA meaning, &ldquo;Under the Rose&rdquo; is a Latin phrase that has been used in the middle ages to denote secrecy or confidentiality. In this game each player will earn points by completing their unique objective card and by outscoring their opponents.&#10;&#10;FREE LANCES refers to mercenaries whose lance was free of any lord&rsquo;s service. Each mercenary will offer you a single use ability that could tip the round in your favor, but be careful not to let their valuable skills go to waste.&#10;&#10;TERRA NOVA meaning, &quot;New Land&quot; brings about a new land card each round that applies to all players requiring you to significantly alter your strategy. Learn the terrain and use it to your advantage or fail to adapt and see an abrupt end to your thoughts of victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Conspiracy is a card game released in spring 2023, on Kickstarter and was chosen Project We Love by KS. It is a fun, fast-paced tableau-builder for those who wanna try what it's like to be a conspiracy theory believer.&#10;&#10;Chose your core conspiracy (card) and build your unique theory around it by winning news (cards) and explaining how those fit your theory. (Don't worry explanation is optional and you can skip it by playing the game in Flat Earther variant.) Each conspiracy card gives a special ability to its believer. Use it wisely to become more influential than your rivals and their childish tales.&#10;&#10;In Conspiracy, each player acts simultaneously during the two rounds of a turn. There are three types of action they can choose from: action card drawing, playing an action card, and flipping a news card. Action cards give you some useful abilities and influence among the believers. The most influential wins the actual news (card) at the end of the turn. By your clairvoyance ability, you can flip your news cards to see the hidden message between the lines and get a useful bonus.&#10;&#10;A player wins and the game ends when any player reaches the given number of followers and is able to keep them until the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;Conspiracy offers a cooperative and a solo mode as well where you can work together (or alone) to uncover the shadow government before it's too late. Merge your conspiracy cards to the ultimate great grandfathers of all conspiracy theories and play action cards side by side against the shadow government cards to win the actual news (card), protect your theory and your hands.&#10;&#10;In cooperative mode, the game ends when the players reach the given number of followers and keep them until the end of the turn or when the shadow government deck is depleted.&#10;&#10;The core mechanics of the game are: hand management, flipping a card, bid, tableau building, variable player powers, and narrative building.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a card-based adaptation of Scrabble game-play. The deck has 69 letter cards, a majority of which are basic cards and just have a letter score.  For each vowel, there are 3 basic cards, and one each of x2, x3, and x4 letter score cards, which multiply adjacent consonants in their word by that amount.  There are also 15 consonant cards that multiply the score for the entire word by x2, x3, or x4.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt an 8-card hand. On their turn, a player plays a word from their hand that must use one basic card from the previous player's word if there is one; they tally the word's score and then draw to fill their hand back to 8 cards. A player may also just pass and draw one card.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the deck runs out and all players pass in turn. The highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The American victory at Saratoga in 1777 and their Treaty with France in 1778 transformed the war in America. The potential influx of fresh French troops to swell the ranks of General Washington&rsquo;s Army drove the British to rethink their colonial strategy. As a result the British moved their efforts from the middle colonies to the southern colonies where it was believed sentiment for the crown&rsquo;s cause ran strong. Having secured Savannah in 1779 the British turned their eyes on Charleston and South Carolina. When the British crossed the Savannah River South Carolina became the focal point of the revolution.&#10;&#10;The years, 1780-1781, in South Carolina saw some of the most intense fighting that occurred in the revolution as both Loyalists and Patriots both rose up in numbers to fight for or against the crown. The struggle for independence during those two years saw over 200+ actions, skirmishes, and battles fought in South Carolina resulting in the names of Marion, Morgan, and Tarleton and places such as Kings Mountain and Cowpens entering American lore.&#10;&#10;Crown and Crescent models the two years of intense, fierce fighting in South Carolina adopting and modifying the unique and innovative command and control mechanics created by the Ragnar Brothers for ANGOLA!  These mechanics keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution as you guide your forces towards independence or crushing the revolting colonists. The map is divided into seven districts, encompassing 6 to 7 key locations each, used to show control of the district. Control enough key locations and you&rsquo;ll then control the district and therefore advance on the victory point track towards winning the game.&#10;&#10;The counters represent military units and auxiliaries such as artillery, rifled and light troops, grenadiers, dragoons, and cavalry. A unique command and activation system has players planning in secret the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is a tense game, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.&#10;&#10;Crown and Crescent can be played with between two to four players (Continental and Whigs vs British and Tories).&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; full-color map&#10;        Two full sheets of counters (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;        One full color rule book&#10;        One deck of 55 cards&#10;        4 player aid cards&#10;        20 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
