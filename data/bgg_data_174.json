Each building block has four sides with different faces, and on a turn one player draws a token to determine which block to place, then chooses which two sides of the building block they might get and which two sides will be left to the opponent &mdash; then the other player decides where to place that block. They then swap roles for the next turn. Try your best to fulfill the conditions on the balconies facing you. Who will gain more points by game's end?&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most votes for their work is the winner of this round, and they gain the labels. In case of a tie, the Master Arcimboldo chooses who wins the tie.

During five rounds of play, players compete for particles to complete quests, developing powerful abilities that offer an edge on opponents. In bidding to do research at the five particle accelerators, each scientist gets to take part in the thrill of discovery. Each player must balance pushing their own research forward whilst sabotaging opponents to make sure they do not make an astounding discovery. Fast and furious auctions ensure that the player who wants something the most actually gets it, though they may have to pay a dear price. Such is the nature of research!&#10;&#10;Quirky Quarks is peppered with interesting facts about subatomic particles. (Who knew that bananas emitted positrons?!) So while you&rsquo;re waiting for your opponents to make a decision, you&rsquo;ll be entertained as you learn about the wonderful world of particle physics. Lighthearted, memorable illustrations make particles instantly recognizable and convey their nature. The game also features tremendous replayability - no two games will ever be identical, and players must determine which strategy best suits the cards that they&rsquo;re dealt as they vie for the Nobel prize!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Somali Pirates, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame set in a hypothetical Coalition campaign to destroy the power of pirates based in Somalia, as well as to otherwise gain control of that country. The assumption of the game is that the pirates, in league with local warlords and Al Qaeda, have become strong enough to be an even bigger threat to the region than they are now. In response, various powers launch military action against them.&#10; There are two players in Somali Pirates: The Coalition, who wants to destroy the pirates, and the Pirates, who want to survive, as well as to maximize their own power and wealth. Central to play of the game is the Netwar Index. Each player has a Netwar Index that indicates how successful he is in achieving his goals...effectively, representing the amount of public support that each side is getting. The Netwar Index affects various aspects of the game, such as mobilization of reinforcements, and is also part of gaining victory.&#10; Both players have a set of counters that represent their naval, land, air and special operations forces (SOF). Players move their pieces across the spaces on the map and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces, seize critical geographical regions, and change the Netwar Index (hopefully in their favor). Both sides can mobilize new units by paying for them with Netwar Points. Given the asymmetry of the situation, each side in the game will have several unique rules..&#10; The game includes one map of East Africa and environs, from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing various pirate and Al Qaeda forces, local militias and warlords, plus the principle Coalition forces (primarily NATO and the United States, and even a potential inclusion of a Chinese expeditionary force).&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 176 counters.&#10;&#10;",

It's then the turn of the lawyer to make their presentation.&#10;&#10;The jurors need to listen carefully to the speeches and follow the clues in their booklets. They will try to deduce who scored the most points during the two presentations. The judge has all the answers in their booklet and is responsible for keeping score.&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of cards numbered 3-7. On a turn, a player lays down 1-3 cards in the center of the table, creating a pile for each number played or adding to an existing pile for that number, so the 3s go on a three pile, the 4s on a four pile, etc. When you play the third 3, the fourth 4, the fifth 5, etc., you take all the cards of that number from the table and place them in a score pile. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to three cards.&#10;&#10;When one player has no cards remaining in their draw deck and hand, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First Blood: Guadalcanal is a battalion-level game simulating the Battle of Guadalcanal. Starting in August of 1942 and concluding in early 1943, the US Marines invaded and captured a small airfield, and then, with the US Army, spent months fighting off Japanese attempts to recapture or destroy the airfield.&#10;&#10;Guadalcanal is considered one of the turning points in the War in the Pacific. Japanese expansion was stopped, and the Japanese Army confronted a foe who didn't flee from banzai charges. The Japanese found themselves unable to support offensive efforts on Guadalcanal and in New Guinea at the same time.&#10;&#10;First Blood: The Guadalcanal Campaign was included with the SILVER Anniversary Issue of the A.H.I.K.S.-Vol.-26~#6-magazine and the game is akin to a &quot;kit&quot; in that you have to mount and cut-out the counters. They have been printed on adhesive backed paper which makes it easier for producing this aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;The contents of the game include: the RULES Folder(8)-pages; a thick paper CHART; a Sheet of adhesive backed counters(over 150); &amp; a (4)-COLOR 11&quot; by 17&quot; thick paper Mapsheet; while players will need to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE.&#10;&#10;The RULES contain the following sections of note: Off-board Movement; Artillery; I.J.N. Naval Units; U.S. Engineers; Airstrip Capacity; Air Units; Brief Historical Commentary; Counters mounting advice; &amp; the Turn Sequence on the back page. The Counters are RED/WHITE(Japanese)&amp; BLUE/WHITE(U.S.) which are Battalion level for ground units, Air Unit Squadrons, individual Ships(Destroyers), Damaged &amp; Destroyed Airfield markers, &amp; Off-board Movement markers. There are MANY different Combat Unit types as well as various Aircraft depicted in this although for game purposes, these are of either Fighter or Bomber types(and F4F-Wildcats can be considered as either).&#10;&#10;The Game Chart is printed with the Setup-/Reinforcements-/Combat Results Explanations on one side with a Units-/Terrain Identification Charts on the reverse. Players may want to copy this prior to play for EACH player to have available. The game Mapsheet covers the area around Henderson Field and it's environs. Also on the Mapsheet are: the seperate Japanese &amp; American Attack Tables; Terrain Movement Cost/Defense Modifiers Table; Off-board Movement Boxes; Reinforcements Starting locations; and BOXES for I.J.A.F. &amp; I.J.N. - Reserve &amp; Attack; and U.S.A.F. Reserve, C.A.P., &amp; Ground Attack.&#10;&#10;The Turn Sequence is as follows: 1.Japanese Reinforcement phase; 2.Japan. Movement phase; 3.Japan. Combat phase; 4.Japan. Supply Resolution phase; 5.Japan. Strategic phase; 6., 7., 8.,-U.S.Player's similar to Japanese 1st 3-phases; 9.U.S. Engineer phase; 10.U.S. Air phase; 11.Check Victory Conditions or begin NEW turn. Overall, a very professional appearing production considering it's subject matter &amp; their operating strictures while the graphics are very detailed, especially for the Aircraft types depicted.&#10;&#10;Subsequently republished after major development in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #178 by Decision Games. The original AHIKS version is now available for free download.&#10;&#10;Game scale in S&amp;T #178 version: approx. 600 yards/hex; units are mostly battalions.&#10;&#10;",

The Greedy Cat eats two food cubes. The Mangy Cat forces another cat to move away from their bowl. Once five cats are at any food bowl, the feeding (scoring) phase begins, followed by a new round.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches 20 points, the player with the most value of food cubes eaten at the end of the feeding phase wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The board consists of various fields and camps that are seperated by highways and train tracks.  Each player has two bases located at his end of the board the player's flag goes in one of these bases; a low ranking piece is usually placed in the other as a decoy.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag. Players place their pieces face down on the fields on their side of the board. A third player is required to act as a referee to determine the outcome of fights (which occur when a piece moves into a field with an opposing piece). &#10;Fights are resolved based on the rank of different pieces.  Pieces that are ranked high such as the General or Lieutenant General defeat pieces of lesser rank such as Engineers (Gong Ping) and Sergeants.  There are two special tiles - a mine which destroys anyone who attacks it (with the exception of a Engineer), the missile which can kill any unit and in the process destroys itself.&#10;&#10;Camps remain vacant at the start of the game and remain vacant until a piece occupies them.  Pieces that remain within a bunker are protected from attack while those on fields are not.&#10;&#10;Similar Games Include:&#10;&#10;    Stratego&#10;    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi&#10;    Si Guo Da Zhan&#10;    Dong Wu Qi&#10;&#10;&#10;",

However, it does not matter if you are a don or a henchman, a bookie or a snitch, a consigliere or a man of honour, nobody really has got a plan of what is going on. Who belongs to which family?

In fact, the game really takes place, when it&rsquo;s NOT your turn. Deal cards to your opponents and family members either in a rather clandestine way when nobody is looking or take a more straightforward approach - you decide. Each player then plays out the cards dealt to him when it&rsquo;s his turn &ndash; they can make him either richer or poorer, endanger his life or see the identities of other players. He may then choose whether to take three white cards (offensive), two black cards (defensive) or whether to try to bribe the other players. After that his turn ends and he can again start dealing cards and &quot;make them offers they can&rsquo;t refuse&quot;.&#10;&#10;Think tactically: Combine different action cards to manipulate and enhance effects!&#10;Cooperate: Bribe your opponents, help your don and get rid of the rest.&#10;Bluff: Every action is performed secretly. Nobody knows who you are or what you are up to...&#10;Change the game: Everyone is playing a different character, for example a consigliere or the bookie.

Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.&#10;&#10;Red Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.&#10;&#10;Iron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!&#10;&#10;Lincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.&#10;&#10;",

At 17:00 on 11 October 1899 the ultimatum expired. The British Empire was at war with the Boers, the white tribe of Africa. The war would straddle the centuries, ending on May 31, 1902. It was a bitter defeat for the Boers and a victory bereft of glory for the world's mightiest empire.&#10;&#10;Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map&#10;264 full color 5/8&quot; die cut counters&#10;Rulebook length - 14 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Medium&#10;Playing time - 8 hours&#10;&#10;",

It is intended for fighting the biggest, bloodiest battles of 1850-1900 in a manageable way. Specific design goals included:&#10;to tackle the major battles such as Solferino, Gettysburg, K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, Sedan or Plevna, often spanning several days&rsquo; combat;&#10;to fit them on a 6&rsquo;x4&rsquo; tabletop;&#10;and to fight them in their entirety, in a single 3-to-4-hour session, with 2-6 players (typically 4).&#10;&#10;BBB is not intended for small actions of a few thousand men a side. There are plenty of rulesets that do that. But BBB is distinctive in:&#10;Enabling players to command entire armies of 100,000+ men;&#10;Fitting battlefields of up to 20km across on the table;&#10;While still producing a fast, fun, flavorful game and a result in an evening.&#10;&#10;Scale varies according to the battle but is typically:&#10;Figure scale 1,500 men or 36 cannon per 1&rdquo; base (organized into multi-base division or brigade-sized units, usually of 3-7 infantry bases, 2-3 cavalry bases or 1 artillery base);&#10;Ground scale 1&rdquo; per 200-250 yards;&#10;Timescale 1 hour per turn.&#10;&#10;BBB uses simple mechanisms and memorisable tables that fit on a clear 2-page QRC.&#10;Turn sequence: IGO-UGO&#10;Command and Control: reflected partly by how many generals get represented on table, partly by how units are rated.&#10;Movement: 2D6 movement table incorporates difficult terrain, generalship and doctrine, troop quality and morale, loss recovery.&#10;Fire Combat: calculated by adding fire points. 2D6 fire table to determine casualties, recorded by base removal.&#10;Assault: opposed D6 roll incorporating a few relevant factors.&#10;Night Interval rules to allow multi-day battles.&#10;&#10;BBB is meant for fighting historical battles. BBB and its companion volume, Bloody Big European Battles, therefore provide fully playtested scenarios for 25 of the most important battles of the period, linked into full campaigns. Further free scenarios are also available on the web.&#10;&#10;All the scenarios fit the battles they depict into a beautiful, tightly engineered game structure. They have clear, simple, but carefully thought-out victory conditions, designed both to recreate the historical situation and to generate an exciting and balanced game that can be completed in a sensible period of time. A particular joy of fighting historical actions on this scale is that usually both sides have several different viable strategies available, meaning the scenarios are full of replay value and can produce quite different games each time.&#10;&#10;",

(Players hold seven cards with two players, five cards with four, and eight vs. four/four with three.)&#10;&#10;Each battlefield card bears a special power that the winner of that card receives as a reward, such as &quot;Remove all cards from one battlefield&quot;, &quot;Choose the next battlefield to activate&quot;, and &quot;Force the loser to give up one won battle&quot;.&#10;&#10;The first team to claim any five battlefields or three battlefields of the same color wins, although rules are provided for shorter games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1945 the Nazis went to the Moon; in 2018 they come back with a vengeance! Get ready, for the Fourth Reich is about to land on your table!&#10;&#10;Iron Sky: The Board Game is based on the full-length feature film Iron Sky, a dark sci-fi comedy set in the year 2018. The Nazis have completed the construction of a massive invasion fleet of flying saucers and space zeppelins, and arrive at Earth's door with only one thing in their mind: total world dominance!&#10;&#10;Iron Sky: The Board Game puts players in charge of the most epic battle of all history. The objective is to gather as many victory points for your side as possible. Both the attacking and defending players are in command of a specific sector of the battlefield, and each player is awarded with a personal score based on how the battle fares &ndash; but no one commander can win the whole war. The players need to help each other out of tight spots, for each commander has a different area of expertise, with weaker proficiency in other areas. Only by working together can the players prevent the enemy from exploiting these weaknesses, and only by working together can they bring the enemy to their knees!&#10;&#10;In addition to mixing cooperation with competition, the core of the gameplay ensures that the players practically have no downtime at all. You are either attacking or defending all the time, eliminating the need to wait for your turn.&#10;&#10;Iron Sky: The Board Game takes a different approach to the universe of Iron Sky. The movie may focus on the main characters, but the board game gives players direct control over the whole global war effort &ndash; and there's no way of knowing which side will emerge victorious. Lock and load &ndash; the Moon Nazis are coming!&#10;&#10;",

Twenty &quot;all-new, all-true&quot; mysteries of the 20th century include:&#10;&#10;     The JFK assassination in &quot;The Camelot Conspiracy, Pt. I and II&quot;&#10;     Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in &quot;The Vanishing Teamster&quot;&#10;     Elvis's death in &quot;The King's Early Exit&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.&#10;&#10;The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard version uses regular movers, while the Deluxe version includes six &quot;collectible&quot; pewter playing pieces: Deerstalker Cap, Time Machine, Dark Lantern, Magnifying Glass, Violin, Pipe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are members of an old English aristocratic family. Your uncle from America had the excellent idea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;passing away bequeathing you his immense fortune. To celebrate the event, you decide to go for tea and enjoy some scones. However, each being equally greedy, each of the heirs decides to poison the cookies with Arsenic (a safe bet) in order to increase their share of their inheritance. Digestion promises to be difficult...&#10;&#10;Tea, Scones and ARSENIC is a family game, for 1 to 6 players. It&rsquo;s a bluff party-game full of thought, strategy and a hint of luck.  Goal of the game : Eat the most Scones without dying in excruciating pain.&#10;&#10;Setting up : Each player chooses a Cup board for their aristocrat (the choice of characters has no effect on the course of the game), and take 3 Sugar Cubes. The Scones are placed randomly, Poison side down, in the cookie box. You play with all the Scones, regardless of the number of players. Some Scones are normal, but others contain varying amounts of poison. The amount of poison is indicated at the back of the Scone. For each type of Scone, there are 2 harmless and 4 poisoned.  The lethal dose at which a character succumbs to poison and is eliminated from the game differs depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The 1st player takes a Scone in hand and turns it over discreetly to know his dose of poison (the other players should not see anything), he can shuffle the Scones before picking if he want to.&#10;Either he eats it (he decides to keep it and places it in his Cup in front of him, Poison side hidden) or he puts it back in its place in the box and consumes a Sugar Cube to delay (he can shuffle the Scones afterward if he want to). In the course of the game, Scones pile up on his Cup. A player can look at his Scones at any time. In either case, their turn ends and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn. When a player runs out of Sugar Cube, he is forced to eat the Scone.&#10;&#10;Each player, at the start of their turn (before playing), can decide that they have had enough, and stop playing (they take a turn each time it is their turn to play). In doing so, he forces the other players to continue for 2 more rounds (Honor rounds) without the possibility for them to stop. Once the 2 Honor Rounds have been completed, one of the surviving players (if any) may in round choose to stop. The remaining players therefore set off for 2 additional Honor Rounds. And so on&hellip;&#10;&#10;If a player reaches his natural resistance to poison (i.e. the number of arsenic doses he accumulated equals or exceeds the lethal dose), he dies (he is eliminated and his Scones are not counted). The deceased may choose to simply turn their board over to the Deceased side and laconically announce &laquo; I&rsquo;m dead &raquo;. Or ... he may suddenly put his hands to his throat, uttering terrible rumblings interspersed with barely audible words such as &laquo; Cursed! &raquo;, &laquo; Why so much hatred ... &raquo; or &laquo; Who will feed the dog? &raquo; Before slipping slowly from his chair and ending up lying on the floor in a grotesque position.

    "Description": "In the cooking-themed card game Raid the Pantry, for 2-4 individuals or two teams of two, players are dealt ingredient and dish cards at the start of play; over the course of the game, players need to collect the ingredients needed to make the dishes in hand. Each completed dish scores you 1-3 points, locks in its ingredients for reuse in other dishes, and allows you to take a new dish card. Action cards, drawn at the beginning of a turn, provide ways to add, lose, trade and retrieve ingredient cards. The eight &quot;Instant Dishes&quot; among the action cards allow players to lock in a common ingredient and score 1 point.&#10;  &#10;Players can score a &quot;cuisine bonus&quot; for making multiple dishes from one of the five primary cuisines featured on dish cards (American, Continental, French, Italian and Mexican). The first player to reach a point threshold, which depends on the number of players, wins.&#10;&#10;In the team version, players end the round and total their points when the Action card deck has been exhausted.&#10;&#10;Raid the Pantry is the winner of the New Zealand New Game of the Year 2013 award from the New Zealand Games Association.  It also won a Game of the Year 2013 award from Creative Child Magazine and one of first ever &quot;Recommended by American Mensa&quot; commendations.&#10;&#10;Originally published by SchilMil Games in May 2012, Cheeky Parrot Games acquired the title in 2014 and released a second edition, with some graphical and gameplay tweaks, in June 2015.&#10;&#10;",

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the MedWar Sicily game system: no CRT, just dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. Richard Berg however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons).&#10;&#10;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.&#10;&#10;Playing time for &ldquo;Desert War Egypt&rdquo; as averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.&#10;&#10;Each game of Desert War Egypt includes full box, rules, one sheet of large 5/8&rdquo; die cut thick counters, dice, two decks of 10 cards, and a thick card stock game board.&#10;&#10;According to the back of the box, the game will include new and updated counters for MedWar Sicily, the first game using this system. Upcoming games using this system include East War Russia 1941, and Guns of August 1914.&#10;&#10;",

The game is based on real planetary missions and rocket science. It also contains elements of politics and strategy that are inspired by the real-life situations that space missions face.&#10;&#10;How do you complete your space mission?&#10;&#10;Each player selects a Mission Card from the deck. This card determines the player's mission &ndash; the mission destination, type of spacecraft needed, the amount of Delta-V needed to achieve the mission, the potential to obtain gravity assists, and the points earned for completing the mission. Delta-V stands for change in velocity, and as applied to space missions and this game, it means the change in velocity necessary for a spacecraft to complete a selected mission.&#10;&#10;Game play is straightforward. On their turn each player draws a playing card, plays up to three Action Cards, trades with other players, and places components on their game board. The Action Cards add real-life issues to the game that space missions often encounter - project cancellations, audits, government shutdowns, and other exciting twists and turns.&#10;&#10;To complete a mission you must populate your game board with the right combination of cards for mission success. Each player needs to collect the Playing Cards that give them the right spacecraft, first and second stage rockets, and matching fairings. Gravity assist and solid rocket booster cards are available to provide additional Delta-V if needed to complete the assigned mission. Once the mission is complete, the player earns the points for the mission, which varies based on the size of the spacecraft and the target, and starts work on their next mission. The first player to score 10 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Battle of Tours is a fast-playing game of low complexity. To that end, much detail has been either omitted or factored into the overall mechanics. We have tried to provide as much period flavor and historical accuracy as we can, within that focus. The game should take about two hours to play to conclusion, about 50% more the first time.&#10;&#10;The tactical system which highlights the different strengths and weaknesses of both sides. The Muslims are lightly armored, cavalry heavy, and prone to piecemeal attacking by tribes. The Frankish army is caught in transition from Roman heavy infantry tactics and the birth of armored knights. It is mobility versus defense, Moorish spears versus Frankish long swords. And you make the decisions.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Tours includes 100 counters that capture the widely varying weapons systems at this battle. You&rsquo;ll find both light and heavy infantry, light and heavy cavalry, and (a few) mounted archers. But beyond unit types, you&rsquo;ll command troops who actually fight &quot;differently&quot; from each other. Muslim units are activated by &quot;tribes,&quot; as a collection of varied unit types that all happen to move together. Frankish units activate by type&mdash;all the heavy infantry, all the light infantry, all the cavalry. The difference means the two armies &quot;feel&quot; different to command. Players designate basic &quot;orders&quot; by selecting counters, then find out who obeys. The chaos and lack of real control conveys an historic chaos that really captures the flavor of this battle, where failure can mean slaughter, but victory can mean losing control, as troops turn from soldiers to looters.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series with straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An Axis &amp; Allies like strategy game reliving the dramatic events of operation Market-Garden in September 1944. A large narrow mapboard represents the area from Eindhoven by Nijmegen to Arnhem. Units are plastic pieces representing infantry, tanks and artillery; 13 important plastic bridges are included. Almost every bridge is a stepping-stone to success. And every bridge can be blown.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to reach Arnhem and make contact with the British paras. The time frame is restricted and if the Allied player doesn't reach Arnhem on time, the paras are doomed and an easy target for the German elite forces!&#10;&#10;The RULES are short and simple: the game focusses on strategy, and nothing else.&#10;&#10;The game map has all the necessary information needed to play the game. Once you've read the rules once, there's no need to look up things anymore. (almost) Every bit of information is on the map.&#10;No looking up hit probabilities, defense factors, or attack factors in rows and columns. No measuring with rulers. Just roll the dice.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with the use of ten-sided color coded dice: so there's some luck involved, but a reasonable level.&#10;&#10;Good tactics require the use of an optimal mix of units to get the job done.&#10;Each kind of unit has its specific strength and weakness, depending on the battleground. Players should choose wisely which units to use where and when.&#10;In this game the players don't get to choose the casualties themselves: a roll with the dice reveals the distribution of the hits. The FOG OF WAR is simulated by distributing the hits at random. In this way you are never totally in control: you plan your strategies, you work out plans, you anticipate as much as you can, but the outcome is never, ever perfect. With &quot;Arnhem'44&quot; both players get a much more 'realistic' game experience playing this game.&#10;&#10;",

There are 2 kinds of cards: CONTAINER cards and GARBAGE cards, each in the possible 5 colours referred above. &#10;Players will have in their hand GARBAGE cards, in whatever colours (some have 2 different colours). GARBAGE cards worth negative points, so players will try to recycle them, that is, to get rid of them. &#10;As to the CONTAINER cards, these worth positive points (from 1 to 5, in each colour), and are placed in the center of the table. These are drawn one at a time. &#10;For each CONTAINER card,  players can bet any number of cards of the correspondent colour from their hand. Whenever all players pass, the highest bet wins that CONTAINER card (place it next to him, worthing points) and discards the GARBAGE cards that he has bet, meaning those were recycled. All the other bets loose, meaning the GARBAGE cards will be placed next to each loosing player, and these worth -1 point per card at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;This is a betting and bluffing cardgame, for 2 to 6 players, 20 min.

Here, each player plays, all at once, as many cards face-up in front of himself as he wishes or he passes. After all players have done this, scoring occurs. Players compare the total number of their played cards. Only cards displaying the characteristic of the current Location card and Gandalf cards played in the column with the matching characteristic are counted. Whoever has the most cards of the appropriate type takes the highest point tile at that Location and the Ring (he is the start player for the next round). The player with second-most cards of the appropriate type takes the next highest point tile and so on - the player with the fewest matching cards gets nothing. &#10;The player who has earned the most points by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Compete against other families for raw goods and prime real-estate.  Do you place your new draper business in the draper quarter where it will be more profitable, or beside the campo with the beautiful statue to earn your family more prestige?  Raw goods are cheaper at the Pirate wharf, but if the Pirates get enough money, they will set sail and rob everyone's ships of their most prized goods!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikipedia:&#10;&#10;Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by Jo&atilde;o Pedro Neto in 2000.&#10;&#10;The game is played with standard go equipment (though 13x13 boards are often preferred to 19x19) and all the rules of Go apply, except that players can't pass and the pie rule is used to determine who goes first.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).&#10;&#10;Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.&#10;&#10;So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.&#10;     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. &#10;&#10;&#10;Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.&#10;&#10;",

Mr. Card Game is a rule-breaking, cross-classing monster killer on a tabletop quest to free King Ralph XI from the Naughty Sorceress. As you and your fellow tabletop adventurers chart a course through the Kingdom of Loathing, whoever buys the right skills, acquires the best stats and can take down the Naughty Sorceress first wins the game and the right to lord it over his or her friends (friends not included with game).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DescriptionMr. Card Game is the official tabletop game of the massive multiplayer online game Kingdom of Loathing. With a mixture of deck-building mechanics and tableau management, Mr. Card Game is a fantasy adventure themed character building card game for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and up which plays in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SynopsisEach player begins with a deck of one point stats and a set of basic newbie gear. On your turn, you have the opportunity to select one of the monsters on top of the location draft piles to kill. By defeating a monster, you receive a new item (displayed on the reverse side of the monster card) to add to your tableau, a new stat card to add to your deck and meat tokens you can use on subsequent turns to draft skills. Once one or more of the players thinks they have accumulated enough power from killing monsters, upgrading stats and training skills to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, they may call a March of the Tower where all players have an opportunity to kill her together. They player with the highest power and enough to kill the Sorceress, wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;StrategyThe gameplay in Mr. Card Game is a hybrid of deck building and tableau management. Mr. Card Game is a game of drafting, not only drafting items and skills, but also the stat cards necessary to use those items and skills most effectively. You want to plot a course through the locations in the game which maximizes the synergy of the skill and item cards you draft into your tableau with the stat cards you draft into your deck. All the while managing your level of meat, the currency of the realm you acquire from killing monsters, which you need to purchase the skills which make you better. Tactically, the game relies upon your management of your tableau, when to use or sell items, and how effectively you craft the hand of cards necessary to defeat your target or perhaps even win the game.&#10;&#10;",

However, unlike a game where you&rsquo;re already established as a villain, 'Pirates!' starts with the barest of set-ups then sees you actually progress. Upgrading your ship and conquering new ships is the order of the day as you take down merchants and other pirates aplenty to build up your own fleet. Will you be feared and become the new Blackbeard, or thrown over board to feed the sharks by your conqueror?&#10;&#10;In the game there is a wide variation of ships which have a different combinations of speed, cannons, crew members and cargo. Pirate cards can be used in your turn or during battle, improving your ship or giving an advantage in battles.&#10; The goal of the game is to become the master of the oceans by conquering 7 pirate points (golden skulls). Ships are worth 1 or 2 pirate points, but pirate points are also found on adventures and fame cards. The game will also end when you conquer all your opponents ships.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Assault on Sevastopol is a two-player game recreating Erich von Manstein&rsquo;s attempt to clear the Crimean peninsula and seize the key port city of Sevastopol as a prelude to Germany&rsquo;s 1942 summer offensive in Ukraine &ndash; the roads to which would lead to the fateful battle of Stalingrad. The Germans are attempting to clear this enemy bastion on the Black Sea and free up their forces for the great offensive to the north. The Russians are desperately trying to hold out as long as possible, falling back on great defensive terrain and strong fortified positions, hoping to delay the German invaders and extract as high a price as possible from them for the capture of Sevastopol.&#10;&#10;But the Germans have prepared for this campaign. With complete air superiority, the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) relentlessly attacks from the skies, while special super-heavy siege artillery is slowly and carefully brought in and assembled expressly for this operation. It&rsquo;s a hard-fought matter of time, distance, and attrition as you recreate the Assault on Sevastopol.&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 regiment, brigade, division, or battle group, each hex is 3 kilometers, and each turn is 3 days.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;     One 4-page, color instructions booklet&#10;     40 color, die-cut, two-sided 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces&#10;     One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map with charts &amp; tables&#10;     One 2-page sheet of historical, designer, and developer notes&#10;     One 4-page, color BATTLESSON (TM) booklet&#10;     One bonus Optional Rule&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Sevastopol&#10;&#10;&#10; Buy Microbadge&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "More than three millennia have passed since the human race left its native land. The discovery of the Sophia triad made real some theories previously thought impossible, theories that were experimented to prove their viability and each of them were performed, no matter whether it was possible or not.&#10;&#10;Dark Matter is a game from 2 to 4 players. Each player starts with three unique cards to play all the game. Each card is divided in two zones in its obverse and reverse, and each zone has one or several skills. Players play these skills to get matters to terraform planets, to recruit soldiers, to attack enemy planets, to improve their own planets, to use heroes and politics to manipulate their cards and opponents cards, to get resources, and more.&#10;&#10;But players won't play only with their own cards. They can also use the opponent cards. Each time a card is played it changes its position, so possibilities are infinite. When a player uses his cards, he spins his card (from front to back) and when he uses the opponent cards, they flip the card (from up to down). In this way, new matters and skills are available to play more actions.&#10;&#10;Get victory points controlling planets and use them to get more resource gems, soldiers or skills. Recruit a huge army gives also victory points and it helps to get enemy resource from their planets. All this with only three cards in hand. Impossible? Try it out!&#10;&#10;&#10;Han pasado m&aacute;s de tres milenios desde que la humanidad abandonase su Tierra natal.  El descubrimiento de la Tr&iacute;ada Sophia ha logrado que teor&iacute;as cient&iacute;ficas imposibles de demostrar no s&oacute;lo se pudieran experimentar para vislumbrar su veracidad, sino que cada una de ellas se pudieran llevar a cabo.  Tanto si eran posibles, como si no.&#10;&#10;Dark Matter es un juego para 2 a 4 jugadores.  Cada jugador recibe al principio de la partida 3 &uacute;nicas cartas que ser&aacute;n con las que juegue toda la partida. Cada carta est&aacute; dividida en dos partes tanto por su anverso como por su reverso.  Cada una de esas partes tiene una o varias habilidades que los jugadores podr&aacute;n activar para generar materias con las que terraformar planetas, reclutar soldados para atacar los planetas enemigos, mejorar sus propios planetas, utilizar h&eacute;roes y pol&iacute;ticos para manipular sus cartas y las de los contrarios, generar recursos, etc.&#10;&#10;En su turno, cada jugador puede utilizar la habilidad de la parte superior de sus cartas que &eacute;l vea y las partes superiores de las cartas de los dem&aacute;s jugadores que vea (los anversos).  Cuando un jugador utiliza una de sus cartas, le da la vuelta en la mano, quedando la habilidad que ha utilizado a la vista de los dem&aacute;s jugadores, que podr&aacute;n usarla en sus turnos.  A la vez, si un jugador utiliza una de las cartas de sus oponentes, girar&aacute; la carta en la mano de su oponente quedando la parte superior en la inferior.&#10;&#10;Adicionalmente cada jugador puede usar las habilidades que le otorgan sus planetas terraformados y las habilidades de los dem&aacute;s planetas controlados por los oponentes, enviando a sus soldados.  Al final de la cuarta ronda de juego, el jugador con m&aacute;s puntos de victoria ser&aacute; el ganador y due&ntilde;o de la galaxia.&#10;&#10;",

Put your carefully arranged bouquets in pretty vases, place them on your shelves, and add cute little knick-knacks as a final touch. Make your shop the envy of all other florists with the most inviting display!&#10;&#10;The Little Flower Shop Dice Game, a dice-based take on The Little Flower Shop, is played over six days (rounds). In each round, players simultaneously roll five dice &mdash; 3 flower dice, 1 vase die, and 1 initiative die &mdash; then take turns based on the initiative die's result. On a turn, you must lock 1-2 dice, or pay money to lock more or none. Unlocked dice must be rerolled on the next turn. When you lock all your dice, you can take an &quot;arrangement tile&quot; that matches your dice roll and place it on a shelf (player board) in your shop. In addition to scoring points for the flowers themselves, you want to accomplish a task set out at the beginning of the game. (Six tasks are included, with only one used each game.)&#10;&#10;The player with the best display after six days wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
