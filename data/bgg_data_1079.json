    "Description": "&quot;I was in every battle, skirmish and march that was made by the First Tennessee Regiment during the war, and I do not remember of a harder contest and more evenly fought battle than that of Perryville. If it had been two men wrestling, it would have been called a 'dog fall.' Both sides claim victory&mdash;both whipped.&quot; -&thinsp;Private Sam Watkins, 1st Tennessee Infantry&#10;&#10;In September, Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi out-maneuvered Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio and invaded Kentucky. Although victorious in two battles, Bragg found his army out of position, low on supplies, and with no more than 1,000 Kentuckians joining the ranks. Buell was forced to seek out Bragg although his army was inexperienced. Outside Perryville, the two armies blundered into each other. A short but brutal battle followed that left neither side satisfied. The Union failed to utilize their numerical advantage, while Bragg withdrew from Kentucky. The result was a narrow Union victory, although Buell was removed from command and middle Tennessee was again in Confederate hands.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;This army does not retreat.&rdquo; - George Thomas when asked if the XIV Corps should retreat from Stones River&#10;&#10;The next time Bragg would face the Army of the Ohio, both opponents had new names. The Rebels dubbed their force the Army of Tennessee and the Union called theirs the XIV Corps. The Union was led by William Rosecrans, one of the war's best commanders. With offensives in Virginia and Mississippi failing, Rosecrans was pressured into making a premature winter push. At Stones River near Murfreesboro the armies fought a three day battle. The Confederates nearly won, but were forced back. The defeat relinquished some of the best farmland in Tennessee and an area that was heavily pro-Confederate. More importantly, the defeat led to a series of recriminations in the Confederate high command that poisoned the army. The Union received a desperately needed morale boost. Although forgotten today, Abraham Lincoln considered Stones River one of the North's most crucial victories.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rally 'Round the Flag!&quot; is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, flexible artillery, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Perryville (Battle in the Bluegrass) there are rules for Union high command confusion and Joseph Wheeler's cavalry screen. For Stones River (Winter of Discontent) there are rules for Cheatham being drunk and Rosecrans coming under fire. Both come with multiple scenarios, including additional forces. Players can make Perryville a grand decisive battle or at Stones River bring in additional Confederate forces that could decide the battle and the war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Game Scale: Approx. 0.25 miles/hex = approx. 440 yards/hex = approx. 402 metres/hex.  1 hour/turn.&#10;&#10;Perryville map: 10 inches by 15 inches. &#10;Stones River (Murfreesboro) map: 15 inches by 18 inches.&#10;The two maps are separate maps.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This house-building game is slightly more complex than the average roll-and-move. Each player starts with a House Plan that shows eight rooms: Living Room, Dining Room, Family Room, Kitchen, Bath, Master Bedroom, Child's Bedroom and Garage.&#10;&#10;The goal is to purchase Construction cards for each room to complete the house. Each player starts with $18,000, but this amount is a &quot;mortgage&quot; that must also be paid back in order to win.&#10;&#10;In order to build a room, a player's token must move to the Home space and draw a Construction card. This may offer a chance to build a specific room at a certain price; if the player cannot afford, does not want to pay the price, or already has built that room, his turn ends. Construction cards may also direct a player to draw and act on a card from the Risk/Option deck. Players may stay at the Home space as long as they wish and continue drawing a Construction card each turn.&#10;&#10;Since the initial mortgage is not enough to build the entire home, players must also spend time &quot;working&quot;. This involves starting from the Work space and rolling 2D6 around the board. Players earn $200 per space moved, and continue to work until they are able to reach the Home space. Board spaces have various events with bonuses and penalties dealing with home-building issues like strikes and permits. Players may also choose to play the stock market instead of moving, drawing a card from the Stock Market deck that either wins or loses money.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Extended Broadside is like a classic Battleships game on steroids. Instead of having two players placing their hidden fleets on a 10X10 grid, this one is played by four players on a huge (36&quot; across) octagonal board in which each player has a five-sided slice of 160 numbered squares.&#10;&#10;The board, vertical dividers, posts and spacers are all of wood. The ships are gorgeous metal and wood miniatures, with carriers, battleships, cruisers and liners about 6&quot; long, and destroyers and submarines about 4&quot;. Each player gets two of the large ships and one of the small ones, and may place them either orthogonally (covering 5 and 4 spaces respectively) or diagonally (covering only 4 and 3 spaces).&#10;&#10;Each player also has an island (same size as a destroyer), two minefields and an airplane. Before normal shooting starts, each player calls out the location of his island, and any island intersecting with any other player's ship(s) cause a grounding equal to a single hit, and the placing player gets a free additional shot. Then each player calls out the location of each one-space minefield: any ship on any of these squares is sunk instantly. These spaces are marked on all boards as hazards and are permanently blocked. Finally, each player gets a shot with a plane, which requires only one additional hit of any kind to sink a ship (an aerial hit on a grounded ship would sink it).&#10;&#10;Finally the regular shooting begins. Each player calls out the number of a space, and hits any ship on that space on all other players' boards. A hit grants another shot. Once all spaces occupied by a ship are hit, it sinks and is removed from play. Players may also choose to use a more powerful air or mine attack, but lose their next one or two turns for doing so. Finally, unlike any traditional game of this type, this game allows a player to move a ship to a new location instead of shooting.&#10;&#10;The game appears to have been hand-crafted, since the ships are all of slightly different sizes with a unique storage insert for each in the box. The only indication of a publisher is a coat of arms with a Greek motto on the wooden box. The use of a carrier with monoplanes suggests that it was made in the mid-1930s, shortly after the traditional Battleships game appeared under multiple titles including Broadside.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murder at Devil Pines is 90's era federal agent vs. the supernatural inspired board game, with a twist!   It comes from the mind of Zzarchov Kowolski (Pioneers of Mars, NeoClassical Geek Revival).&#10;&#10;Players take a number of actions, ordering gear, managing their investigation, or collecting clues but only have a limited number of turns to do so. The Heat is on! There's a monster on the loose, the press is closing in, and your bureau chief is demanding answers.&#10;&#10;When we first sat down to play the prototype of Murder at Devil Pines, we need we had something unique.  It's a semi-cooperative game, where agents need to race around investigating who killed the local politician, how the sacrifice was made, and ultimately, stopping whichever monster has been let loose on this poor unsuspecting town.&#10;&#10;Murder at Devil Pines is a unique cooperative social deduction game with a combination of engaging mechanics unlike anything you've ever seen.  While working with your fellow agents to solve a murder may be nothing new, the introduction of a conspiracy card means that you have a chance to be part of the summoning of a monster. While investigating, if you figure that out, it is your solemn duty to aid the monster. Will the Fallen Angel call on you for redemption, or are you already a pawn of the Vampire? Each player has six turns, shown by the heat die, to figure this out.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is straightforward.  You take an action and then move, or move and then take an action.  Actions consist of investigating, meaning picking up a green, red or blue skill die, rolling however many you've collected of that color, and then checking the reference card.  &quot;Calling it in&quot; where you help or hinder your fellow agents by announcing how, who, or what, or making a raid on a cult compound, or monster lair.&#10;&#10;Because of how easy setup is, and how quick gameplay is, this is the perfect game to share with friends.  Its an excellent game to introduce non-board game players to.  The rules are simple and clean. Action move, move action.  You pick!&#10;&#10;With the twist, there's nothing more satisfying than looking around at the other players at the board, watching their stunned faces as they realize you've pulled the wool over their eyes.  &quot;Josh, you mean, the monster was the Wendigo, and you just let it eat you so we wouldn't figure it out?&quot; Self-Sacrifice!&#10;&#10;Lastly, you can own your own crazy wall!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The next player must do the same, and the winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards.&#10;&#10;Whilst mainly luck, there is often a choice of which card to play, and therefore some element of skill. It is a quick and simple game which can be played many times with players of all ages.&#10;&#10;The cards, which are bright and colourful, are placed in front of the player so there is no problem for little ones handling the cards, and there is no scope for cheating.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players must complete five missions successfully or succumb to the mole.&#10;&#10;Set Up: Remove all 10's and jokers from the deck and make an identity deck out of the following cards: &#10;Players 2: 10, 10, Joker&#10;Players 3 or 4: 10, 10, 10, Joker&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and hand one out to each player, removing the other cards entirely from the game. The player with the Joker is the turncoat. Give five cards to each player.&#10;&#10;THE MlSSlON: The game is played over a series of missions. On a player's turn they look at the top two cards of the deck and select one to determine the mission, placing the other card face-down in the discard pile. lf a player draws a picture card (known as a spy) it is immediately discarded and a new card is drawn. Then, each player takes a card and places it face down next to the mission. When all cards have been placed, add one face-down from the deck, shuffle the cards, and reveal them. Cards matching the suit of the mission add to the team's total; other cards subtract from it. The total must be equal or higher than the value on the mission card to succeed. If any spies were placed, the mission fails.&#10;&#10;ACCUSING: At any stage a player can accuse another of being a turncoat. If they are right, the team wins. If not, the turncoat wins. If there was no turncoat, everybody loses. Otherwise, the game is won by the team if they succeed five missions, and won by the turncoat if the team loses five missions.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the designer: &quot;Werewolf (or as it is sometimes called, &quot;Mafia&quot;) was always a fantastic game for me, and one I played a lot in my early university years. It is a game of two teams, but of unknown identities. It is an interesting mix of old and new design concepts; the heated discussion and bluffing generated by Werewolf is very modem; whereas the player elimination and sitting around is becoming ever more rare with each new design. One immensely popular (but lengthy) board game involving traitors is Battlestar Galactica, by Corey Konieczka. It sets players on a spaceship, trying to collectively ward off dangers, which would be easier, were it not for the traitor in the midst. I have extracted the game's clever system of sabotage-by-card, and came up with Turncoat.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

As the captain of one of his ships, you must get your crew home to Ithaca, but complete a series of missions on the way home, whilst the Gods will Bless and Curse your ship.&#10;&#10;Will you make it home wealthy, will you make it home at all?&#10;&#10;&#10;Voyage home is an adventure game where you must sail your ship home after completing a series of quests!  The other players are also trying to do the same thing, but each player will also play the part of the GODS.  Some of the Gods are out to destroy enemy ships whilst other GODS are out to help your ship! Some Blessings, Curses and other effect spells are working in great combination with each other to help you complete the game before everyone else!&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay Detail - The game is divided into two ACTS.  ACT I is the main part of the game, ACT II is the end game, which may not involve all of the players.ACT I has X amount of turns, which is dictated by 10 &quot;oversized&quot; cards that are on display at all times on the table, they are randomly sorted before the game starts so that only one is visible at a time.   Once all the &quot;oversized&quot; cards have been exhausted then the game goes to ACT II which is a sudden death ending to the game.&#10;&#10;Phase 1 is made up of a card draw phase where players can choose to draw cards from the GODS deck (which makes up their hand during the game which allows the players to also play the part of the Gods themselves, they can play blessings and curses as well as effect cards that effect either other players ships, their own ships, other players, areas on the map or the general gameplay state (called Global effects).  Phase one usually takes around 20 seconds.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is the Card playing phase where each player will choose which cards they want to play and then play them.  There is a special order that cards are played in and a player order so players must all choose which cards they're playing first for that turn before all the cards are revealed.  During this phase any and all cards that are played will also be resolved if possible.  It's good to make up combos of cards in your hand, and then play them all at once, so that you can propel your ship more quickly through the quests. This is the most lengthy phase of the game.  Some players may have larger hand sizes and will take some time to work out what they're going to play, and once cards have been played they need to be actioned.  This could take 3 or 4 minutes per player to work through, depending on how experienced players are at the game and how many players there actually are.&#10;&#10;Phase 3 is the movement phase where you will each roll your dice and move your ship across the map.  You need to complete all 6 quests before you can head back to Ithaca.  It doesn't necesarrily have to be ACT II for you to be travelling home to Ithaca if you have been so successful to have completed everything before then.  However, it's quite unlikely that you'd be heading back so soon, considering the temperament of the Gods after all.  Movement is important as other players can't land on the same spot as you, and ports can only be visited by two ships at once.  Player order plays a reasonable role on how effective your movement phase is going to be, as does your dice roll.  You can skip your movement phase to instead draw off a SHIP deck (another deck of cards) which enables you to upgrade your ship to enhance your ability in some aspect or another. Although movement itself is done in player order, it shouldn't take more than a minutes for each player to work out where to move their ship to once they've rolled their movement dice.&#10;&#10;Phase 4 is cleanup.  You will remove one of the &quot;oversized&quot; cards if required (which reduces the length of the game, you will also perform any other cleanup actions (some cards require you to perform actions during this phase.  Then the player 1 ICON is rotated clockwise, so each players number order changes for the next turn.  This phase isn't very complex and is usually over in a minute or so.  It usually just involved an oversize card being removed and all the cards that got played this turn being discarded to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Quests and finishing the game:  Each ship must complete all 6 quests before being able to return to Ithaca.  Each ship must closely monitor it's supplies (which keep the crew well fed!) and crew number as well as its riches (GOLD!) as this may become very important as you endeavor to finish the game before time runs out!&#10;&#10;To win you must be one of the players who made it back for starters!  If players have not completed all 6 quests when ACT I ends, then they're lost at sea and take no further part in the game.  There is some sudden death rules that effect the remaining players but as long as you make it back you have a chance to win! The amount of crew is the first factor in deciding a winner, whilst Gold is the secondary factor, but usually a winner is obvious!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Corporate Times is a financially themed strategic game. The game mechanics are a combination of worker placement and resource management, with a high level of player agency and involvement.   The game gives a unique, behind-the-scenes glimpse of the business world that affects us all by revealing the powers that drive the markets and the whole economy. A dominant element of the business world is buying and selling stocks and assets, but the politic forces, the media and the banks will make this world much more challenging to navigate.&#10;&#10;Corporate Times provides a deep yet easy-to-understand, entertaining insight of the modern business world and the powers which control it: politics, the media, and the banks. The media controls the news and decides on the agenda, including what to promote and what to hide from the public. Politics can strengthen the influence of your corporation on the economy. The Banks oversee the monetary flow and transactions and controlling them allows better funding options. Each player builds his/her own corporation, navigating through the economy&rsquo;s rules, and dealing with the 3 forces. The players need to use their assets, money and influence for one goal &ndash; to take over the economy.&#10;&#10;Your purpose is to dominate the nation's economy by accumulating 20 influence points. The board game simulates the economy of the state, divided into 11 different markets. Each market is constructed of a few market shares, open for investments by the players&rsquo; corporation. The participants set up a mega corporation that will attempt to dominate the state economy. Points are accumulated by the purchase of market shares and the use of news cards. Every market share has a value in influence points and income and can be purchased in cash by a bank loan, in a bidding war or by striking a deal between players. News cards are opened at the beginning of every turn and influence the game strategy.&#10;&#10;The income and the influence points score of each player are marked on score tracks on the game board. After the purchase of a market share, the player will advance on these tracks according to the income and influence points attributed to the specific share. The news cards also have direct influence on the income and might inforce you to change your immediate investment plans and long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are a master criminal looking to earn bragging rights at the annual Thieves' Market by bringing the rarest and most valuable wares for your discerning customers. All sales are final, but you may find items you worked hard to obtain being sold in another rogue's display! You'll have to find the right balance between choosing items to add to your own display and sabotaging what your rivals stole fair and square!&#10;&#10;Thieves' Market is a drafting microgame for 2 to 4 players. Each player is a world-class thief who will be attending an underground international auction. The sneak who brings the best goods earns bragging rights for the year. First, they'll be choosing their targets and building their collection. Afterwards, the auction provides them the opportunity to ply their trade against one another.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a hand of potential targets for them to rob. All players select a card, and at the same time they decide whether to put that card into their Display or their Stash. Cards in the display are face-up on the table and are worth the value in the top right corner. Cards in the Stash can be used for the action on the card later on. After players have allocated their cards, they pass their hands around the table and repeat this process until there are no more cards.&#10;&#10;After drafting, everybody has the chance to use the cards in their stash to affect the outcome. Players will go around the table stealing, breaking, or switching out items in an effort to be victorious. Card effects range from very strong to practically useless, but so do their value in your display. Figuring out the best cards and whether they belong in your display or in your stash will determine the outcome.&#10;&#10;Once both phases are complete, players will add up the value of their display and any relevant set bonuses. The player with the best display wins the round and is the most lauded at this year's auction.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Conviction is a political satire card game where players deliver sweet judicial justice to Trump, his cronies, and other political characters. The game allows you and your friends to take matters into your own hands as prosecutors putting a wide variety of public figures on trial &ndash; from Ivanka and Jared to Betsy DeVos and Paul Ryan &ndash; in front of Lady Justice.&#10;&#10;Over the course of four years (rounds), prosecutors take turns rolling the dice to put a Public Figure on trial. Rolling anything but doubles will convict the Public Figure and add them to that prosecutor's conviction pile. But if you do roll doubles, the Public Figure is acquitted and placed under the protection of Lady Justice. Each Public Figure has a point value &ndash; the more notorious they are, the more points they&rsquo;re worth. Trump and his inner circle, family, and comrades are the most valuable convictions; if you somehow convict a Public Figure not associated with Trump (e.g. Elizabeth Warren or the Muslim American), it&rsquo;ll cost you points. Whoever has the most points at the end wins the game and saves America!&#10;&#10;Motion cards add an element of chance and strategy to the game, allowing prosecutors to manipulate the order of the trials or affect the proceedings in other specific ways. The names and illustrations for each Motion offer a tongue-in-cheek take on moments ripped from the headlines, referencing everything from &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; to Trump&rsquo;s promise to &ldquo;drain the swamp.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;    * Guillotine - Conviction&rsquo;s theme is based on the United States political environment. Similar general card mechanics, though many new specific card effects have been invented. Conviction also introduced dice for randomness in trials to mirror reality. Game art is educational and humorous.&#10;    * Family Business - Both Conviction and Family Business are fast-paced card games, combining a shared play-area of character targets with an additional deck where players can manipulate proceedings as they jostle for advantages. However, Family Business is an elimination game instead of being points-based and Conviction does not contain any &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo;-style mechanics. Of course, both games feature a cast who&rsquo;d be better off in prison.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BELLA CONTRA BARBAROS covers the period of Rome's wars with the barbarians from 100 BC to 100 AD; from the reforms of Marius to the Dacian War of Trajan.&#10;&#10;Basically, there are two contrasting systems of organisation and tactics and command and control&#10;Firstly the Romans - who are regulated and disciplined - good order is important to their manoeuvre and success in battle. This is the Roman army's great strength.&#10;The barbarians on the other hand - their warbands and cavalry are less-controllable but faster and rather more fluid in their battlefield movements. The barbarians' main strengths are their impetuous attacks and surprise in ambushes.&#10;&#10;Combat Resolution&#10;An adaption of my Grand Manoeuvre Napoleonic set, the combat rules are not dice-heavy; the modifiers that most game systems use (for flank attacks, disorder, and other tactical advantages) are significant points in determining the combat results and instead it is the dice rolls that modify the outcomes. Generally, the die roll itself plays a less of an important part in determining combat results; usually it only adds one point in the combat calculation unless the combat element has impetus and then two dice are used.&#10;&#10;Stratagem Cards&#10;There are some interesting ancient period flavours in this optional rule.&#10;These cards will provide some challenges for players to deal with.&#10;The cards include many of the stratagems mentioned by Frontinus and Polyeanus. There are 34 tactical ploys and stratagems. The cards can be selected by players, or picked randomly in the game set up phase for use in deployment or for use during the game itself.&#10;&#10;Inspirational Pre-Battle Speeches&#10;A chance to deliver a rousing address to the troops before battle to encourage them to fight well&hellip; perhaps their morale is shaky and needs to be boosted?&#10;Another optional rule which adds period flavour; a pre-battle speech may give the player's forces some combat or morale advantages.&#10;&#10;Heroic Death Rules&#10;Added to the mix (and only if things are going badly for the player) is the possibility of a heroic death for both barbarians and Romans &ndash; the Roman version of this being called the &ldquo;devotio&rdquo;.&#10;We may reflect that Boudicca is better known than Gaius Seutonius Paulinus.&#10;Everyone knows the name of Spartacus, but only the rather more keen, historical wargamer would know who Marcus Licinius Crassus was, or of his ultimate fate.&#10;This option gives the Barbarian player (who must be a tribal king, or a commander in chief) a chance to &quot;win&quot; on his, or her own terms even though in fact their armies will be defeated and the cause of the rebellion is lost.&#10;&#10;Scenario Booklet&#10;There are eight historical battle scenarios from Rome's wars and campaigns against the barbarians; each has an introduction, umpires notes, player briefings and victory conditions, terrain generation rules and army lists.&#10;&#10;The eight battles in the booklet are:&#10;Vercellae 101 BC - Marius` great victory over the Cimbri.&#10;Mutina 72 BC - Spartacus defeats the Governor of Cisalpine Gaul.&#10;Histria 61 BC - Burebista defeats &quot;The Monster&quot;, Gaius Antonius.&#10;Sabis River 56 BC - Caesar verses three Belgian tribes.&#10;Arbalo 11 BC - Drusus ambushed by the Sicambri.&#10;Volcaean Marshes 7 AD - The Batos unite against the Romans.&#10;Mons Graupius 83 AD - Agricola marches against the Caledonians.&#10;The First Battle of Tapae 86 AD - Decebalus` Victory.&#10;&#10;Historical and Points based Army Lists&#10;Extensive Army Lists for most of wars and campaigns with Barbarians in the period are provided hopefully these will produce historical and balanced armies. In addition, I have made points-based army lists for Romans and Barbarians.&#10;&#10;Battlefield Terrain Generation Rule Booklet&#10;This booklet has specific terrain rules for each theatre of the major wars with the barbarians.&#10;&#10;QRB`s&#10;You can play these rules with various scale figures. Three versions of a six-page Quick Reference Booklet are supplied for use with 30, 40 &amp; 60mm base widths - players are advised to use the closest one in size to their own particular basing.&#10;&#10;Game Markers are supplied&#10;Game marker files for hits, order and formations are supplied - players only need to print, fold, cut and glue or laminate them. Also provided are cards to remind players about the inspirational pre-battle speech effects. And to assist players some simple orders cards that may be hand-held or placed on table.&#10;&#10;Campaigns&#10;Victory conditions are suggested according to scenario or campaign conditions and there are also recommendations for dealing with post-battle pursuits, and fluctuating morale in campaigns.&#10;&#10;The Rule Book&#10;111 pages, with 66 colour photos and images illustrating the rules, a glossary of game and historical terms and an index.&#10;Black and white copies of rules &amp; quick-reference booklets are provided.&#10;&#10;-from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Exploring space. Grow your wealth. Become the richest.&#10;&#10;In Star Pioneer you play intrepid pioneers seeking out new riches in the great expanse of unknown space.&#10;&#10;You will explore new regions, trade with newly discovered inhabited worlds, search for mineral deposits and manufacture super commodities from strange new materials.&#10;&#10;With some luck and careful strategy you will be become the richest pioneer in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The Basics&#10;&#10;You start with 100,000 Galactic Dollars (GD) and your rocket on a map card. As you play you will lay down new map cards expanding the playing area. Most map cards will provide a new opportunity to earn money and you'll get some money just for exploring.&#10;&#10;Planet map cards will let you trade one of 3 commodities; water, food and ore. By buying at planets where the price is low and selling at planets where the price is high you'll make a profit. Easy! But be warned that the prices are not fixed. When any player buys or sells, the price will go up or down due to demand. Additionally, prices have a chance to fluctuate on their own, this can happen locally on a single planet or galactically for a single resource. A good trade route won't stay open for long, but without risk there is no reward.&#10;&#10;Planets also have resource points that let you buy resource cards. These are expensive long-term investments as you'll need two or more before you can make a profit from them. There are also only a limited number of resource points, so make sure you get them before your fellow players. The investment can be worth it as a good hand of 3 or 4 resource cards can win you the game.&#10;&#10;Mineral Deposit map cards offer good earning opportunities for those feeling lucky. The smaller mineral lodes are easier to find than the big ones. You could spend several turns just floating in space looking at rocks before hitting the mother lode.&#10;&#10;The player who reaches 1,000,000 Galactic Dollars first wins, so don't spare the rocket fuel and get earning if you want to be the best Star Pioneer!&#10;&#10;(Rules Summary)&#10;&#10;There are 24 hexagonal map cards, each divided into three lozenge-shaped movement spaces. There are 2 blanks, 4 wormholes, 8 planets, and 10 mineral deposits. In a four-player game, the starting map consists of two side-by-side planet cards.&#10;&#10;The three Commodities on each planet (Ore (red), Food (green), and Water (blue)) have prices indicated by a correspondingly coloured die (1 to 6), in units of 10,000 GD. Additionally, each planet (except the starting one(s)) have D3 Resource Points (yellow), indicated by Resource tokens.&#10;&#10;On a player turn, they first roll two dice. If the total is 7, reroll the Commodity prices of the closest planet(s). If a double was rolled, there is a 'Galactic Crash' of a specific Commodity (1-2 Ore, 3-4 Food, 5-6 Water). Reroll the Commodity price of the affected commodity on all planets.&#10;&#10;Next, the player moves their ship, up to 3 spaces. Wormhole spaces are connected to all the other Wormholes on the map. If they explore (move off the map), they draw and place a map card, oriented as they wish. This earns the player 10,000 GD.&#10;&#10;Finally, the player can perform one action (out of 3 possible ones).&#10;&#10;The player could Prospect if on a Mineral Deposit space. These are rated from 1 to 5. When Prospecting, the player must roll greater than that number to find the mineral deposit. If unsuccessful, nothing happens. Otherwise, the player earns 50,000 GD times the Mineral Deposit's size, and the Deposit is marked as exhausted (black token).&#10;&#10;The player could Trade if on a planet. A player's ship can carry up to 3 Commodity tokens. If the Commodity price is 2 or less, the player can only buy. Once the player has bought or sold, the price is adjusted. If the player sold, the price goes down 1 (but no lower than 3); if they bought, the price goes up 1 (but no higher than 6).&#10;&#10;Finally, the player could buy a Resource Card if on a planet with remaining Resource tokens. The player pays 50,000 GD, removes one Resource token, and draws a Resource Card. You can only buy one at a time.&#10;&#10;Resource cards are used to make Super Commodities. At any time during their turn, a player can reveal 2 or more Resource Cards to produce a Super Commodity. Its value is the sum of the base numbers on the cards multiplied by the highest multiplier on the cards. The Resource Cards are then discarded.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

If someone's ribbon gets tangled, they'll be out of the running!&#10;&#10;Sewing Circle is a game for 2 or 3 players. Your goal is to be the player who avoids tangling their ribbon. 12 cards are placed onto the table in a circle, with the 6 remaining cards being divided evenly among the players. Each player decides which color ribbon will represent them, and the first player to choose will go first.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple- keep your line unbroken. If your turn ends and your line is broken, you lose. Every turn you must flip a card in the circle face-up, then you may swap a face up-card with its neighbor, and then you may exchange any face-up card with a card in your hand.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you'll have to plan your moves so that while untangling your ribbon you tangle your opponents' ribbon as well. Causing multiple tangles means they'll have to spend their turn dealing with them and can limit their options in tangling things up for you. Choosing the best cards to flip on your turn and making sure the cards in your hands have different lines on them can be important as well. If you can plan multiple steps ahead you can improve your chances even more.&#10;&#10;Sewing circle also includes a solo/cooperative mode, where players must keep all three ribbons from getting tangled. If any ribbon is tangled at the end of any player's turn they all lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Containing three copies each of twenty new cards, this pack immerses you in the world of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. As the story progresses into the pages of A Dance with Dragons, those who would play the game of thrones find themselves helplessly surrounded by enemies. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister struggles to hold onto power as the Tyrells and the Faith of the Seven split the loyalties of the capital's citizens. At the Wall, Jon Snow takes the role of Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but has trouble balancing the demands of duty with those of morality. Finally, In Essos, Daenerys Targaryen has become the queen of Meereen, only to discover that the realities of rule differ greatly from expectations.&#10;&#10;The Dance of Shadows cycle reintroduces the player-favorite Shadow mechanism from A Game of Thrones: The Card Game First Edition. This mechanism increases the tension of your encounters, keeping games steeped in mystery and a constant fear of the unknown. As the sun sets on Westeros, you must decide how much of yourself you are willing to sacrifice in order for your plots to come to fruition.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Apex K-Truck Racer is a resource allocation competitive racing board game in which two to six players take on the role of truck drivers who guide their vehicles, fueled by kinetic power cubes, on smuggling missions through the abandoned streets and roads of the old world. The K-trucker who earns more reputation points throughout the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Thematically, the game begins immediately after the players have successfully stolen from a Corporation Conglomerate, collecting some cargo and a bit of information that reveals secret warehouses along the escape route, where more resources are hidden. Each game represents a smuggling run from point A, the Conglomerate gates, to point B, the agreed-upon Drop Spot.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds in which each player takes actions to manage the allocation of K-Cubes on different areas of the truck to add speed, power-up its guns or to activate the drone sidekick that improves the vehicle. By doing this, truckers create unique strategies to achieve different goals during the mission, which reward them with prestige among their peers and employers.&#10;&#10;Players must be quick because the Corporation is hunting down the smugglers to recover its resources. Players must also keep an eye out for the other Truckers, who will try everything they can to collect additional cargo and get to the destination first, even if that means shooting down another truck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;AWARDS &amp; HONORS&#10;&#10;2018 - Luso Design Awards (Portugal) - Product Design - Bronze&#10;2018 - Luso Design Awards (Portugal) - Product Art - Bronze&#10;2018 - Catarse Board Game Prototype Contest (Brazil) - Top 5&#10;2018 - The Game Crafter&acute;s Board Game Rules Sanity Test - 66/80.&#10;2020 - The Game Crafter&acute;s Board Game Rules Sanity Test - 77/80. &#10;       &quot;Trucker combat race game has easy to follow rules and looks like it can carry a heavy load of fun.&quot; (Gamecrafter, June 2020)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This set features new ordnance for use with Global War -2nd edition. This set introduces a new concept to Global War &ndash; the idea that players can spend IPPs for advanced ordnance they expend to improve their outcomes. Ordnance can improve combat values, grant the ability to select targets and in some cases give units abilities they don&rsquo;t have, like being able to hunt IPPs on convoy lines.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
