All fifteen checkers were used, except the starting position is different than in backgammon - each player places two checkers on their first point and thirteen checkers on the  sixth point from the opponent's side of the board. The object of the game is to be the first player to move all of your pieces off the board. However, there is a sudden death rule: if a player throws a number on a die which cannot be played, that player immediately loses. The three dice could be combined for a single move or used separately for three different moves.&#10;&#10;",

The 50 Problem Cards and the possible impact that facing these dangers have on the expeditionary teams&rsquo; successful progress through the pyramid, took three years of research alone. As the players will discover, archeological expeditions into pyramids encountered many physical and emotional challenges as the result of the sadistic mind of the pyramid builder, who incorporated deadly traps in order to frustrate and confuse grave robbers.&#10;&#10;Three groups are created, each with two competing archeological teams (approximately five players per team). The teams progress through the pyramid by correctly answering Question Cards, selecting a Passage Progress Card and collecting Hieroglyphic Cards, each with a hieroglyphic symbol and the translation of that symbol. Although most of the symbols were created to resemble actual hieroglyphics, the simulated experiences encountered as the players collect, piece together, and correctly translate a real message from a hieroglyphic tablet, is authentic.&#10;&#10;The goal of the two competing archeological teams is to travel to each of the three chambers; the Pharaoh&rsquo;s Burial Chamber, the Queen&rsquo;s Burial Chamber and the Great Hall. As each chamber is entered, a piece or several pieces of a Hieroglyphic Tablet is/are discovered. Using the Hieroglyphic Cards accumulated, the team that can correctly piece together and translate the Mummy's Message wins the simulation game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As described by Dr. Scott Simmerman, the publisher:&#10;&#10;Lost Dutchman is a well-designed team building game that focuses on collaboration, leadership and engagement. It is designed to be facilitated by a trainer or consultant interested in generating discussions about the organizational culture and framed around desired outcomes. It comes with extensive debriefing ideas. It is a business simulation but useful for schools and other organizations looking to improve collaboration.&#10;&#10;It is normally played with 5 / 6 people on a team, with 3 to a 100+ teams. It can play with as few as 6 people but the design works much better with 12 or more. It is proven to scale up really well for large group events of 150 to 250 or more people.&#10;&#10;Dutchman is designed for large team building / strategic planning events but works well for small group classroom training situations. We sell versions for different size groups.&#10;&#10;The Design:&#10;&#10;The challenge is to collaborate, rather than to compete, and to share resources and do sufficient planning to optimize overall results. The reality is that teams often choose to compete, thus making choices that sub-optimize results.&#10;&#10;Components include a colorful map, a Grub Stake of resource cards, planning tools, job aids and other information about the game and the goals. Putting on cowboy hats and bandannas, the group settles in to briefly hear the history of the Lost Dutchman's Mine and to learn the mechanics of the challenge.&#10;&#10;The team is given 20 days of 2 minutes each to manage their journey to the mine and back home to Apache Junction. They can choose from 3 paths with different risks, planning for weather changes and focusing on the optimal use of resources. Teams are given the opportunity to gain additional information valuable to their journey's success but must decide if they are willing to delay their start by one or two days in order to obtain this information. After being given the introductory information, the team has 15 minutes to plan. They must work together to make decisions about tactics, resource management, direction and risk.&#10;&#10;The 20 days of play (roughly 35 minutes) begin and are marked by lots of lively interaction among players and teams in the spirit of collaboration and competition. During this time, they'll discover the impact of their early decisions on their results. They can choose to get advice or collaborate with others.&#10;&#10;The goal is to get to the mine, mine as much gold as WE can, and return to Apache Junction. All teams are successful, but the ones that plan and collaborate will optimize their results. Debriefing can focus on collaboration, planning, leadership, motivation, optimization of organizational performance results and many other themes.&#10;&#10;",

Players draw colored cards that determine what square s/he will go to next. Some special cards allow you to skip ahead, go to a certain part of the board, or force you to go backwards on the path. The winner is the first player to reach the tree of life.&#10;&#10;From the publisher: Around 600 BC there lived a prophet named Lehi. Lehi dreamed about a straight and narrow path that led to the Tree of Life. In the center of the path was the Ironrod. By clinging to the Ironrod and pressing forward, one could reach the Tree of Life. Along the path, one must be very careful not to slip away and get trapped in the Mist of Darkness, the River of Water, or the Great and Spacious Building. The consequence for slipping away would cause a prolonged arrival to the Tree of Life. In order to win the game, one must reach Lehi and the Tree of Life by taking the shortest path. The surest way to reach the Tree of Life first is to stay on the path and follow the Ironrod.&#10;&#10;",

This is a simple connection game for 2 players only (though the rules say 2 to 4).&#10;&#10;Try to connect your two sides of the board using the tiles with various curved paths on them.&#10;&#10;The game has two phases. In the first phase, players take turns laying tiles with just two curves on them. These are either Y shaped forks, or two bends around opposite corners. If you let your opponent complete their path in this phase, you're doing very badly.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, players start over-laying the 2 curve tiles with 3 curve tiles. This makes it much easier to complete a path. When one player does so, the other still has a chance to lay a 3 curve to disrupt the path. But 3 curves only go onto 2 curves. So by clever placement, you can force yourself into a path with two solutions, so your opponent cannot block both at once.&#10;&#10;It's a remarkably simple design, but seems wide open with possible techniques. Tiles can always be placed in any orientation. The clever part is that a valid path cannot follow an oblique turn. You go round bends like a train on tracks. So by placing a fork in the correct way, I can improve my path but block yours. But when you get to lay 3 curves, you can undo the damage.&#10;&#10;NOTE: There are no Versions listed under this Game entry, as this is played with the components of Down Under. The Versions are therefore listed under that Game entry.&#10;&#10;",

All types of low-level fighting are covered; minor battles, ambushes, raids, prison-breaks, cattle rustling and the storming of forts!&#10;&#10;The basic unit of the game is the squadron, which is composed of somewhere between 25-50 men. These are often the size of weak companies, but we use the term company to cover the next administrative level, composed of several squadrons, somewhere between 150-250 men. Each company has a Captain, who has great influence on his men. The overall commander of a side is called a Colonel.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve tried to portray just about every troop type in Europe in these rules, from Irish Kern to Spanish Musketeers. One of our favorite elements of this game is its expandability and &quot;accessable chrome&quot;. Anyone can add their favorite forgotten troop type, from Cimaroon to Lap scouts riding Reindeer!&#10;&#10;",

The game board features 5 lines of 26 dots on each line.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponent's men. Players use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on any given turn. With each spin, the player can move any of his five pieces. In order to capture an opposing piece, a player must spin and land by exact count on the opposing piece on that line. There is a &quot;shell hole&quot; on each line that offers safety from capture.&#10;&#10;Capturing a piece closes that line, and the capturing player can then place his free piece on any other still open line, increasing the opportunities to spin the exact number needed to capture another enemy piece on that line. The first player to capture all of the opposing pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Travelling is done by rolling the dice. If a player reaches one of his targets he has to read the text of the card and follow its instructions that usually favour far away locations and add handicaps to near locations.&#10;&#10;Beside the normal movement there exist two special movements: one clockwise around the map by travelling by bus and one counter clockwise by travelling by 'Pl&auml;tte' (tourist ships that were used for shipping salt along the river in former times.) The special movements normally increase your travel speed but add the risc of too far movements.&#10;&#10;After a player has reached all his targets he has to move to the castle of Burghausen (the longest in Europe or probably in the world) in the middle of the game map. There he has to roll the dice for each of the six castle wards. The first player to reach the most inner ward wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Isabelle &amp; Isabeau takes us back to the Mediaeval days when knights were bold and princesses charming! Bit like &quot;families&quot;, but the dice make the difference.&#10;&#10;Basic Rules:&#10;&#10;In this game, you try to win as if you were playing a game of &quot;pure&quot; families - indeed you need to build two families of six similar cards to win. But the dice make things interesting.&#10;&#10;There are 3 of them: the first is a Character die that denotes either you or one of your opponents, and the other two are Action dice. Typical actions are: draw a card, place a card, discard a card, steal a card from an opponent, swap hands with an opponent, roll again etc etc.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn you roll the dice. You will perform one of the actions on the Action dice, knowing that the other one must be carried out by the person shown on the Character die. You choose who is going to do what, and in what order.&#10;&#10;Isabelle &amp; Isabeau game doesn't require any grand strategies, but the game mechanism conjures up some interesting combinations.&#10;You may discard most of your hand only to swap it immediately with another player. You may may need to choose between the lesser of two evils yourself. Memory plays an important role: knowing who has which cards in their hand can be vital. And jokers and &quot;veto&quot; cards add some extra twists and turns.&#10;&#10;In short, this is a quick, fun game with lots of &quot;mediaeval&quot; illustrations. Oh, and did you get the pun in the title? No? Time to brush up on your French grammar, then...&#10;Isabelle and Isabeau has just been released in mainland Europe, and will be available shortly in the UK.

Even the rule sheet is presented as a &quot;Prescription Form,&quot; which notes Refill: PRN (As needed for fun).&#10;&#10;Per the rules: &quot;Each player acts as a resident physician. (A resident physician is a doctor who is undergoing specialty training following medical school.)&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player is given 10 patient cards [which] represent the patients that the player must try to discharge during the course of the game. One patient is discharged each time a question is answered correctly.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first player to discharge all his/her patients wins.&#10;&#10;As per the Trivial Pursuit model, there are color-coded spaces on the board that correspond to question categories. The 4 categories are:&#10;Green-History and Personalities&#10;Yellow-General Medicine&#10;Red-Anatomy &amp; Surgery; Public Health; Preventative Medicine&#10;Blue-Nutrition &amp; Exercise.&#10;&#10;In addition, other spaces offer exceptions to the color code system and present players with alternative Bonus and Risk cards that can modify their position on the board or choice of question categories.&#10;&#10;The rules conclude with a directive [keeping with the prescription pad theme] for &quot;NO GENERIC SUBSTITUTIONS&quot; and &quot;Keep within reach of inquisitive teenagers &amp; adults.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is followed with a fairly substantial disclaimer that though this game is based on reputable sources, one should turn to Dr. Arnvie for advice on medical treatment or conditions but should, instead, consult your regular medical provider.&#10;&#10;",

Either have the fewest robbers in your hand and the most points on the table once the final house has been built &ndash; or reveal 5 Robbers at once from your hand, and you have won. Danger City takes its inspiration from so-called &ldquo;Gated Communities&rdquo; that one may find in plush suburbs of North American (or English?) cities, and the idea that you must either be a very paranoid person to live in one, or have very good reason to want to protect yourself from someone!&#10;&#10;We are taken to an idyllic neighbourhood that is in full-blown development &ndash; houses are being built, as well as parks, amenities, services and the like.  But somewhere things go wrong: a gang of robbers have arrived. The neighbourhood takes decisive action and starts to install surveillance systems, to thwart their enemies. But who will win out?&#10;&#10;Basic Rules&#10;&#10;Players take turns in building the neighbourhood, by playing Neighbourhood cards from their hand onto the table. Each card has a specific value &ndash; a Garage is worth 5 points while a Golf Course is worth 15. Cards circulate round the player from player to player: you draw or play a card and then pass one on face down. Lurking in their midst are a rabble of robbers. Chances are you either want to collect them or get rid of them, but you cannot play them like Neighbourhood cards. If you collect 5 of them, you can reveal them all at once from your hand and win. You have &ldquo;sided with the robbers!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Otherwise the game ends when a specific number of House cards have been played &ndash; twice the number of players. At that point the game stops and the player with the FEWEST robbers in their hand wins. If there is a tie, then Neighbourhood points come into play &ndash; whoever has played down the most points wins.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s pretty much it!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A miniatures rules system designed to recreate garrison warfare in the English Midlands during the English Civil War.&#10;&#10;&quot;What we wanted to do in Tinker Fox was to drop you into the boots of a Governor of a district in the English Civil War. A Governor does more than fight battles. He must first and foremost follow his masters&rsquo; orders. They are usually vague, and it is up to him to come up with a plan to implement them. He must then try to get his subordinates to carry out his detailed instructions. Unfortunately they often have their own agendas and personalities that he must deal with. He must also run an extensive civil government, which is not directly simulated, but is represented by delays and obstructions they naturally cause to military matters.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tinker Fox will generate numerous and varied types of battles with whatever troops are present in the campaign. These can be replayed using our new Very Civile Actions! cards now available as a variant for Spanish Fury, Actions! Let the games begin!&quot;&#10;&#10;The components consist of a rulebook, quick reference data sheet, unit control sheet, mapsheet and a set of counters.&#10;&#10;",

You can use this in conjunction with our miniature rules sets (Ironbow, Spanish Fury, Actions! and Spanish Fury, Battle! or Pistolado!) or with any other set you might own (for those of you who dare to touch a non-Perfect Captain product&hellip;you know who you are!). This set can be used in a variety of ways, some of which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll develop yourselves - and if you do develop something, don&rsquo;t forget to write it up for our Yahoo group, and share it with us all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The cards included with this campaign generator can be used to simulate most areas of Western Europe from the Pyrenees to the edge of the Eurasian Steppes, and from the Alps to Scandanavia.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Battlefinder! components include a rulebook, a mapsheet, terrain cards and a set of counters.&#10;&#10;Like all games from The Perfect Captain, Battlefinder is available for free download to print and play.
