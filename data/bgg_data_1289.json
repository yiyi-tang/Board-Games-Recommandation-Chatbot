    "Description": "This is a game where you work together with your friends to escape from a city full of zombies!&#10;&#10;In this game, you and your friends have a limited amount of time to escape from a city full of zombies caused by the ancient virus &quot;Kishii&quot;.&#10;There are many dangerous zombies in the city, and you have to explore the city to find the items you need to escape. In addition, the virus is spreading in the city, so you have to hurry or you will get infected too.&#10;Even if you don't have strong weapons, work with your friends and you'll get everyone out!&#10;&#10;Basic how to play :&#10;Each player chooses a character.&#10;Set all the cards face down in the middle of the table.&#10;On each round :&#10;- every player reveals a card from the center : take the items and leave the zombies in the middle of the table.&#10;- each player may then exchange items, use their character's special skill or use items to defeat the zombies.&#10;- when players are done with their actions, if there is one or more zombie remaining face up on the table, one of the players become a zombie (he now counts as a zombie and will attack other players on future turns)&#10;If the players manage to get four special items (the map, radio, car and fuel) before the end of the 5th round, they escape the city and win the game. Their score then depends on the number of characters (NPC included) they could save.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#231;&#181;&#140;&#232;&#161;&#176;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#143;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#140;Kishii&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#186;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#128;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#230;&#159;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;Kishii&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#132;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&

Players then take turns to identify by guesswork, deduction, or telepathy the cards held by the other players. If correct, this card is placed facedown on its corresponding square in the board.

There are also some wild cards and blank cards.&#10;&#10;The game starts with each player having five cards and two on the table. On their turn a player must add a single card to the table to form a new word. Cards can be played before, after, in between, or on top of the current cards. Blank cards can be played on top of letters to effectively erase them.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play they draw until they can.&#10;&#10;The object is to either play all your cards or force the other players to have at least ten. The game is normally played in multiple rounds with scoring.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On August 3rd, 1914, Germany declared war on France. German armies poured into France and Belgium. Britain protested, then declared war on Germany on August 4th. The famous British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France and marched into Belgium on August 21st. They halted on the Cond&eacute; Canal at Mons to defend against what they thought was a small German force to their north. Once that was brushed aside, they planned to turn east and roll up the German flank. However, they actually faced the entire German 1. Armee. The next morning, in a thick mist, German cavalry patrols stumbled into outlying British pickets. So began the long fight between the British and Germans in The Great War.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Mons (August 23rd-24th, 1914) looms large in the legends of the British Army. Here the plucky BEF with their &ldquo;rifle fire like machine guns&rdquo; gave the dastardly Germans a bloody nose, or so the story goes. The Germans for their part were well satisfied. In their view, they met the &ldquo;English,&rdquo; pushed them back, then chased them all the way to the Marne. Which view is correct?&#10;&#10;Mons had surprises for both armies. They expected a battle like in The Boer War or the Franco-Prussian War. Mons did have maneuver and even cavalry charges, but hard lessons were learned.&#10;&#10;Mons, 1914: The Mad Minute is the second game in the Rifle and Spade Series, first used in Gallipoli, 1915: Churchill&rsquo;s Greatest Gamble. The series rules have been completely overhauled to speed play and ease learning. Key charts have been simplified and rules that were rarely used have been dropped, resulting in faster and smoother games. Gallipoli can be played with the 2.0 rules with some short upgrade instructions and a few replacement charts.&#10;&#10;Mons is a big game. Two maps show the length of the Cond&eacute; Canal. The 1,500 counters have every unit from the BEF and the German 1. Armee. Units are half-battalions and batteries with some platoon pickets. Mons has many scenarios: three training scenarios, the full two-map historical scenario, several smaller one-map scenarios, and a set of very interesting hypothetical meeting engagements. In the meeting engagement scenarios, the armies enter gradually, led by their cavalry divisions. A wild period of maneuver follows as the cavalry and j&auml;gers attempt to sneak past the enemy until the infantry show up, and the battle is joined in earnest. There are rules for cavalry charges, including debacles and impetuous charges. The command problems of the BEF and German 1. Armee are shown, although scenario variants give players all the freedom they could want.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Two 22x34 maps&#10;5 1/2 standard counter sheets (280 each), total 1,540 counters.&#10;35+ Small wooden colored cubes&#10;One version 2.0 series Rule Book&#10;One Game Book&#10;One Setup Book&#10;Numerous Charts and Tables, Player Aids, Army Organization Trees, and Status Displays&#10;Planning Maps&#10;Dice&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Potions &amp; Puppies is a light weight game that has a unique twist on resource management and press your luck. It's a 1 to 5 player cooperative game where all players must work together to share resources to discover recipes to a variety of potions to help you get past tasks inside the tower. Each puppy has a unique magic ability to help their friends but must balance using their own abilities with using those same crystals for potions.&#10;&#10;Puppies have a variety of actions to take on their turn ranging from gathering crystals from a shared stash to discovering or brewing potion recipes. Each puppy also has two unique abilities - a lesser ability can be used an unlimited number of times per game as well as a once per game ultimate ability that will make the puppy's player mat flip and their remaining ability will cost more gems to use for the rest of the game. Discovering potions is vital to puppies' success, and each time a player wants to discover a potion they must use three colors of crystal from in front of them that do not match any other current recipe before flipping over the top potion card. Potions can be be brewed by using the same crystals as are on the recipe card by placing them onto the puppies' current tile. When all potions have been brewed, the puppies can move forward.&#10;&#10;Brewing a potion that is labelled on the modular tile they are currently standing on allows the group to move forward and one step closer to escape. They also have unique abilities such as rearranging recipes, looking at the potion deck to see what is coming up next, and digging up many crystals at once. At the end of each turn the active player can draw up to two crystals from the blind bag to replenish their resources - but each time a black crystal is drawn the guardian moves one space closer to the puppies and the crystal goes back into the bag. If the puppies brew all the potions on the final tile before the guardian lands on their current space - they win! Otherwise, it's game over.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

A two-page comic introduces the game, which is then presented in six pages of rules including the maze-like playing board and a tracking sheet.&#10;&#10;The game is played by two opponents, one controlling the &quot;human&quot; team and one controlling the &quot;slimebeast&quot; team.  A third player acts as a &quot;referee&quot; to enforce the rules, make decisions in uncertain cases, and track locations and events that are unknown to one team.  Additionally, the &quot;referee&quot; controls a team of &quot;bums&quot; - hapless humans that should be rescued by the human team or used as egg incubators by the slimebeast team (bums are, effectively, an in-game resource).&#10;&#10;Prior to play, each player receives 100 points to use to build their team.  Humans and slimebeasts have variable powers with varying costs; every human and every slimebeast can some varying powers, depending on player desires.&#10;&#10;During play, each player maintains their own map that shows locations and events known to them (generally, all their own team and those of the opposing team they have discovered).  The play pieces are straight pins with colored tape to indicate status/condition/etc.  The referee simultaneously maintains a &quot;master&quot; map that is considered authoritative in the event of a discrepancy with a player map.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in turns following an established sequence.  In each turn, humans move first and slimebeasts move second; combat then occurs wherever humans and slimebeasts have encountered each other.  Combat uses a fairly complex series of processes that obviously are heavily derived from Dungeons & Dragons mechanics.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the humans eliminate the slimebeasts or the slimebeasts eliminate the humans.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The leader is a very strong country tile, but is tricky to play optimally and its inclusion should be agreed by all players before starting a game of Keyper or Keyper at Sea.&#10;&#10;The Leader was not included in the base games as a regular tile as it seriously disrupts the normal flow of a game.

It can be played cooperatively or in &quot;hero team vs. villain&quot; mode.&#10;Players take turns singing verses which must contain a rhyme determined by the villain. They should try to include as many of the items depicted on open cards on the table, because they can take any of these item cards as coins. At the end of a round, the group can buy extra skills and lives for the coins they collected. &#10;The villain's role is to make the hero team's task more difficult, because when a player fails to create and sing a musical verse within time and conditions, the hero loses a life, and if the team loses all their lives, the villain wins. There are 3 levels of difficulty of the rhyme cards, so the Villain needs to manage the difficulty of the rhymes in their hand and analyze which ones are more difficult with the elements that are currently on the table. If after three rounds the hero team still has lives, there is one last round. In this final round each player must use all the elements on the table, and the sung stanza needs to be a provocation to the Villain. If a player succeeds, the villain is hit. If the Villain receives a number of blows equal to their life, the hero team wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cricket: The Game is a 2-4 player tabletop game, based on the sport of cricket. The game consists of a game board, playing cards, tokens, and dice.&#10;&#10;Each team plays an Innings, both Bowling and Batting. The sequence of play is based on deliveries in an over which commence with the Bowler secretly selecting their bowl to deliver. The batter then marks on the field their attempted stroke, before the bowler reveals the bowl type. A rolling advantage is set based on various outcomes in gameplay, that may favour the batter or bowler. Next an Over Deck card is revealed that can affect the batter or bowler with different advantages or disadvantages.&#10;&#10;Both teams then roll dice to determine the strength of the delivery and stroke, which may result in a strike, miss, or block. If struck, the ball enters the field where the batter rolls additional dice to determine the distance and bounce of the ball.&#10;As per the sport, the winning team either finishes with the most runs, or bowls the other team out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The 7th Division had spent eighteen months preparing to fight in North Africa &ndash; training as a tank division for hot desert conditions, not as a light infantry amphibious force for arctic island warfare. The commanding General De Witt assured the high command that the Island defences would crumble in three days. It took 19 days of battle and over 500 U.S. Soldiers killed in action with more than 1200 injured. The Battle of Attu, which began with an unopposed landing, would end with unrestrained violence.

Yamasaki Yasuyo.&#10;&#10;On June 7th, 1942, Soldiers of the Imperial Japanese invaded Attu in the Aleutians Islands. After the landing the Japanese soldiers began constructing fortifications and an airfield. Realising the need to hold Attu, the garrison was increased to a 2500-man force under the command of Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki. The Japanese were acclimated to the harsh weather conditions, they had prepared their defences, they were utterly devoted to their Emperor and prepared to sell their lives dearly. The US Forces landed 11000 Soldiers on May 11th , 1943 expecting to secure the Island in &quot;three days&quot;. Over the next 19 days the US forces gradually gained the upper hand. Realising that there would be no help or reinforcements coming to help in an increasingly hopeless situation, on May 29th , Colonel Yamasaki, sword in hand, led a massive Banzai charge against the Americans. The Japanese military used the term Gyokusai or &ldquo;Shattering like a Jewel&rdquo; to describe the self-annihilation of the defending force, of which only 29 Japanese survived the battle. This was the only instance of a banzai charge on American soil.&#10;&#10;Warfighter: WWII Expansion #61 &ndash; Attu #2 adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions, including new US Hostiles, Japanese Soldiers, Locations, Missions, Objectives, and Skills:&#10;&#10;4 x Player Soldiers&#10;4 x Non-Player Soldiers&#10;4 x Squad Soldiers&#10;9 x Weapons and Equipment&#10;1 x Service Record Card&#10;4 x Missions&#10;4 x Objectives&#10;10 x Locations&#10;16 x Hostiles&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Errata: There are typos on card 61-22 (Arctic Trained SRC), which does not affect gameplay.

Ultimately, the only statistic that matters is point differential &ndash; and that's what counts in D20 Football.&#10;&#10;Game play is simple: for each quarter, the players use a virtual 20-sided die chit-pull system and consult the results chart. If no overtime, that's just four &quot;die rolls&quot; per scheduled game per player. Luck isn't everything, though. Players choose an offensive and defensive focus for each quarter. The player who does the better job of outwitting his opponent can affect the results in his favor to a considerable degree.&#10;&#10;So, can 2020&rsquo;s Tampa Bay Bucs go all the way in your replay? Maybe not &ndash; there are four slightly better teams in their way.&#10;&#10;Every 2020 NFL team is rated, and a specially designed scoresheet makes the game flow smoothly. The game can be played solo or two-player. It&rsquo;s highly portable, easy to play, and is sure to &ldquo;fire up&rdquo; football fans of all ages.&#10;&#10;",

As part of the abstracted game play, a gridded table is used as this simplifies movement, ranges, line of sight, and the effects of terrain.&#10;&#10;I designed these rules so that I could use diverse small collections of my &lsquo;shooty&rsquo; models in a game without needing to build up larger squads or invest in new, page-heavy skirmish rules. This has been a nice way to introduce some of my non-miniatures gamer friends into a game with my miniatures.&#10;&#10;The intended setting is near future and Sci Fi military or policing actions involving around a Squad&rsquo;s worth of models (usually ten or so), however I&rsquo;ve also used them for the Weird Wild West and Weird World War Two skirmishes so the rules are really usable across any gunfight setting. Occasionally, the rules have had a run out for a standard Dime Fiction Wild West shoot-out, Hollywood Colonial adventure or World War Two section-level encounter, using Primitive weapons and no armour (except for Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s boiler plate).&#10;&#10;The rules are simple to pick up, but the turn sequence is a little unusual compared to many games: make sure you understand this before playing. You&rsquo;ll need a couple of dozen tokens for Initiative Points, and a few markers to place beside Stunned models. In addition, you will need a handful of six-sided dice, and if you&rsquo;re not using a gridded tabletop, a ruler marked in 6&rdquo; lengths.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You can also encircle opponent's swappies to get more clones and get rid of more enemies.&#10;&#10;Basically, the idea behind Swappies was to create a game where good players in Candy Crush Saga (or any similar games) could play against each other. Also, there is no kind of luck, this game is just all about skills.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Swappies est un jeu de permutation et de domination pouvant &ecirc;tre jou&eacute; par 2, 3 ou 4 joueurs. Ce jeu de strat&eacute;gie est jou&eacute; sur une grande planche de jeu contenant 81 cases dans une grille de 9X9. Il y a 2 fa&ccedil;ons de gagner; &ecirc;tre le dernier joueur &agrave; avoir perdu tous ses swappies ou mettre ses 49 swappies sur la grande planche de jeu.&#10;&#10;Essayez de faire des combinaisons afin de cr&eacute;er des clones avec vos swappies. En faisant cela, vos clones prendront la place de certains swappies ennemis. Vous pouvez encercler les swappies de vos adversaires pour avoir plus de clones tout en se d&eacute;barrassant de plus de swappies ennemis.&#10;&#10;En fait, l'id&eacute;e derri&egrave;re Swappies &eacute;tait de cr&eacute;er un jeu auquel les joueurs de Candy Cush Saga (ou tout autres jeux similaires) puissent s'affronter l'un l'autre. Aussi, il n'y a pas de coup chanceux, ce jeu n'est bas&eacute; que sur les aptitudes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (French)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cabbages and Kings is a trick-taking game played with a 44-card deck. There are four suits, each numbered 1-11: kings, cabbages, ships, and shoes.&#10;&#10;The deal will generally not come out evenly: extra cards are set aside and given to the winner of the first trick. Before the first trick each player passes three cards to the player on their left.&#10;&#10;Play is standard trick-taking: players must follow suit and may play anything if they cannot. There is no trump.&#10;&#10;Player start with 50 points and they gain or lose points based on cards taken. Kings are worth 2 and cabbages -1. In addition the &quot;big ship&quot; (apparently the 10) is worth 10 and the &quot;old shoe&quot; is worth -10. The first player to reach 100 points wins.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game comes from a Lewis Carroll poem, 'The Walrus and the Carpenter', wherein the main characters talk of many things, including: shoes, ships, sealing-wax, cabbages, and kings.&#10;&#10;",

With experience, it is dynamic, sharp and tactical.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 3 stones on the board. Each turn consists of 2 moves. Pieces are normally added at the beginning of each move; but existing pieces can be moved, instead, to achieve an extended range of movement.  Replacement-capture may be made during placement.&#10;&#10;There is a natural tension between using moves to spread out one's pieces, or to increase one's future range of movement from a specific point; or to create barriers to the opponent's expansion or to limit his range of throw.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each mission builds on the last mission with the ultimate objective to get as much of the 10-man crew through the required 25 missions.&#10;&#10;Players will physically mark on the crew cards to show their record of downed enemy planes and completed missions. Use a sharpee. The cards are coated with a UV protection which allows you to clean your card off with an alcohol swab to reset it.&#10;&#10;Bomb Run is a solitaire, deck-in-hand, card game. That means there is no table-top required and the entire game fits in the player&rsquo;s hand. Each mission takes on average less than 10 minutes but it can easily be put away and picked up later and continued mid-mission.&#10;&#10;",

Lovely promises of fortune and glory will bring you to deep forgotten catacombs, but only a true hero, with a body and mind forged in the strongest steel will survive.&#10;&#10;Half role playing game, half figurine (1:50 scale) Catakombes Dark Reign is a cooperative game for 1 to 3 players embodying a group of heroes, who form an alliance against their opponents to accomplish their quest, while another player gives life to the adventure as the game master. The game takes place in an alternative medieval era, where legendary creatures and magic coexist with the real world.&#10;&#10;Purpose of the game&#10;Incarnate a hero willing to over- come every risk to achieve the main quest.&#10;1/Setting up&#10;You need to define who the heroes (PC) are and who the Game Master (GM) is. We recommend a group of three adventurers PCs. The game master (GM) is in charge of animating the adventure for the PCs in the respect of the game&rsquo;s rules.&#10;The GM chooses a quest and prepares the &laquo; Catacombs&rsquo; plan &raquo; cards enables to create a unique gaming board for each game.&#10;Each PC chooses a character with the help of a predefined sheet or PCs create their own character if they wish.&#10;The introduction of the game takes place in a narrative way. The GM describes the quest to the PCs, who verbally describe their actions. Every conceivable actions are possible, it is up to the GM to adapt them to the game.&#10;When PCs enter the catacombs the game play is in turns.&#10;2/Game turn&#10;During a game turn, there is first the PCs&rsquo; turn then the GM&rsquo;s turn and each turn is divided into 3 phases.&#10;PC&rsquo;s turn :&#10;Phase 1: The characters recover all their action points (A.Point).&#10;Phase 2: One of the PC&rsquo;s (by turns) draw an unexpected card at the start of each turn (except in the first turn of the game) and the PCs suffer its effects. Take care of all the various effects affecting the PCs and their allies (Fear, Burning, Poisoned...), and remove expired markers.&#10;Phase 3: Each PC does his actions (walk, run, attack, search ...). Each time a PC does an action, he removes the equivalent action points as indicated by the action&rsquo;s cost. When a character is activated, they aren&rsquo;t obligated to spend all their action points in one go. For example, they may do one action then let another PC or ally play their actions and finish their actions afterwards. But once the PC&rsquo;s turn is over, all remaining action points are lost.&#10;GM&rsquo;s Turn:&#10;The GM repeats the 3 phases of a turn, like during the PCs&rsquo; turn (bare in mind that the GM doesn&rsquo;t draw an unexpected event card). The GM&rsquo;s characters play in the GM&rsquo;s desired order.&#10;3/End of the game&#10;The game ends when the main quest is completed or all PCs are eliminated.&#10;The GM then reads the conclusion of the quest and the PCs intervene verbally describe their actions.&#10;The PCs add up the experience points, Ecus earned and the treasures found during the game and share them equally.&#10;Then the PCs spend their experience points to develop their characteristics and gain new skills. They can go to town in order to buy new equipment with their hard-earned ecus.&#10;&#10;- description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
