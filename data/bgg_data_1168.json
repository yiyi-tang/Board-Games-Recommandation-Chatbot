The airfield at Keflavik played a crucial role in Operation Reforger which would rush vital resupplies and reinforcements from the US and Canada to Western Europe. The naval installation near there monitored the underwater SOSUS line that monitored Soviet submarines in the North Sea and North Atlantic. However, most US and other NATO military leaders assumed a Soviet attack would be in the form of air attacks by long range bombers with cruise missiles and conventional bombs. However, an airborne and amphibious assault could not be ruled out. This designer has made some assumptions in crafting this game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Soviet High Command mobilized a reinforced regimental-sized (331st Regiment of the 106th Desant Division as well as Spetnatz commandoes) airborne and amphibious assault that would be launched at the very outbreak of the war.&#10;     The Soviet assault seek to inflict as much damage as possible on the NATO military installations in and around Reykjavik and Keflavik, as well as gathering any intelligence materials discovered during the raid.&#10;     Evacuation and even the survival of the raiders would be secondary to the successful elimination of the NATO installations.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game lasts up to 12 turns. Each turn represents six hours of time. A hex is about 6 kilometers across. Combat units are companies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Using these powers, you summon creatures, cast spells, activate enchanted weapons, and invoke creature abilities.&#10;&#10;You play as part of 1 of 2 Factions (Tenebris = Dark Faction or Lux = Light Faction) warring head-to-head which are trying to take control over the Realm by either having the most elemental power, or by finding lost lore and artifacts in order to learn how to resurrect their Primal God of elemental magic at the Hollow of Fate.  This location being the place where the gods were last seen after their epic battle, as well as where the dragon Baransu is currently residing, waiting to awake to rid the world of elemental magic and the Factions of Light and Dark!&#10;&#10;The game is made up of 2 Rounds, with each Round having two phases: Activate and Conflict. During the Activate Phase, all Clans obtain more Battle Cards, Power Tokens and Creatures. During the Conflict Phase, Clans take turns spending a Power Token to either summon creatures, draw more Battle Cards, utilize their Avatar&rsquo;s power, or activate a found Legendary Weapon. After spending a Power Token, the Clan may then move any creatures of theirs on the gameboard, followed by an option to Battle at any contested locations. Creatures in the game have a variety of different traits that can be used in Battle, and Battle Dice, Creature Traits and Battle Cards are used in Battle to defeat the enemy!&#10;&#10;In the course of the game, Clans complete Saga Cards (secret objectives) to find Lore throughout the Realm and finally a Legendary Weapon&rsquo;s location and use. These artifacts provide a power boost in the game and help satisfy one of your Faction&rsquo;s win conditions. Lore Cards provide the history of a Legendary Weapon and story beats encountered at different triggers in the game. Clans are also trying to control matching element locations to place more Power Tokens on the gameboard in order to have the most elemental power to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The tiles may be a tapioca card, a branding card (the cup logo), or a bottom.  If a bottom card is placed, that column's demand switches, either from most tapioca to least tapioca, or the reverse.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, cups will be eligible to score if they have a lid, bottom, three tapioca sections, and a brand.  Players each have a total maximum amount of tapioca that may be contained in their three cups.  The player who best satisfies each columns' requirements wins the corresponding sound tile and additional may be earned if all cards of one cup contain the same color of straw.  Multiple rounds of play may be required to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The rules for Animal Inc describe it as an &quot;unusual semi-cooperative hand management game&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 36 cards in 5 suits, with numbers ranging from 0 to 12, and each suit has a unique distribution.  For instance, all grey cards are 6's, and green cards are numbered 3-9.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt out evenly, with each player then choosing a few cards to discard.  The players are adding cards in a pyramid structure that is 8 cards wide on the bottom.  To play a card on the bottom row, a player simply plays it next to a previously played card.  To play a card on a higher row, it must be supported by 2 cards, and at least 1 must be the same color as the card being played.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players are out of cards, or no player may legally play another card.&#10;&#10;If the pyramid reached the 5th tier (4 cards wide), then the last player scores positive points equal to the sum of the values shown on all cards in the 5th tier and above; all other players lose points equal to their single highest card.  However, if the pyramid does not reach the 5th tier, the last player loses points equal to their single highest card, and all other players gain points equal to their single highest card.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It portrays a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; attack by the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) against the USSR. The premise of the game is that the Cuban &ldquo;missile crisis&rdquo; escalated to an all-out nuclear war between the Cold War protagonists. The game is designed for two players, one taking on the role of the attacking US forces and the other the defending air defense forces of the Soviet Union. The game can also be played solitaire. The SAC game's design is based on the classic NORAD game, published over four decades ago by Conflict Magazine and Simulations, and designed by Dana Lombardy. My design is a tribute to that classic, but with the gaming perspective &quot;switched&quot; and some new rules &quot;tweaks&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Who would have said that the better fortune tellers were in cheap sci-fi movies? Maybe it was just a matter of luck.&#10;&#10;When we started to surf among the stars, we were too lazy to collect any garbage. Therefore, the space is now full of that trash. Those were the days; we could afford throwing all kind of things though the spaceship wc.&#10;&#10;Now resources are limited. That trash, that we threw away so carelessly, is now the most valuable currency in the space. More than gold, more than any other mineral, now plenty in any rock in the space. No one studies how to make a screw, that&rsquo;s why they cost so much.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s stop talking. Welcome aboard. You probably know something about us, the Those Little Assignments Co. We travel through the space, jumping into the hyperspace, avoiding threats looking for resources and, who knows, maybe a mighty artifact.&#10;&#10;Please go to the sign board. Every day there is a new adventure to live. Well, we really have no &ldquo;days&rdquo; in the space, but we still count every 24 hours, just not to get crazy. I hope you enjoy your time here.&quot;&#10;&#10;Little Space Errands is a game for 1 player, with games of around 20 minutes length. You will face a variety of threats represented by cards, using different resources of your ship and using the dice to get some loot.

    "Description": "Taoex is an abstract strategy game where players use mono-directional tiles to navigate a hexagonal grid to capture opponents&rsquo; tiles to create multi-directional towers for greater mobility. Using the 6-pointed compass, that control all direction of play, located in the center of the board, players take turns placing their 12 tiles (2 for each compass direction) in the optimum starting hexes. Once all the 36 starting hexes have been filled the game begins with the players taking turns advancing at least 1 tile into play per turn. Within the board there is a 6-pointed star called The Way where tiles are forced to roll the 10-sided Taoex die to charge the path a tile/tower moves across the board. Regardless of whether the roll is beneficial to the rolling player, the tile must move the roll along the Way if it can. Tiles/towers that traverse board to the far side of the board, if the tile/tower manages to line up with a starting hex, the tile/tower can wrap around the board to come out on the other side once again. An excellent tactic when hunting new directions.&#10;&#10;As players begin collecting enemy tiles, by landing on them, they form towers of up to 6 tiles tall, maximum. Anything over 6 tiles the tower&rsquo;s owner either removes enemy tiles from play or in the case of his own, liberates them and returns them to an open starting hex of the appropriate direction of the tile. The game is won by a player collecting 6 of one enemy&rsquo;s tiles into a single tower or, if 1 player captures/eliminates all opponent tiles.&#10;&#10;Taoex is a challenging and unique abstract strategy game that is very simple to learn and yet offers the players a mental workout as they master their play. Naturally, the rules that govern the game are more complex than the description written above, but it is the nuances in the rules that makes all games more interesting and Taoex offers its fair share. If you are the kind of gamer that enjoys using your mind to defeat opponents rather than just relying upon some lucky dice roll or random chance, then Taoex is a game for you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card has 2 actions, top and bottom. When cards are lying on table, bottoms of higher cards cover tops of lower cards, so initially boss uses only 4 actions.

Boss dies only when you remove its final card.&#10;&#10;Boss actions are very unique and full of flavor to each Boss. Each action also has different targeting system, it can target weakest models, closest, all base to base, etc.&#10;&#10;Each boss also has its own set of tokens like Quarry, Control, Shields, Toxic that gives it the additional twist to its mechanics and combat characteristics.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each boss has 2 mini scenarios.&#10;&#10;Every single Boss brings tons of fun and challenge to encounters and will require many attempts to beat them!&#10;&#10;Also, each Boss now will belong as fully playable Boss for its respective faction.

The modifying cards are still secret to the rest of the players, among teammates you can only ask if they have cards of a certain type but not how much they reward or penalize.  Maximum 5 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Sudden Death: A game of up to 16 players, initially 1 survivor card and a modifier card will be delivered to each player.  Special survivors' cards and encounter cards must be removed from the event deck, as getting stamps is not essential but to survive.

    "Description": "Una Vittoria Inutile, Goito 1848 (A Useless Victory, Goito 1848) is a wargame by designer Andrea Brusati about the attack of the Austrian Army of Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky against the Piedmontese I Army Corps, deployed to protect the bridges over the Mincio near Goito, during the First Italian War of Independence.&#10;&#10;Una Vittoria Inutile, Goito 1848 is the second wargame of a series, using the same rules system, named &ldquo;Risorgimento&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Operational Game System &ldquo;Risorgimento&rdquo; simulates the battles and campaigns of the Wars of the Italian Independence (1848 &ndash; 1866) at regimental and battalion level. The system does not deal with the tactical formations of the period, instead it highlights the command systems and capacities, the fog of war, and the consequent operational and strategic decisions, keeping the game complexity at middle to low level.&#239;&#187;&#191;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Irregular Wars: Conflict at the World&rsquo;s End provides a fun and easy, fast-play, set of rules for engagements on the fringe of the European world &ndash; Ireland, the Americas, the East Indies and the vast steppes of Central Asia. The lands discovered by European explorers seeking easy access to the trading wealth of the Indies exposed untold avenues for expansion. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw successive waves of self-aggrandising traders, raiders, conquerors and colonists leave Europe for new lands beyond the sea. Some pursued the freedom to practice persecuted religions or the opportunity to convert the heathens, others sought raw resources in the form of gold, furs or exotic spices or plants, like nutmeg or tobacco. The game is designed for engagements between two forces of from 500 to 2,500 fighting men per side. Each player represents a leading conquistador, noble, governor, daimyo, chief, cacique or petty monarch. These leaders are given the umbrella title of &lsquo;lords&rsquo;. The key to success in Irregular Wars is the lord&rsquo;s ability to harness the enthusiasm of volunteer or militia soldiers which, together with the effective use of terrain, counts for more than sheer numbers alone. The uncertain nature of army recruitment and variable level of centralised command and control make the rules ideal for small scale, localised and asymmetrical warfare. The game could quite easily be expanded to cover earlier or later conflicts anywhere in the world prior to the establishment of reliable and professional armies. This second edition of Irregular Wars continues the fun and fast approach of the original rules. More background information and explanations are provided and the phase sequence has been streamlined. Additional changes throughout the rules make the randomised aspects of the game more realistic&hellip; in a random sort of way. This edition includes army lists for 48 different sixteenth and seventeenth century armies belonging to the major European colonial powers and the indigenous populations of Ireland, the Americas, East Indies and Eurasian Steppe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Do pay special attention for storyteller's clue, which tells you how to solve different obstacles and riddles, and how to win the game!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;In Fantasy World players take turns being a story narrator. Each turn the narrator designs a problem scenario for the other players to solve. Each other player then selects an item from their hand and explains how that item solves the problem. Once completed all players then simultaneously point at the player who they think has the most convincing solution (besides themselves). If the player recieved either the most votes or no votes their card is discarded, otherwise it is kept. Item cards come in various colors if one player gets a complete set or 3 of the same color they have won the game.&#10;&#10;In the story mode variant, narrators must continue the story each turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Using a portable neoprene mat, players will try tossing small cardboard dodgeballs into each other's rings. Once a ball is tossed into a ring, that player is out. The last team standing wins.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;Each player at the start of the game will select a jersey ring with a nickname on it. That becomes their player piece. Each player will also grab a dodgeball. If a dodgeball thrown from the opposing team enters this jersey ring, it counts as a hit and the player with that ring is out. A hit occurs when the dodgeball completely enters the ring or is leaning inside the ring. If the dodgeball is balancing on top of the ring or leaning outside of it, that counts as a catch. That means the person who threw the ball is out and their jersey ring must be removed from the arena. The person who caught the ball can now have a previously out person come back in for their team. Teams go back and forth throwing until one team is left standing.&#10;&#10;HOW TO MOVE&#10;Once you toss your dodgeball, you'll need to pick up another one to throw again. To do this, move your jersey piece to a different section of the arena. There are 4 sections for each side. Each section separated by lines and a pattern of blue and grey. You can move to a section that contains a dodgeball to pick one up again or you can move to a section without a dodgeball and won't pick one up. But you must move every turn You can move once per turn.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;The goal of dodgeball is to knock out all the players on the other team.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Table Dodgeball League.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of magic users as they embark on an all-out mystical battle for arcane dominance or simply petty vengeance.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players will use their hand of cards to cast a spell. A spell will usually be created from three cards (elements) in their hand, and placed face down ready for the casting phase. Players will have to act fast however as the quicker a player prepares their spell, the earlier they'll be able to cast it and inflict pain upon their opponents.&#10;&#10;Once all casters have prepared their spells, they begin the process of flinging them at each other: In order of initiative, each player places a missile token on their caster then moves it around the arena, then deals damage and other harmful statuses to the target(s) depending on the spell's effects.&#10;&#10;Casters that end up on the wrong side of a fireball need not fear, for death is merely an inconvenience! When their physical forms expire, casters explode in a burst of magical energy and become sentient slimes. In this form players cannot win the game, but killing a living caster will return them to life, allowing players a chance to snatch victory once more.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the last caster to be left alive, so don your finest robes and hats and prepare your toughest spells...

One player is then designated as &lsquo;Shipment Delivery Person&rsquo; and takes the three dice, rolling and setting them within reach of all players.&#10;&#10;Play: Each player simultaneously chooses values on 2 of the 3 dice for use on their 4x4 game board grid of shelving. One die value will be used for the &lsquo;type&rsquo; of game (letters W E R C S) and one other die value for the &lsquo;size&rsquo; of the game box (numbers 1-5). Players write down a type/size pair in one of the shelf sections of the game board (ex. W4 or R1).&#10;&#10;The &lsquo;SDP&rsquo; then rolls the dice again and players write down a new type/size pair using the new die values.

A maximum of 4 helper actions can be used by any player. Cross off a box each time an action is used. All actions only affect that player&rsquo;s own use of the die values.&#10;&#10;Scoring after 12 spaces are filled in: &#10;&bull; Score for a single run (i.e. a straight) of 3 orthogonally adjacent game box sizes in ascending/descending numerical order (ex. 1, 2, 3, or 4, 3, 2, not 4, 2, 3), regardless of type, by adding up the total of all game box sizes as a final number within a row or column.&#10;&#10;&bull; Score for an individual set of 3 games of the same matching type (regardless of size) orthogonally adjacent to each other in a row or column. Scores are based on the total number of individual sets distributed across the 4x4 game board grid of shelving.&#10;&#10;Score equals - 1 set - 3vp  &bull;  2 sets - 5vp  &bull;  3 sets - 8vp  &bull;  4 sets 12vp  &bull;  5 or more sets - 17vp&#10;&#10;&bull; Score for each individual collection of all 5 game types AND all 5 games sizes within the grid of shelving(ex.
