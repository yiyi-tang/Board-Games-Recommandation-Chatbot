    "Description": "In 1646 BC, the island of Thera (present day Santorini) was the site of a volcanic eruption one hundred times more powerful than Pompeii. This eruption coincided with the decline of the Minoan civilization and the rise of the Mycenaean civilization. Due to Thera's strategic location, the Mycanaean wanax (king) has decided that it is time to rebuild Thera and has tasked you, one of his koreters (governors) with this responsibility. The koreter who best rebuilds Thera to its prior glory will be victorious.&#10;&#10;In the role-selection and resource-management game Thera, each player has a map of the island where they will engage in trade, clear ash, generate resources, move those resources to building sites across the island, and construct economic and luxury buildings. On a player's turn, they select one of five roles from the rondel. Every player can benefit from this role, and the one who chose it gets benefits that scale with the amount of favor on the role. Favor accumulates on roles over the course of the game and is redistributed every time a role is chosen. Here's an overview of the five roles:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Priestess prays for rain, bringing the life-giving resource to the island.&#10;    The Worker consumes that water and produces resources.&#10;    The Planner moves those resources around Thera so that they can be used for construction or trade.&#10;    The Builder uses those resources to construct buildings on undeveloped sites across the island.&#10;    The Trader buys and sells resources at the port.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players earn points by constructing buildings. You must get the needed resources to the desired building site, then acquire the building plans (which are available to all from a common building tableau). Should you build another quarry (a resource-generating building), or are you worried one of your competitors will take that temple (a luxury building) that aligns with your strategy? Time is of the essence in Thera, so efficient planning and resource management are important in winning the day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For other players who cannot escape, they will be caught by the navy and lost a life (rum token).&#10;&#10;The game ends when (i) a player has over 15 scores, or (ii) all players lost their last life.

    "Description": "Territories in Flames is Australian Design Group's newest World in Flames Collector's edition expansion that dramatically expands the scope of World in Flames in all those parts of the globe that were vital to the economies of the great powers but peripheral to the major theaters of combat.&#10; World War II was just as much the field of diplomacy and politics as it was industry and mighty armies, and from the jungles of Burma to the mountains of Kilimanjaro people across the globe had to choose sides in this global struggle.&#10;&#10;Although the Axis powers only had sporadic plans for overseas empire, there were many yearning to throw off the yoke of the colonial powers and only too glad to help their supposed liberators.&#10;&#10;Territories in Flames includes all the locally raised overseas troops, city based volunteers, (the ultimate fantasy Christmas present scenario, Japan conquers Singapore then China liberates it, easy peasy), warlords, Siberians, the Ukrainian national army, forts, coastal forts, roads, rails, facilities and saved oil &amp; build points.&#10;&#10;Territories in Flames is playable with&nbsp;Patton in Flames or America in Flames as well as&nbsp;World in Flames.&#10; Territories in Flames includes 400 full-colour counters that turn World in Flames from a great into an unforgettable experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An intense cooperative, dice-rolling, unique tower defense set in a medieval fantasy world for 1 to 4 players. Have you ever wanted to be an archer on a castle wall? Now is your chance because all players play as archers defending against four powerful armies all attacking at once. Will the small band of archers defend the great castle of Godfrey or will the four Captains of the armies gain control of the castle? It is up to you and your team of archers so, &ldquo;Notch, Draw, Loose!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;How To Win:&#10;Players win if all four Captains are killed before one reaches the Center of the Keep.&#10;&#10;Players lose if:&#10;&gt;&gt; A Captain reaches the Keep at the center of the Inner Court. &#10;&gt;&gt; All ten soldiers of any one army are placed on their quadrant in the bailey.&#10;&gt;&gt; The Player&rsquo;s Deck has no more cards left to draw.&#10;&#10;General Gameplay:&#10;The goal of the game is to kill all 4 Captains before 1 advances to the Keep. Archers will be attacking the Captains with their arrows while eliminating the invading armies. Players will also use cards and purchase items from the Archer&rsquo;s Equipment to accomplish this goal.&#10;&#10;Every normal arrow is worth 1 damage unless otherwise stated on the cards or with special abilities. Each archer has 5 arrows and 5 spaces to move each turn.&#10;&#10;The 12mm dice are the soldiers of the different armies that are invading the castle. The health of a soldier is determined by what it rolls. Archers can ONLY attack soldiers in their row of their quadrant. Archers kill soldiers with their arrows by reducing the soldier&rsquo;s health down to 0.  Archers receive an Archer Trophy for each soldier they kill during their turn. Archers will use these trophies to purchase equipment to help them defeat the Captains.&#10;&#10;When a soldier's health reaches 0, then remove that dice from the bailey and place it back on its army&rsquo;s card in the Gathering Area. The soldier dice will be rolled again and placed in a future round.&#10;&#10;Archers do NOT receive an Archer Trophy if soldier dice are killed while being placed during the Enemy phase. However, Archers do earn trophies for soldier dice killed by barrels and cards that upgrade their arrows.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards are split and have two options.  Players choose one option to play and then discard. Players CANNOT play both of the options on the split cards. Split cards are designed to help for the different situations that players find themselves in.&#10;&#10;Each round has two phases: Archer Phase and Enemy Phase.&#10;&#10;Archer Phase&#10;Each Archer Phase consists of all 4 archers taking their turns.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s Turn:&#10;Draw 1 Card &#10;Add to hand or follow the instructions if it is an Enemy Card. &ldquo;Captain Advance&rdquo; cards advance the Captain to the next space in their trail toward the Keep at the center of the Inner Court.&#10;&ldquo;Extra Soldier&rdquo; cards will add an additional soldier to be placed during the Enemy Phase of that round (&#10;&#10;2) Anytime during an archer&rsquo;s turn they may:&#10;Move 5 spaces and Shoot 5 arrows.&#10;Play 1 card from your hand OR purchase items from the Archer's Equipment&#10;If you purchase items, then you CANNOT play a card in the same turn.&#10;If you play a card, then you CANNOT purchase items in the same turn.&#10;&#10;3) Discard for hand limit&#10;4) Pass the 1st player Castle Token to the person on your left (Clockwise)&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s Movement:&#10;Archers are allowed to move to any space along the castle walls with a yellow border. Only one archer is allowed on each space along the wall. However, two archers may be on a &ldquo;Starting Position&rdquo; at the same time while they are moving along the wall. And as archers move past another archer, they CANNOT shoot arrows in the row of the other archer as they pass over them.&#10;&#10;Stairs do not count as a space, the Archers just walk through them to the next space with a yellow border. Start positions do count as one space when the Archers are moving around to the other wall.&#10;&#10;Enemy Phase&#10;Each Enemy phase begins immediately following the Archer Phase. &#10;The Enemy Phase consists of 3 elements:&#10;Roll the d8 Captain dice and resolve.&#10;Check what number you rolled with the Roman numerals on the 4 corner towers. Whatever number you rolled, the Captain in that quadrant advances one space.&#10;&#10;If the Captain is in the bailey,then add a rolled soldier in the space that the Captain advanced from.&#10;&#10;If the Captain is in the Inner Court, then resolve any Barricades that they might have passed through. No soldiers are ever placed in the Inner Court.&#10;&#10;If that Captain is dead, then nothing happens. Take a deep breathe. You DO NOT re-roll if you rolled to advance a dead Captain.&#10;Roll the Soldier Placement dice for each of the 4 armies and place 2 soldiers on to each quadrant of the bailey.&#10;&#10;Roll 8 new soldiers (2 for each army) and place them on the two soldier positions of their army card. These will be placed in the next round during the Enemy Phase.&#10;The highest health is placed in position #1&#10;The lowest health is placed in position #2&#10;&#10;After rolling the NEXT soldiers and placing them on their army cards, then the Archer Phase of the next round begins&#10;&#10;",

This addition expands the Angler's options and gives a strong boost to the early fishing game.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the new 6PM Clock card optionally extends the Tournament another round for both the Solo, Co-op (2 Anglers), and Competative (2-4 Anglers) mode.

For the Solo/Co-op Tournament, the AI Angler catches a 7th Fish of your choice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The unique concept in Chess Unbound is that each piece's movement is indicated by the space it occupies on the chessboard.  Each space on the game board contains a modular tile that shows a movement style from traditional chess (pawn, knight, rook, etc.).  When you move a piece, follow the movement style on its current space.  When the piece comes to rest, the space it lands on will indicate how it moves next turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponent's king. The king piece is the only unique piece in the game, in that it never follows the movement rules of the spaces it occupies (it only moves like a king in traditional chess).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Utilising the &quot;everything in one box&quot; model, everyone who plays Soulbound will be able to experience the game as it is intended to be, without the financial investment hurdle. Feel the thrill of commanding creatures of mythology to become the next Soulbound!&#10;&#10;Along with creatures of mythology, Soulbound introduces a unique take on explaining what happened to these creatures that stoppped their existence in Modern Day planet Earth. Explore how the unknown war of the heavens and hell, known as &quot;The Vanishing&quot;, caused Pandora's Box to thrust creatures of mythology and Gods alike into an alternate reality of planet Earth, known as Axiom07 by the greater beings. To the local population, the planet is called Duhra, and they have no idea about the darkness that they will have to fight back in order to survive.&#10;&#10;Soulbound is the world's first battle card game that gives you the authentic Trading Card Game experience, while incorporating a heavy influence from Tactical Turn-Based Strategy Role-Playing games and a &quot;Dynamic Resource&quot; system. With Melee creatures, Ranged creatures and Support creatures, players will get to make new kinds of tactical decisions.&#10;&#10;Every game of Soulbound comes with every card available. It also comes with two starter decks pre-configured so that players can learn that game before jumping in to the deck building aspect. In a box, 2 players can easily create two competitive decks. For the most competitive players, they may find they need a copy of the game for their own. With an abundance of available cards to build decks from, your ability to make the correct tactical decisions will be the biggest difference in a game. Skill should always determine the best player, not the player with the deepest pockets.&#10;&#10;Soulbound is played over a series of turns in which you, an Animan of the planet Duhra, command creatures in battle against other Animan to work your way up to the title of &quot;Soulbound&quot; and be entrusted with fighting back the darkness that escaped from Pandora's Tome. Utilising your own Soul Energy, you begin your turn by building up your resource to Call creatures to the field. Creatures are able to act the turn they are played to the field which creates a very high tempo game. Having a strong offence is just as important as having a strong defence, as your resource also acts as your life force. Throughout a game, it can be attacked and fluctuates because of that. No linear resource growth here.&#10;&#10;Through the many creatures' abilities and combat, players attempt to make tactical decisions to break through the opponent's defences and deal damage to the opponent's resource. A skillful players will be able to manage both their own resource and their opponent's resource to ensure they always can have the upper hand.&#10;&#10;With outstanding table presence, outstanding art, and outstanding gameplay, Soulbound will keep you engaged and constantly creating new combos in your head. In the end, the only thing that matters is dealing 60 Soul Damage to your opponent and claiming your spot among the Soulbound.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, you have to evade enemies and survive the elements long enough to scrounge together a search and rescue beacon to summon help. Your time on the ground will not be easy. The odds are against you.&#10;&#10;You may also be able to turn your misadventure into heroism if you can capture enemy intelligence, destroy some of their installations, or maybe find other MIA allies and return to safety with them.&#10;&#10;Or maybe you'll get eaten by a bear while trying to hide from a storm in a cave.&#10;&#10;IGD is a solitaire game driven by tables and cards. Inspired by games like Ambush! and Ranger, you will see the narrative of your Pilot's exploits unfold in front of you through a combination of cards drawn and tables rolled on. Careful planning and choices will be pitted against the vagaries of fate, and the wide range of available Event cards mean games can feel drastically different from one another. One game will be a ruthless hunt as you flee from dogged pursuers, another may be a battle against rains, wildfires and errant bombing runs, and the next may see the tables turned as you attack enemy installations with captured weapons.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The dread dragon Niddhoggr has devoured the roots of the World Ash, Yggdrasil, and the great tree has toppled onto its side, crashing the realms of mortal and supernatural together. With the gods dead and the fires of ruin consuming the world, your war clan of Viking warriors know what they must do to survive the destruction of the Nine Realms and restore order: they must become the new gods!&#10;&#10;Ragnarok is a campaign-driven skirmish game in which players form a Viking war clan seeking to prove itself worthy of becoming the new pantheon. The use of a mechanic called Godspark means that battles are no longer determined by merely striking an opponent and dealing damage. Instead, warriors will be pushing, throwing, and crashing their opponents around the battlefield, making their very environment a weapon. As the war clans develop, they may gain glorious new powers that will bring them closer to godhood, or win the respect of the denizens of the realms, allowing them to bring dire wolves, dwarves, and even the dreaded giants into their war clans. With strategic gameplay and epic storytelling, players must write their own sagas and tell of how their war clans have, through blood and steel, clawed their way up from ruin to stand before the halls of Valhalla.&#10;&#10;",

The game can rely on three great features: amazing miniatures, an original and extremely competitive gameplay, historical accuracy at its highest level for what concerns this specific topic.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds. To begin with, each player must select which cards (minimum 1) they will play during the current round. Each card represents specific moves and maneuvers the gladiators can perform. The original FightHex System integrates all the information about orientation, armor and view directly on the miniatures' bases!&#10;&#10;The round begins: the players must choose, alternatively, which move their gladiators will perform, trying their best to predict and counter the opponent's movements. At the end of each round all cards will be refreshed.&#10;&#10;As soon as two miniatures are engaged, combat begins! Use Combat tiles to Defend or Attack a specific area of your opponent: block enemy attacks and penetrate their guard. In this phase, predicting where your opponent is going to hit and where they will block is essential! If your opponent's Defense tile does not match your Attack tile... your attack is a success, pull out a Damage token from the bag!&#10;&#10;The Summa Rudis tracks Crowd Favor. Both if you penetrate the enemy's guard or block their attacks, move it towards your side. You win immediately if the Summa Rudis reaches the last space on your side of the track, or if at the end of the 15th round the Summa Rudis is on your side of the track!&#10;&#10;The game can be played in two modes: Duel (1 Vs 1) and Melee (1 to 6 players). Moreover, each type of gladiator has four experience levels featuring special moves and techniques!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hindsight: 2020 is a real-time cooperative dice-drafting puzzle game for 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you will select two dice of the same color from a grid of 36--the first, the ACTION DIE, determines your main action by its position and your bonus action by its value; the second die, the POWER DIE, determines the strength of first action. You will use the actions to manipulate the puzzle tiles, to alter the dice in the grid (for future turns), and to manage the timer. The adjustable difficulty level will keep you on your toes for play after play as your team gets better at solving the puzzle quickly. Thinky and frantic, saving the world has never been so fun.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;The apocalypse is upon us! If only we&rsquo;d seen it coming. Luckily for the rest of humanity, you&rsquo;ve just finished the prototype for your new time-intervention device. Alas, it&rsquo;s a little unstable and unreliable--it is a prototype, after all. You&rsquo;ve figured out what intervention is needed to stop the apocalypse, but it takes some tinkering to get the machine aligned so your operatives can make those changes. You have just a couple minutes to find the right configuration of your machine to send back our intervention agents and save the world. Can you finish before the apocalypse arrives? Time to find out.&#10;&#10;Saving the world, as fast as you can. The game has two play areas, a 6 by 6 dice grid, and a tile tableau. The dice grid has twelve actions you may take, one for each row and one for each column. At the top of the tile area are six &ldquo;keystone&rdquo; tiles numbered 1-6, representing the code you need to match. In an array of 36 tiles below the keystone line are columns of similar tiles.&#10;&#10;When you select your Action die, you place it at the end of either the row or the column, indicating which action you intend to take. Then you select your Power die, another die of the same color, and place it on the Power die space outside the grid. The action you selected is augmented by the Power die, and allows you to manipulate the tile tableau or the dice grid. After you take your main action, you get a secondary action determined by the value of the action die you took. These secondary actions allow you to flip the sand timer and add more dice to the grid, among other things.&#10;&#10;To solve the puzzle, you need to manipulate the tiles so that the top of each column matches the keystone number above it. When the number matches, you can &ldquo;lock&rdquo; that combination in place, triggering the bonus (or penalty) card attached to that column. You win if you are able to lock all six columns before you run out of dice or timer flips. Of course, if you ever let the timer run out, you also lose.&#10;&#10;This is how the world ends:&#10;Accompanying Hindsight: 2020 is a thematic website that uses your six-digit keystone code to reveal what happened to cause the apocalypse, and how your team did or did not succeed in preventing the end of the world.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Air supremacy was a constant challenge during World War II. In the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe's powerful Stukas were a key component to the German's blitzkrieg strategy that led them to victory. Over the English Channel, the heroism of RAF pilots saved their country from an invasion. In the skies of Kursk, Smolensk and Stalingrad, many Soviet pilots defended their land against German bombs. And when the Allied forces landed in Europe, it was under a constant aerial cover of fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers. At that time, Allied air supremacy was at its pinnacle.&#10;&#10;In the Memoir '44: New Flight Plan expansion, players can deploy air units such as fighters, fighter-bombers and even bombers to support their troops on the battlefield. This is not the first time airplanes will make an appearance in the Memoir '44 system, but with its all new set of streamlined rules, Memoir '44: New Flight Plan grants many new tactical options and is compatible with all existing scenarios in all theaters of operation. The expansion also comes with 21 new scenarios and 16 finely-crafted, legendary planes, in impressive sizes, such as the B-17 that measures 72mm by 101mm.&#10;&#10;",

First everyone works on building their doujinshi, working to get one each of Title, Cover, Element, and Genre cards. If you have two of the same card, you can turn one to the dark side (usually worth negative points) and force it on to an opponent. After one person has one of each card on the Light Side you move on to the Event Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Event Phase, it's finally the big day of the convention and everyone tries to sell their doujinshi. While base points are decided in the first phase, in the Event phase a variety of surprises can change everything around.&#10;&#10;",

Using the slang one can only learn by being a proud New Zealander. Just like classic Scrabble, players earn points by forming interlocking words, cross-word fashion, using letter tiles with various score values. In a fun twist, the specially designed Kiwi Scrabble game board features &quot;YEAH NAH&quot; spaces -- if a player forms a word crossing one or more of these, they'll get to draw a &quot;YEAH NAH&quot; card that offers an advantage over their opponents. Also included is a Kiwi Word List, displaying heaps of Kiwi-specific slang and definitions to help you get creative with your word play. Play any word on this list to earn extra points that could help you win the game!&#10;&#10;Includes game board, 100 letter tiles, 36 cards, 4 racks, cotton tile pouch (Which is Black only for the Kiwis), word list and rule book.&#10;&#10;",

What are those categories, and how is an answer correct? Read on...&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the yellow, green, and red loops so that they overlap like a Venn diagram and form seven specific regions: yellow-only, yellow-and-green, all three colors, etc. Each player represents one of these colors. Each player chooses a category in secret, with the category being something that can easily divide answers into &quot;belongs&quot; or &quot;does not belong&quot;. Examples might be things with four legs, foods, games by Reiner Knizia, things you can cut, and school subjects. Each player writes something that belongs in their category, then the other two players move those answers to the proper region. (If you're yellow, for example, you must give an answer that belongs in the yellow category, but that answer might also belong in the red or green category as well.)&#10;&#10;Following this set-up, on a turn one player places a token in one of the seven regions, e.g., inside the red and green categories but outside the yellow one. Each player now gives an answer that matches the status of their own category, then the other players say whether or not your answer is placed in their categories or not. If your answer fits within the proper region, then you score a point and leave the colored portion of your answer sheet visible; if it's not in the proper region, then you hide the colored portion (to show that you don't score), but leave the answer visible to give information to other players.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 1 point in all seven regions or to score 8 points total wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We are all Fools on our journeys through this world. It&rsquo;s dangerous to go alone. Take this game with you.&#10;&#10;Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game (or FoF) is based on the Tarot, in use since the 14th century for games and since the 17th century for divination. The art for Fellowship of Fools dates back to 1761 to its creation in France by Nicolas Conver de Marseilles and is called the Tarot de Marseilles. Today, Tarot cards are widely used  for game playing, creativity, divination and personal development. Our hope is that FoF can turn that inward reflection of the Tarot outward to help players develop friendships.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve split the Tarot deck into its two parts&mdash;-the Major Arcana for Situations and the Minor Arcana for Topics. On each card are two different prompts&mdash;-corresponding to the upright and the reversed meaning of the card. Numbers next to the prompts indicate their difficulty, possible points that can be gained or lost for playing that prompt, as well as the number of Topic Prompts that can be played for that Situation Prompt.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to play Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game: solo, with two players, or with multiple players. We encourage players to experiment with the cards and find their own ways to play. Visit to our Gamplay page to see the many ways to play, then experiment with the game and submit your own ways to play!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game you play as a &quot;pooplord&quot; of a preselected kingdom. Your goal is to grow up your animals from &quot;Puppy&quot; stage to &quot;Wise&quot; stage. How? You have 3 types of cards: Animals, Kingdoms and Extras. Animals are your creatures, your babies, you take care of them. Each animal belongs to a kingdom. There are 6 Kingdom cards: Alpacas, Flamingos, Pandas, Unicorns, Sloths and Dinosaurs. Your goal is to own 3 animals of your kingdom on your field, complete of their &quot;poop markers&quot; aka being Wise. Extra cards can help you doing that! EXTRAS are 2 different types: TRICKS (can be used unlimitedly and in any moment) and TREATS (can be played max 2 per turn unless specified otherwise). Each turn has different phases. The first thing you want to do is to position &quot;poop markers&quot; on your animals card (does not apply in the first player's first turn). You get 1 poop marker per animal. Then you draw 2 cards, choosing between the 2 decks (animals deck, extras deck), the combination is up to you (1/1, 2/0, 0/2). You can play a maximum of 2 cards per turn, if there aren't cards in your field allowing you to play more. Playing cards, the player should try to prevent opponents to stack poop markers on animals while trying to fully stack his own animals. The winner is the first player owning 3 wise animals on his field. During the &quot;stacking poop&quot; phase, poop markers can't be prevented, so be sure to clean up the poop you want to delete before the next player's turn's begin (before your ending phase, to be clear). All this stuff fits into funny artworks and weird characters!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A terrible drought has struck a bountiful jungle and all the animals are left with no food to eat. Jungle wardens' airplanes are parachuting food packages to the animals, but each animal prefers its own kind of food! To complicate the matters further, all packages look the same and animals first need to open them to see what's inside. All the animals rush wildly for the clearings where food packages appear...&#10;&#10;The object of Jungle Chase is to collect as many food packages as possible before they run out. Players do so by controlling six animals each of varying strength on a hexagonal board representing a jungle with clearings and landing spots for food packages. On their turn, players roll two six-sided dice to determine which animals may move one space each, with doubles enabling special moves. When animals of opposing players meet the stronger animal chases its opponent off the board.&#10;&#10;Contents of food packages are hidden from players and a player whose animal enters the package space may look at it without revealing the contents to other players. If the food is appropriate for the animal, the player may now collect it. When all packages, whose number is determined at the beginning of the game, have been collected the player with the most food is the winner.&#10;&#10;Jungle Chase is a &quot;classical&quot; board game with game pieces, dice and a board with a very deliberate old-school feel and yet quite modern in it's final execution in terms of tempo, duration etc. Basic mechanics and inherent logic are quite simple and yet the game strives to offer enough depth for an adult to enjoy the game as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Be warned, trucking is a competitive business. As you race to haul more loads than anyone else, keep an eye on the other truckers.&#10;&#10;The trucker who delivers all of their dedicated loads first, ends the game. However, the trucker who delivers the most loads to cities in need will win the game, so plan well and get Haulin&rsquo;!&#10;&#10;",

All player roles are non-gender specific.&#10;&#10;Needed to play:&#10;5 cards, 9 cubes and 1d6 inside a d6&#10;&#10;In this game, both players are playing cooperatively. Your goal is to move your player markers from their starting spaces to the &lsquo;Together&rsquo; spaces, at the end of the game board, during your shared turn. If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Place the two halves of the game board so that the sides marked A face each other. Place the 2 player markers on their respective               starting spaces at the end of the board. Place each of the 4 Hobgoblins of Sadness markers on the 4 black squares. Place 1 on the board&rsquo;s time track. Lastly, each player should choose one side of a personality card and place a marker, in their &#10;matching color, on the [8] space of their energy track.&#10;&#10;Players play:&#10;One player rolls the die in a die. Each player then chooses one of die roll results to apply to either movement or energy.&#10;&#10;For each 6 rolled, move the marker on the time track down 1 number. Remember: if the marker on time track on reaches 0, you have both lost the game.&#10;&#10;Movement is either left or right, forward or back, never diagonally (unless a special action allows this).&#10;&#10;At any time during their shared turn, each player may use the special action listed on their card. Reduce the energy on your card&rsquo;s track to pay for this, as specified by the special action. Your energy levels may never go above 8 or below 0. Remember: if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you have both lost the game.&#10;&#10;Players may move to a space occupied by a Hobgoblin. If, at any time, a player&rsquo;s marker is on the same space as a Hobgoblin, they may spend 2 energy to send the Hobgoblin back to a starting space of their choice.&#10;&#10;Hobgoblins of Sadness play:&#10;All Hobgoblins of Sadness now move 2 spaces - left, right, forward or back, never diagonally. Players will always move the Hobgoblins towards the player marker nearest to a Hobgoblin&rsquo;s position. If both player markers are equally distant, move the Hobgoblin to the player with the most energy. If still tied, move them towards the player of your choice.&#10;&#10;If a Hobgoblin moves to a player&rsquo;s space they will reduce that player&rsquo;s energy by 1 or 2.&#10;&#10;Next Turns and Game End: &#10;Players now move or gain energy on their shared turn, followed by the Hobgoblins movement. If both players enter their final &lsquo;Together&rsquo; spaces at the same time, during their shared turn, they win the game and have found their way to Together.&#10;&#10;If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;A new game in the &quot;Gameshop&quot; series.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood of Empires is a game of a grand strategy set in the ancient Mediterranean region, starting in 264 BC. It is for 2-4 players and takes about 2-3 hours to play. It is a card driven game where each player is dealt a hand of cards to play during a round that will allow them to take different actions in the game that also act as a fog of war. The simple rules make play easy but there is depth to the strategy and the players constantly have meaningful choices to make.&#10;&#10;Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC his empire has fragmented, the two most powerful factions being to the east; the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt. Meanwhile Rome has been solidifying its hold of the Italian peninsula and the Carthaginians have become the dominant trade and naval power of the western Mediterranean. Historically, 264 BC was the year the first Punic War began between Rome and Carthage. Many other wars followed and by 188 BC Rome had defeated, contained or occupied her foes.&#10;&#10;In this game each player takes on the role of one of the four major factions; Rome, Carthage, Egypt or the Seleucid Empire and will fight so that they can become the dominant power. Players will try to expand their territory, manoeuvre their armies and defeat their enemies in battle.&#10;&#10;Empires will pay in blood to rise or fall. How will history unfold this time?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Vector Wars is a 2-player area domination game based on a 9 square board known as The Grid. You place one of your 9 character cards face-down, which gives little to no information to your opponent as to the strength of the card placed. These cards flip to give you an individual flip ability, which you may use to battle to keep control of the grid. Your job is to try and gain the most victory points by maintaining a tactical advantage over your opponent, which will ultimately gain you the victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At Phrasenfuchs it is important to recognize the phrase you are looking for as soon as possible. Not so easy, because you were alienated from six different species. So it may happen that the keywords are replaced by the &quot;fox&quot;, a phrase is to be drawn or only the topic and a keyword from the phrase is known. It also appears that all players at the same time rate it. In turn, a player always reads a phrase card. The color of the phrase card specifies the task. For example, crucial words in the read phrase are reversed or only snippets are read. The goal of the teammates is always the same: guess the phrases as fast as possible. Whoever manages to be the first to score points and pulls his character forward. And when the first goal is achieved, you win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crossword puzzles with a difference: Kross the Wordz allows each player to choose one letter in turn, which everyone must then use. Quite tricky, if the sideline wants a Y, which now does not fit in their own word plans. Although one can also expose a disagreeable letter, but that gives negative points, and - of course - the longer the word, the more points there are.&#10;&#10;Here's how it works:&#10;A player calls any letter. All players enter it on their block sheet. Everyone has a task card that they have to work on. The goal is to form as long and meaningful words as possible in order to fulfill the task. Whoever succeeds best, gets many points. If you do not want to enter a letter, take a penalty card from the middle. Who has the most points in the end, wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
