    "Description": "Capes &amp; Chaos is an all new story universe of Superheroes and Master Villains brought to you by 2C Comics and designer Dan Hopkins. Set in the not too distant future of current day earth, devastated after an apocalyptic attack of aliens and demons, the grand opening of the Capes &amp; Chaos universe is revealed through this, the strategy card game. Included right out of the box are two full stand-alone versions, Basic Edition and Advanced Edition. Basic Edition plays as a &quot;medium-weight board game&quot; with fresh mechanics, and over 140 unique works of high quality art! Continuing right on top of Basic Edition, adding depth and enhancing strategy, Advanced Edition dives deeper into a &quot;dueling style&quot; card game, but with a twist! In Capes &amp; Chaos, while you are still competing against other players, you do not go head-to-head. Instead you will fight neutral opponents in a compelling mix of both new concepts and traditional elements of combat from tabletop RPGs. Capes &amp; Chaos is sure to deliver hours of hobby fun!&#10;&#10;In Capes &amp; Chaos: Strategy Card Game you are taking on the role of a &quot;Titan&quot;, the most powerful of superhuman heroes. Your deck of cards represents your superpowers and military assets for protecting your people and fighting against the overwhelming chaos threatening what little remains of civilization. As part of a larger effort to protect the last bastions of society, Titans fight to defeat enemies and complete missions on the battlefield. In order to promote greater success, a friendly competition has ensued among the Titans. Who can defeat the most dangerous foes while completing their missions the fastest? Race against your fellow Titans to accumulate the most Threat Points!&#10;&#10;As a Titan you will play with a constructed deck of &quot;Cape Cards&quot; and fight against a random assortment of &quot;Chaos Cards&quot; as the opposition of the game. Cape Cards do not have common card backs, each side is unique. One side shows the card's art, the other side shows the card's abilities. Basic Edition only uses the art side of the card, where as Advanced Edition uses both sides of the card.&#10;&#10;There are no rule variations between Advanced Edition and Basic. Advanced builds right on top of Basic Edition by adding additional rules. Therefore Basic is either a stepping stone to Advanced and must be learned first, or a separate game to be enjoyed on its own merits.&#10;&#10;Game length varies as the number of rounds to complete a game is determined by the players at the start of each game. At the end of the game, accumulated Threat Points are tallied to determine winner placements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players take the part of a gunslinger in a Wild West shootout in a card and dice game mixing strategy, memory, fast reactions and raw nerve. Six Gun Showdown comes with six characters with their own unique dice and set of 15 cards. Players can play single 1-on-1 duel, or for more than 2 players it is suited to knockout tournament play or a series of duels in a round robin format.&#10;&#10;In a duel, players choose six cards from their deck (15 at the start of the game) and lay them face down in front of themselves.&#10;Players then enter the staredown where they take alternate turns to choose then turn over a face down card, revealing either a Modifier card or a Draw card. The reveal of a Draw card indicates the player is entering the shooting phase by drawing their gun to shoot at their opponent, and can then prevent their opponent revealing their next card by touching one of their opponents cards before their opponent chooses their next card (which ought to be a Draw card if they want to shoot too!).&#10;The shooting phase is affected by whether one or both players get to resolve their shots (determined by reactions speeds to touching cards after  a Draw card is revealed). If both players managed to reveal a Draw card, they compare speed values(total from Draw and Modifier cards), with highest value shooting first. Players hit their opponent with a shot by rolling their dice and adding this to their accuracy value (total from Draw and Modifier cards), requiring a total of 6 and higher or &quot;hit&quot; symbol. &#10;Then, at the end of each round, players discard the cards they revealed in the round and can choose their next six cards from any of their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;Players score 1 point for hitting their opponent, with a bonus 1 point if they revealed their Draw card second. Play lasts for 3 rounds (4 only to resolve any ties after 3) and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With enough wealth you will eventually unlock new ships to help you take out giant, ore encrusted asteroids in search of the fabled rare metals that will make you all filthy rich!&#10;&#10;At any point during your solo campaign (or as a stand alone, heads up match), another player can take control of a band of raiders (with their own custom ships) and try to steal the miners ore and potentially capture their ships.&#10;&#10;I am hoping this game could evolve with expansions full of new ships for the miners and raiders alike, along with even bigger asteroids to truly take mining operations to be next level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of a three in one game system, MAG-Wars is a magnetic spaceship, battling game for 2 players (or 4 with an extra copy and a large tabletop).&#10;&#10;In MAG-Wars, players choose either miners or raiders and build a small skirmish unit of ships with which to battle each other (based on the encounter&rsquo;s points value and theme).&#10;&#10;Before the battle can begin, the environment must be set.&#10;&#10;Of the three games in this overall, magnet based system, both MAG-Wars and MAG-Miners will use a procedurally generated system to make sure each arrangement of asteroids and space debris is completely unique.&#10;&#10;Once the environment has been set, players will each draw three hidden objective cards and battle will commence:&#10;&#10;1.Players line up their ships on opposing table edges.&#10;&#10;2.To decide who goes first, both players choose one of their ships and simultaneously flick them across the table.&#10;The player who flicks closest to their opponents side of the table without going off is the winner and goes first.&#10;Note: There will be practice mini games available in MAG-Skills (the third game in this system) which will help players perfect their flicking power and accuracy.&#10;3. The first player flicks all of their ships once.&#10;4. The second player then flicks all of their ships once.&#10;5. Play continues like this with each player only being able to flick their mobile ships (right way up).&#10;&#10;Beyond flicking to move, spaceships in MAG-Wars can do a number of different things. Here is a list of some of the potential actions that can be declared during a battle:&#10;&#10;A. Attack - You can flick a ship at an enemy and if it makes contact, that enemy ship loses power and is immobilised (placed with its tail end down on the table).&#10;B. Assist - If you have an immobilised ship on the table, you may declare assist, rotate that ship to the angle required and then flick a ship at it to try and knock it back down (power it up). If successful, that ship may be flicked this turn as normal (chaining multiple assist flicks can potentially power your entire team back up in one turn).&#10;C. Repair - Some ships need only make contact with a powered down ship to be able to power it back up and get it flicking again.&#10;D. Dock - Certain ships have the ability to dock with other ships. If this is declared and the flick successfully makes contact with an appropriate target (varies per ship), then the two become docked together.&#10;A docked ship can be:&#10;- Towed to its enemy&rsquo;s portal and captured (removing it from the game),&#10;- Boarded and looted,&#10;- Did I mention these ships TRANSFORM!!!&#10;Well actually they can be combined together in various different combinations. Should a player declare &lsquo;dock&rsquo; and then make contact to the appropriate ship, the two ship models can be temporarily combined to form a &lsquo;Hyper Ship&rsquo; with a very powerful and unique ability.&#10;&#10;To win the game you must either:&#10;Knock/have all your opponent&rsquo;s ships immobilised,&#10;Fulfill all three of your hidden objective cards,&#10;Have the highest total ore value when all ore has been collected.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gettysburg covers the full three days of the battle, with each game turn equivalent to 2&frac12; hours of daylight or one night. The map spans the historic battlefield and surrounding terrain, divided into 800-meter hexes. Counters represent the military units that fought in the battle, divisions for the Confederates and corps for the Union. Special markers represent leaders and artillery concentration. Event cards bring to life the notable moments of the battle, upsetting the perfect plans of the player and giving the game exceptional replay value.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the game system are fatigue and army morale. Units cannot sustain combat continually and will wear out if pressed too hard. Maintaining a reserve of troops to plug gaps in the line is critical. As units rout and break, or if their line of communications is cut, the morale of their army plummets. If you can drive the opposing army&rsquo;s morale to zero, they quit the field and you win a &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; victory.&#10;&#10;A match takes no more than 90 minutes, making the game suitable for beginners and old hands alike.&#10;&#10;Published in July 2023 by MMP as the wargame within Special Ops #11 magazine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2.5 hours (daytime) &amp; 9 hours (nighttime)&#10;Hex: 800 yards / 732 meters&#10;Units: division to corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (40 3/4&quot; game counters, 72 5/8&quot; game counters plus 14 3/4&quot; &amp; 16 5/8&quot; blank counters)&#10;Sixteen event cards &#10;One 8-page rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1 - 1.5 hours&#10;&#10;",

The goal of providing faster play is in keeping with the desires and interests of the younger generation.&#10;&#10;MicroGammon is not just an update to traditional backgammon but is also unique enough to have received a US patent.&#10;&#10;An important feature of MicroGammon is that the rules are fundamentally the same as they are for the normal backgammon game.  &#10;If you know how to play backgammon, you already know how to play MicroGammon!&#10;&#10;Another important and fun feature of MicroGammon is the novel dice that are used, which allow for game compression to speed things up as described below.&#10;&#10;MicroGammon is basically 2/3 of a normal backgammon game having 16 points instead of 24 points, 10 checkers instead of the normal 15 and using 4 sided dice (shown below) rather than the traditional 6 sided dice. The result is a game that is much faster paced and more volatile with doubles occurring 50% more often (1 in 4 rolls compared with 1 in 6 roles for cubic dice).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This game is our way of bringing attention to the problem --while keeping a sense of humor.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Mansplain It!&nbsp;was created with the ability to play it in two completely separate styles-- competitive OR cooperative. Mansplain It!'s unique blend of teamwork, on-the-spot action and game play make it infinitely reuseable and replayable.&nbsp;Mansplain It!&nbsp;is based on a complicated and nuanced system of points, guessing and drinking as much wine as possible until you get bored and watch more Vine compilations.&#10;&#10;Each deck of&nbsp;Mansplain It!&nbsp;comes with 200 concept cards with informative (and actually researched) facts about each subject. Learning CAN be fun, kids! It also includes 100 rebuttal cards to spice up your game play and the instruction manual to get you started.&#10;&#10;Game play is designed around trying to earn as many points as possible while firing back WellActually cards that can do everything from end a turn to completely eliminate all earned points within the game.&#10;&#10;Using your Topic Card, you will spew forth every fact, figure and every piece of bullshit trivia knowledge you can on the topic.

If you happen to say one, a player may choose to play their card and steal your spotlight for a chance to win points. Players may choose to save their WellActually card for another instance, betting that your mansplaining ass will repeat yourself at least once before the timer runs out, or play it immediately to shut you up. HOWEVER&mdash; if they DO steal --&nbsp;they must keep talking as well.&nbsp;They are now saddled with the responsibility of Mansplaining on your chosen topic.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&ldquo;But&nbsp;Mansplain It!&nbsp;What if my superior male brain avoids all virulent vocab, vanquishing these vocal villains?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;the deck is stocked with over a whole bunch of&nbsp;F***You cards that can impact game play immediately.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Cards include:&nbsp;&#10;&#10;     The Glass Ceiling- Everyone at the table loses 20% of their points.&nbsp;&#10;     #blessed- Everyone at the table must post to Instagram immediately or lose all of their points.&nbsp;&#10;     Triggered&trade;- You&rsquo;re offended. Player immediately loses their turn. All points are forfeited.&nbsp;&#10;     Money Where Your Mouth Is: Player may only continue if they make a charitable donation to a women&rsquo;s rights organization.

If the vote is not unanimous, their turn ends. All points are forfeited.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&#10;The action of Mansplaining/Rebuttal happens as many times as possible in the 30-second window. Again&mdash;the victor is the last person talking when the timer runs out. They win the points for that round, and it starts all over again. That&rsquo;s it!

There are 4 distinct zones on the board:&#10;1 - Inside&#10;2- close shot&#10;3 - long shot&#10;4 - midfield&#10;In each cell only 1 player of the same team can be placed and in the 'inside' area, only friendly player can be placed, simulating the 3 seconds rule.&#10;&#10;Players have 3 attributes, Defence, Attack and Rebound. DF and AF have 4 values, from 1 to 4 growing, RF is from 1 to 10 with the higher the better.&#10;&#10;You can play typical defense tactics like in real basketball, and movement of player is asynchronous with the one of the ball.&#10;&#10;The game has been developed and published in 1981, so it is obviously feeling the age.&#10;&#10;The player are simple cardboard figures on a plastic base, as well as the ball. There are no basket or any other element in 3D apart of the players themselves.&#10;&#10;It remarks more on the fidelity to the rules and the game more than the look.&#10;&#10;It can be played in 2 players, normally and a game typically lasts from 40 to 60'.&#10;&#10;The game is not language dependent for the set, but the rules are only in Italian.&#10;&#10;",

The Polish 1st Armored Division crosses German positions on the Dives river and in a truly cavalry style, moves towards the town of Chambois and the Hill 262 - Mont Ormel. In this way, the Poles blocked the only escape route for German troops locked in the so-called Falaise Pocket.&#10;&#10;The game Hill 262 - Chambois, 19 - 21 August 1944 presents the Allied fights during closing and defending the Falaise Pocket. The main hero is the 1st Armored Division of general Stanis&#197;&#130;aw Maczek. In addition, there are American and Canadian units.&#10;There are 6 scenarios in the game. 4 of them are short clashes to familiarize yourself with the procedures of the system &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot;. The main subject is the defense of the Allies and German attempts to get out of the pocket. The chaotic organization of the German army in this battle is shown in a simple way. At the beginning of the game a German player chooses battle groups that he will try to move out of the board. The Allied player does not know the opponent's plans. Only during the game it turns out which units appear in the game. Thanks to that every gameplay is different and the game provides a lot of emotions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On turn each player rolls a d6 die and move one of their pawn along a spiral of 48 colored spaces. The goal is to reach the center space. The catch is that the board consists of two layers: An upper visible layer with holes, one for each space, for the slim pawns to rest in, and a lower layer with seven holes allowing a pawn to drop out of the game. Before playing, the lower layer is randomly rotated and flipped relative to the visible top layer. The players are only allowed to have two pawns at the board at the same time. A disappeared pawn is out of the game. If a player loses all their pawns the player is eliminated. Thus, players tries to remember the positions of the bottomless pits to avoid losing all pawns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Starting a new life, striking it rich, and escaping the law. There are your typical conflicts as well, water, money, land, women, fighting, killing, and just general out west rowdiness.

Boredom leads to other activities too, you probably know what I mean.&#10;This big as the western sky story has just about everything you&rsquo;d expect in a western, plus some mysterious cursed tunnels, cattle, and murder happens.

West of Elsenborn Ridge, near the cities of Li&egrave;ge and Spa, Belgium, was a vast array of Allied supplies and the well-developed road network leading to the Meuse River and Antwerp. The Germans planned on using two key rollbahns or routes through the area to seize Antwerp and force a separate peace with the United States and Britain. Capturing Monschau and the nearby village of H&ouml;fen, and the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt just east of Elsenborn Ridge, were key to the success of the German plans, and Hitler committed his best armored units and infantry troops to the area, including the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend.&#10;&#10;The green, untested troops of the 99th Infantry Division had been placed in the sector during mid-November because the Allies thought it was an area unlikely to see battle. Their soldiers were stretched thin over a 22-mile front, and all three regiments were on line, with no reserve. In early December, the 2nd Infantry Division was assigned to capture a vital crossroads marked by a customs house and a forester&rsquo;s lodge named Wahlerscheid, at the southern tip of the Battle of H&uuml;rtgen Forest. They transitioned through the 99th division's lines and after a deadly, costly battle, capturing the crossroads. But the Germans counterattacked in what the Americans initially thought was a localized spoiling action, but was actually a leading element of the Battle of the Bulge. The 2nd ID consolidated their lines, pulling back into H&uuml;nningen, and then to the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt, and finally at the dug-in positions held by the 99th ID at Elsenborn Ridge.&#10;&#10;What you get in ATS Battle of the Twin Villages:&#10;&#10;ALL the combat counters you need to play&#10;New, large-hex winterized map for the historical battlefield&#10;Color Battlefield Walkaround rules in 3-hole format&#10;Color scenario format, bloody warm red you know the drill!&#10;Monster scenario to tie it all together without all that ordering from a Chinese restaurant menu &gt; they were there, you plop them down and get rolling!&#10;AFV Cards for all the AFVs in the module&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can move one step across normal terrain, pay two points to move through mountains, or you can move as far as you want along a river for free. When you add a card it has to be on a space next to your pawn and any rivers must line up. You get points equal to the number on the card (1, 2, or 3, with higher point cards being more complicated) for every edge that perfectly matches what you put it against. If no edges match you can still play the card but it's worth negative points equal to its face value. If you can't play a card at all, you have to discard one face down, which is worth triple negative points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once during the game you must play a castle. This costs ten points, but at the end of the game you get points for the card under your castle and the four neighboring cards. Castles must be built at least two cards apart, so building in the right place can also deny other players points. When moving, castles and pawns both allow you charge tolls for anyone passing through, which is the best way to get a point advantage over other players.&#10;&#10;Explore the countryside, build your castle in the right place, and see if you can become the richest Lord of Shinano.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have a &quot;blast&quot; and take aim as players &quot;pie&quot; their opponent with a cannon full of whipped cream! To start Pie Face Cannon!, one player steps up and places their face in the facemask, while the other player aims the cannon and tries to launch whipped cream onto their opponent's face. The player behind the mask can try to avoid getting &quot;pie-faced&quot; by using the included blocking hand. Players can earn points by either blocking themselves or by successfully &quot;pie-ing&quot; their opponent. The first player to score five points wins.&#10;&#10;Whipped cream not included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you overcome the voice-jamming challenge in Speech Breaker? You're reporting live from the scene! Put on the game headset, talk into the game microphone, and get your teammates to guess who/what/where without saying any of the words on the cards. What's the catch? The microphone jams your speech with a built-in delay. As you talk, you hear your delayed voice through the game headset, making it harder to speak clearly. For example, how would you report that &quot;an alien is swinging kettlebells in a glass house&quot; without saying any of those words &mdash; and in just 30 seconds &mdash; with your speech jammed?&#10;&#10;",

There are only five days left before the final battle - can you defeat the enemy and become a legendary hero?&#10;&#10;Long ago the Dragon Princess broke a taboo and had a child with a human. The &quot;Sin&quot; was a target for all the monsters in the world, and to defend her child the Dragon Princes descended into the Abyss. After an unimaginably long time, the Abyss transformed the Dragon Princess into a monster, and she's coming to reclaim her child and destroy the world in the bargain. You have just five days to defeat her.&#10;&#10;Each round has three phases: card acquisition, playing units, and deciding whether to challenge the monster. A number of cards equal to the numbers of players is dealt face-up, and everyone reveals which one they want at the same time. If there are any conflicts, the start player for the round decides how to resolve that, and it doesn't have to be fair. Next you play units that add to your battle strength. Some units can be played for free, but advanced units will require spending mana of right color from weaker units. Finally you decide if you're ready to challenge the monster. You only get to do this once, so you want to wait until you're strong enough, but not so long someone else beats the monster first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
