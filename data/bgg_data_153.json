    "Description": "Gun and Gun is an anime-themed card game from Japanese design studio Keepdry that features competitive one-versus-one battles, a distinct two-deck draft system, and gorgeous Japanese sci-fi art!&#10;&#10;In Gun and Gun, players assume the role of one of the game's many Gunners and equip their character with two guns available to them. Once selections have been made, it&rsquo;s a frenetic race to kill each other by reducing either their opponent&rsquo;s life points or their deck size to zero.&#10;&#10;A single copy of Gun and Gun is enough for two players to get right into the gun-wielding action; however, some may wish to use more than one set. Playing with one copy provides a more traditional board game experience with a surprising amount of strategy involved in choosing characters and guns.&#10;&#10;Playing with two sets, however, ups the intensity and overall competitive nature of the game, allowing for an experience that is closer to that of a constructed card game, where players construct their own decks. Either playstyle is a blast, but we would recommend playing with one set first in order to get used to the gameplay and to learn about the strengths and limitations of each character and gun, before moving into the more competitive side of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Korean War: June 1950 - May 1951, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by Joseph Balkoski first published in 1986, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. Hailed by many as of the premier games covering The Korean War, this two-player operational level simulation covers the first year of the Korean conflict, from June 1950 to May 1951.&#10;&#10;During this period, the United States found itself involved in a bitter struggle in a remote Asian land that many Americans had not even heard of. Amid the debacles and stunning victories of the first year of war, the very foundation of the American military system &mdash; so recently triumphant in the Second World War &mdash; was severely shaken. In a war that few Americans understood and which historians have tended to ignore, the foundation of future American diplomacy in the face of communism was laid.&#10;&#10;The players control ground and air forces of the United Nations, North Korea, and Communist China. Each player's force consists of a wide variety of units, including infantry, marines, paratroopers, armor, and aircraft. The map is a 1:750,000 representation of the Korean peninsula from Pusan in the south to the Yalu River in the north. In addition to controlling military forces, the players must make a number of political decisions that have an important effect on the game. Above all, the UN player must strive to keep international tensions at a minimum for the purpose of preventing World War Three. Intense escalation and mobilization could have disastrous consequences for the militarily-unprepared United States. On the other hand, insufficient force applied to Korea could lead to the conquest of South Korea by North Korean communists.&#10;&#10;This edition of The Korean War features a super-sized map and larger counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature edition of the classic Joseph Balkoski game goes beyond merely incorporating errata found from the original edition; it includes enhancements that include:&#10;&#10;     Larger and easier-to-read 9/16&rdquo; counters and three game maps&#10;     Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork&#10;     Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts&#10;     Restrictions on UN build-up and breakdown so UN player cannot perpetually continue Action Phase by reorganizing units&#10;     Modified amphibious assault system that allows UN player to more effectively recreate September 1950 Inchon invasion&#10;     Modified victory conditions that lessen impact of Global Tension&#10;     New random events to make the operation a bit more unpredictable&#10;     Updated rules treatment backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions.&#10;     Updated historical notes&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: 7 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (landing options; no hidden units)&#10;&#10;Time Scale: one month per turn&#10;Map Scale: 7.5 miles per hex&#10;Unit Scale: battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions&#10;&#10;Players: one to two, best with two or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours depending upon scenario, 20+ hours for campaign&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Four map sheets (42.5&quot; x 71&quot;overall map dimension)&#10;    Three countersheets (9/16&quot; size)&#10;    Rules booklet with updated Historical Notes&#10;    Two charts and tables booklets&#10;    One ten-sided die&#10;    Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Falling victim to the law of overstretch, the Soviets were badly surprised and beaten back through the strong leadership and superior strategy on the part of the Germans.&#10;&#10;If Stalingrad had determined that the Germans could not win the war, then the Battle of Kharkov led them to think they had not yet lost. From the Battle's results, each side drew vastly different conclusions. The Germans were determined to renew the offensive, to finish the uncompleted victory cut short by the thaw. The Soviets were determined to await the offensive, trap and immobilized the attacker, and then launch a massive counteroffensive of their own.&#10;&#10;With over 1000 playing pieces, four maps, two rule books and in depth briefing material including historical review, from the Winter Storm Campaign Series this operational level game is the sequel to Winter Storm: Decision at Stalingrad by Vanguard Games and covers the campaign for Rostov and Kharkov in February-March 1943.&#10;&#10;The system features detailed supply rules similar to OCS, weak ZOCs that show the potential of infiltration and the effect of terrain, and a flexible sequence of play to show the principles of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BHARATA 600 BC is a multiplayer strategy board game set in the Indian subcontinent (Bharata) in 600 BC. This is the end of the Vedic period and the rise of the 16 Mahajanapadas (Great Kingdoms). Each player takes on the role of a Mahajanapada ruler, trying to make their kingdom the most predominant power in the ancient Bharata. Players get to decide how to lead their armies, gain and manage resources, and conquer territories to expand their kingdoms. At the same time, they have to protect their territories from rivals, natural disasters, and social events, such as riots. Players&rsquo; actions and achievements are rewarded with Victory Points that contribute to determining the game winner.&#10;&#10;Each player (or team) begins the game with a set of resources, two armies, and a different start location. In addition, players get to create their game avatars by choosing a combination of personality traits and abilities (variable powers), which can differ or be identical to other players&rsquo;. With each turn, players draw resources that are often linked to their previous decisions on resource pool management. Players may choose to convert their resources into Coins and use the Coins to increase their Army Strength or to conquer specific terrain types later in the game. Players use their two armies to move on the map, conquer territories through settlements or direct combat with other players, plan for attack or defence, gain regional resources and trade objects, and accomplish objectives. Events trigger natural disasters, diseases, or riots, which create an additional level of defence and resource planning. This is the time your ability traits become handy. They allow you to manoeuvre certain Events in your favour while at the same time, based on your play style, to make it harder on other players or the contrary, to help them out with their own Event scenarios.&#10;&#10;In BHARATA 600 BC, players have a great level of control over their play style and outcome. They can opt-in or out of a combat strategy, an objective-based strategy, a competitive or collaborative approach. As players find themselves in a dynamic game context, they have to adapt their strategy and choices to the evolving scenarios on the board.&#10;&#10;",

Skillfully unlock the best route up the ever-changing game board. Use strategy and tactics to jump over as many play pieces as you can, and prevent other players from getting to the top first by bumping them down.&#10;&#10;Spin, Climb, Jump, Bump; Be First to the Top&#10;&#10;GAME MATERIALS&#10;- Game Board &ndash; Six multi-colored rotatable rings, with 12 colored squares each and a black, stationary top level;&#10;- 18 Pawns &ndash; Three of each in six different colors &ndash; red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white;&#10;- Deck of Cards &ndash; 42 playing cards, as follows:&#10;   - 36 cards in six different colors and numbered 1, 2 or 3,&#10;   - Three &lsquo;any-color&rsquo; wild-cards, and&#10;   - Three &lsquo;unlimited-spin and any-color&rsquo; wild-cards.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME &#10;Move all three pawns up the six rings and enter them all onto the top stationary 7th level.  First to do this wins the game. Second, third and fourth place winners follow continuing the game until the last pawn reaches the top level.&#10;&#10;PAWN MOVEMENT &#10;- Pawns always move by one, up down or sideways, but never diagonally;&#10;- Two pawns cannot occupy the same color square&#10;&#10;Jumping &#10;- A pawn can jump over or &lsquo;leapfrog&rsquo; any pawn;&#10;- The number of pawns in a row that you can leapfrog is unlimited, provided that the color card played is the same color as the square that the pawn lands on; and&#10;- Jumping can start from the first move onto the board and even onto the top 7th level.&#10;&#10;Bumping &#10;- If the square above, adjacent or below is occupied, then you can bump that pawn directly down two levels, by playing the color card of that square and moving your pawn to the occupied square;&#10;- If another pawn occupies the square that your opponent&rsquo;s pawn dropped down to, then that pawn also drops down two levels and so on (even if they happen to be your own pawns);&#10;- You cannot leapfrog up to bump an opponent&rsquo;s pawn down two levels; and&#10;- Bumping is only possible by moving up one level, sideways or even down, if you choose to do so.&#10;&#10;CARD PLAY&#10;There are three types of cards in the deck:  &#10;1. Numbered color cards are the main cards used in playing the game.&#10;&#10;RING ROTATION&#10;- The number on a card is the number of squares that you can rotate a ring, 1, 2 or 3 either clockwise or counter-clockwise, as shown on the cards;&#10;- You can only rotate the ring level that your pawn is on; and&#10;- Rotating is optional, you can play the card as a color only card, but if rotating, then move the ring the same number of squares as the number shown on the card and always rotate the ring before playing the color.&#10;&#10;COLOR PLAY&#10;- The color on the card is the only square color that you can move a pawn to, when played;&#10;- If after rotating a ring, the square color above where the pawn arrives is the same as the color of the card, then you can climb up to that square, bump another pawn or leapfrog to a higher square of that same color, in a combination move. If not, then play a second color card if you have the color match.&#10;&#10;2. Any-color wild-cards, allow you to move one pawn up, down or to an adjacent square from where your pawn is positioned, regardless of the color of that square:&#10; - The card also allows your pawn to climb, jump and bump, as explained in Pawn Movement above and to move up to the final 7th level;&#10; - This card cannot rotate any rings.&#10;&#10;3. Unlimited-spin, any-color wild-cards, allow you to rotate one ring (optionally) any number of squares clockwise or counter-clockwise, provided that you have a pawn on that ring:&#10;- The card is subsequently also played as an any-color card, as described above.&#10;&#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;- Youngest player goes first;&#10;- Play one card per pawn move, starting off the board;&#10;- The square color on which you place your pawn must match the card color (wild-cards are any color);&#10;- Play all three of your cards in your hand, if possible;&#10;- You cannot bump another player off the bottom first level; and&#10;- After you have played as many of the three cards as you can play, your turn ends, you draw new cards for a total of three cards in your hand and the next player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;- From the 6th ring level, play any numbered card that matches the color of your pawns or any of the wild-cards to move up to the 7th safe level at the centre of the game board;&#10;- You can leapfrog over other pawns to make this move;&#10;- Your pawns cannot be removed, once they reach the top level; and&#10;- When all three pawns are at the top, you&rsquo;re done and if first to get there, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Seeds make fruits and fruits make sets! So pick your fruit with no regrets!&#10;&#10;In Fruit Picking the players become fruit farmers who will plant and pick fruit and trade them with Market Island. The goal is to collect a set of market cards, claiming the title from one of the 4 districts of Market Island.&#10;&#10;In more detail, during a turn a player will take all the seeds from one space on their fruit island board and then distribute them mancala-style in clockwise direction. The last space a player puts a seed on becomes their Pick farm for this turn. They then choose to either getting more seeds on their Pick farm or trading the same fruit as on their Pick farm with the Market Island by paying seeds and receiving a market card for that. If a player collects all cards of one of the 4 sets of market cards the game ends.&#10;&#10;This new edition features all new artwork, useful double-layered game boards and rules for solo play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The War of Jenkins&rsquo; Ear simulates the last major conflict in the Caribbean between England and Spain from about 1739 to 1748 (though it was largely eclipsed in Europe by the War of Austrian Succession at the time.) The actual underlying cause of the war was trading rights in the lucrative West Indies. After centuries of intermittent and reoccurring war between the English and Spanish, these two maritime powers had managed to work out a trade agreement that ended their conflicts but not their longstanding enmity. In April 1731, the captain of the Spanish caravel La Isabela intercepted and boarded an English brigantine (the Rebecca) near Jamaica that he suspected of being a smuggler. The brig&rsquo;s goods were looted and the English captain (Robert Jenkins) was consequently tortured throughout that day. When the Spanish captain (Juan Le&ograve;n Fandi&ntilde;o) hacked off Jenkins&rsquo; ear with a cutlass, he bridled, &ldquo;Go tell your king that the same will happen to him if he is caught doing the same.&rdquo; Beyond the bravado or even hubris that convoked such an utterance from el capit&aacute;n, it would reaffirm the old proverb, &ldquo;Death and life are in the power of the tongue&rdquo; because this flippant threat would indeed eventually reach the truculent King George II.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;S&amp;T #308, Nov-Dec 2017&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the end of June 1862, the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, leading the Army of Northern Virginia defeated the Army of the Potomac, commanded by the Union general George McClellan during the Seven Days Battles, thereby saving Richmond. Having put an end to the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula campaign, Lee decided to put pressure on Washington and regain the initiative. Though outnumbered, he would do his utmost to avoid the junction of the Union armies in the Eastern Theater. His first target was the new and inexperienced Army of Virginia led by the Union general John Pope. Lee dispatched General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (victorious in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of the previous winter)   to intercept the Union. The vanguard of both armies met in Culpeper County in Virginia. The Union general Banks positioned his artillery on the ridge near Cedar Mountain and a cannon battle ensued. The Confederate general Winder, leading the southerners, was mortally wounded in action, resulting in confusion and withdrawal for the south. Upon seeing this, Stonewall advanced the reserves and led the counter-attack himself. Faced with this unexpected wave, the Union line was broken and the soldiers retreated in disorder.&#10;&#10;As Jackson, will you be able to win the first battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign or will you change the course of history wearing Banks&rsquo; blue uniform?&#10;&#10;This game published in VaeVictis #153 uses the Civil War Brigade Battle system (Worthington Games).&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Complexity : 4/10&#10;Solo playability : 7/10&#10;Duration : 1 hour 30&#10;One turn = 40 minutes&#10;One counter = 1 brigade&#10;Scale : 200 meters&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Instead of delivering a fatal death blow that would give the Empire of Japan dominance of the Pacific region, the attack's ultimate consequence was to, in words attributed to Admiral Yamamoto, &quot;awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;&#10;&#10;In The Pacific War - From Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, two players face off in an epic struggle for control of the Pacific area of operations. In action from December 1941 to June 1944, the Japanese player uses his forces against the Allied forces from the United States, Great Britain, Australia and the Netherlands. Aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and land-based aircraft are all involved. With them, each player plans and conducts strategies out of a limited hand of resourcey cards to gain the initiative and defeat his enemy's forces and control crucial ports and bases across the Pacific. The Japanese are at their strongest at the beginning, and the Allies gain power and resources each turn. Few would debate Japan's chances of victory, but the goal of The Pacific War is to see whether the Japanese forces can achieve better military gains and delay its defeat. Or can the Allies win a quicker victory? It's up to the players to utilize their assets to turn the tide of the war!&#10;&#10;Man, your battle station . . . It's time to fight The Pacific War!&#10;&#10;",

Players also gain disciplines, which give them powerful supernatural abilities unique to their character. Lastly, teams will choose their ambitions, which allow for multiple paths to victory, such as being bloodthirsty, manipulative, greedy, or somewhere in between.&#10;&#10;Blood Feud is dubbed a &quot;Mega Board Game&quot; because unlike a traditional board game, it isn't played at a single table. Blood Feud requires a large room or two separate rooms with 2-4 tables. One game table features the Cityscape and Orders, the map where players move their forces around the city and order them to fight and take control of important territories. The other game table features the Council and Market, where players use their best diplomatic and resource management skills to make sly trades, buy upgrades and player level-ups, and make large political decisions that will shape the destinies of teams to determine whether they win or lose! In order to win the game, teams earn victory points through the completion of legacies, which are secret objectives that can consist of all sorts of tasks and achievements  earned through gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Now the next player going clockwise chooses one of the two dice left in the center of the table, without taking it, then uses the corresponding stamp, and so on, until everyone has stamped an animal onto their farm. The face of the dice showing the hay bale is a wild card; if you choose a die showing the hay bale, you can use any stamp.&#10;&#10;After all players have filled all the squares on their farms, the game ends. For each type of animal you have on your farm, count the largest group. For each animal in your largest group you score one point.&#10;&#10;The advanced mode adds the hay bale stamp, hedges on the board, and three random request cards with new ways to score points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The riskier, more difficult pot or the safer, easier one?&#10;&#10;The difficulty of each shot is calculated depending on the number of cards between the cue ball and the target pocket, whether there are any other balls in the way and the angle at which you hit the object ball. You have a Cue (upgradable) with a Power tracker as well as Chalk (needed for trickier shots). You can opt to apply extra power to reduce the shot difficulty, but both Cue Power and Chalk are limited resources that you'll need to manage. Then you roll two dice and if at least one of them scores equal or higher than the difficulty, the pot succeeds.&#10;&#10;Miss a shot and there's a chance your opponent will clear the table and win.&#10;&#10;",

Each village will sing of this glory to impress the other villagers for years to come.&#10;In this 2-6 player game, every bear village must maximize these deeds and actions each season before winter hiBEARnation. As the bear elder, you must instruct the bears in your village on these deeds!&#10;&#10;Each season consists of three turns that elders take simultaneously. First, roll your bear dice behind your village screen &ndash; keeping your bear plans secret from the other villages. Then give your bears their assignments using the different spaces on your village board, but be careful because only bears with matching skills can be assigned to the same space. Finally, in the order they appear on the village mat, each bear goes out to face their particular task!&#10;&#10;Glory is earned in many ways, most of which require gathering resources like honey and ore. Bears can also draft new bears into their village to gain more bear dice or hire mercenary bears for a single turn. Bears can raid nearby villages or defend their own home if they think the other villages may try and attack! Bears also love to adventure &ndash; but they have to beware of rival bears beating them to the punch!&#10;Once winter ends, the game ends, and the village that has accumulated the most glory is the victor of Tales of BarBEARia! Thanks for BEARing with me and PAWSing to read this, even if this summary is quite emBEARassing! Grab this game FURiously and forgive these unBEARable jokes. Now get your BEARings and look for a good BEARgain, and it&rsquo;s PAWSible you&rsquo;ll love this game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood on the Ohio presents the late 18th century struggle between a coalition of Indian tribes led by Little Turtle and the nascent American Army to determine control of the then Ohio territory. Known as the Northwest Indian War, Little Turtle's War and Washington's Indian War, this was the first major challenge to President Washington and his army following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. Spanning from 1785 to 1795, the conflict grew out of a dispute over territorial boundaries following the war, aggravated by settlers flooding across the Ohio to claim Ohio lands then in possession of Native American nations.  The Miami and Shawnee were the principal tribes involved but in time they created a loose alliance with numerous other tribes and together they dealt the U.S. the worst defeat by Indians in the history of our Indian Wars. Washington sent three separate expeditions against them. The first two were handily defeated. The third and final expedition led by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ended the conflict with his victory at The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.&#10;&#10;This design is similar to King Philip's War. It is point to point movement, using a three dice simultaneous battle system with variable reinforcements on both sides, special action points, alliances and treaties, and frustratingly undependable American militia. The American army operates out of forts, the Indians out of villages. Every two turns both players enter into quartering which in effect resets the board. Destroyed Indian villages are relocated while additional forts and settlements may be built as the game progresses. Indians raiding is a quick and simple mechanism that adds color to the game.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are included - one per expedition with a campaign game that encompasses all three. Low counter density with quick and tense game play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Bayonet &amp; Musket Battles series is GMT's follow-up to the extremely popular Musket &amp; Pike series, showing the movement of European warfare from tactical systems based on shock to a modern reliance on firepower.  Volume 1 will be Banish All Their Fears, covering the battles of Neerwinden, 1693 and Blenheim, 1704.&#10;&#10;- Neerwinden, July 29, 1693, War of the League of Augsburg.  Outnumbered and thoroughly out-maneuvered by the French army under the Duke of Luxembourg, British King William III refuses to retreat his Allied army over the river to his rear and instead elects to defend a stout breastwork line strongly anchored on fortified villages. Luxembourg has the cream of the French army at his command, and sees an opportunity to break the enemy defenses and possibly destroy the Allied army.&#10;&#10;-  Blenheim, August 13, 1704, War of the Spanish Succession.  Facing defeat in Spain, northern Italy, and along the Rhine, the Duke of Marlborough leads his Allied army deep into Bavaria and threatens to remove that key French ally from the war.  The French respond by sending an army under Marshal Tallard that links up with the Bavarians under Elector Max Emmanuel and stands to face Marlborough near the village of Blenheim on the banks of the Danube.&#10;&#10;Larger armies and the primacy of firepower mean significant changes for the familiar Musket &amp; Pike game system:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Larger armies.  Brigades became the primary battlefield maneuver element, and while retaining foot battalions and horse regiments as our unit scale, we've made brigades paramount. Shifting brigades between wings and committing them into action to take advantage of enemy mistakes was the essence of victory for the great commanders of the age, and we've built that into the game.&#10;     Supremacy of firepower.  Combat has been streamlined and simplified so that most unit combats are now resolved in 1 - 2 die rolls with decisive results.  Players will soon learn the importance of creating and using fresh reserves to bolster their shot-up frontline battalions.&#10;     Solid map and OOB research.  Nothing new here, the consistently high level of historical research that went into maps and OOB's in the Musket &amp; Pike series continues.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Some dice results provide movement, while others allow you mark rows or columns and drop new gems onto the board.&#10;&#10;Once the turn order, a.k.a. the Pecking Order, has been established, players will then execute actions one at a time. Players can move their chickens 1-3 spaces depending on the dice spent and possibly shove an opponent's hen out of the way. If a chicken lands on a Grain Gem, a player can place it on their Egg Board. Some Grain Gems are rarer than others. They score positive points if they are part of completed sets on the facet of the jeweled egg and negative points if that facet is incomplete or the gem is unused.&#10;&#10;The advanced variant of Gem Hens adds Power Clucks, powerful abilities for your chickens that make the battle for precious Grain Gems even more chaotic.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.&#10;&#10;Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.&#10;&#10;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect.

Your base of operations is the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt on duty at Yankee Station. You play as a Navy pilot flying strike missions against targets in North Vietnam. Your goal will be to survive a mission or a campaign.&#10;&#10;The Skyhawk was a nimble aircraft and was capable of carrying slightly over four tons of&#10;ordnance. Depending on your target, the player has the opportunity to load out his aircraft to meet the mission requirements. The missions will not be easy. President Johnson and his civilian advisors may even change your target or ordnance loading depending upon the political situation in the USA.&#10;&#10;Facing you will be a determined North Vietnamese force. It is possible you will face small arms fire, AAA, SAM launches, and a rare encounter with a MiG.  You will have help. Support Forces allow the player to attack NV defense forces before you attack your target. Their success could make your job easier.&#10;&#10;The player may fly a single mission or play one of the three campaigns included in the game. These campaigns are:&#10;First Tour of Duty: Yankee Station: 10 August 1966 &ndash; 10 September 1966&#10;Second Tour of Duty: Yankee Station 20 October 1966 &ndash; 27 December 1966&#10;The third campaign combines the two campaigns above with additional rules.&#10;&#10;The game is not meant to be a detailed simulation of the Rolling Thunder campaign.

Brutal fun as someone commented is spot on.&#10;&#10;In the addictive multiplayer mode there was short-lived gloating at apparently strong hands, poker faces pretending a good hand, frustration, Intense rivalry between the kids, fist pumping joy and laughter at someone else&rsquo;s plight. Confiscating each other&rsquo;s cherished cards was contentious. The diversion cards being played out of turn were priceless double-crossing targeted at who has annoyed you the most and part of the joy and pain of playing with friends or family. I think in football they say there is no such thing as a friendly.&#10;&#10;The single player is a different game altogether. The black guard pack sits there silent and seems to know what you are planning, coming up with cards like it&rsquo;s been tipped of by a snitch. You dread the Inevitable Traitor card making his appearance. But then there is the joy of getting a good run going, tempered with wondering on the turn of each card whether your luck is about to come to an abrupt end. There are 14 escapers waiting in your pack and extension pack for a home run, and the first person to ever get all 14,  I would tell them to go buy a lottery ticket. They will command the luck of the gods.&#10;&#10;",

The game is operational in scale, with units representing brigades and regiments.  The map sheet consists of two maps: a large-scale map of Malaya as well as a more detailed map of Singapore island.  The earlier turns of the game take place on the larger Malayan map, and the play moves to the smaller Singapore map only towards the end of the game, when the Japanese prepare to assault the island.&#10;&#10;Game components consist of one map sheet, 100 counters, rules, and game charts.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine (S&amp;T) #96.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:  &quot;Each hexagon on the large map of the Malacca Peninsular represents an area 16 miles across.  Each hex on the inset map of Singapore Island represents an area 3.4 miles across.  Each Game-Turn represents one week of time.  Each Assault Pulse represents 56 hours.&quot;  (Source: Section 2.4 of the Rules (Game Scale)).&#10;&#10;",

The king's heart would break if his only little boy didn't win, so the other participants join forces to help the clumsy heir to the throne win.&#10;&#10;A truly unique and funny cooperative card game in which the goal of the players is to have the prince's card at the front by the end of the game. It may seem simple, but you really have to pay attention to which player is playing which card. It is an excellent opportunity for children to learn the basics of algorithm construction.&#10;&#10;During the game, we first place the participants of the running race in the specified places - princess, cook, knight, prince. Each player will receive a certain amount of program cards, which can be played to move characters in a certain direction. Caution! If we move with any character by running off the field from one of the sides, the game ends immediately and unfortunately we lost! This makes the game very exciting.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played with difficulty - the played program cards must be turned face down so that only the last played card is visible. With this, the memory can also be woven into the game. The game also comes with additional cards that can be used to add extra characters to the running race.&#10;&#10;The game can be won if the prince is first after the cards have been played, otherwise unfortunately the players have lost the game.&#10;&#10;",

Every night the Mafia kills another person, every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and condemn one of them to death. Since every role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander, and who is part of the Mafia. If the Mafia kill off enough civilians, the community becomes a permanent haven for crime, but if the civilians rid their community of the Mafia, they win.&#10;&#10;Mafia: Vendetta offers eleven different civilian roles and five different Mafia roles. It also features two different alternative modes, the Loner mode and Yakuza mode, that each introduce a third faction to the game. You might play a Mafia Thug, a protective Nurse, an innocent Bystander, or a cunning Imposter. No matter what your role, play it convincingly, make your choices carefully, and trust no one.&#10;&#10;",

So it is a rare trivia game that can be played with adults and kids.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in nine different colors, corresponding to different question categories. Players roll their two dices and choose one of them to move around the track. When a player stops on a color they get a multiple choice question (or sometimes a mini game) of the appropriate category, delivered via app. If the player answers a question correctly two times in a row, they get a knowledge cup of that color (assuming they don't already have it). If they already have this colors cup, a correct answer allows the player to roll again and move on around the board.&#10;&#10;If a player stops at a space with an opponents pawn that owns this spaces color, he will challenge him in head to head questions to get the knowledge cup from him.&#10;&#10;Once a player has assembled all 9 knowledge cups or moved around the board three times, he is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Flip fish, spend dice, add them to your collection - but beware of reveal and catch abilities that can have various effects on the game!&#10;&#10;Each fish, item and character has been meticulously hand-inked by illustrator Judson Cowan, then colored by hand in Procreate. It's an absolutely gorgeous world with many, many dark surprises to uncover.&#10;&#10;As your eyes spy more and more horrifying things, you'll collect Regrets cards - which drive up your madness but also give you access to more dice and increase the value of weirder fish. It's a risk/reward scenario as you balance your madness, knowing that at the end of the game the player with the highest value of Regrets will have to discard their most valuable mounted fish.&#10;&#10;Manage you resources, make strategic decisions, leverage madness to your benefit and suppress your Regrets as you try to catch the most valuable haul of weirder and weirder fish on this thrilling week at sea.&#10;&#10;SOLO MODE:&#10;In the solo mode (which you can also co-op), you'll act as an ichthyologist on a mission to catch and catalog every fish in the sea. Over a campaign of dozens of games, you'll try to reel in every last fish and document their attributes on provided catalog sheet. At the end of each game, you'll have to discard an equal value of fish to the regrets you've collected and may have to let some fish go to return to another day. At the end of the campaign, you'll have a catalog of all fish names, depths, values and difficulties that can be used by players in the multiplayer game to help identify what they might fish up!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You will be commanding small groups of Sherman tanks, Priest mobile artillery and Greyhound armoured cars in order to clear routes across the freezing countryside to Bastogne, where the US 101st Airbourne are surrounded by the enemy.&#10;You will need to supply at least 3 but preferably 5 standard six-sided dice. Sample counters have been included at the end of the book which you can cut out or copy, and stick to card if you wish.&#10;In full colour, rules and 12 replayable missions are included.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

These cards are full of quotes both from history and from famous Napoleonic movies: &ldquo;By God, sir, I have lost my leg. &ndash; By God, sir, so you have.&rdquo; or &ldquo;We shall match them with our lancers!&rdquo; Nobody can resist reading these with the right accent&hellip;&#10;&#10;The challenge You win the game by destroying half the total combat strength of the enemy army. This task is easier for the French when only one army faces them. However, if Wellington&rsquo;s forces survive long enough for the Prussians to finally arrive, the tip of the scale will swing in favour of the Allies, and the French are probably going to find themselves fighting for their life. And nobody can be sure exactly when the Prussians are going to appear in the East&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

Tory militia appears once per region the first time British regulars enter, and they can be converted to regulars and leave the region, but will never reappear in that region once they've left.&#10;&#10;The British player wins by controlling regions whose victory point total exceeds the scenario requirement.  Colonials win by winning three major battles, by winning two major battles while limiting the British player to less than half of the scenario victory point total, or by lasting to the end of 1783 without the British player winning.&#10;&#10;Multiple &quot;what-if&quot; situations are provided, with each one adjusting the British victory point level required to win.

Any lace can be moved by either player, but it must be moved the exact number of spaces rolled, then threaded through an empty hole. When you're unable to complete your turn, you lose. And so, the goal is to maneuver the laces to limit your opponent's options &mdash; but should they escape, they might just hand your crafty trap back to you.&#10;&#10;This is a simple, strange, and sprightly little game that takes only a minute to learn. There's something soothing about the sound of the shoelace sliding against the board as you pull it through. And there's something gently nerve-wracking as the holes get fewer and fewer and the laces start to get shorter and shorter. Each match results in a unique and visually appealing crisscross of blue and pink laces. Every lace has a knot carefully tied at one end by hand &mdash; by either designer Amabel Holland, publisher Mary Holland, or one of our friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
