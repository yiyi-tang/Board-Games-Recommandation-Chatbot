Using elements of area control games, this simple card game has players competing for scoring areas which range from 1 to 12 using a series of card in their hand.&#10;&#10;Players simply lay cards over different scoring areas, and when all cards have been placed the topmost card scores the area. The game is designed to be played over several rounds.&#10;&#10;Scoring areas are represented by Jacks, Queens and Kings in all different suits. Players cards range from ace to 10. Players can only play a card that is higher than the previous one played onto a scoring area. An ace, however, resets the area: it can be played onto any card, but any card can be played onto an ace.&#10;&#10;The game plays for between 2 to 4 people, with a team-based variant for 4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

To build a structure, you need to collect a matching blueprint (for a bridge, monument, church, etc.) plus various resources (wood, stone, iron, and/or gold) as specified for the structure being built. Finally, you must claim the building site with the blueprint and deliver the resources needed to that site. On completion, you earn victory points (VPs) and receive a crest from the District where the site is located that will score additional VPs at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player who contributes most to the construction of Budapest will earn the greatest number of Victory Points and hence win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Main Event Boxing is a round by round game in which fighter&rsquo;s will perform uncannily close their real life abilities. In Main Event Boxing, fighters are rated for scoring ability, punching power, endurance, defense, ability to absorb punishment, ability to be knocked down or knocked out, susceptibility to cuts and swelling, and how often a fighter commits a foul.&#10;&#10;Main Event Boxing features all of the nuances of professional boxing that you see in real life bouts. Quick KO&rsquo;s, TKO&rsquo;s, and close decisions, will all occur on your tabletop with real life accuracy in Main Event Boxing. As in real life boxing, ANYTHING can happen, but you won&rsquo;t see the flash KO&rsquo;s and huge upsets with regularity in Main Event Boxing, like you do with other boxing games.&#10;&#10;Main Event Boxing is a sequel to FAST Boxing. However, the game has changed a great deal, and it is much more than a ratings update, which is why I gave the game a new name. If you have played FAST Boxing, the game will be somewhat familiar. However, if FAST Boxing wasn&rsquo;t your cup of tea, I ask you to give this game a look, as it is truly THAT much better.&#10;&#10;I always felt that FAST Boxing was a &ldquo;complimentary game&rdquo;. It was a game that bridged the gap from a quick playing game, like Ultra Quick Boxing, and a detailed game like Title Bout. Main Event Boxing has shed the &ldquo;complimentary game&rdquo; title now. This game stands on its own with the best of them. While the game does play rapidly, and it&rsquo;s certainly not a punch-by-punch simulation, I stand firmly behind the accuracy of the game. And most importantly, I find the game play to be quite compelling and easy to pick up and play. This ultimately is the most important thing about any game!&#10;&#10;Fighters, Fighters, Fighters&hellip;&#10;&#10;The standard game features a vast array of today&rsquo;s current boxing stars. With the standard game, you get over 190 heavyweights, 90 Cruiserweights, 78 Light Heavyweights, 94 Super Middleweights, 82 Middleweights, 108 Junior Middleweights, 112 Welterweights, 122 Junior Welterweights, 115 Lightweights, 75 Junior Lightweights, 89 Featherweights, 76 Junior Featherweights, 74 Bantamweights, 76 Junior Bantamweights, 68 Flyweights, 45 Junior Flyweights, and 128 Strawweights. That&rsquo;s over 1600 active fighters. No other game company can match that! You can rest assured that my research and analysis yields very accurate fight ratings.&#10;&#10;The match-ups are limitless!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For clever merchants it is a time of great potential.

Each player has a different character and special power taken from a range of different neighbouring cultures. Players buy trade goods in far off markets to sell in the bazaars of Byzantium, while doing their utmost to undermine and obstruct their rivals and avoid the various historical hazards of the time. Players use Trader markers to purchase and move goods appearing across the board, avoiding dangerous local events and rival player skulduggery. Later in the game players can attempt to secure influential government roles worth bonus victory points but require each role to be voted upon by all players so bribery and deal making is a must! The player with the largest and most influential merchant empire at game end is given the title of Merchant Prince of Byzantium.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player buys the files and print as many times as he wants.

    "Description": "A two-players game derived from Stratego, but asymmetrical and themed in the Greek Mythology universe. Two teams of gods struggle for the dominance of the Olympus - its current occupiers, lead by Zeus, against the Chthonians, entities of the Underworld lead by Hades.&#10;&#10;Both players choose a team of 9 out of 12 units. As in Stratego, their pieces identities are hidden from the opponent before they enter combat. Besides their pieces, each side has two important assets, Honor and Energy, which are crucial in their mobility and combat power.&#10;&#10;Both sides have different victory conditions: the Chthonians win by moving one of their leaders (Hades or his wife Persephone) into the Olympus top, while the Olympians must simply avoid the Chothonian success by eliminating their leadership from the game. Also, a player loses when ending up with less than 1 Honor point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "- Introduction -&#10;&#10;Everwar is a fast, fun and accessible wargame, with a diesel punk aesthetic and a pixel art graphic design, very characteristic of mid'90s video games (hello Advance Wars!). The universe of Everwar is based on a fun and solid game system (easy to learn but hard to master) which develops an interesting plot that, in addition to providing a rich background, regularly introduces new mechanics and playable elements that add depth and freshness to the gaming experience through regular updates.&#10;&#10;- Background -&#10;&#10;The story of Everwar is set in an alternative universe that shares certain similarities with our own world. The events take place in Domum, a planet where the technological advance of humanity has evolved exclusively around internal combustion engines and fossil fuel.&#10;&#10;In Domum, wars between nations have occurred on a global scale on numerous occasions throughout recent history. This has molded belligerent societies accustomed to enduring the sacrifices of long confrontations.&#10;&#10;The base game of Everwar brings us to Erisland Kingdom, a nation that is mired in a bloody civil war for the succession to the throne. But something is about to change the course of history in a terrible way, and neither Erisland, nor any other nation of Domum, is prepared for it.&#10;&#10;- Gameplay overview -&#10;&#10;During a game of Everwar, the player's objective is to fulfill one of the scenarios victory requirements. This may include collecting a certain amount of victory points, capturing an enemies HQ or taking control of strategic objectives.&#10;&#10;To do so, players will take non-consecutive turns in which the initiative is based on the orders issued to their armies.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players will simultaneously choose orders that will allow them to move and engage in combat with a different number of units. Initiative is determined by the number of units activated by an order, the player activating the least number of units will gain the initiative during the turn.&#10;&#10;Everwar has a dice-based combat that uses a rock(tanks)-paper(artillery)-scissor(infantry) system to determine the number of dice each player gets. This, together with terrain bonuses and flank bonuses, brings a fast and simple yet highly tactical combat experience.&#10;&#10;",

CAC attempts to embrace the modern Native Culture, and allows us to learn and laugh at the same time.&#10;&#10;The eldest player starts as the Emcee and draws a red card. He or she reads aloud the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the red card. Everyone, including the Emcee, holds ten white cards, and answers the question or fills in the blank(s) by passing one (or two) white cards face down, to the Emcee.&#10;&#10;The Emcee shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the group. After all the card combinations are read, every player votes on their favorite response by placing their token on that white card. The player who submitted the card with the most tokens wins that round and keeps the red card. After the round, everyone draws back up to ten white cards, and the duties of the Emcee pass to the person on the left. The player who is first to collect five red cards is declared the Token Indin'.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once upon a time, the King decided to talk a nice walk through the forest. As the day drew on, the King wandered deeper and deeper into the forest until suddenly he found himself lost and separated from his Guards. &quot;I'm lost! I'm lost!&quot; shouted the King. The King's Guards heard the King's cry for help, but they too were lost in the ever changing forest. They searched frantically for hours for the King, but to no avail. They were not the only ones in the forest that day searching for the King for unbeknownst to them...there were Assassins afoot!&#10;&#10;King&rsquo;s Gambit is a hand held 18-card solo game. The goal of King&rsquo;s Gambit is simple: 1) defeat all four Assassins in the forest, OR 2) find the King (who is lost in the forest), and escort him safely through the forest back to the Castle. To do that, you must outwit the Assassins who are trying to kill the King. The Assassins can also wound you! The King&rsquo;s guards (who are also lost in the forest) can protect the King and you as well...if you can find them. The King also has Allies who can help you in your noble quest, but the King also has Enemies who will hinder your quest. Don&rsquo;t lose your way, or you too might get lost in the ever changing forest!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aggression is a war-game for two players. Each has 100 armies to be distributed in certain countries on a map which is drawn at the start of the game. A series of battles are then fought with the object of neutralising enemy armies. The player retaining control of the most countries is the winner. There are three phases, in each of which the same player moves first.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: The players take turns to delineate one country on the map. This is done by drawing the boundary lines of a single enclosed area on a piece of plain paper. There are no restrictions on the size, shape or location of the countries, though it is recommended that they be drawn reasonably large. Twenty countries are to be drawn in the standard size game.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: The players take turns to allocate some of their armies to one unoccupied country. The number of armies allocated is written into the country concerned and that country is then regarded as occupied. The player taking first turn should identify his own allocations by boldly underlining his figures. Phase 2 continues until all countries are occupied or until both players have allocated all of their 100 armies.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: The players now take turns to conquer one or other of the opponent's countries. A country may be conquered if there are more of your armies in adjacent countries than your opponent has in the country under attack. Similarly your opponent may conquer one of your countries, at his turn, if he has a superiority of armies in adjacent countries. To qualify as &quot;adjacent&quot;, countries must have a visible length of common boundary. The number of armies in the conquered country is crossed out and they take no further part. The armies carrying out the attack are in no way depleted and may be used for other attacks later in the game. The object of the game is to retain more of your own occupied countries than the opponent retains of his. Note that countries you conquer don't contribute to your score but merely reduce your opponent's score by one as he will have retained one less country at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The best strategy depends, in complex ways, upon the original map. Several tips are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Create &quot;buffer&quot; countries to protect weak countries during phase 2.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Avoid crowding enemy-held countries at the start of phase 3.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The first countries to attack in phase 3 are not necessarily the strongest of the enemy-held countries, but those which, by teamwork, can most damage your position.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Eric Solomon, Games with Pencil and Paper&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Squex is a 2-player abstract connection game, similar to Hex.&#10;The game is played on a 8x8 board of octagons and squares. The goal of each player is to connect their corresponding sides of the board with a continuous line of pieces.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;     On their turn, each player can place one octagonal piece on any free octagonal place on the board.&#10;     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color, a square of that color is placed to connect them (it is possible to place up to 4 squares by placing just one octagon).&#10;     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color and there is a square of the opponent's color in between them, the opponent's square is replaced by a square of the player's color. The opponent's octagons are no longer connected by the square that was there. This is called a &quot;cut&quot;.&#10;     Whenever a player performs a &quot;cut&quot;, the opponent can then play two times in a row (it should be noted that if a player performs a &quot;cut&quot; on the first of two consecutive turns, they lose the second turn and it's the opponent's turn to play twice).&#10;     A player only wins when they connect their respective sides of the board and it is impossible for the opponent to ever break that connection with a &quot;cut&quot;. Usually after a player connects two sides there are still three of four more turns until the connection is &quot;uncutable&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player adds up their own points for members survived and tools collected, and the player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;10&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#142;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#138;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#135;&#142;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#229;&#173;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#175;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#231;&#142;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#175;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Army of Flanders is the thirteenth volume in Red Sash Games&rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the third in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or&#10;the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand&#10;France&rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson&#10;on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&rsquo; war of middle age &ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.&#10;&#10;In Army of Flanders, you will have a chance to change history &ndash; and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to&#10;write your name in the history books. Flanders is the source of Gloire, and the graveyard of reputations.&#10;&#10;As the French, will you pursue an offensive or a defensive strategy? The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and acess to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you are under the eye of Versailles, only a couple of day&rsquo;s ride from the front. You are merely an extension of the King&rsquo;s will. If his reputation needs patching up, expect to be ordered to lay siege to some massive fortress. At least you will have the resources. But, if the King decides to pursue diplomacy, you will have to secure and &lsquo;rationalise&rsquo; the frontier. If you fail, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies. IF you disobey&hellip; it does not bear thinking about.&#10;&#10;As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops: Dutch, British, Spanish, German, Huguenot, and even the not&#10;inconsiderable army of Li&egrave;ge. The Germans want to pursue a Rhine strategy. The Spanish want to hunker down and let the Dutch&#10;do all the fighting. The British Isles are still being subjugated by the Prince of Orange, though much of the populace supports him.In the early years it will be enough to hold the line. Later, hopefully, the enemy will run out of steam and you can pay him back in his own coin!&#10;&#10;Like the other games in the series, Army of Flanders focuses on the operational art rather than tactics or grand strategy. You are the theatre commander, subject to dictates from on high and only partially able to guide the action. Your main goal is to acquire Prestige. Your playing pieces represent battalions and regiments, which you must deploy wisely, deciding how strong to make your garrisons, and how many units to group into mobile formations for attack or defence. These formations are commanded by Leaders, rated for their skill and their temperament (and their political pull), and assisted by Auxiliaries. These last are specialists such as grenadiers and pioneers. Once you are organised, be sure you pick the right time to fight. You have a large army, but it is not infinite! The combat system has a tactical feel, addressing the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Sieges depend on good planning. Screen your besieging army with another to keep the enemy at bay and make sure you have lots of siege guns and sappers. Supply is critical. You can live of the land, but it is safer to build a string of dep&ocirc;ts. Operational tempo is driven by the accumulation of &lsquo;operations points&rsquo;, which must be expended in order to act aggressively. A player may have the Initiative for a while and dictate the pace of the game, but eventually, he will run out of steam and have to pause to accumulate more points.&#10;&#10;Special rules in Army of Flanders deal with the imposition of&#10;strategy from above, the discord of allies, the War of the Two&#10;Kings in Ireland, and the campaigning along the Moselle Valley, which was the highway to the Rhine, just off the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends when peace breaks out &ndash; something you have little control over &ndash; so be sure to acquire Prestige as fast as you can!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
