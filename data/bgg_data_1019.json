Soul Spire comes with three different playable factions that the players can ally with, each having their own story path that describes the events based on your progress.&#10;&#10;Scenario 1 introduces the players to new mechanics before branching off down the path of your chosen faction. Your decisions affect how the game progresses and how much more difficult future objectives become, where even victory in a scenario for your faction can ultimately lead to another faction winning the game overall. Each faction has a mini-campaign over at least 3 scenarios, which combined with multiple hero options gives some serious replayability to a more tactical, strategic dungeon crawler.&#10;&#10;Expands on the rules first introduced in Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth bringing some entirely new ideas to the dungeon crawler style game.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 15 cards. Each player places his cards in front of himself openly. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a deck [draw pile] in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;The player on the left of the one who deals [the dealer] starts the game. The opening player places matching cards to the river cards already lying on the table. If he cannot join a card, he takes one from the covered deck [draw pile] and his left-hand neighbor continues. Each player may join all the matching cards he has [during his turn]. Cards can also be put in between the cards already lying on the table, if they match the others on both sides.&#10;&#10;The left side has no limit, so with each game a new colorful city can be built.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who finishes first with his cards. He [or she] is the &quot;greater builder&quot;. You cannot always join all the cards. If at the end of the game there are still some cards left, the player with the fewest cards left wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game was co-published by &quot;Spil og L&aelig;r&quot;, Danish for &quot;Play and Learn&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Forces are mobilizing in the region at an alarming rate with the UN summit deadline looming. There are skirmishes every day in different territories as both sides struggle for control. You have been tasked with securing the new front, and it's critical that you do this before the UN sanctioned ceasefire comes into effect stopping any further build-up. Under your command is a full complement of military assets that are battle ready. The terrain is a challenge, ranging from the desert like Oleshky Sands to the Codrii forests and beyond to the Balkan Mountains.&#10;&#10;Surge: Battle for the Oleshky Sands is a two-player game of confrontation. Your mission is to deploy the assets as quickly as possible to neutralize the enemy and secure control of the region. To retain control of an area, you must have the most units in that area, and to control the region, you must control the most number of areas. There is a constant struggle to retain control of the different regions with battle lines moving quickly. No two games will ever play the same.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary&#10;&#230;&#170;&#128;&#229;&#174;&#182;-DANKA- (Danka -DANKA-) is a new game produced by the Buddhist temple &#227;&#129;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#188;&#154; (Puni no kai) to help explain the role of the temple in its community. In English, Danka would be a person that supports the temple, like a parishioner in Western societies.&#10;&#10;In this dice game, you become the priest at a temple working to increase the number of families that support the temple.&#10;&#10;The game contains custom dice with the following symbols: Study (practice in the Buddhist disciplines), Welcome (welcoming people, and also wining and dining), Worship (or visiting a shrine), Adornment (of a buddhist statue), Festivities (festival, social functions), and the Daibutsu (a large buddha statue).&#10;&#10;Roll all 6 dice at the start of your turn. You can re-roll several times, and you will take the actions available once you are satisfied with your dice rolls.&#10;&#10;As you take actions over the course of the game, the number of families that support your temple will increase, and winning or losing the game rests on the number of supporters that you have at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;This game includes a large wooden buddha statue that any player can use. It is made from a special kind of Japanese maple tree.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's site&#10;There once was a town with a temple near a great Buddha statue, known as a Daibutsu. The priests at the temple worked day and night to help the townspeople understand Buddhism by managing the temple facilities, taking care of the Daibutsu statue, and hosting festivities. Of course, the priests also spent time on their Buddhist practices (training) every day.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of priests in the temple, with the nearby town having only 100 people living in it.

After the initial Axis invasion, things are getting heated in a hurry between the Tigris and the Euphrates. The Allies and SSU have now realized that the third Bloc wouldn't have committed so many forces for anything other than a prime objective. If the Axis sought oil, they would have attacked elsewhere like the Arabian Peninsula or Iran's oil fields. They sure are in for more than sand and old ruins, aren't they? NDAK forces have finally found their target: an isolated outpost on the outskirts of the desert held by a handful of French Foreign Legionnaires in an area crawling with Spetsnaz. Only the Luftwaffe boys can mount the fastest strike ever to take this objective before anyone else: Operation Kondor.&#10;&#10;This new expansion for Dust 1947 describes all the Luftwaffe forces, with new characters, vehicles, Platoons, etc. With the Operation itself come three short stories by Andy Chambers himself, a must read for every Dust fan!&#10;&#10;",

Barricade your locations from the storms, or you'll find yourself having to uncover what you've already worked to find &mdash; or get ahead of the game and use your radar to see where the next storm is coming from. After the storms have passed, the prospector who has the most money and treasure (points) from the locations they occupy wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Lost World Lunch is a quick-play card game for 2-6 players. Each player takes on the role of a Dinosaur (the deck has three carnivores and three herbivores). Your goal as the Dinosaur is to get as many Victory Points as possible by Biting, Clawing, Stomping, and Smashing the pesky, trophy-seeking Victorian Hunters as they sip their tea and eat their lunch.&#10;&#10;A game takes about 15-20 minutes to play. Each player is dealt three Hunters that they are racing against their opponents to complete. You complete a Hunter by matching (in order) all of the symbols on the Hunter&rsquo;s card with your Attack cards, while trying to use the best Victory Point card on each Hunter.&#10;&#10;Each Hunter is also looking to catch a specific Dinosaur (that upper left hand corner image of the Dinosaur on Sergei&rsquo;s card). If a player completes a Hunter that was looking to catch them, they earn double points.&#10;&#10;But watch out! There are special cards that allow your opponent to steal your Attack Cards or even swap your Hunter with theirs (getting all the associated Victory Points as well)!&#10;&#10;Team Play and Simple Play (for young kids) As there are three Carnivores and three Herbivores in the deck, players can split into two teams and compete together, rather than playing a free-for-all. Also, if you ignore the VP and specials, you can use the game as a simple color/symbol matching game with younger children&ndash;work them up to Victory Points after they learn math skills and finally teach them the Special Rules when they have mastered Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

The gemstone must be moved within the same row.  You may only move the gemstone if there is an empty space in the rock there (in the neighboring space of the same row). If there are multiple empty spaces in the rock on this space then you may select one of them.&#10;&#10;For the bonus tile with the water drop and an X: If you use this bonus tile you may take one water drop off the game board and place it back in the water box.  It doesn't matter whether the water box is currently in front of you or one of the other players.&#10;&#10;Due to production reasons, the bonus tiles in the Advent Calendar are slightly thinner than the bonus tiles in the game.&#10;&#10;",

The lava cooled to form a terraced landscape and with time the island became inhabited by people. Kingdoms emerged in the three corners of the island, all there to extract noble metals from the lava.&#10;Today, the kingdoms are ruled by the Queens of Copper and Gold and the King of Silver. Alchemists have settled on the misty shores. Alchemists have the ability to transmute the gold, silver and copper into magic pearls. The kingdoms send out messengers to get magic pearls made by the alchemists and to bring them back to the kingdom. All the messengers wear rings made from the noble metals. They&rsquo;re on the move day and night, exchanging the rings among themselves as alchemists require two different metals in order to make a magic pearl. It is therefore customary on Magic Triland to carry out trades by bartering at every encounter. A kingdom possessing magic pearls, possesses the highest wisdom and magical power.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;The game is played on a board with hexagonal blocks of different heights, that form a different board every time. Each player has to pawns with rings (metals), that come in each players color. He moves his pieces using cards covering the height difference between the blocks. Exchanging rings between players when playing pieces meet, enable a player to collect pearls along the side of the board. First player to bring home a pearl of the color opposite to his starting hexagon wins the game&#10;&#10;",

In a world where the undead have overrun mankind, the only form of entertainment we have left is reenacting movies of times gone by.  Now it's your turn to shine as you remake your favorite zombie classics.&#10;&#10;Adventures is Zombiewood is a cooperative game where players each command a different actor each turn.  They use the actor to take on the Z-lebrities that spawn during each Scene they are shooting.  They roll dice in an attempt to match the symbols required to defeat the Z-lebrity.  Anytime a player is unable to defeat the Z-lebrity, their actor is zombified and joins the growing horde to be faced in the game's final scene.  Combat must be fast (as you are trying to conserve film reel) so each combat phase is timed, and all players must be finished with their attack rolls before the timer signals the end of the scene.  Team strategy and quick thinking will give you a chance to survive to the end of your movie.  How many stars will your film earn... and will you survive to find out?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Honour web site:&#10;&#10;&quot;Rommel is a tabletop game of great battles in the European and Mediterranean theatres of the Second World War. The player takes the role of a general commanding an entire division, or elements of several divisions, or an entire corps or even an army. Units represent companies and battalions. Tens of thousands of men and machines clash for control of miles of territory. Make decisions about the application of air power, engineering, the use of reconnaissance, the commitment of mobile reserves, and many other things.&#10;&#10;Rommel can be played with miniature figures and terrain -OR- with &ldquo;unit cards&rdquo; on any flat surface. You may in fact use both in the same game, since the cards can act as labels and play-aids for your bases of miniatures. The basic game introduces players to the operational decisions of a second world war general. Two players can complete a game in 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;The full advanced game features:&#10;&#10;- Large battles and multi-player games.&#10;- A complete army and battlefield creation system for fictional scenarios, including thirteen army lists for six major powers.&#10;- Guidelines for players who want to create their own historical scenarios from famous battles.&#10;- Detailed rules for things like amphibious and airborne operations, cavalry, minefields, pioneer and special assault units, and much more.&#10;&#10;Use Rommel to recreate your favorite historical battles, or use its army-building system to create fictional armies from six major nationalities during all periods of the war. The &ldquo;Open Architecture&rdquo; system allows you to modify the game&rsquo;s points and units to create any other nationalities and armies, or interesting What-Ifs. (For example, what if Fascist Spain had joined the war in 1941? What if the Americans had entered before Pearl Harbor?)&#10;&#10;A unique scenario creation system allows players to &ldquo;bid&rdquo; for the resources with which to create their armies and then automatically adjusts scenario conditions and choices accordingly. There is no scripted &ldquo;attacker and defender.&rdquo; Instead, a player who chose to fight at a disadvantage in points has many advantages in the creation of the scenario.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This Mega-corporation will be controlled by a single Player who with his fleet of Delivery trucks must distribute the Puke Cola throughout the States of the USA, hire Employees for his company and form a Puke Cola dispatcher army, manufacture the different varieties of Puke Cola, reinforce its Headquarters with traps to avoid fortuitous incursions and, finally, to avoid that the side of the Redneck steal to them the secret recipe of the Puke Cola.&#10;&#10;Against him is the team of the family of Rednecks, the Hickey. They were on vacation in Hawaii when the Puke Cola began to be commercialized. In this team of 1 to 3 players will have to cooperate and help each other.
