    "Description": "Earth has been overrun by the evil Legion of Terra, and it's up to the Alliance between Earth's rebels, the Mercurians, and the Venusians to stop Terra's and Mars' Axis of Evil!&#10;&#10;Rocketmen: Axis of Evil is a fast and furious game of spaceship combat between two or more players, who battle for the resources of an asteroid belt and ultimately for the fate of the entire solar system. Players collect ships and crew to build customizable fleets (much like in WizKid&rsquo;s previous popular game series &quot;Pirates&quot;), and then they gather resources during the game to add more ships to their fleets. The first player to capture his or her opponent's home base, or to destroy all of the ships in his or her opponent's active fleet, wins.&#10;&#10;In late 2005, the expansion pack &ldquo;Battle of Titans&rdquo; introduced 60 new ships and 30 new character cards to the Rocketmen universe, as well as a new ship type (Harvester), pod type (Tractor Beam) and even a new crew type - though technically, it wasn&rsquo;t really a crew but rather a new weapon called the Torpedo (which loaded just like crew).&#10;&#10;Each game pack contains 6 plastic styrene cards (2 ship cards and 2 base cards, or 1 ship card and 1 Fighter squadron and their base cards; 1 crew card; and 1 resource card), 2 cardboard ship data cards, 1 cardboard asteroid, 1 six-sided die, and a rulebook (which was updated with the release of Battle of Titans and the new features it brought with it).&#10;&#10;Each Axis of Evil game pack also contains a small comic of which there were five to be found and these added to the game&rsquo;s charming story.&#10;&#10;Each Battle of Titans game pack also contains a Jovian Fuel Jelly template. This can be used with the included scenario (or you can create your own). The Jovian Fuel Jellies float in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and are the only source of rocket fuel in the solar system. This fuel is harvested by both Ganymede (who has a bigger slice of the rocket fuel pie) and Io using their harvesters.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone has a chance to bet on the outcome, then a judge decides the winner and bets are settled. When all players have judged twice, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

It is logical in its associations and what it chooses to make important in terms of combat. It places a premium on good, sound tactics. This is not a game where players sit back and shoot at each other from across the table top. Victory has everything to do with the choices you make on the table.&#10;&#10;Learn to think tactically. Suppress and move. Maintain squad discipline, but control the table. Create firing lanes and punish those who move through it. Combat begins and ends with movement. Everyone can shoot; survivors know when to shoot and when to relocate.&#10;&#10;Each MegaCon plays extremely different, having intrinsic strengths and weaknesses. Learn them, then create tactics and adapt in the flow of battle to take advantage of the MegaCon you play.&#10;&#10;If you learn to marry solid tactics with MegaCon strengths, then perhaps you can call yourself a MERCS player.&#10;&#10;MERCS 2.0 streamlines many of the dice and modifier interactions that exist in the game. It introduces new reference cards, keywords, initiative, and medium range. It also reimagines flank, melee combat, suppression and overwatch, and dealing with elevation in combat.&#10;&#10;This version contains all 12 MegaCons, 9 different game modes, and an ever-changing campaign that uses the MERCS: Conflict. custom dice&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios include the first year of the Japanese offensive, as well as 1941-43, 1943-45 and 1941-45. There are also mini-games for Midway, the Solomons, Burma, China, the Philippines, Manchuria and others.

Air units are in groups based on squadrons. Land units are regiments, brigades, divisions, corps and armies. The game system uses an interactive sequence of play in which both players can launch strikes, exploit errors, and win great victories. New rules include Kamikazes, armored divisions, task force markers, Soviet intervention, MAGIC, special operations forces, the China front, strategic bombing and the atomic bomb.&#10;&#10;Components: 840 die-cut counters, two 34x22&rdquo; maps, player aid cards, and two rulebooks, 2 inch box.&#10;&#10;(source: Decision games website)&#10;&#10;",

One rich in technology, settlements &amp; farms, markets &amp; exotics, as well as, temples &amp; sacred sites.&#10;&#10;Specifically, the players claim domains by building camps, upgrading those camps to villages, and ultimately into great cities. The various settlement types project varying degrees of influence over the domains. By controlling the domains,the players will earn a number of different victory point multipliers (including farms, markets, temples, and sacred sites). In addition the players will use their settlements to control three kinds of resource dice (forest, mountain, and desert dice). Each respective dice type offers a unique set of odds for resource procurement (forest dice offer much wood, some clay, and an occasional exotic good; mountain dice offer much stone, some metal, and an occasional exotic good; finally desert dice offer equal odds of wood, stone, clay, and metal, with a greater chance for exotic goods.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the players will strive to attain victory points on 4 tracks:&#10;&#10;Subsistence (farms x settlement score [village = 1, city = 3]).&#10;Commerce (markets x exotics)&#10;Theology (temples x sacred sites)&#10;Technology (single score, no multiplier)&#10;&#10;Over the course of six rounds of scoring (six generations), the players will compete for the highest final score.&#10;&#10;",

Each mission card grants the player a specified number of operations points to reach certain objectives. Operations points are expended to recruit the special ops team, then to move and attack on the map. A deck of event cards controls the opposition forces (OPFOR). Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical system with opposing units taking turns firing at one another. Victory can increase the number of operations points available, but heavy losses can reduce them. The game ends when the player runs out of points.&#10;&#10;40 die cut counters&#10;14 event cards&#10;11 x 17 inch map&#10;&#10;",

There are four full-color 22x34&quot; maps and lots of counters.&#10;&#10;A new addition is the command system. This forces players to activate one corps at a time, and move all units of that corps before you move any other. The movement rate is decided by a die-roll. All units within range of their commander may use a single die-roll, while out-of-command units must roll separately.&#10;&#10;",

During play, players use two discard piles, one for suited cards (referred to simply as &quot;The Discard Pile&quot;) and another for Joker Crabs (referred to as the Joker Pile).&#10;&#10;Suited cards may be played on the discard pile on top of other cards that match their suit or number. Once a suited card is played, a player may also discard all cards of higher value of the same suit from their hand. When a Jack, Queen, or King is on top of the discard pile, no Joker Crabs may be played. Additionally, if a player cannot play, they must draw cards at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;Joker Crabs, which are all based on real crab species, have unique effects. All but one of them can benefit a player by, for instance, forcing an opponent to draw from their hand or allowing them to play unique combos. The final Joker Crab &mdash; the Lobster &mdash; is a barrier to victory as it cannot be played; should you hold the Lobster, you must find a creative way of discarding it without playing it.&#10;&#10;",

Charles XII, King of Sweden, personally led an invasion deep into Tsar Peter the Great&rsquo;s realm. The Russians engaged in a successful defensive campaign which culminated in the epic battle of Poltava. As a result, Sweden&rsquo;s mastery of the north was forever smashed, and Russia emerged as a great European power.&#10;&#10;In ON TO MOSCOW, one player controls the Swedish side; the other controls the Russian side. The objective is to gain control of as many Fortress cities as possible and destroy the enemy&rsquo;s military power. Each side has a number of military units and leaders with which to attack enemy forces and gain control of Fortresses. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation.&#10;&#10;Players who want to learn the game quickly should just read the GENERAL RULE beneath each major rules section, and then follow the specific procedures within each section as the need arises during the course of play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Solferino portrays the final battle of the Second Italian War of Independence, a nominal French victory that persuaded Napoleon III to make peace without much attention to the aims of his Italian allies. It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.&#10;&#10;The scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.&#10;&#10;Command and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.&#10;&#10;The movement sequence uses the &quot;chit pull&quot; mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.&#10;&#10;Combat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.&#10;&#10;As the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.&#10;&#10;Players gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.&#10;&#10;The battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.&#10;&#10;This game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars. Solferino gives us a glimpse of what the American Civil War might have been like if every general had been a McClellan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Volume III contains 7 Battles:&#10;&#10;The New York Campaign :&#10;&#10;&#10;     Brooklyn (27 Aug 1776). Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.&#10;&#10;&#10;The New Jersey Campaign :&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force. He makes a plea for men to stay on for six more weeks for an additional bounty and was able to pull together 5,000 troops. With these, he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey again. Sidestepping the British forces marching to Trenton along the main road, the Americans make a back road march towards Princeton. Sending a force to guard a bridge over the main road to slow a British response, this force runs into a trailing British regiment. A battle ensues in a nearby field. The fast marching Americans defeat the British forces, capture supplies at Nassau Court House, and march on to Morristown to winter quarters, but loss General Mercer.&#10;&#10;&#10;Two Bonus Scenarios!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Stony Point (16 Jul 1779) Wayne's surprise attack on the Hudson River fort. The Americans went in with only bayonets and cutting equipment. They managed to capture nearly 500 of the 600 man garrison.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     King's Mountain (7 Oct 1780) The rebel militia avenge their defeat at Camden with a decisive defeat of the Tories, ending Cornwallis' attempt to conquer the Southern colonies until the following year..&#10;&#10;&#10;Components: Two 22 x 34 inch maps, 560 counters, rules book, storage bags and dice.&#10;&#10;The easy game system recreates battlefield conditions with a move-fight-rally play sequence to simulate the grand tactics of these battles. Additional rules include command control, morale, artillery, light infantry, and dragoons. Each battle is represented by its own units and map along with exclusive rules to recreate the unique battlefield situation. Units are generally regiments, and rated for combat strength, morale, and march capabilities. Famous leaders are also included-Washington, Howe, Greene, and Knyphausen. Battles range from Bunker Hill, through Brooklyn and Trenton, to Saratoga and Monmouth, and on to the South at Cowpens, Guilford, and King's Mountain.&#10;&#10;(from the publisher)&#10;&#10;",

You've been searching for a long time and now you're pretty sure that mysterious creatures from lore really exist! However, in order to convince the editor-in-chief and make it to the front page with your story, you will need some solid evidence. You'll have to keep searching and following even the smallest rumours until the signs get hot. But time is of the essence because your competitors have become aware of the story...&#10;&#10;There are 6 different creatures who are said to be found in different locations around the world &ndash; referred to as &quot;mysteries&quot;. For each mystery, there are 6 rumours and each is assigned a unique colour and symbol.&#10;The rumours have different values ranging from -1 to 4. The higher the value of a rumour, the higher the probability that the mystery truly exists.&#10;Only one of these cards is the actual proof of the respective mystery - you must find out its value throughout the course of the game. This evidence is hidden under the overview cards and its value is unknown to you at the beginning of the game. All other cards are rumours. You hold these rumours in your hands and play them round by round, revealing information to everyone.&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game, you will take search cards by performing the &quot;Search&quot; action. These represent your findings on the various mysteries.&#10;Time-outs in the basic game allow you to exchange previously collected search cards in one mystery for another. These cards grant you the opportunity to bluff or alter wrong decisions.&#10;The professional tools of the variant introduce 6 unique actions into the game and take the game to a more strategic level.&#10;&#10;",

The board is a grid 7 x 9, with columns numbered 3-9, columns representing planes of reality, rows representing schools of magic, though this has no effect on gameplay. The board &quot;wraps&quot; top to bottom, but not for the purposes of diagonal capture.&#10;&#10;Players roll 3d3 (six sided dice numbered 1-3 twice), and place their coloured tokens on a space in the column matching the dice total. The exception to this is where the three dice are all different, where the player misses a turn &quot;distracted by events in the prime material plane.&quot; When a player rolls all three dice the same, they get another turn after placing their stone.&#10;&#10;Capture of opposition stones is in the style of Othello/Reversi, but captured stones are removed from the board and returned to their owner. First player to place all their stones wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Let's Do Lunch! &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Mohawk&quot; is a wargame of the &quot;French and Indian War&quot; in North America.  Mounted, color mapboard measures 22&quot; x 17&quot;.  Map features significant land and water routes used in the period.  Inset maps are included for high seas naval movement and tactical battle resolution.  176 two-sided mounted and die-cut counters represent regular and militia, Indians, fortresses and fleets.&#10;&#10;Reinforcements from Europe are variable depending on naval activity.  Militia must be &quot;mustered,&quot; and &quot;go home&quot; at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by &quot;gifts and supplies&quot; and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.&#10;&#10;Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: &quot;Attacking/Defending Fort,&quot; &quot;Open Ground,&quot; &quot;Wood&quot; (forested) or &quot;Landing.&quot;  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A &quot;hit&quot; is determined by a D6 roll of &quot;6.&quot;  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are &quot;plus 2&quot;, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to &quot;retreat&quot; in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be &quot;promonted&quot; to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a &quot;Troop of the Marine battalion&quot; or &quot;Courier de Bois&quot; (French).&#10;&#10;Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.&#10;&#10;The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.&#10;&#10;The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (&quot;gifts and supplies&quot;).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually &quot;go home&quot; after a victory (to celebrate).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.  The British must hold a total of three French cities from the list of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal or Quebec (at least one must be Montreal or Quebec).&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a force composed of a number of Units, each of which in turn includes a number of individual figures, with weapons chosen from a short list of generic weapon types (it's simple to add more or detail the existing ones). A player is allowed to activate his units one at a time until he fails an activation roll, at which time play passes to the opponent. Units which have not moved, or fail to activate, are able to use reaction fire. Movement is measured from a short list of available actions, run, walk, assault, etc. Combat is resolved using a die roll-savings throw mechanic, with saving throws only if the target wears armor. Hits result in Suppression or Casualties, with more experienced units able to take more suppression hits before casualties are inflicted. vehicles are treated generically, but with a choice of armor &amp; weapons.&#10;&#10;Force list, weapon choices and vehicle details are left to the player, although fan-produced lists have been posted on the game website.&#10;&#10;FUBAR has a range of rules and supplements including these genre:&#10;&#10;    FUBAR 40K Boarding Actions - Space Hulk and Space Crusade&#10;    FUBAR Generic Sci-Fi&#10;    FUBAR Stargate1&#10;    FUBAR Star Wars - Hoth battle &#10;    FUBAR Clone Wars&#10;    FUBAR Starship Troopers&#10;    FUBAR Steampunk&#10;    FUBAR Warhammer 40K&#10;    FUBAR Warzone&#10;    FUBAR Hammers Slammers&#10;    FUBAR Imperial Commander&#10;    FUBAR 15mm SciFi&#10;    FUBAR Micro FUBAR - 6mm scale&#10;    FUBAR Vietnam&#10;    FUBAR WW2&#10;    FUBAR Afghanistan&#10;    FUBAR Horror &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Airships: North Pole Quest will take you back to 1924, in the golden years of airships, when nations started aiming for the Arctic, the last inviolate frontier, and for its symbol: the North Pole. Being the &quot;first&quot; was not only a matter of prestige, but also of great opportunities: strategic explorations, lands to be annexed, trade routes to be opened.&#10;&#10;Beautiful (and highly detailed) airship models, plus abstracted navigational and flying tools, are the hands-on parts of the game, while cards and changing weather will continually deal players new challenges.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of one country's airship commander, having to organize a crew and certain equipment choices, and then beginning a series tertiary flights for fund-raising and prestige. Each team will require a &quot;support ship&quot; and landing equipment, and these have to coordinate with flights as well, especially for the big jump to the North Pole.  Players select from a list of &quot;actions&quot; that they can take each turn and must judge which ones are the priority for this turn and what can wait.&#10;&#10;The game is  not just &quot;Start at Point A and fly to North Pole.&quot; The tertiary expeditions, for fund-raising and publicity, allow players to better equip their &quot;team&quot; to make the longer journey, and to hire specialists for their crew members who have distinct abilities for extra support. Weather plays a key role and a clever device keeps the weather changing in realistic patterns. Players must factor the current weather and what is anticipated as they make choices of actions and routes. Airships can be damaged and this costs time and money to repair.&#10;&#10;The campaign game ends-- as expected-- with one airship reaching the North Pole and returning to its support ship. (You have to get back to win!)&#10;&#10;Shorter scenarios offer the chance to &quot;race&quot; to other locations and deal with different challenges. There is also a solo, &quot;training&quot; mission scenario to help players learn how to coordinate actions for the best performance.&#10;&#10;",

(MacArthur called it, &ldquo;Advancing the bomber line.&rdquo;) And, most of all, the novel concept that not every Japanese stronghold needed to be attacked at all.&#10;&#10;Some 13 different invasions or operations were included, with flexibility for adjusting both timing and target as the situation demanded. In fact, the original goal of Cartwheel (called &ldquo;Elkton&rdquo; when first proposed) was the capture of Rabaul. After much discussion in the highest levels (including the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Roosevelt, and Churchill), and overruling MacCarther&rsquo;s own objections, Cartwheel&rsquo;s final objectives shifted to the Admiralty Islands, bypassing Rabaul and setting the stage for the invasion of the Philippines.&#10;&#10;Operation Cartwheel eventually included the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the death of Yamamoto, Bougainville, multiple parachute drops, a Japanese counter-invasion, and the leap-frogging strategy up New Guinea. It involved the top commanders on both sides, sometimes working in close harmony and sometimes at ends. (The Japanese army and navy had conflicting concepts of how to defend the area and each pursued their own ideas!)&#10;&#10;With 284 5/8&quot; counters and a 22 x 34 inch map (each hex representing about 100 miles) Operation Cartwheel integrates separate ground, naval, and air games. Logistics is key, as it was at the time, but not a burden in game mechanics.&#10;&#10;Operation Cartwheel will be published in ATO's 2008 Annual, featuring a &ldquo;double-length&rdquo; magazine, with an in-depth look at the history behind the game, plus other articles, and an assortment of replacement/improvement counters from that year&rsquo;s games.[...]&#10;&#10;NOW AVAILABLE AGAIN!&#10;&#10;Game has been OOP for years.

Two coaches take turns on offense and defense, calling plays and executing drives. Touchdowns, field goals, fumbles, interceptions, penalties, and big plays are all part of the exciting action. Join the fun as the teams of the Professional Football League compete for the Championship Trophy!&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;In Third and Long, two players take on the role of opposing coaches in a game of American Football.&#10;&#10;Each coach chooses a team from the star players included in the game. Pre-made teams are provided for simplicity, or a draft with a salary cap can be held to form the teams. Teams do not have all 11 players represented, they simply comprise of the star players from the following skill positions: QB, RB, WR, LB, CB, S.&#10;&#10;A coin flip determines who starts out on Offense and who will initially play defense. Players share two decks of play call cards. The coach on offense takes the Offensive Play Calls and the coach on defense takes the Defensive Play Calls.&#10;&#10;Coaches choose their respective play calls in secret, revealing them at the same time. The interaction between the offensive and defensive play call determines the match up of star players involved in the play. Action Cards (which form each player's hand) are used to further influence the outcome of each play.&#10;&#10;The game is made up of a series of drives. Each drive is made up of a randomly determined number of &quot;Key Moments&quot; (from 1 to 5). Key Moments represent those special times during a football game that mean the difference between success and failure. For each Key Moment, a play occurs. If the offense is able to win that number of plays in a row, they score.&#10;&#10;If the defense is able to stop the offense on any of the Key Moments in a given drive, then a fourth down has occurred. Most of the time a punt will follow, but sometimes the coach on offense is desperate and will attempt to go for it.&#10;&#10;Each game results in real football game-like scores, and uses nothing but cards (no extra components to keep track of field position or time on the clock). Interceptions, fumbles, big plays, injuries, field goals, touchdowns, safeties, extra points... its all in there!&#10;&#10;",

The roles &quot;Mastermind&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; then determine a trump suit and a round rule for the current round. With eight cards in hand, players then start to play. Each role has a special task, the fulfillment of which earns an award at the end of the round. For example, &quot;Captain&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; must win more tricks together than &quot;Mastermind&quot;, whereas &quot;Mastermind&quot; wants to win at least as many tricks as &quot;Captain&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; combined. (&quot;Rebel&quot; has nothing to do with any of that and pursues their own goals.)&#10;&#10;The Captain leads to the first trick, and other players must follow suit, if possible; otherwise they can play any card, including trump. The winner leads to the next trick, and once all tricks have been played, players receive an award if they have met their role's goal. If no one has won, pass the roles clockwise and start a new round.&#10;&#10;",

Destroy the enemy castles to win the game!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a castle card, protected by three wall cards. A castle can't be attacked until you destroy its walls (unless you get an assault card). The defense value of the castle and walls is represented by shields; to destroy a card, you need to attack with more swords than shields. You can attack with several cards, gathering soldiers, bowmen, siege weapons, etc. Your enemy can avoid your attack using academy cards (strategies to reduce the damage taken).&#10;&#10;There are different decks on the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Town deck provides soldiers, bowmen, builders, explorers, gold and more. You will draw 1 Town card on each turn, and you will perform an action then (an action can be played with 1 or more cards at the same time).&#10;     The Siege deck provides siege weapons with high attack power; you can get Siege cards using your builders and gold.&#10;     The Academy deck provides tactics to avoid enemy attacks.&#10;     The Dungeon deck will be open with explorers; beat a deck to get a treasure (additional town cards).&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Castlecards: Asalto al Castillo es un juego de cartas de partidas r&aacute;pidas donde la estrategia y la suerte se entremezclan para disputar batallas medievales.

    "Description": "Bloodiest Day: The Battle of Antietam, from Spearhead Games captures the essence of this crucial engagement. Bloodiest Day's unique approach to simulating Civil War battles uses alternating-impulses and an area map to capture the ebb and flow of Civil War battle as attack and counterattack build to a crescendo of combat.&#10;&#10;17 September 1862, Sharpsburg, MD: The bloodiest single day of combat the North American continent would ever witness draws to a close. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, outmanned but not outfought by McClellan's Army of the Potomac, barely adverts disaster along the banks of the Antietam Creek. Heavy but uncoordinated Federal attacks had stretched the gray-clad lines to the breaking point. Only the nick-of-time arrival of Hill's Light Division blunts the final Union assault. McClellan refuses to commit his reserves to grasp the war-ending victory that lies within his reach. Lee's first invasion of the North ends - but the war drags on. Yet McClellan's imperfect victory would lead to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and change fundamentally the nature of the conflict.&#10;&#10;System is loosely based on the area movement games from Avalon Hill (Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy) and sister game to They Met At Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 hours&#10;Area: 1&quot; / 2.54cm = 285 yards / 260 meters&#10;Units: Brigades&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 30-page Bloodiest Day rulebook&#10;Two single-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;Two single-side printed Order of Battle charts&#10;Four 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Low-Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1.5 - 2.5 hours&#10;&#10;",

As you march through the woods, you encounter various guardians, from small trained animals to huge powerful monsters. However, defeating the guardians requires much energy and wise use of magical flowers grown all over the island. Should you fail, many dark curses will be laid upon you.

Although their goals are similar, only one season will claim the honors.&#10;&#10;Your goal? Be the first to achieve one of the four victory conditions:&#10;&#10;     Plant a 3&times;3 rectangle of Guardian Tree cards in your Forest&#10;     Have only cards of your season on the recruitment line&#10;     Collect 8 Fire tokens&#10;     Move the Onibi creature to your opponent's side once the Onibi card is in their possession.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played in alternating turns. On each turn, choose one of the following options:&#10;&#10;     Draw 1 guardian animal card from the shared draw pile and add it to the shared help line&#10;     Use 1 action token on 1 guardian animal card in the shared help line&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a guardian animal card&#10;Draw a card from the shared draw pile and place it face up on one of the three help lines:&#10;&#10;     the shared help line if it&rsquo;s a neutral animal&#10;     your help line if it&rsquo;s an animal of your season&#10;     your opponent&rsquo;s help line if it&rsquo;s an animal of their season&#10;&#10;&#10;Each animal provides elements that you can use later with one of your two Action tokens.&#10;&#10;Be careful: revealing too many solitary animals can be detrimental. After 3 solitary symbols, you lose an Action token, which will significantly reduce your ability to act.&#10;&#10;&bull; Use an action token&#10;Place one of your Action tokens on a card to point to the last element corresponding to the action you want to perform. Count all elements of this type visible from the start of the common aid line OR from the last Action token pointing to this element.&#10;&#10;Possible Actions:&#10;&#10;     Recruiting one or more Guardian Animals&#10;     Extinguishing the fire by collecting one or more Fire tokens&#10;     Planting one or more protective trees&#10;     Advancing Onibi toward your opponent&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; End of the turn&#10;The turn ends when both Summer and Winter have used up their 2 action tokens.&#10;&#10;Add up the value of the fire tokens in the clearing: the value of each fire token is determined by its location. Then, add up your water values. Check to see whether the fire value in the clearing is strictly higher than your water value. If so, add a fire varan card corresponding to your season to the shared discard pile for each fire token present in the clearing.&#10;&#10;Next, place a fire token on each of the cards on either side of the Onibi standee.&#10;&#10;Retrieve your 2 action tokens back in front of you, and place all of the cards in the help line, as well as the cards in the players' personal lines on the shared discard pile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&#10;&#10;No prior knowledge of Living Forest is required to enjoy Living Forest Duel.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game, players attempt to guide an airplane around the world as the calendar progresses from day to day.  Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).&#10;&#10;The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Shanghai&#10;    Maloney&#039;s Inheritance&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The action in that scenario is fought on two maps, East and West, and also allows for the possibility of a last-minute change of side by Stalin. It can be played by two, three or four. There is also a smaller (one map) Historical Scenario, which is played only on the East Map. It can be played by one or two. Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historical in both scenarios. The main body of rules is written with the alternative history scenario in mind.&#10; Each game turn represents three days. Each hex on the West Map represents eight miles from side to opposite side, while the corresponding figure on the East Map is 16 miles. Each counter typically represents an army or occasionally a corps.&#10; Also included with this game are bonus and errata counters for Rhineland War,South Seas Campaign, Afrika Korps, Sedan, Partisan ,and Patton&rsquo;s First Victory.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;",

Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Girl Genius: The Works is a non-collectible card game that consists of several standalone decks of cards. You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.&#10;&#10;The four standalone decks as of September 2018 are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Castle Wulfenbach&#10;    Master Payne&#039;s Circus of Adventure&#10;    Castle Heterodyne&#10;    The Siege of Mechanicsburg&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This version of Clue was the first limited edition, released by Winning Moves in 1997.  It came in a tin box with appropriate holders for its other contents, which included Pawns and a Die, Cards, Murder Envelope, Weapons, Notepads and Notepad Holders.&#10;&#10;Each board was individually numbered and contained many special features unique to this edition.  Among them were a laminated board and laminated cards, along with taller wooden pawns than usual with brass bases and solid brass weapons.  Included in the weapons was the Poison Chalice, a special edition enhancement to the game.  The Notepad Holders are also unique to this edition, though the 50th anniversary edition creates a similar design incorporated into an invitation.&#10;&#10;",

Stay one step ahead of your opponents, as you race to be the first player to play all your country cards within the confines of your available table space, and win the game.&#10;Block your opponents by holding on to China or India or open up the Gulf States by playing Saudi Arabia. Take a boat through the Pacific Ocean to Australia or transit by train through Thailand to Malaysia. Try not to get stuck with Singapore, or landlocked with Laos as you watch the country cards spread across the table. The excitement builds as you have fewer and fewer cards left to play, but less space to play them in as you reach the edge of the world. (The table&rsquo;s edge). Every country card is different due to their varying border connections and hence no two games are ever the same in this clever game that you will want to play again and again. Play as a stand alone game or combine with Mapominoes games for other continents to make to expand the game to cover the world. A simple game with hidden strategic depth that gives it broad appeal to both children and adults.&#10;&#10;",

To that end, you must sacrifice cards from your hand, and even your own willpower, to custom build your arcane arsenal.&#10;&#10;Begin as one of 6 unique Battlemages specialized in their own magical discipline. Then, tailor your deck to your strategic tastes and in reaction to emerging opportunities. Curse and counter-curse your opponents into submission&hellip; without being Hexed yourself by the wild magics that have since passed beyond your control.&#10;&#10;An unconventional deck-builder that is highly interactive as you constantly deflect Hexes around the table. You are not building a resource engine so much as constructing your deck to deliver the types of interactions you want to have with other players. Will you specialize in forcing discards to deprive them, focus on negation magic, attack their Willpower with direct damage &ndash; or take on chaotic and possibly dangerous spells to build Victory points into your deck at great risk to yourself?&#10;&#10;Plus, newly conjured spells are not put into your discard pile, rather than forcing you to wait for their return, but are placed directly into your hand. You can play them immediately &ndash; right when you need them most.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;When asked about it, years after it ended, George Washington said that the American Victory was &quot;little short of a standing miracle.&quot;&#10;&#10;Almost a Miracle! uses our successful Tarleton's Quarter! as a game engine starting point to bring the Northern &quot;half&quot; of the American Revolution into play. Will the British be able to impose &quot;the King's Peace&quot; on the northern colonies or will the revolution survive to birth a new nation?&#10;&#10;The map and victory conditions for Almost a Miracle! show players why battles took place in key areas but also lets players explore those seemingly odd tertiary campaigns, like Halifax, Fort Pitt, and Quebec.&#10;&#10;Designer David Jones forces both sides to deal with their own challenges. The British consistently failed to &quot;live off the land&quot; and had to buy or ship food to sustain their armies, while the Continentals struggled with purchasing power and transportation.&#10;&#10;The game handles battles in both large and small scale, as both were critical to the War's outcome, with a system that models 18th Century combat and how it differed from later times, where morale, readiness, leadership, and mere chance all could be &quot;the&quot; critical factor at one time or another, and disease and desertion could be an army's biggest killer.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover the short enlistments of the Continentals, the uncertainty of French support and entry, prisoner exchanges, and the variable support of Loyalists and Native Americans. Both sides faced challenges they did not expect, and both sides contributed nearly as much to their own failures as they achieved in victory. The game will provide insights into how narrowly the Americans succeeded and how close the British came to their own victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;decription from the publisher&#10;&#10;Designed by David Jones, after Mike Joslyn.&#10;Graphics by Mark Mahaffey, after Craig Grando.&#10;Developed by Lembit Tohver.&#10;&#10;This game was published in issue no.51 of &quot;Against the Odds&quot; magazine.&#10;&#10;",

That is, at the end of July, when the AGC offensive was historically shut down in favor of supporting extended drives by the flanking army groups, it&rsquo;s possible that, if you&rsquo;ve done better up to then than your historical counterpart, Hitler may authorize a continued and immediate advance on Moscow.

    "Description": "Wicketz is a Cricket sim using a quarter-board for the wicket, model batsmen, fielders, bowlers and umpires, a spinner for the deliveries and 246 cards for the strokes. The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible. This is determined by another spinner, but the higher order get 3 and 2 lives, the tail are out first time. Normal cricket rules apply and the game has advanced rules for bowling &amp; fielding variants.&#10;Sumo has the original publisher as A W Compton producing a limited 200 edition. The set I have is by RDA Marketing and Luding reckons the designer is Richard Pullen. Although my rules set refers to a card dispenser and a window display, the game doesn't have them. I can't figure out the relevance of selecting Pace or Spin whatsoever, so I suspect the earlier edition had more to it. Solid sim of limited appeal (geddit!).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rite is an epic, asymmetric and tactical wargame that makes players forget the world around them. Each player commands one of five factions (Humans, Goblins, Undead, Chaos or Primals) that try to complete a rite in a volcanic crater.&#10;&#10;The Humans try to call upon the might of the Angels by activating shrine tiles. The Goblins need to bring sacrifices to their fire beacons to activate them and call upon an ancient dragon. The Undead need the life energy of the other factions to activate runes and open a portal to the underworld. Chaos tries to take control of enemy units to infiltrate the enemy factions. Finally, the Primals try to devour all enemies to evolve one of their little hatchlings into Ultimatosaur.&#10;&#10;The factions can complete their rite by summoning unique units, moving them around and defeating other units. While doing so, they can perform special rites to summon powerful commanders and unlock mighty spells.&#10;&#10;Whatever the objective, players better watch their step, because a furious Firelord is trying to burn them off his volcano!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
