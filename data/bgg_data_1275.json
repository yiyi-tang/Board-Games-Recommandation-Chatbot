    "Description": "&#232;&#132;&#177;&#232;&#181;&#176;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#228;&#186;&#186; (Dasso Meijin) is a game from Japan about escaping pet lizards. Each player is a different pet lizard which has got free from its tank in the game designer's home (the game title means 'escape master'). They run around the rooms and try to catch insects. The first lizard to get a set of insects is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game designer (who breeds pet lizards) describes the game as a mix of roll &amp; move and Old Maid, in that the lizards follow paths around, and steal cards off each other akin to Old Maid.&#10;&#10;However, the game does not use dice. Instead, players choose a numbered card from their hand in secret, reveal it and advance as far as they wish up to the number. The lowest numbers go first.&#10;&#10;Players follow paths around the different rooms in the home, and try to catch insects in the rooms or collect useful objects (by drawing cards). If a player gets into a room with another lizard, they can steal a card from the other player's hand. But some cards are also traps.&#10;&#10;The pet owner is also moving about, and if a player ends up in the same room, they cannot move or they will be caught. So being able to predict the movements of the other players and the owner matters.&#10;&#10;The first lizard to secure a hand of four cards of one type of insect is the winner.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Their goal, of course, is to keep their cat alive as long as possible.&#10; Inspired by quantum physicist Dr. Edwin Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s metaphysical thought experiment stating that a cat sealed in bunker with a container of radioactive poison - that may or may not have opened - is both alive and dead at the same time, this destructible game begs the question&hellip; does curiosity really kill the cat?&#10;&#10;Perfect for curious players who revel in experiences that push the boundaries of what a game can be.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To survive on this battlefield, you will need to see the future, read your opponent's mind while obscuring your own thoughts, move in for the kill when they least expect it, and, most importantly, survive by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;ESPC is a fast-paced game where you try to be the last player standing.  A round should take about 5 minutes or less.  The last player left alive gets a victory point.  Cards in the game represent Psychic Powers. Each turn a player draws a card and declares what power they are going to use.  At this point, any player may challenge the use of this power.  If the player claiming to play the power doesn't have that card in hand, they are out for the round, but if the player has the card, the challenger is out.  At this point, the player uses their power card and discards face up.  This continues until only one player is left, and points are awarded.  Then the deck is reshuffled and the next round begins.  The game is played until one player reaches the target number of victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Each time the game is played, only a subset of powers are used. The number of powers in a game is based on the number of players, and there are rules governing how powers are selected.  This leads to a unique experience each time the game is played. For a 4 player game there are 4,000+ different power combinations.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It is played on an initially empty square board.&#10;&#10;Both players must have shared access to a sufficient number of black stones, white stones and rods. Stones are square-shaped and placed on the spaces (squares) of the board. Rods are as long as stones are wide and placed on the edge segments between adjacent squares.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A group is a stone along with all other stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent like-colored stones. Thus, all stones in a group are the same color.&#10;&#10;The size of a group is the number of stones in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayOn your turn, if possible, perform exactly one of these actions:&#10;&#10;- Place two stones of different colors on adjacent empty squares and a rod on the edge segment between them.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of two adjacent stones of different colors not separated by a rod and place a rod on the edge segment between them.&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins.

If no one crosses that line, players re-fold and try again. Players choose which color lines to fold based on where their airplane lands compared to the color disc. They usually have three color lines from which to choose, but if a player lands their airplane on the color disc, they can choose any single color line to fold.&#10;&#10;If your plane crosses the finish line, you win instantly; otherwise whoever has gotten closest to the finish line after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

One of its two square halves is colored black, the other white.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A bit is one of the two small one-colored square prisms that make up a piece.&#10;&#10;A stack is a set of one or more bits piled onto each other on the same square. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost bit, which denotes its owner.&#10;&#10;The height of a stack is the number of bits in it.&#10;&#10;A group is a stack along with all other stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent like-colored stacks. Thus, all stacks in a group are the same color.&#10;&#10;The size of a group is the number of stacks in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, place a piece on the board so that it exactly covers two empty squares or two stacks that rise to the same height, without causing any bit to lie directly on a like-colored bit. At all times, at least one bit of every piece on the board must remain uncovered.&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available, you must pass.

It is therefore easy to learn, quick to play, yet difficult to master! Suitable for two to forty players!&#10;&#10;The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. It is possible to start with only 20-odd miniatures, but that can easily be expanded. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies. Similarly, the distances are given in inches for use with 28mm scale soldiers. Feel free to adapt to centimetres should you not have the space or when you use a smaller scale of miniatures.&#10;&#10;This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1860 to roughly 1914, the age in which European countries forged empires all over the world and combated each other and the various indigenous people. The rules will work for skirmishes in colonial settings, the Franco-Prussian War and other Wars of German Unification, the Balkan Wars, the Spanish-American War, the Boer Wars, the Boxer Rebellion and other clashes. It will also work for the early clashes of WW1.&#10;&#10;Designed for the beginner with a minimum of miniatures, it also allows you to field large armies on the table top and play to a conclusion in two to three hours.&#10;&#10;The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and be removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry charges and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a unit, but also between units and as such, the whole army.&#10;&#10;This product come with two commander dice. Markers can be downloaded.&#10;Cards are available separately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher FB page&#10;&#10;",

A base tea token, tea flavours and additives shown on the card are needed ingredients, and placed in an empty tea cup.

When the final order is completed, other players complete their last turn so that each player has played the same number of turns.&#10;To score, players add up their victory points from fulfilled customer orders, and add their leftover money to this total. In 3-5 player games, additional points are awarded to the player(s) who fulfilled the most orders and most diverse tea recipes. Award ties are friendly with each winner receiving 5 points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points (from customer orders, money, and awards) wins the game as best tea merchant!

Great power can be yours if you&rsquo;ve got a villainous eye for looking past the other temptations of the vaults!&#10;&#10;Relic Roadshow adds new temptations to Vault Wars allowing you to bid your way to the dark side! New Vaults are uncompromised by special rules and instead award the second-highest bidder with powerful Relics to craft! Drawn by the corrupting power, Aspiring Villains reward you for crafting their desired Relics. Vices give powerful, unique abilities... if you&rsquo;re willing to take on a bit of corruption, of course! Step right up and place your bid!&#10;&#10;Players will take turns as an Auction Master, leading a cut-throat bidding war to selling off Vaults full of items to the other players.&#10;Each Vault provides a unique experience, introducing new ways for the players to bid.&#10;No player quite knows everything that's in a Vault, and there's lots of junk to fool your opponents into bidding on.&#10;Between auctions, players may sell off their items to gain Gold, or save them for Victory Points -- paying storage fees to keep them around.&#10;Collect gems for massive Victory Points, Weapons to gain lots of Gold, or rare Artifacts to gain powerful abilities.&#10;Each player has up-and-coming heroes who are looking for specific items, giving out bonus victory points (but try to keep that a secret from your opponents).&#10;The player with the most victory points after all the auctions will be the winner!&#10;&#10;",

The cards use the French suits &mdash; with the suit being an image of a fortification, many rather intricate and some quite attractive &mdash; along with a paragraph of explanatory text. Along the top of the sheet additional panels list the game's rules, and a panel along the left edge contains an index of important terms. A central panel bear the &quot;Peter Schencken&quot; imprint against an architectural backdrop adorned with military hardware.&#10;&#10;The sheet could be dissected for use as a traditional deck of cards or left intact for use as a board game, using the rules printed at the top. These rules appear to be fairly straightforward, involving the rolling of dice to determine one's moves, the victor being the first to land on panel number 53, the Complete Vestung (&quot;Complete Fortification&quot;). Additional rules add spice to the game; for example, anyone landing on panel number 16 &mdash; the Aussenwercke (&quot;Outworks&quot;) &mdash; must sit out two turns. By progressing through all the panels, players are exposed in sequence to the various elements of fortification, from basic geometry through the digging of counter approaches.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player draws two additional cards, then tries to negotiate trades, e.g., &quot;I can trade Day drinking and Online, for company and distraction.&quot; After a successful deal, players trade the cards secretly. When trading, players can lie about the cards they are offering, except the first card that they offer. Players can additionally add Loo rolls as sweeteners for the trade. If a player collects three cards in the same category, they must play this set for points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when six COVID-19 cards are drawn, then all played sets are scored. Black cards in your sets (good events) are worth 2 points, loo rolls are 1 point, and red cards and unplayed cards are 0 points.&#10;&#10;",

When two players play each takes a separate path. The game came with a spinner, called a &quot;spino&quot;, which displayed numbers from 1 to 8. Players take turns spinning and moving their counter the corresponding number of squares.&#10;&#10;Some squares on each track are marked with a letter of the alphabet and a player must follow an instruction that corresponds to that letter. For example, landing on the &quot;A&quot; square of the left track results in the instruction &quot;Forgotten lunch. Back to start&quot;; landing on the B square results in &quot;Tiger snake on road. Extra spin to get past.&quot;&#10;&#10;The two tracks diverge at square one and rejoin at square 89. Square 90 is the last square. A player must spin the exact number to land on square 90. The first player to do this wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hold The Fort is a quick-fire strategy card game for 2 to 6 players where you are the commander of your fortress and your cards are your army of heroes.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, players are randomly dealt a Fortress Card and four to six Hero Cards. Players then choose two Hero Cards from their hand to defend their fortress with. These cards are placed face down in front of their fortress and the game begins. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they take one of three actions; recruit, defend, or attack.&#10;&#10;To recruit, a player picks a card from the draw pile. If they draw a Hero Card, it is added to their hand. If they draw a Chaos Card, the scenario described on the card takes effect.&#10;&#10;To defend, a player takes a Hero Card from their hand and bolsters their defence by placing it next to their existing defenders.&#10;&#10;To attack, a player takes up to three Hero Cards from their hand and lays siege to another player&rsquo;s fortress. They roll the Dice of The Fates to see if their heroes receive a boon or a penalty. The total score of all attacking and defending cards is then calculated and it is determined whether the attack failed or succeeded.&#10;&#10;On a failed attack, the defending player wins the Hero Cards that unsuccessfully attacked them. On a successful attack, the attacking player wins the defeated defending Hero Cards. The defending player then attempts to rebuild their defence with any Hero Cards from their hand.&#10;&#10;When a player no longer has any Hero Cards to defend their fortress with, their Fortress is conquered and they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last player left standing wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The besieged Polish-Lithuanian forces prevailed and managed to stop a further Ottoman expansion North.&#10;&#10;One of the players will take control of the more numerous Ottoman forces and his objective will be to break through the Polish fortifications and take control of the main Polish encampment.&#10;&#10;The player controlling the Commonwealth forces will be defending his fortress at all costs at the same time trying to bring down enemy morale to a level at which it will refuse to keep on fighting.&#10;&#10;If neither side achieves their objective on the battlefield before the end of the 5th turn the game is decided upon a diplomatic clash when both players will use their diplomacy assets acquired throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

You roll 7 dice to dish out ice cream cones complete with whipped cream and a cherry on top. Players roll up to seven dice per turn trying to build their treat with a flavored cone, cherry, whipped cream, and 1-4 specific scoops to score points. As long as one die on your roll can build onto the cone you've started, you can keep rolling to complete it or risk your progress to add more scoops and freeze out your opponents. Push your luck too far and you'll end up with brain freeze and find your chances of victory dropping precipitously.&#10;Once one player has sold cones of all four flavors, whoever has sold the most total scoops wins!&#10;&#10;",
