    "Description": "Sudden Storm is a fast moving campaign of the 1937 naval war between Japan and the US recreating the full range of surface, air and submarine warfare in both operational and tactical operations. &#10;It enables you to explore the challenges admirals on both sides would have faced if the US and Japan had ended up at war in August 1937, during the &quot;China Incident,&quot; rather than in December 1941. A multitude of different potential strategies makes for maximum replayability with new challenges every time. &#10;Sudden Storm is the second offering the ODGW's GQ III Decisions at Sea series of naval campaigns.&#10;&#10;Resulting tactical naval engagements can be fought out with any naval rules, but the campaign seamlessly interfaces with GQ III (purchased separately). In addition to background features describing the road to war, campaign level charts, OBs and campaign map; Sudden Storm contains all new color GQ III 1930s combat charts, 240 Ship Logs and 32 aircraft Formation Cards - everything needed for tactical resolution. A sheet of full-color 1937 aircraft counters on card stock is also included for those who want to resolve tactical aircraft operations, but might lack the requisite miniatures.&#10;&#10;Sudden Storm is not just another retread of Plan Orange or WW II. Politically and geographically, it presents a very different situation from either one with only two combatants confronting each other in a world defined by 1930s technologies while everyone else is determined to remain neutral. Geography, logistics and neutral zones provide gamers with tough command and operational challenges. Naval warfare is also very different in that era. Aircraft have an important role, but lack the reach and striking power another five years will bring. Surface naval forces remain the key to controlling the seas. The IJN and USN are briefly and uniquely balanced in strength at this one moment in time. Most of the modern IJN and USN ships employed in 1942 are already available, but in different, 1937 configurations. In addition, there are no magnetic torpedo exploder problems, radar or Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; (sic) torpedoes available yet. All this creates an ideal environment for a wide range of classic naval battles.&#10;&#10;Sudden Storm also includes download access to 150 pages of Bonus Files. These include eight options, additional forces and Ship Logs, Coastal Defense Cards and maps of the defenses of Manila and Truk, individual carrier and airfield Flight Logs, separate full-color aircraft counters for the flights of each carrier and land based squadron featuring the unique color schemes of the times along with supplemental data on the forces and other aspects of this forgotten era. The files also provide opportunities to explore forgotten technologies like LTA dirigibles and the US flight deck cruiser.&#10;&#10;Sudden Storm offers you a window into the fascinating colorful, forgotten world of the late '30s filled with tough command challenges and classic naval battles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Under Admiral Tirpitz, with the active encouragement of Kaiser Wilhelm, Germany committed to a naval construction program designed to challenge British control of the North Sea. In less than two decades the resulting Anglo-German Naval Arms Race was one of the primary causes of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Within weeks of the outbreak of war in August 1914 millions of soldiers were engaged in combat. On the Western Front German armies violated Belgian neutrality to gain easy access to northern France. While this gambit did open a promising route to Paris, it had a fearful political price as treaty obligations brought England into war.&#10;&#10;For a few weeks in the later summer of 1914 it looked like German armies might capture Paris, scoring a knock-out blow. When they failed, and a stalemate descended all along the front from the Swiss border to the English Channel, the North Sea became the only other theater that offered a way to quickly bring the war to a conclusion.&#10;&#10;For a variety of reasons, including the British advantage in capital ships, a major fleet action did not occur until Jutland in May 1916. Still, there were numerous occasions early in the war when the fleets could have clashed, and the stakes were high indeed. Churchill later described Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, as &ldquo;the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon,&rdquo; an indication of the importance for England to maintain control of the North Sea.&#10;&#10;This campaign game, focusing on the early war, offers players a chance to fight out a series of actions that helped shape the campaign, and that offered the possibility of a major fleet action.&#10;&#10;Players will face both strategic and tactical decisions with the fog of war (sometimes literally on the North Sea) may confer advantages or devastating disadvantages.&#10;&#10;The campaign is compatible with virtually any miniatures rule set. &#10;The strategic decision model provides replayabililty as no two campaigns will be the same, especially combined with a wide variation in possible tactical encounters. And there is always the possibility that control of the North Sea will come down to one afternoon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game Four Color Cards (See Sek) appears to be related given the similarities between tricks and valid hands as well as their descent from chess (Xiangqi) cards. &#10;Similar to Mahjong, the goal is to form a complete hand with sets of three or four and a pair, with scoring usually resembling that of Mahjong.&#10;&#10;Sets for Xiangqi Mahjong are usually either fashioned from one or two regular Xiangqi sets for 32 and 64 piece sets respectively, or as 56 piece Mahjong-style tiles, with each rank of piece quadrupled ala Mahjong. Specific rulesets vary depending on number of pieces and region, but usually the 32 piece variant can take two to four players, whereas 56 and 64 piece rulesets usually take only four. Two 56 piece sets can be combined with different colored characters to play Four Color Cards or a yet unstandardized four color version of Xiangqi Mahjong which seems to be growing in popularity. Additionally, there are some Mahjong variants that add Xiangqi Mahjong tiles as number-based jokers.&#10;&#10;",

Each item from this Food Deck has a suit -- meat, dessert, carbs, and lard -- and a point value. There are even a few veggies mixed in.&#10;&#10;The Appetite Deck contains 52 cards with each of the four suits and numbers from 1-13. Draw these cards into your hand and use them to take food from the buffet, matching at least one card with the food's suit and totaling its point value. You may, instead, steal food from the top of an opponent's plate, but it costs 2x.&#10;&#10;Watch out for veggies that show up on the buffet because the appetite deck doesn't contain veggie cards. Someone will have to take on for the team and spend a turn to remove it.&#10;&#10;Stack the food you take onto your character card's plate. This character card shows any bonuses you may have. Be wary of others snatching food right off your plate. You can safely store food at your table, but that just gives your opponent more time alone at that sweet, sweet buffet.&#10;&#10;Each piece of food has an effect that can shift the tide of the game, and so does each slot on the buffet line, so no matter if you're scrounging for scraps there is still a chance to win!&#10;&#10;A Turn&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may either spend Appetite Cards to get food from the buffet or bring your plate to the table so that it can no longer be stolen from your plate.&#10;&#10;What's in the Box&#10;&#10;Buffet Table&#10;&#10;The buffet is made up of four cards or &ldquo;tables&rdquo; on which to stack the food. Each of these cards reveals a bonus when all the food is removed.&#10;&#10;Food Deck&#10;&#10;Up to four different food cards are face-up on the buffet table that all players will vie for. These foods show a number and food suit. Foods also have bonuses that can sway the game.&#10;&#10;Appetite Deck&#10;&#10;This deck of 52 poker cards contains four suits (the four food groups: meats, carbs, desserts, and lard), and each group is numbered from 1-13. &#10;Character Plates&#10;These are larger cards that show one of the playable characters and their bonuses.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;&#10;Keep playing until you have ravaged the buffet, and there is no food left!

    "Description": "You have invaded the convention hall in search of some great relic; but its pieces have been scattered throughout the event. Will you be the first to find the parts needed to claim the prize?&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;Players build teams, either solo or collectively, of searchers, scouts, and fighters. Searchers investigate areas, the time it takes is based on that character's skills and the size and use of the room. Once found, your scouts run the relic piece back to base. But watch out for your opponent's fighters as they want to get it back.&#10;&#10;The convention hall uses a modular system so you may decide on the size of the game. A more enormous building has more rooms, events, and hidden pieces, and will provide longer playing time. Costumes, food, boosts, and more come from cards that are found or purchased. Use dice for combat and searching revelations.&#10;&#10;When entering an area, flip the tile to show its layout. Is it filled with several vendor booths or one room dedicated to a celebrity speaker? Is it themed for anime or sci-fi? This all matters because you can dress your team members to get the help of the other con-goers in the room, and you definitely don't want to get caught wearing your StarFeet uniform in the Anime room.&#10;&#10;Time and Turns&#10;&#10;The game progresses using a virtual time system based on 5-minute increments and passing half-hours. Players take their characters through a half-hour at a time, completing as much as they can during their turn. Events may change from hour to hour, so teams need to be sure they are paying attention to the show schedule. A quick-moving scout may get from one corner of the conference to the opposite side in 15 minutes, or 3 turns, while a fighter wearing a giant robot armor suit may take an hour or 12 turns. Once in an area with a potential object, searchers use their observation skills to look for them. Someone more observant will use fewer turns to search the area. Two searchers on a team will do it faster, and an enemy in the room can distract the searcher.&#10;&#10;Classes&#10;&#10;Searchers find items based on a combination of factors: their statistics, environmental factors from the area card, time elapsed, and dice. Be sure to read the room because if your cosplay matches your environment, the others in the room will help your search, whereas you in a pirate outfit will surely be harassed by a room full of furries.&#10;&#10;Scouts are used to transfer information, outfits, and relic pieces quickly. If a room changes from one theme to another during an investigation, a scout may need to purchase and run a new costume over. Once a relic piece is found, you may want to use your scout to get it back to your base as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Fighters are the brawn that are used to steal a relic piece from scouts or to help escort a weak scout back to base. They can also interrupt a searcher or keep an enemy from entering a room being examined.&#10;&#10;How to Win&#10;&#10;The winning team will have gathered all the relic pieces in their base before the event ends.&#10;&#10;",

Numerous beyond belief and driven always to fight and conquer, the Orks threaten to overwhelm every single galactic empire, stronghold and race.

You must be cautious as there are many predators in this place, including the T-Rex. However, if you take too long, your dinosaurs can starve, escape, or even turn on their captors.&#10;&#10;In Dinosaur Whisperers, you work cooperatively with other players or you can play solo. Your objectives are two-fold: first you must explore the land to find some dinosaur specimens, then you must safely guide them back to your ships before you are overcome by the dangers of the island.&#10;&#10;The game starts with several hex tiles that make up the main play area. Players collaboratively place their workers on the available spaces to perform those actions, such as explore, move, feed dinosaurs, etc. As you explore, new tiles are drawn from the deck to expand the map; each tile provides new worker actions, events, and items to help you on your expedition. Many of the tiles also increase the likelihood that the dreaded T-Rex will appear and hunt you down.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Morgana introduces two new resources: &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Mistletoe&quot; that are present in all three new modules. Gold is used to procure other resources like shields, flags, and building materials. It is also worth points at the end of the game.  Mistletoe may be spent to ignore one requirement on a mission card, making them easier to fulfill.&#10;&#10;Module 1: Morgana&#10;&#10;The enchantress Morgana is interfering with the search for the heir to the throne! Players may use Morgana once per round to help their cause and make it harder for other players to accomplish their goals. This module significantly increases the amount of direct player interaction in the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game round one Morgana die per player is rolled. Once per round for their turn, a player may choose to use a Morgana die and place it according to the depicted pips onto a cauldron, activating various special abilities. Additionally, they may move the Morgana figure on the board between principalities,  which blocks the principality as long as she is present. Nobody can place any figure (knight or Merlin) on the principality making any resources there unobtainable until Morgana is moved again (knights no longer count this space while moving)!&#10;&#10;Additionally Morgana brings her poisoned apples, which can be used by players to manipulate any knight die and even move other players knights to do your action, really interfering with other player's plans!&#10;&#10;And one more thing&mdash;using a Morgana die and spending construction materials or gold to increase the number to 7 will award the player the drinking horn that is kept in front of the player (till another player takes it from them, like Excalibur or the Holy Grail). The drinking horn not only awards one victory point as well as a poisoned apple immediately, but also gives victory points at the end of each round to the player who currently holds it.&#10;&#10;Module 2: Caerleon&#10;&#10;Caerleon offers hopefuls to the crown a host of new options in approaching their quest. Caerleon is comprised of 6 districts that replace the principalities on the game board. Each district works differently and alter the game play of the base game in various ways:&#10;&#10;Textile district - Here players gain a flag of any color, but it is also the only place in the city where players now can gain flags. When placing the flag-bearer, players may choose two flags instead of one.&#10;&#10;Stone cutter district - Here players gain a construction material of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get construction materials. When placing the builder, players may choose two materials instead of one.&#10;&#10;Armor district - Here players gain a shield of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get shields. When placing the shield-bearer, players may choose two shields instead of one.&#10;&#10;Gold district - Here players earn two gold each time they place a henchmen.&#10;&#10;Merchant district - Here players can gain up to 4 resources, flags, shields, and construction material of their choosing. But for each resource they have to pay either one gold or another of their resources.&#10;&#10;Garden district - Here players gain apples and/or mistletoe to help them on their quest.&#10;&#10;Caerleon is very challenging and gives players a way to experience Merlin in a totally new light. New strategies and tactics wait to be discovered.&#10;&#10;Module 3: Market&#10;&#10;The market gives players the opportunity to acquire different goods by spending gold. To qualify for using the market, they must not have completed a mission on their turn. Each of the available goods costs one gold, and once taken by a player is not replaced until the good is used or a scoring has taken place. Players may use these goods when they see fit, but they have to return any market good at the end of a scoring (After the 2nd, 4th and 6th round).&#10;&#10;The market goods:&#10;&#10;Shields and Construction materials &mdash; work the same as other shields and construction materials.&#10;&#10;Apple / Mistletoe &mdash; There tokens may be used either as an apple or as a mistletoe.&#10;&#10;+ 1 Influence - When the player uses the Lady-in-waiting to place an influence, they make place the token under the influence, making it count as two influence.&#10;&#10;Extra die - The token functions as an extra die of a specific value, granting the player an extra turn when they want. The number cannot be altered in any way though.&#10;&#10;- description from publisher's Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

To climb one step ahead in your career you trade in career points. The first one to reach his/her highest career step (minister, boss or CEO) wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are 12 different supporters and four different actions. These you trade in, exchange and claim and thereby increase your career point budget. And once in a while a player sabotages another with a special event.&#10;&#10;The dynamics and relations of the cards mock real world career situations and present the whole area in a fun way which can inspire reminiscing and story-telling.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Whole swathes of realspace are left burning in the Thousand Sons&rsquo; wake, yet each battle is but a single step in a larger plan, a lone ripple in the corrupted stream of fate.&#10;&#10;Codex: Thousand Sons contains a wealth of background and rules &ndash; the definitive book for Thousand Sons collectors.

    "Description": "Based on one of the nations favourite TV game shows.  Predict the survey results to win BIG!  Who will be crowned Family Fortunes Champion.  Our survey said....&#10;&#10;Contents:  2 rules cards, 1 buzzer card, 3 lost life cards, 5 spot prize cards, 70 question cards&#10;&#10;It's just like the TV show.  Two teams (or individuals) must try to guess the most popular answers given by the British public when asked everyday, but entertaining, questions.&#10;&#10;The players split into two teams.  One full game comprises three single money rounds, two double money rounds and one final Big Money round.&#10;&#10;The single and double money rounds are the same - the teams race to give the first answer, and if they don't come up with the top answer, the other team can try to beat the first team's answer to win the chance to play or pass.  Then the playing team tries to give all the answers that feature on the card, until either they finish the card, or lose three lives.  If they lose three lives, the other team has a chance to steal by supplying one of the remaining answers.&#10;&#10;The big money round is the finale, and each team nominates one player to represent it.  This round is a quick fire round - the players have to write down an answer to five of the cards, and win points for answers that are on the card, with bonus points for getting the top answer.&#10;&#10;The teams add up their points and see who is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The sweets come in 4 different colours (yellow, red, green and blue) and 4 different shapes (a dummy, crocodile, bear and sweet in its wrapping). 9 counters, of which 4 colours, 4 shapes and 1 sweet wild card with 4 colours&#10;&#10;Turn over the top card on the pile and place it next to the&#10;pile. At this point, look for the colour and shape that appear the same number of times indicated in the card you have just turned over. Once you have found them, take the counters.&#10;&#10;When you have all stopped taking counters, the players who have guessed right earn a card to be put to one side. As there are always 2 cards to be earned (one for colour and one for shape), take the turned-over card and the card on the top of the pile.&#10;&#10;Sometimes, no colour or shape appear in the required quantities. In this case, you only need to take the wild-card sweet. The player who get it, earns 2 cards.&#10;&#10;The game finishes when there are no more cards in the middle of the table. The player with most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
