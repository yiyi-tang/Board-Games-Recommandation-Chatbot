You gain points by increasing your reputation with the Council Worlds, promoting your Crew, researching Anomalies, recruiting Freelancers, and completing Missions. All of these brave endeavors will score you points and lead to your victory. Running your starship entails assigning crew to different stations on your ship board, which allows you to assign dice to those stations to activate ship actions. Move and explore space, encounter raiders, face anomalies, and use your crew abilities and skills to fulfill mission requirements and activate their bonuses. Manage your ship's power, weapons, and shields, and recruit and promote crew members to enhance your ship and achieve objectives to ensure your side prevails.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game, each player takes a turn in clockwise order. On your turn, you must take 2 actions (and any free actions that you want) before ending your turn by passing or spending 1 to recruit a freelancer or promote a Crew on your ship. The round ends with each player Activating the Warbound. When any end game condition is met, players calculate their final score to determine who wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You don't know how long it will be before power can be restored. Dealing with uncertainty and insecurity, possibly with failures and losses, the situation will make enormous demands on you.&#10;&#10;Each round of a game is a complete day, broken into day and night. Different events happen in day and night, with these events becoming more serious and all-encompassing as the days progress. Initially everyone still has enough to eat, but people might be stuck in elevators, and accidents or fires can occur as the population handles open flame to cook.&#10;&#10;Over time, food will run out, people will need more care, and the population needs to be informed about what measures the administration is taking. To solve these problems, the players control five teams &mdash; fire brigade, police, rescue service, construction, and administration &mdash; each with three members. Each team has important skills, but they can also crossover to handle other tasks, with the construction team also being able to put out fires, for example.&#10;&#10;Teams can be used only for a certain amount of work, after which they need to recover. Players must act under time pressure and a lack of information, having only a few minutes to decide how the teams will act, with anything unaddressed remaining undone &mdash; and unfortunately unresolved tasks deteriorate the mood of the population, possibly leading to riots and chaos. Teams and time are limited, though, so you must set priorities and ration where needed.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 4-7 days, and you can determine how well you do based on the damage suffered by the population and area.&#10;&#10;",

One die will be used for Winnie the Pooh, while the other die will be one of his friends coming to help. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, however each player determines how to use the dice.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use each die to place a number in any open hexagon in any beehive. One die will be used for Winnie the Pooh, using the number on the die for a hexagon space. The other die will be used for a Friend, which will also place a number in an open hexagon space. The goal is to make number runs and/or sets of the same number in each beehive. The longer the run or the larger the set, the more points you will earn.&#10;&#10;Round Summary:&#10;&#10;- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the current round&rsquo;s track. The round tracker is just used as a helpful reference. (Over a game you will mark 24 numbers, filling all the beehives. It will be 2 numbers each round, over the 12 rounds)&#10;&#10;- Use one die for Winnie the Pooh&#10;     Choose one of the dice for Winnie the Pooh. Write the number on the die in any open hexagon space in any beehive.&#10;&#10;- Use one die for a Friend&#10;     Use the other die for one of Pooh&rsquo;s friends, using whatever their special ability is. Some friends will give you a choice between two numbers. Some friends will look at Pooh&rsquo;s die and then make another number based off of that number. Write the number in any open hexagon in any beehive. Also, mark an X over the leftmost heart on the friendship track under the friend you chose. Note: You may choose a friend more than three times, there just is not any additional bonus.&#10;&#10;- Repeat this until you have completed 12 rounds&#10;&#10;Scoring: The goal is to make number runs and/or sets of the same number in each beehive. The longer the run or the larger the set, the more points you will earn. You can use each number you wrote once for a run and once for a set. You can use the number already in the center of each beehive in multiple runs or sets. A run is three or more numbers that are connected and continuously increasing by one. A set is a group of two or more numbers that are connected and all the same number.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;Total all your runs, sets, furthest star on the honey/bee track, and also all stars earned from friends. Total these points and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Lower value cards may be used to provide relics or manuscripts to add to the prestige gained from visiting a particular holy site. You may even be able to go on pilgrimage on your own as the hermit!&#10;&#10;When you go on pilgrimage, you receive a scoring card and discard all the cards you played. Players going home discard only one of the cards they played. Scoring cards give you 5-10 victory points, and there are chances to add to these using lower-value cards you play.&#10;&#10;The more you go on pilgrimage, the smaller your band of followers becomes, making it more difficult to compete against your opponents, so you need to choose when to admit defeat and go home early in the hope of attracting more impressive followers to your cause.&#10;&#10;The game is over when thirty pilgrimages have taken place, which typically means 16-20 rounds of play.&#10;&#10;This game has been in development since 2004, and now is in final stages of refining the artwork.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player builds the world as the game is played and the decisions start off right away. Players need to decided if they are going to defend, attack, upgrade, or a combination.&#10;&#10;Each player has a relic to grab from another player&rsquo;s board which means that they will have two relics from other players on their board. Each player also has customizable dice that can be upgraded during game play. The boards start empty and as the players move and do discoveries the world begins to fill out. The first player to retrieve both of their relics and bring them back to their base wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will roll three dice (more can be purchased later). Each die has one gold, one wood, one stone, and three movement. You can only bank the gold and the others need to be used that turn. Anything rolled could be used for movement instead of the resources rolled. You use movement to create pathways to your relics. You can use gold to discover more gold, wood, and stone Tetris like pieces which can also be used to block other players. After you make a discovery you can take that resource and modify your dice to improve your future rolls. Other combinations of resources are used to build walls, bridges, and more soldiers. When you have your relic you can only move at half speed to bring it back to base. After someone drops both relics off at base the game immediately ends with that person as victor.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The players &#204;&#129; task is to design pavilions across the square to protect pedestrians in the rain. Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.&#10;&#10;The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be &quot;slid&quot; onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.&#10;&#10;Players score points for completing rows and columns, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Competitors throw 44-pound granite stones (or &quot;rocks&quot;) down an ice sheet into a bulls-eye target area (the &ldquo;house&rdquo;) at either end of the 155 foot playing surface. Teammates often furiously sweep the ice with brooms to affect a thrown rock&rsquo;s speed or trajectory. This is a finesse sport.&#10;&#10;In Big Time Curling two players each hold an 8-card hand composed of three types of cards: Guards, Draws and Takeouts. Guards are blocking stones that make it harder to throw (or &quot;draw&quot;) a stone into the bulls-eye (&quot;house&quot;) or remove (&quot;takeout&quot;) one. After all 16 cards have been played a round (&quot;end&quot;) is completed. The stone closest to the center of the house determines the winner of the &ldquo;end&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The winning team scores a point for each rock closer to the center than the opponents&rsquo; best rock -- while the opposing team doesn&rsquo;t score at all!&#10;&#10;All cards are reshuffled and a new round is played. After ten rounds the game is complete. The player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player wants, in his turn and using only two actions, to move his hero to the exit of the labyrinth, but by the longest way he can, because each piece his hero passes through will bring him more points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The second game mode is done through challenges. A number of actions and a special power are shown to all players, who simultaneously imagine the longest possible path.

There are four elements, and each element is represented by unique colored elemental ring.  There are four dragons, and each dragon is represented by one of the elements.  The game is over when the elements at sea are exhausted and your island creators are relying on you to provide protection and good fortune for the coming year.&#10;&#10;Your gameplay is influenced by your dragon's elemental alignment, and you will need to gather raw elemental rings from the sea purifying them at elemental shrines. Once the elemental rings have been purified, they are placed onto your island, protecting your creators and also scoring you points. May the best water dragon win.&#10;&#10;Tatsumi explores new type of resource drafting that revolves around each player's dragon and its positioning and movement around the board. The 3D board physically holds every gatherable resource in the game, eliminating round to round setup tasks and allowing you to strategically plan ahead.  Resources are needed to complete set collections and are then placed onto your island into your point scoring engine.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may perform two actions, one of which is a flying action (you are a dragon).  The other action is a choice between gathering resources, scoring resources, or shedding a scale. Flying is single point-to-point movement, often setting up your position on the board for your next action. Gathering is taking two resources from the board as a result of your position and unique dragon.  Scoring is transferring gathered rings onto your island and scoring points based on each color ring that you transferred.  Shedding a scale provides a unique opportunity to interface with the game, often taken during an awkward board state or positioning, and it provides a short term or long term benefit provided.&#10;&#10;When you're done with the game, simply reload the 3d board with rings for storage and affix the lid to enable a quick set-up next time you play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They have fought countless petty wars that have spurred their military and economic growth. Their influence and conflicts extend around the globe, and the aristocracy have no wish to see it end...but change is coming. Great alliances are forming, and the nations of Europe are consolidating their power for the final struggle. Will one nation's imperialist dreams raise them up as the world's sole power, will the world leaders form a great League of Nations to end all wars, or will the century old rivalries pull the world into the most horrific war ever seen?&#10;&#10;As the leader of one of the five great powers in Europe, you will compete to spread and protect your influence around the globe using military, economic, and diplomatic might. Use the press to sway public opinion to force nations into alliances or war, and upgrade your empire's capabilities by establishing control over important regions of the world. You must be careful, though, because the world is on the brink of all-out war and it could spell the end of the West's dominance.&#10;&#10;In Western Twilight, you will perform actions using your personal rondel, with opportunities to upgrade it with enhanced and new abilities for a unique engine-building experience. Compete with the other nations of Europe for control of territories around the world by competitively drafting cards to place your nation's military, economic, or diplomatic influence markers. You must be cautious because every action you take can bring the world one step closer to the war to end all wars.&#10;&#10;Western Twilight can end in three ways: diplomatically, economically, or militarily. Each ending will change how your different influence markers will score, so you must steer the world down the path you are most prepared to win, whether that be peace or war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Drop Pods is a roll and write, print and play, solo player, tabletop game. You will need two six sided dice, a pencil, the rule book, contract and map.&#10;&#10;The world has changed&hellip;.&#10;&#10;These are dark times. The world is being battered by an alien threat. We did not know what to call it at first but now it is known as Pod Fall. A wave of unidentified objects, hundreds of thousands of pods, carried by a solar current, struck the planet atmosphere and rained down upon the lands. Where they came from nobody knows but it was soon clear that the pods carried aggressive alien creatures bent upon terraforming the world in their own image. To our horror the pods were too numerous to repel, the outer shells hard to crack and the aliens within monstrously difficult to fight. But they had one vulnerability. They take time to hatch and so traps can be set up around the pods and as they emerge, they are triggered, and the aliens would have an unexpected and often lethal welcome to our world.&#10;&#10;The fight back began. There were too many pods for the military to destroy by themselves though and the tide turned against us. So, the general public came forward and formed Pod Task Forces, small groups that went in and setup improvised traps around the pods the army did not have the resources to deal with. Even lone fighters embraced what was being called the Human Responsibility. Now the future has a chance as the tide has been slowed as fewer aliens can break free to seed the world in their terrible image. But it is on a knife edge as circumstances could easily turn in the enemy&rsquo;s favour. So, until enough of the newly emerged aliens have been exterminated, the Pod Task Forces must continue their work for the sake of humanity.&#10;&#10;Your Role&#10;&#10;You have gathered together some willing volunteers and formed a small Pod Task Force and will be taking available Pod Contracts. These are issued at the town hall by Sarge, the resident Warrant Officer. By setting up the Pod Contracts the government acknowledges that, as well as doing their duty, ordinary civilians should be rewarded for carrying out the trapping of pods and therefore the killing or injuring of aliens. If completed these contracts reward the player with Experience Points and Resources Coupons. The world has come out of a ravaging few months and resources are in short supply and the government needs to distribute these who they can trust to do the job properly.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We must be seen to be helping the cause and when the time comes, and the world is free of the vile alien grip, then those who have fought the invasion will be rewarded.&rdquo;&#10;Sarge reminds you of your responsibility.&#10;&#10;Aim&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to eradicate as many aliens as possible, through the use of traps, in your allocated Pod Contract location. Pods will attempt to hatch when they sense movement nearby so there is a small window in which to construct the trap and then see it triggered as the alien attempts to confront the intruder. In each session you have one Pod Contract and encounter one location but once cleared there are plenty more and your Pod Task Force can continue on their campaign of eradication. You can keep the same characters and try harder maps as they become more experienced.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You take the lead of two rival intelligence agencies and try to find out as much information about each other's actions as possible.&#10;&#10;At the same time, you are careful to keep your own actions secret. The more explosive an action is, the higher its value and the more important it is that it doesn't come to light.&#10;&#10;You may now take turns revealing four cards at a time. Then add up the points of the revealed cards. Every enemy secret goes to your account, no matter who revealed it. The points of the double agent go to the person who uncovered it. However, no points are awarded for the dead end. When you have deducted the minus points from the overlapped cards, whoever has the most points left over wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flicking game on a revolving wooden board with some similarities to Carrom and Crokinole.  The game was created by the owner of Maison du Billard in France, Philipe Rog&eacute;, and won the Concours Lepine Gold Medal in 2009.&#10;&#10;Each player has 4 coloured discs that are positioned on the circles marked on the playing surface. The player who starts is drawn at random, and play goes clockwise.&#10;&#10;When a player shoots an opposing disc into the black hole in the middle of the board, he can play again. If his disc enters the hole at the same time as an opposing pawn, he passes the turn to the next player. Direct or indirect shots are allowed.&#10;&#10;1) If a player shoots one of his discs out of the playing field, it will be lost and taken out of play. If it is an opposing disc, it will be placed on the circle closest to where it went off the board.&#10;&#10;2) If a player by mistake plays (touches or shoots with) an opposing disc, his disc furthest from the hole will be taken out of play.&#10;&#10;POSSIBLE GAME ENDINGS:&#10;&#10;The last player who has one or more discs left on the playing surface is the winner. If there is only one disc left for each of the last two players and one of them pockets both of them at the same time, the game is drawn and must be replayed. There are no winners or losers.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player no longer has a disc on the playing surface, the game is over, and the 1 point per disc is scored for the other players. The first player who reaches 5 points wins the game. It takes 2 points difference to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",
