Prepare for restless dead, secret societies, and unholy artifacts!&#10;&#10;Ancient Relics is based on the theme of the global influence of the Ancient Ones and their cults and moves the action from H.P. Lovecraft's dread-filled New England to the wider world. In Curse of the Jade Emperor players will find exotic, yet hauntingly familiar characters and tales, pulled from the myths and legends of ancient China. The Middle Kingdom's undying past collides with a present made all the more uncertain through the interference of diverse otherworldly actors.&#10;&#10;The pull of China is strong and in Call of Cthulhu it attracts academics from Miskatonic University, eager to study the history and artifacts of one of the world's oldest civilizations. The forces of law and order also come to do battle with some of the world's deadliest criminal organizations. Curse of the Jade Emperor also follows Ancient Relics' over-arching theme of artifacts with great and terrible power reoccurring throughout history. Pack your bags for a voyage to the Orient in Curse of the Jade Emperor!&#10;&#10;",

The basic game mechanism is a kind of reverse werewolf/mafia game where the secret character, The Doctor, is the only person who can&rsquo;t kill anyone and has to survive on wits and confusion alone.&#10;&#10;Background: (Or buy the DVD and watch it!)&#10;Human soldiers and the mysterious headless monks are working together in an uneasy alliance. They have kidnapped The Doctor&rsquo;s companion (Amy Pond) and taken her to the asteroid know a Demon&rsquo;s Run. The Doctor arrives on the asteroid disguised as one of the monks but reveals himself and demands Amy&rsquo;s return. The lights go out and then back on, all orchestrated by the doctor, of course. Now the soldiers are stood there facing the monks. The soldiers know that one of the monks is their feared enemy, The Doctor, determined to foil their plans. All they have to do is to work out which monk is The Doctor in disguise and shoot him before he escapes. But if they shoot the wrong monk they will feel the wrath of their allies and be killed themselves by the monks dying blast. The monks themselves know that the soldiers are trigger happy and might shoot them. It might be best for them to zap any of the trigger happy soldiers before they themselves are killed - at least the other soldiers would know that they were a monk and not The Doctor. But the monks&rsquo; plan needs the soldiers and if they lose all of their soldiers then their plans will fail and The Doctor will triumph. The soldiers and monks need to act quickly before The Doctor is able to escape. The scene is set for the Demon&rsquo;s Run Standoff.&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;The players take on the role of soldiers, headless monks and The Doctor through a series of standoffs. During each standoff: the soldiers try to kill The Doctor; the monks try to direct the soldiers to The Doctor, and The Doctor just tries to survive. At the end of the standoff, points are given to players whose characters are still alive.&#10;&#10;",

To to this, players must roll their dice to assemble sets that first match the number on the &quot;Crew Dice&quot; which represent the Cabin Boy, Ship's Cook, and First Mate.  This becomes more challenging as there are limited spaces on the boat for dice sets to be placed, and the first player can change throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The game is normally continued until one player scores 30 to 50 points, when the player with the most points overall is dubbed the new Captain of the ship.&#10;&#10;Keel-Hauled has been discontinued, and is no longer available at The Game Crafter website.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Derelicts of Sin: Heresy is the first in a series of games revolving around the Derelicts of Sin and the dark past of the Theocratic Council.&#10;&#10;Heresy revolves around Kyle Mason, the sole survivor of a terrible act of sabotage.  Hoping to find oxygen before he asphyxiates, Kyle limps his sabotaged ship into a forbidden Cursed Zone called &quot;the Wreckage.&quot;  There, he boards one of the Derelicts of Sin, the Heresy, desperate to find the supplies he needs to survive and return home.&#10;&#10;This solo game seeks to recreate the feel of classic text-based adventures.  The player takes on the role of engineer Kyle Mason.  Oxygen is used as action points to move, open locked doors, restore power, etc.  The player begins on the Airlock tile.  As he or she explores the ship, additional tiles are drawn randomly and added to the ship.  These tiles provide instructions on how to further advance, reveal the items that can be found in the new room, and detail the the puzzle(s), if any, that must be solved in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;In the current version, a player sheet is used to track the player's physical and mental states (which affect the player's ability to search the ship and perform various actions), as well as the player's oxygen level and inventory.  Another optional version is in development that will use chart tiles and tokens to track these things.&#10;&#10;As the player explores the ship, he or she will find data cards that gradually reveal the terrible fate of the Heresy and its passengers and crew.  They also provide victory points that are key to obtaining the specific ending a player desires.  Without sufficient victory points, players will lose when they end the game, so it's important to find as many data cards as possible.&#10;&#10;This game was developed as part of the  Solitaire Print-and-Play Contest at http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/644090/solitaire-print-and-play-contest/page/1.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 5 dice of a single, unique color. In the center of the mini-trampoline is set a heavy, non-fragile cereal bowl. The players space themselves evenly around the mini-trampoline and place all five of their dice on the game surface in front of them. Each player has a polo mallet (at times also known as a serving spoon). On the starting signal, all players strike underneath the mini-trampoline with their polo mallet to try to propel their dice into the bowl. The first player to get all 5 dice in the bowl is the winner. This game is an alternative to the difficult to obtain Piratenbillard.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dept. 13 is a game in which players use the Steel and Glory System to battle the creatures created by Occult Nazi Forces. Dept. 13 is a secret government agency dedicated to fighting supernatural forces. The game includes super spies (who are identified only by one letter initials), Nazi zombies, ghouls, mad scientists, and themes of occult horror. As with the other games in the S&amp;G system, the battles are very quick and can be fought one-on-one or with players each controlling large groups. Each character has several unique stats, including their fighting ability, and the cost to hire them as a mercenary into your fighting force.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&#10;&#10;",

The troll will take the customer&rsquo;s orders and he hope the gnomes make their work fast, very fast; because if they delay an order, the customer (another troll, usually!) will get angry and leave the restaurant without paying.&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;15 order cards&#10;95 product cards&#10;12 counters: 3 green, 3 blue, 3 yellow and 3 red&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;&quot;Trollburger&quot; is a 2-player card game. At the start of the turn, the starting player turn over the top deck card and show the number on it.&#10;&#10;If that number is equal or higher thant the number of order cards on table, another order card is drawn and placed on the table.&#10;&#10;Then the starting player choose to perform one of 4 actions on his turn. He can make that action as many times as the number shown at the start of the turn:&#10;&#10;-Take cards from the product deck&#10;   -Search a card from the product deck&#10;   -Discard cards from the hand&#10;   -Place products on the table to build a burger&#10;&#10;Then, he can choose to deliver a burger to the customers. The player can deliver an incomplete burger, in the hope that the customer does not realize.&#10;&#10;Next, the other player takes his turn, using the same number; &#10;and at last he becomes the starting player for the next turn.&#10;&#10;If at any time, a 5th order has to be added on tha table, the older order on table is discarded (and any player who was working on it, loses his product cards).&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;&#10;When a player devilers an order he takes that order card. &#10;The game ends if 4 orders are discarded or the last order card is drawn.&#10;At the end of the game, each player add the victory points of his order cards. The player with more victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;(Here you can find all the files to print &amp; play your own Trollburger).&#10;&#10;&#10;Los jugadores son gnomos que trabajan para un troll en una hamburgueseria. El troll les ha comunicado que uno de ellos sera despedido al final del dia; aquel que aporte menos al negocio. El troll es el encargado de coger los pedidos de los clientes y espera que los gnomos hagan su trabajo rapido, muy rapido; pues si se retrasan en entregar un pedido, el cliente (normalmente otro troll!!) se va a enfadar y se ira del restaurante si haber consumido.COMPONENTES DEL JUEGO&#10;&#10;15 cartas de pedidos&#10;95 cartas de productos&#10;12 contadores: 3 verdes, 3 azules, 3 amarillos y 3 rojos&#10;Reglas&#10;&#10;EL JUEGO&#10;&#10;&quot;Trollburger&quot; es un juego de cartas para 2 jugadores. Al principio del turno, el jugador inicial gira la carta superior de la baraja y muestra el n&uacute;mero que aparece en ella.&#10;&#10;Si ese numero es igual o mayor que el numero de cartas de pedidos en la mesa, aparece una nueva carta de pedido y se a&ntilde;ade al centro de la mesa.&#10;&#10;Despu&eacute;s el jugador inicial elige cual de 4 posibles acciones quiere realizar en su turno. Podra hacer esa accion tantas veces como el numero que se ha mostrado al principio del turno:&#10;&#10;-Coger cartas de la baraja de productos&#10;   -Buscar una carta en la baraja de productos&#10;   -Descartar cartas de la mano&#10;   -Colocar productos en la mesa para elaborar una hamburguesa&#10;&#10;Despues, puede elegir entregar una hamburguesa a los clientes. El jugador puede entregar una hamburguesa que no este acabada, con la esperanza de que el cliente no se de cuenta.&#10;&#10;Acto seguido, el otro jugador realiza su turno, usando el mismo numero; y al final se convierte en el jugador inicial para el siguiente turno.&#10;&#10;Si en algun momento, se debe anadir un 5&ordm; pedido a la mesa, el pedido mas antiguo que hubiera en la mesa se descarta (y cualquier jugador que estuviera elaborando ese bocata, pierde los productos que tuviera en la mesa).&#10;&#10;OBJETIVO&#10;&#10;Cuando un jugador entrega un pedido se queda esa carta de pedido.&#10;El juego finaliza si 4 pedidos se han descartado o si se muestra el ultimo pedido del mazo.&#10;Al final de la partida, cada jugador suma los puntos de victoria de sus cartas de pedidos. El jugador con mas puntos de victoria es el ganador.&#10;&#10;(Aqui puedes encontrar todos los archivos necesarios para imprimir y jugar a tu propio Trollburger)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Freedom is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Veljko Cirovic and Nebojsa Sankovic in 2010. It is played with black and white stones on a square board. The game is related to Go-Moku and Slimetrail. It can be played with a Go set or with pen and paper.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Board: Freedom is played on a 10&times;10 square board. Beginners can try the game on a 8&times;8 board. Other board sizes may be also used.&#10;&#10;Objective: The objective of Freedom is to have more &quot;live&quot; stones at the end of the game, than your opponent. A stone is considered to be &quot;live&quot; if it is a part of some horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of exactly 4 stones of the same color.&#10;&#10;Play: A game begins with an empty board. Each player has an allocated color: White and Black. White plays first, putting one white stone anywhere on the board. After this move players take turns placing their stones on empty cells adjacent to the last opponent's stone. If all cells adjacent to the last opponent's stone are occupied then the player gets the right (&quot;freedom&quot;) to place his stone on any empty cell of the board. The game ends when the board is filled with stones. The last player has the right to pass on his last turn (and leave the last cell empty) if placing his stone reduces his score.&#10;&#10;",

The first to do so cries &quot;Piktee&quot; and scores 50 points and claims the Free Kick card, and a new deal starts (the Free Kick card has no purpose at all so I do not know why it was included in the game).&#10;If a player dares, he may not call out his 5 card team but he can wait to get a six card team. If he is still the first to call &quot;Piktee&quot; he will score double points but, of course, by waiting, someone else might call a team before him and he will not score.&#10;The Penalty card is exactly that, a penalty card. If you are caught with it in your hand when &quot;Piktee&quot; is called, you lose 25 points.&#10;The first player to score 500 points after several deals, wins.&#10;&#10;",

Lesser known is that between eating (and being eaten) they while away their time with a simple fishing game.&#10;&#10;As a fishing game, the goal of the game is to capture cards. Each player will play two cards every turn, capturing cards using either the sum or difference of the played cards. The players that captures the most cards scores points for the round. The first player to reach twenty-two points wins the game and is granted the privilege to be the first bunny out for dinner.&#10;&#10;The game is a reinvention of the classic Moroccan fishing game Ronda.  Aside from using the Decktet instead of the Latin Deck, the game is also played with two cards at a time and bonuses are given for suit combinations played.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A feeding frenzy for two bunnies.&#10;&#10;This is a simple fishing game of capturing cards off the tableau. The game starts with an 8x3 grid of cards face up on the table.  After splitting the undealt cards (using a split the pie mechanism) the players capture cards by playing one or more cards whose rank adds up equal or higher than the card being captured.  Each of the capturing cards must share a suit with the card being taken. After the tableau is cleared, the players add up the values of their captured cards to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Even though the game was designed as a light game, it is almost completely a perfect information game.  The only moment where there is not perfect information is when the players determine the split of the hand -- and even then they can figure out which cards the opponent is splitting.  As such it could be played as a very memory heavy, intense, spatial game.&#10;&#10;The game was inspired by the designer's pet rabbit who is by far the most enthusiastic and fastest eating bunny the designer has ever seen. The girl has no problems yanking food right out of her partner's mouth, but is readily aggrieved if she does not get her fair share of the produce.&#10;&#10;",

As a great house in this kingdom, you must work with &ndash; and against &ndash; your fellow houses to bring stability, order, and progress to a struggling land.&#10;&#10;You will use loyal Retainers from your court to secure your fiefs and gather Labor &ndash; one of the five types of Power you can earn and spend. As you develop and grow, you will find it advantageous to grant land to Monks, Knights, and Merchants, each of whom earns you a different type of Power. This also frees up Retainers so they can be used to take more actions on the game&rsquo;s various boards.&#10;&#10;These boards reflect the kingdom&rsquo;s customs &ndash; its political, religious, economic, and feudal structures. Each custom offers the players a unique set of actions, and some include Offices - positions of influence that grant their holders bonus Power as well as access to exclusive actions. Just as important, each custom dictates the types of Power valued by society; houses that produce the right kinds of Power will gain more Glory, and will ultimately win the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to paying for actions, Power can be used to change the customs themselves, opening up new actions and offices, and altering the types of Power that will lead to victory. Players must therefore either adapt to new customs, or work to ensure that the existing customs remain in place. As you navigate your way to greatness and victory, you will find yourself arranging marriages, earning titles, erecting grand structures, and fighting alongside your fellow Houses as foreign nations invade the kingdom, but in the end only one house will be celebrated in the history books. That house must, by rights, be yours&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

In order to win, a player must form a BODY and get rid of all the cards in their hand, going out of play with only body parts in front of them with at least one each of a HEAD, TORSO and FEET and the KROWN card, with no other cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;[i]From the Box:[/i]&#10;Whats Dwyn?&#10;A game with lots of card swapping.

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;A Monopoly style game featuring the Scheels sporting goods company.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Let's Rodeo is a game for people to enjoy the sport of rodeo anyplace, anytime.  This game is designed to show how one rodeos, starting from the amateur right up to the pro circuit and through to the finals.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move around the game board, which consists of two circuits, amateur and pro. All players start by moving around the amateur circuit. Players enter rodeos by landing on a rodeo square and paying the entry fee. A card is then drawn which gives the player's result in the rodeo and money is awarded. Each rodeo can be entered multiple times.  There are places on the board where players must pay money and some where broke players can earn money. Filling a &quot;permit&quot; (earning a set amount of money) is necessary to move into the pro circuit.&#10;&#10;Once in the pro circuit each player must enter and place in each of the 8 pro rodeos.  Each rodeo can only be entered once. Once any player has completed all 8 pro rodeos the finals begin.  Any players still on the amateur circuit are eliminated. All players on the pro circuit roll dice to find out their standings in the final events.  Winnings in the finals are added to money earned in the pro circuit and the winner is the player with the most money.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Counter is a miniature game that lets you assemble a squad of troops that meets your requirements and then pit them against your opponents in real time.&#10;Played in 30 second rounds, players race their miniatures over the contested hot-spots of the battle field while targeting and throwing out cover fire as best they can.&#10;&#10;But speed and reflex must be tempered with strategy and patience.&#10;Expend more resources than your opponents and they will get the drop on you.&#10;&#10;But perhaps your squad has an ace or two up it's sleeve?&#10;Did you bring more gunners than your opponent to likely win any fire fight? Or perhaps you opted to bring Heavies to devastate the battlefield and control the field of play? Or maybe you decided to unleash the kind of tactics and tricks that only your Ops can bring to a squad?&#10;&#10;In any case, the battle will be fast a vicious, and leave you with plenty to consider and tinker with before the next battle begins.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Game play for Counter consists of 30 second rounds of frantic live action troop maneuvers performed by all players simultaneously.&#10;Strategy and nerve must be used to lay out your action chips on the zones marked out in the battle field, as their placement will allow for different actions to take place:&#10;- place them down in a zone and you can then move a troop on top of them, provided you can get him there fast enough&#10;- place your chip on top of another players chip to lay down cover fire, preventing an enemy entering that zone.&#10;- use your chips to target the troops in a zone, then get your troops in range to finish them off.&#10;- reserve your chips to build up your intuitive and get the drop on other combatants, firing before they do. &#10;All of these actions and more take place fluidly, and then the action resolves in a snap when the timer chimes, then in a flash it continues on in subsequent rounds until the battle field is secured or left devastated.&#10;&#10;The dynamic real time action system along with team construction and the various orders and tactics that players can field with Op cards ensures every game of Counter will demand thought and instinct of a high caliber from all players.&#10;&#10;",
