At the same time, they try to guess what will be in demand.&#10;&#10;Each of the six Decktet suits represents a different colour or style of fabric. Players use cards to influence the value of each style and collect chips representing investment in particular styles.

You take the roles of brave warriors and fight for your life against the opponents. The objective of the game is to develop your character, earn experience and finally become the King of Albion. In order to do this, you equip your character with various weapons, explore loactions (represented by special cards) and collect resources (represented by tokens). You may also play event cards and send enemies against your opponents. After collecting a number of Experience Points, you may spend them to advance your character, becoming more powerful.&#10;&#10;There is one major rule - to survive. Do not count on a warm welcome. Your character will get beaten and robbed many times. Everyone waits for your mistake, and a thug hunting for people like you hides in dark backstreets. But you can earn respect and eternal fame if you do not break down, but grin and bear the adversities of fate. However, if you only complain, you will earn nothing more than scorn and oblivion. Are you prepared for such a tough life? If so - enter bravely the gates of Albion, if not - leave now and come back when you are ready!&#10;&#10;The game was created for Proglobal - an IT company best known for a MMORPG 'Arena Albionu', a Polish browser-game which has been functioning online for over 7 years now and has about 650 000 registered players' accounts. The game is defined by two main elements - the technical side and the players who create an Internet community. The plot of the game takes place in a medieval reality. The weapons of ancient knights and warriors from various cultures are graphically presented.&#10;&#10;The game contains the following components:&#10;- 110 cards&#10;- 56 tokens&#10;- the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Each running cars through a series of moves, shooting attacks, ramming actions, and special maneuvers, the players struggle to be the best of the best.&#10;&#10;-- Description from the back cover of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book&#10;&#10;Gearmageddon was designed to be a game, plain and simple. We wanted to make something fast and fun that could be played within a hour to an hour-and-a-half with minimal brainwave expenditure. Gearmageddon is kind of a zero-calorie asphalt death match.&#10;&#10;- From the Introduction of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book&#10;&#10;In Gearmageddon, there are three basic actions: move, shoot, and ram. Movement is determined by a player setting the speed of a vehicle and selecting maneuvers. Combat is performed using a target number system. Collision damage is calculated based on speeds and structures of vehicles. Driver Cards provide opportunities for rule-breaking events that can instantly change the tide of battle. Weapon and Upgrade Cards are used for quick reference during games.&#10;&#10;In addition to rules for arena combat, Gearmageddon has rules for combat races based on the 2008 movie Death Race.&#10;&#10;The Core Rules includes rules for cars, motorcycles and tractor-trailers. Gearmageddon was designed to be used with 1/64 scale vehicle miniatures and 3D components. The game's simple rule of erring on the side of a rules decision that causes maximum damage accelerates gameplay.&#10;&#10;In 2011, Exploding Goat Games, LLC started the Worldwide Arena Series, a tournament that ranks Gearmageddon players according to their performance in each game played. Standings are posted weekly on the Exploding Goat Games, LLC Web site.&#10;&#10;",

Red cards are worth the most points.  Some of the cards have black corner markings which alter the points value.  When all cards are laid, the boards are scored, with points available for each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line.&#10;&#10;There are also rules supplied for an advanced version of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players move trough squares at the sides of the board, like in Monopoly. The central part of the board is a map of Western Europe, with 18 squares over each country divided in sets of three. Each set of three has a different colour, and a letter inside. The three &quot;I&quot; stand for Industry, T is for Tecnology, P is for Pesca (fishing), Tr is for Transport, A for Agriculture, and E for Energy. At the beginning of the game each player picks a card with the objective for the game, for example: &quot;Take control of all the Fishing of the Mediterranean countries plus Portugal&quot;, or &quot;Take control of the Energy and Industry of Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg&quot;. Each player has plastic counters to put over the map, on the squares with letters he needs, so when all three squares of one resource have plastic colours of one colour, their owner takes control of the resource. To put a counter on one map square, the owner must first gather a license of the resource he wants, then land on the squares of the board that allow you to place counters on the map, and then pay for them. A player can put any number of counters in one go, as long as he has the license needed, and as long as he can pay for them. &#10;The sides of the board, where players move, have several different squares. In some of them, the players can get money, or purchase licences, in others the players can put plastic counters on the map, in others they can alter the price of each counter (for example, &quot;Rise 4000 ECUS the price of Tecnology&quot;), and in others they can put counters at half-price or for free.&#10;The game includes a table to track the ups and downs of the prices of each resource, and money (1000, 5000 and 10000 ECUS banknotes. ECU, by the way, was the first name proposed for the currency that we all call Euro now.).&#10;When one player gets his Objective, the game ends, and the player who has gathered more money wins, so sometimes the first to get the Objective is not the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If they have to think for too long, their brains explode. That's why they record all their knowledge on memory cards. These cards are precious to them, and our alien friends have no intention of sharing them !&#10;&#10;27 member states of the European Union, 27 memory cards to win ! Which one of them will bring the most of them back to his mother planet ?&#10;&#10;Neurodyss&eacute;e is a Trivia game where players take the role of aliens who want to learn more about the European Union.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the players alternate taking one of the three roles:&#10;&#10;     One player is the &quot;Candidate&quot;: he must answer a question correctly to win &quot;memory&quot; cards. The number of cards he may win depends on the difficulty level he chooses.&#10;     One player is the &quot;Game Master&quot;: after the debate led by the &quot;Disturbers&quot; (see next bullet), he reads the question from the question card and the three answers.&#10;     All other players are &quot;Disturbers&quot;: each of them choses one of the answers from a randomly drawn question card and try to convince the &quot;Candidate&quot; to choose that answer, before the &quot;Candidate&quot; even knowns what the question is. Once the &quot;Game Master&quot; decides he had enough of the debate, he reads the question and all possible answers aloud and the &quot;Candidate&quot; chooses one answer.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player has a character card representing an alien with a second card that is shifted above the first to indicate the alien's brain size.&#10;&#10;If the &quot;Candidate's&quot; chose the wrong answer, his brain grows the number of levels equal to the difficulty level he chose. He also loses one of his memory cards to each &quot;Disturber&quot; who defended that answer, if any.&#10;&#10;If the candidate chose the right answer, the &quot;Disturbers&quot; who defended that answer lower their brain size by one level. The &quot;Disturbers&quot; who defended a wrong answer raise their brain size by one level.&#10;&#10;If a player's brain &quot;explodes&quot;, he draws one question card and reads all four questions. He loses memory cards to the first player who gives a correct answer to each question. The number of cards lost depends on the question's difficulty level. The player may loose up to 10 cards in this process (1+2+3+4).&#10;&#10;Once the memory card pile is empty, the player with the most memory cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The new heroes introduced in this expansion are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Captain of the Guard: The Captain of the Guard is an experienced warrior who can give orders (extra actions) to other player's heroes to carry out on their turn if he chooses, who rides a powerful battle steed, and who has the tactical ability to outwit the enemy troops advancing during his Darkness Spreads phase.&#10;&#10;&bull; Assassin: The Assassin can appear and vanish from nowhere, launching sneak attacks on minions, then vanishing to the safety of the shadows at the end of her turn. Most importantly, she has the ability to land a deathblow to any General just when the heroes think all is lost.&#10;&#10;&bull; Chaos Wizard: The Chaos Wizard is able to cast powerful spells, but the untamed magic that he uses will not only lay waste to the invading minions, but can also wound himself and other heroes, or destroy the land he is working to protect if not kept in check.&#10;&#10;&bull; Adventurer: The Adventurer holds a magical item from previous quests that gives her great ability in card management. Additionally, her questing experience enables her to complete a minor quest for Hero cards each time she ends her turn on a location with a Treasure Chest and grants an advantage on major quests. Couple all this with her ability to mingle with lowlifes of the Inns and she can be a powerful defender of the realm.&#10;&#10;",

Not only can she spend actions to Heal three wounds to Heroes at her location including herself (especially useful if losing a battle to a General), she automatically heals one wound to all Heroes at the end of her turn if on a location with them. Couple this with the ability to use minion's energy at tainted locations to heal the land and her Walk in the Light ability to ignore a General's combat abilities and you have a very valuable hero to add to your team.&#10;&#10;&bull; Druid: The Druid is very powerful in wooded areas (Green Locations) and a strong healer of the tainted land. His &quot;One with the Earth&quot; ability keeps him safe from enemies when in the woods and his ability to summon woodland creatures at any Green Location to attack Minions (even when he is not present) is extremely useful in keeping Orcs and Imps under control.&#10;&#10;&bull; Elf Lord: The Elf Lord knows the secret pathways through forests, enabling him to travel swiftly through all green locations. His mastery of Elf Magic enables him to assist himself (or other heroes) with a re-roll of one die each round, and his ability to ambush Minions and Generals in combat makes him a strong warrior in support of the realm.&#10;&#10;&bull; Monk: The Monk, a wanderer on some sacred quest for her order, is a master of the Martial Arts, enabling her to land a fury of blows with her staff on the unfortunate minions and Generals she encounters. Additionally, she uses the same training to defend herself against attacks. Her spiritual conditioning and wandering nature provide her with an additional Quest opportunity at all times as she is always holding two Quest Cards.&#10;&#10;",

Her catlike reflexes and razor-sharp claws make her a strong warrior in defense of the realm.&#10;&#10;&bull; Shaman: The Shaman, a shape-shifter and magic user, is a welcome addition to any Hero team. His Arrows of Destruction rain doom on minions and his ability to change into a Wolf or Bear grant him valuable skills in movement and combat.&#10;&#10;&bull; Seeker: The Seeker was born with the ability to glimpse the future and as such the Seeker always knows where the next Minion attack will occur and if a General will move. The sword she wields is extremely deadly because of her ability to foresee the battle beforehand, enabling her use all Special Cards as Battle Luck cards. If her attacks fail to defeat all enemy in the area, she can call upon her magic to summon images that will confuse her attackers and send them them wandering off to other lands.&#10;&#10;&bull; Thief: The Thief is the master of sneaking behind enemy lines to not only scout the army of the Dark Lord, but also to steal battle plans from the General's headquarters tent. While not the greatest of warriors, the use of her daggers in combat, especially when treasure can be stolen, often enables her to question the enemy before dispatching them and to gain valuable information in the form of Hero Cards.&#10;&#10;",

Rolling doubles explodes the dice (roll the doubles again and add to the previous roll). Any rolls of 6 automatically cause 1 point of damage to their opponent's Stamina.&#10;&#10;&#10;     If a round was won using Strength, any character reduced to zero or less Stamina loses and is out; if all characters have no Stamina, the match is a draw.&#10;     If a round was won using Agility, the winning character has pinned the losing character. Pinning a character for three consecutive rounds will cause that character to lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of each match, players can increase their character's stats using Glory Points (1 GP is gained for each point scored in their rolls, and an additional 100 GP goes to the winner of a match). Buying an additional Strength or Agility die costs the current number of dice x 100 GP (each additional die bought also adds 5 Stamina).&#10;&#10;There are additional rules for using teams, weapons, and stunning. The game includes a worked example, pre-made characters, and blank character cards.&#10;&#10;",

From the rules: &quot;The world of words is explored in The Verbal Game where the familiar form of a deck of playing cards is used to construct words that work in everday life, as well as words for special purposes, such as college entrance testing.&quot; &quot;...an exercise in the building of words through the combination of prefixes, roots, and suffixes.&quot;&#10;The 52 card deck used is composed of one suit of prefix cards, one suit of suffix cards and two suits of roots, 13 cards in each suit.  The 'de luxe' edition has two extra, more complex suits of roots for use after players are experienced with the basic roots.  Each card has from four to eight word fragments and variations from which to choose when playing.  Like a standard deck of cards, this is a game system and rules are given for Verbal Rummy, Verbalgrams, Crossword Solitaire, Verbal Chess, Tug of War, and others.&#10;From the ALPSCO Science Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A satirical science fiction card game created for the February Design contest; the game revolves around creating positive feedback loops formed out of individual cards, each of which must connect to the previous card. There are three 'suits' that the cards convert between, and three possible values. Players use pawns to perform various actions over the course of a turn, and can either work cooperatively by building card systems jointly or competitively by taking over systems. Thematically, players take the roles of members of the Society of Learned, Orderly, and Beneficent Beings, a society of aliens devoted to bringing about cosmic unity as they attempt to harmonize a planet with three species locked in warfare.&#10;&#10;",
