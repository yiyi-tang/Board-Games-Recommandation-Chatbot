    "Description": "Evil In The North is a solitaire adventure game that is set in a dark wintry realm. The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter-religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.&#10;&#10;Player guided characters will travel on a map that consists of card tiles. These tiles require various checks as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur. Opposition can also emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a character's vital resource --their followers. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.&#10;&#10;Combat in the world of Evil in the North is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants' INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. To win Evil in the North, a player must fulfill every mission started. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of a mission, regardless of how many missions have been completed. Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).&#10;&#10;ABOUT THE REIMPLEMENTATION:&#10;This game builds on Black Metal by offering a whole new map treatment. Rather than building the tile map as you play, Evil in the North uses a preset tile map that is arranged prior to play. The preset tile map constrains player movement to a 7 x 7 grid (removing the chances of a run-away tile map). Furthermore, additional map tiles have been added to create the vast Ice Sea; a central area of the tile map consisting of 9 map tiles. Additional rules have been created to serve this new aspect of the tile map.&#10;&#10;Unlike Black Metal, a regular game of Evil In The North is played with full map disclosure (all map tiles are displayed face-up from the onset).&#10;&#10;Other changes/additions include:&#10;--Updated text on many cards (mainly to accommodate the new tile map)&#10;--An updated and consolidated rulebook (integrating the Mission booklet)&#10;--New and updated rulebook diagrams&#10;--New rules and sections within the rulebook (including a new Q&amp;A and Card Clarifications section)&#10;--An official variant sheet for an advanced game&#10;&#10;",

The turns do not have a time limit so you have all the time to think about playing any card or simply advance and end your turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone reaches the end of the board or you are  the last player alive, since each player has a certain amount of life that varies depending on the character you choose at the beginning, if they kill you you lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;Una Historia basada en el Siglo XIV en medio de la Peste Negra que atacaba la Pobre Europa , con toques de Fantas&iacute;a del Propio Creador. Este incluye:Un juego de Mesa que mezcla un Tablero, Cartas , Dados con funciones diferentes, Selecci&oacute;n de Personajes , Vida y much&iacute;simo mas incluyendo un sistema basado en el puro Azar y el Riesgo por la Recompensa lo que hace que la &quot;Cripta de Plagcrow&quot; sea un Juego en donde el Jugador deber&aacute; pensar su siguiente movimiento y adaptarse a los Cambios Rotundos que puede dar el mismo juego independientemente de los dem&aacute;s jugadores. Tienes la Libertad de elegir entre una forma de jugar mas segura y defensiva, as&iacute; como todo lo contrario y ser un Rival que solo busca desatar el Caos! aunque le pueda costar la Victoria. Con 7 tipos de Cartas adem&aacute;s de ser m&aacute;s de 500 diferentes entre si y  extra&ntilde;as formas de jugar lo hace un juego ideal si estas agobiado de los juegos convencionales en donde el factor sorpresa se apaga al jugar unas cuantas partidas ya sea con las mismas personas o cambiando de jugadores , La Cripta brinda que nunca 2 partidas se parezcan entre si as&iacute; como esa seguridad de saber que nada asegura la Victoria ni la Derrota, Sera tu decisi&oacute;n de aguantar hasta el final o rendirte ante la situaci&oacute;n.&#10;&#10;",

Or will your theories be one of many forgotten attempts at unravelling this mystery?&#10;&#10;In slightly more detail, over the course of the game you place researchers to pick up evidence cards across the site of Machu Picchu, then commit evidence cards to support different interpretations of Machu Picchu's past to win publications and bonuses, while also trying to mitigate your disturbance of the site by returning artifacts to the land.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on a system favoring the fog of war and the uncertainties of military preparations, &quot;Talvisota 1939-1940: The Soviet-Finnish Winter War&quot; places both players in a situation requiring them to choose their strategies after careful reflection. Maintaining one&rsquo;s war morale is important, but the decisive results are mainly achieved by considering the potential actions of the other side. In the solitaire mode, the player controls the Soviet forces against a Finnish A.I. opponent.  System by Lionel Liron.&#10;&#10;Published in VaeVictis #158&#10;&#10;--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---&#10;&#10;In 1939, faced with Nazi Germany&rsquo;s expansionist politics, Stalin demands of Finland some strategic territories necessary for the defense of Leningrad. Helsinki refuses and on 30 November, with no prior Declaration of War, the Red Army attacks the Finnish territory with five armies and 28 divisions.&#10;&#10;The strength ratio is crushingly in the Soviets&rsquo; favor with 400,000 combatants, 1500 tanks and a modern aviation against 265,000 Finnish soldiers and 20 tanks. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the overwhelming numerical and material superiority of the Russians is broken by the fierce resistance and the bravery of the Finnish forces.&#10;&#10;Despite a front extending from the Arctic to the isthmus of Karelia, and the offensives of mostly 3 against 1, the lack of preparation and coordination of Stalin&rsquo;s forces, the extreme climatic conditions and the Finnish belligerence jostle all predictions and overturn military logic. Mannerheim&rsquo;s troops employ Molotov cocktails, surprise infiltrations and an optimal exploitation of the terrain to resist the Russian giant until March. But the lack of armament and international support, the limited numbers of troops, and a Soviet surge irreversibly compel the little Nordic outlier to sign an accord on 12 March 1940.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fraywick, the last great human city, is constantly under threat by the dangerous wild monsters of the world. But when Fraywick would fall, the Moxian Guard stands tall against the menace. Using the charismatic power of Moxie, the Moxian Guard command their own monsters to fend off threats from beyond the gates. You have discovered your own Moxie, and set off on a journey to rally your own band of monsters together. Tryouts for the Moxian Guard begin in eight weeks, do you have what it takes to make the cut?&#10;&#10;Moxie: A Journey of Monsters is played over a series of 8 rounds, culminating in a final tournament between the players. Each round has two phases, a scouting phase in which players search various decks of cards, called routes, for monsters to recruit to their team, and a battle phase where they will face off against another player, pitting their recruited monsters against one another for rewards.&#10;&#10;In the scouting phase, there are no turns. Instead, players act simultaneously, scouting routes they've reached. Players begin with just a handful of moxie tokens, which they'll spend to scout these routes. Players can search each deck they've reached one time each round, choosing only a single card from it to join their team, and so must choose how best to spend their moxie tokens to cover the most ground. By committing many moxie tokens to a route, players draw more cards from that route, giving them more options to choose from, but at the cost of less moxie to search other routes with. Once each player has spent all of their moxie tokens for the round, the game proceeds to the battle phase.&#10;&#10;In the battle phase, players pair off against each other to pit their team against the others. Each player prepares their team for battle by determining the order they'll send their monsters out, attempting to position each monster where it will best counter their opponents. Once players have committed their order, the battle begins, with players sending their monsters out one at a time to do battle until they run out of strength. Monsters strength is determined by that monsters particular strength dice, by comparing monsters types to see if one or the other can score a critical hit, and by utilizing the various effects of each monster to further alter the outcome. Once only one player has any monsters remaining, they win the battle that round.&#10;&#10;After each battle phase, players are rewarded based on their performance. Players who win their battle progress along the route tracker, opening up a new route for them to scout going forward in future rounds. Players who lose their battle, on the other hand, are rewarded additional moxie tokens to allow them to scout further into the routes they've already reached. In addition, defeated players may advance one of their monsters into a powerful new form, granting it new strengths and abilities.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this way until the end of the eighth round, where players will compete in a final tournament bracket to determine the games final victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a merchant of the silk road at the center of the world, your goal is to buy and sell specialty goods while moving from one bustling city to the next in order to become a wealthy merchant. In this game, players must create trade routes connecting two cities by lining up tiles containing images of roads on top of the board while using a rough map for hints. After creating trade routes, you must compare them with more precise maps. If there are specialty goods on the routes you create, you can collect points. However, there are certain goods which can deduct points as well, so you must be careful when constructing routes. In addition, you only have two minutes to create the routes. Within the limited time frame, think of the best possible routes and aim to trade well and efficiently.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. After first using the trade cards to decide the destination city and value of the local goods, the hourglass is then set, and trading begins. You then refer to your personal specialty goods map while you quickly place route tiles to connect cities together. The fastest merchants, and the merchants that have traveled the most routes will be award with bonuses. At the end, answer keys are placed on top, the goods obtained are confirmed, and points are received. After repeating this four times, the traders that have gotten the most points are the winner.&#10;&#10;",

(&quot;Long live the knights!&quot;) is a tower defense game with 2 levels of difficulty - one for children age 7-12 and the other, more advance version, for gamers age 12 and up.&#10;&#10;Each round has 6 phases that are repeated until the end of the game is triggered.&#10;Phase 1: Taking action card. Every player takes 6 action cards in the first round, in other rounds takes 3.&#10;Phase 2: Evil knights are coming. The number of evil knights depends on the number of players. In the first round number of evil knights is the same as the number of players + two extra more, in other rounds without two extra more.&#10;Phase 3: Playing action cards. Players use their cards to fight the evil knights. On their turn, players can play as many cards as they can. Players place their cards under evil knights, face down, and put a token in their color on top of it.&#10;Phase 4: Action card payment. Action cards are turned face up (tokens must remain on the cards) and players pay the sum of their face up cards. If they can't pay, all of their face up cards are discarded. If they pay more than necessary, they don't get any money back.&#10;Phase 5: Fighting knights. Evaluate every knight separately. If the sum of the action cards under a knight is greater than the power of the knight, a knight is defeated and the player gets a point. If the sum of the action cards is lower, knight survives (card is not discarded), action cards are discarded and tokens are returned to the player.&#10;Phase 6: Knights attacking. Every knight that survived is going to attack the castle. Every knight attack after another. A knight can destroy a castle card only if his crest color matches the color of the castle card. This card is then discarded.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds, if all the castle cards are destroyed, all players lose. If all the knight cards are used and the castle is still standing, you successfully defended the castle. All players are considered heroes, but only the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cross Bronx Expressway is the third game in the Irregular Conflicts Series. It simulates the socio-economic processes of urban development, and the human costs that result, as a competitive city-builder with collective loss conditions. Players control one of three asymmetric factions working in the South Bronx between 1940 and 2000, pursuing their own goals while cooperating to keep the borough viable. Through a card driven sequence of play, they will work to solve the economic challenges facing the area by building infrastructure and organizations, forming coalitions, mitigating the multitude of issues facing the vulnerable population, and managing resources to stay out of debt. Cross Bronx Expressway offers an engaging way to learn about the recent history of American cities, as exemplified by Jane Jacobs&rsquo; pivotal work The Death and Life of Great American Cities, simulated through the case study of the South Bronx. Players will experience the conflicting incentives and complex factors shaping urban life, and together determine the fate of the Bronx.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is driven by a deck of event cards which determines turn order, and then players spend resources to take actions on map spaces. The game ends after the event deck is exhausted, or earlier if certain conditions are met. Players score victory points at regular periods during the game, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins (unless an auto-loss condition for all players is met).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Oh and try to ignore those people across the way at Embryonic Inc, they are always bribing our employees trying to get our secrets, you aren't that type of person are you?&#10;&#10;Jurassico is a roll-and-write game heavily inspired by the process of reconstructing dinosaur DNA as seen in Jurassic Park. To do this, the players share a common pool of dice and take turns selecting pairs of dice to utilize, crossing off their sum from their scoring sheet (representing different dinosaur genomes, with six sets of genes needed to complete each), then re-roll the used pair for the next player.&#10;&#10;Much as in Jurassic Park, it is possible to take shortcuts by splicing your DNA with that of modern reptiles and amphibians, modifying dice values and/or colors, but the uses of this ability are limited only do this a limited number of times for each die. It is also (again inspired by the events of the book and the movie) possible to sell samples to a competitor (Embryonic, Inc) to earn additional points.&#10;&#10;The game continues until a player reaches five points based on the genomes they have completed and/or sold to the competition. There is also a solo mode where the player tries to reach a set points goal before Embryonic does.&#10;&#10;",

You are also in constant peril of getting lost in the Bermuda Triangle!&#10;&#10;Rumors and Legends is a light game that can be learned in 10-15 minutes and takes around 30-45 minutes on average to play. You'll find the mechanics comfortably familiar if you have played the usual suspects of mystery games before, but a host of new twists and turns to make the game feel unique, modern and thematically interesting.&#10;&#10;A player rolls the dice to determine their next move. Their move may involve moving their mini a specified number of spaces, drawing a Rumor card, moving the door minis, and/or moving to the Bermuda Triangle to end the turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player is first to solve the mystery of Professor Daffle's disappearance. There are three components: the Creature responsible, the Location of Daffle's disappearance, and the Incident that was involved.&#10;&#10;The player who is able to solve the three components of the mystery is the one who wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Right Cruel and Fell is a wargame for field battles in the Hundred Years War (1337-1453). &#10;It covers closely-related conflicts, such as the War of Breton Succession, the Castilian Civil War, or the Anglo-Scottish wars of the same time. &#10;The system is specific to time and place, although supplements expand the scope to include the War of the Roses, Italy (1300-1492) and the Teutonic Knights (1200-1410). &#10;The mechanisms particularly reflect these conflicts and the interaction of troops in them, with historical accuracy and even zeitgeist.&#10;&#10;A battlefield in RC&amp;F is divided into a grid of 3&rdquo; squares called acres, each of which represents approximately 70 yards in each direction. &#10;&ldquo;Troops&rdquo; of 400 infantry or 200 mounted men are the basic units; each troop on one base with a recommended size of 2&rdquo;x1&rdquo; although the gaming standard of 40mm frontages (or 60mm with 4&rdquo; acres) will work as well. &#10;There is likely no need to rebase miniatures. &#10;Each type of historical soldier and unit is accurately represented. &#10;The status-based attrition system (step loss) accounts for both physical and psychological deterioration. &#10;The game uses both six-sided and ten-sided dice, sometimes as singular rolls, sometimes in opposition to the enemy. &#10;RC&amp;F accounts for command and control, or lack thereof, as well as the character of leaders and their influence on troops&rsquo; behavior. &#10;The mechanics are straight forward, leaving players to concentrate on historical tactics, rather than worry more about rules. &#10;A large number of orders of battle and battlefield maps is included.&#10;&#10;RC&amp;F players should be ready for a challenge that accurately simulates battles in the Hundred Years War in a playable and enjoyable game. &#10;The author is a professional historian with decades of wargaming experience, who has extensively playtested these rules with both experienced and novice players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stingbad is a set of Fantasy wargame rules developed as part of a new series covering different periods.&#10;They were developed from the pedigree of our popular Sacre Bleu massed skirmish rules, using a variable sequence of play which means even underdogs stand a chance of winning.&#10;&#10;The rules stand alone, no other sets in the series are required, but all those in the Streamlined Play Rules Series share a core set of rules, so if you learn one picking up another one of the rules in the series is easy. Each set is, of course, heavily tweaked for the period they cover and are streamlined for fast play. We want our games to be straightforward, so we can concentrate on trying to defeat our tabletop enemy insted of spending our time 'fighting' the rules to get them to work! That is central to the design philosophy of these wargame rules.&#10;&#10;In the case of Stingbad, included are three ways of choosing armies, and the features include amongst other things flexible unit sizes, different types of battle, weather rules, commander ratings, fluke hits, heroes and speeches, collapsing buildings, smoke and - as you'd expect - magic rules.

    "Description": "Hungry Life is an environmental education and awareness card game played between 2-5 players and for the whole family, schools and holidays.&#10;&#10;It comes in two versions: A Europe continent (English, French, German) and a North America continent (English) featuring species unique to that continent.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with their own deck of 20 cards plus five in their hand (player count dependant). You start by placing a primary producer/Base Card to create a new habitat. Each animal card will list what it can eat leading up to an apex predator. Each new habitat is connected as the game goes on, but with human projects such as roads and housing estates these habitats can become disconnected. Animals that could once be moved are now trapped. You must strategically place your animals, human projects and natural events to thwart your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics have been designed to practically demonstrate how humans are causing issues but also how we can help in a simple and family friendly game lasting 25 - 45min.&#10;&#10;Each animal card will also feature data about that animal so you can learn things like their weight, population size/trend as well as where they fall on the endangered species list.&#10;In the rules you'll also find a list of organisations that are working hard to protect our natural world.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all their cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pottery is as old as humanity, and many culture have left their mark on it. However, Persian pottery is known as the epitome of art, creativity, and practicality coming together. Along the history many people have tried their hands at pottery. But it takes a master potter to create a timeless vessel, and there can&rsquo;t be more than one master potter in each generation. And now the time has come to choose the master potter of your generation.&#10;&#10;The Master Potter is a competitive worker placement game, in which 2 to 5 players take on the role of pottery masters. Players must send their apprentices to different spaces across the board to collect the essential materials and form and decorate different pottery utensils which are among the available requests. Creating a pottery utensil will grant points to its creator, and the player that reaches 20 points first, will be the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in consecutive rounds. Each player has 4 meeples, representing their apprentices. Each round begins Each round begins by players putting all their meeples on the board to collect resources, one at a time, until they are all placed. At that point all players collect their meeples, the first player marker is passed to next player in clockwise order, and the resource spaces are refilled and prepared for a new round.&#10;&#10;Each requested pottery consists of a basic shape and two sets of ingredients, each of which may include different number of colors and patterns or even additional clay blocks for ornamentation. Clay blocks can be collected from different parts of the riverbank, colors and minerals are up for grabs at the market, and artists can be hired to add different ornamentation to the pottery. However, remember that if you go to a space before others, you will get a better choice and a lower price.&#10;&#10;What will your pottery collection look like when this fierce competition is over?&#10;&#10;",

Doctors rush to see the patient with morbid curiosity on the otherwise dull night...&#10;&#10;Prognosis Death is a set-collection card game where each player is a doctor who is trying to take the credit for curing a patient. You&rsquo;ll collect symptoms and use them to construct a diagnosis. You&rsquo;ll challenge and outwit your rivals, and you&rsquo;ll get the recognition you deserve &ndash; at any cost!&#10;&#10;Your objective in Prognosis Death is to either have the lowest score remaining in your hand when the patient is discharged, or the highest score in the case that the patient succumbs to their illness and perishes.&#10;&#10;At the start of every turn in Prognosis Death you&rsquo;ll add symptoms to your hand by either drawing an unknown card from the deck, or by taking a card from the public discard area. At the end of every turn, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to remove symptoms from your hand either by making a diagnosis, which consists of a set of matching symptoms, or by discarding a card to the public discard area.&#10;&#10;Every symptom card has an effect that will either trigger when that card is discarded, or when you make a diagnosis with that card as the top-most card. Symptoms also have effects that will trigger when they are retrieved from the public discard area. Whether these effects help or hinder you will depend on the card!&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game cards in each player&rsquo;s hand will become revealed and will become accessible to players who can see them. For the most part you can use accessible cards in any player&rsquo;s hand as though they were in your hand, but beware, cards that you have revealed become inaccessible to you - if it is still in your hand at the end of the game it will count towards your score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
