    "Description": "In the year 1938 the Third Reich undertook an expedition to Antarctica. The explored territory was called Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) named after the expedition vessel, Schwabenland.&#10;Unnoticed from the rest of the world a secret base was built: The Base 211 and the Reich began to developed progressive weapon systems.&#10;One day, troops on reconnaissance missions disappeared and there were sightings of strange 2m tall worm-like beasts and house-high creatures. &#10;Due to the potential threat, the high command of Neuschwabenland caused a general mobilization to deal with the menace and to gather more informations about the strange creatures...&#10;&#10;Neuschwabenland is a tactical hex and counter combat game for 2 players simulating the hypothetical struggle between forces of the Third Reich and the forces of Alien life forms, in an Arctic setting. The game is also highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;The Reich has advanced equipment and special units at disposal, such as the UFO-like flying machine Haunebu.&#10;However, due to the harsh weather conditions they are limited when it comes to unit activation.&#10;&#10;Aliens on the other side fight their enemies by sheer force of numbers and can activate all units.&#10;While they lack the firepower of the Reich (with one exception, the Tripod: A monstrous killing machine), they are very dangerous in close combat.&#10;&#10;The combat system is inspired by the game Space Crusade.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a map (ca. 10 x 18 inch) depicting a part of the Antarctic region, Neuschwabenland, a sheet with 88 (5/8 inch) counters and 6 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The Great Wall is a card game where each player receives 'composition' cards. These depict a certain scene that can be formed with &lsquo;wall&rsquo; cards. In each turn, the active player will be able to add a wall card to the existing wall and play an &lsquo;action&rsquo; card to alter the wall. If an addition to or alteration of the wall results in a composition equal to what a player (doesn&rsquo;t have to be the active player) has in their own composition cards, or one of the three communal composition cards, that player can yell CLICK to take the picture and complete their composition card. They thereby win points, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lincoln&rsquo;s War reflects the fickle nature of politics and its influence on military policy-making during the American Civil War. Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.&#10;&#10;Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:&#10;    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map&#10;    1 color rulebook&#10;    1 color play and background booklet&#10;    162 Operations Cards&#10;    2 countersheets&#10;    2 player aid cards&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.&#10;&#10;(source: MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Patrol: Man-to-Man Combat in the 20th Century, is an individual man level simulation of non-urban infantry combat from World War 1 to the present.  The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.&#10;&#10;Sequel to the game Sniper! Popular tactical combat system.&#10;&#10;As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly &quot;buy&quot; actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...&#10;After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all &quot;tactical&quot; game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:&#10;in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.&#10;review by: Francois Charton&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes&#10;Hex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters&#10;Units: Individual Soldiers &amp; Vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Six 9 x 9&quot; four color maps&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Patrol rulebook&#10;Foure Player Aids Cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-6 hours&#10;&#10;",

To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.&#10;&#10;",

However, players can alter the line by paying bribes. In this way, players can win tricks unexpectedly.&#10;&#10;",

Units are regiments of 15 to 30 figures divided into 5 bases, with players commanding a division or corps.&#10;&#10;The first edition was published by Adventure Games in 1983. GDW released a 2nd edition with minor changes in 1988, with a scenario book &quot;To the Sound of the Guns&quot; the same year. Johnny Reb III: Regimental Grand Tactical American Civil War Miniatures Rules, published by John Hill in 1996 is a very different game, with major changes to the scale (1&quot;:50 vs 1&quot;:40 yards, 1:30 vs 1:20 men, artillery batteries vs sections) and games mechanisms.&#10;&#10;",

In the main game mode, players select one deck, then draft a complementary team of creatures, items, and spells before doing battle in the arena.&#10;&#10;Each creature you summon has unique abilities based on the twenty Aztec Daysigns, e.g., Eagle allows your creatures to fly one lane over to attack, Jaguar allows shifting one lane before attacking, and Snake allows eating defeated Nawals to absorb their powers.&#10;&#10;Nawals can be combined together to create a hybrid creature with more health, power, and both sets of abilities. Shapeshifting a Nawal restores its life completely, so finish off your opponent's wounded creatures to avoid giving them a powerful play.&#10;&#10;",

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.&#10;&#10;The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.&#10;&#10;The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.&#10;Counters = 200&#10;&#10;Other credits:&#10;&#10;Graphic Design: Redmond A.

    "Description": "Long ago, when humans were still primitive, gods ruled the world. Submissive people served their idols, who sought to gain more and more power through the blind faith of their followers. However, the arrogance of the gods and their incessant confrontations led to their decline and almost extinction. The last survivors hid in oblivion waiting to return, more powerful than ever.&#10;&#10;In the years that followed, humanity was thirsty for knowledge and understanding. This triggered the awakening of the gods who demanded eternal faith and obedience in order to regain their power. Soon, epic battles between gods spread throughout the world and humanity descended into chaos.&#10;&#10;The Dark Ages returned more tyrannical than ever. The gods, along with their followers, are fighting to be the only ones to rule. Who will be the last god to control humanity? Will this god bring light, love, war, fear or eternal darkness?&#10;&#10;The fate of the world is in your hands!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Altar: Realms of the gods is a card game for 2 to 5 players. During the game you fight against enemy gods and try to protect your Realm. Your goal is to build Shrines and discover the hidden Altars in your god's Realm in order to activate them and make your god the most powerful of all and win the game!&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a god and takes their board which represents their Realm. On their turn a player must first draw a card and then perform 1 main action:&#10;&#10;Use the Ability of a card (e.g. Activate an Altar, draw additional cards, destroy enemy Altars etc.), Perform a Ritual to build a Shrine and place it on their god&rsquo;s Realm or Worship a god. When worshipping a follower is placed face-up next to their god&rsquo;s realm to show where they activate their abilities and protect against the enemy gods. In addition to the main action, a player may take any number of free actions.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player builds at least one Shrine and discovers and activates all the Altars on their god's Realm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Black wins if 3 non-adjacent sides are connected, white if 2 opposite sides are. Thus black's goal is harder; to compensate, black will begin with some pieces already on the board. Initially, players do not yet have assigned colors; they take turns each placing a black piece on an empty hex. Either player may instead pass to become black (when they feel black has enough pieces on the board); the other player becomes white and places a white piece, and they continue alternating turns placing their own color. Black wins by forming a Y (connecting 3 non-adjacent sides) but loses by connecting 2 opposite sides without a Y. Likewise white wins by connecting 2 opposite sides but loses by forming a Y without connecting 2 opposite sides.&#10;&#10;",

It pits the Emperor Napoleon's Grande Armee against the Army of Imperial Russia under General Count von Bennigsen. This winter battle was one of the bloodiest battles of the Napoleonic era. The full campaign game covers the entire two day period of this epic struggle. The game also includes smaller scenarios covering Napoleon's approach to Eylau on the afternoon of the 7th, the bloody battle of the 8th on the high ground beyond Eylau, Davout's III Corps attack against the Russian left flank, and the Prussian late day counter attack.&#10;&#10;The game system uses an asymmetric sequence of play and alternating fire combat. The basic combat units are Infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. All command units, from brigade leaders to army commanders, are represented by individual counters. At 15 minute per turn and 116 yards a hex the game system allows players to make both grand tactical decisions and apply tactical techniques used by the armies of the Napoleonic period.&#10;&#10;Infantry battalions are represented by being in either column formation on the front side of the counter and line formation on the reverse side. Additionally, infantry battalions may use strength points to deploy as skirmish companies represented by separate counters. Artillery units are battery or half battery sized units with separate artillery gun crews designated for each battery. Cavalry units are depicted in cavalry formation on their front sides and may suffer exhausted after a charge, flipping to their back side.&#10;&#10;Cavalry SP are not squadrons. The strength of some cav units may coincidentally match their number of squadrons, but most do no not.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operations Olympic &amp; Coronet is an update of the Olympic solitaire game first published in  S&amp;T along with a second complete game covering the planned follow-up invasion: Operation Coronet.&#10;&#10;The Olympic map has been updated to reflect better understanding of the tough and, in places, impassable terrain as well as the potential landing sites. &#10;The Coronet map shows the flat, wide-open Tokyo plain. &#10;The counters have also been updated with new information about the Japanese order of battle, especially their plan to move 36th Army to Kyushu as a counter-invasion force. With that, the Americans face a force intent on breaking through to the beach.&#10;&#10;Also added are: naval gunfire, atomic bombs, and even the Soviets (from a MOVES variant). The Japanese doctrine and supply rules have been updated to better reflect their historic plan for an initial counterattack. The kamikaze rules are also updated with further research into their probable effects.&#10;&#10;This Special Edition package includes two full-sized (22x34&quot;) maps of the two invasion areas and 560 counters. Both games can be played solitaire or two-player.&#10;&#10;(from S&amp;T press website)&#10;&#10;",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals.

Players use a simple online interface to view each gift and then to input their answer. A correct answer will take the players to another floor, while an incorrect answer won't budge the elevator.&#10;&#10;Mr. Hincks is waiting on the top floor, ready to inscribe your name on his leaderboard.

But each patrol, each convoy mission, each amphibious landing you make to pursue victory risks full-scale battle with the AI squadron &ndash; a battle that could leave you triumphant or shattered in a matter of hours. A dynamic card-driven AI opponent assigns enemy missions, refits and launches new ships, and plots raids on your supply routes and coastlines.&#10;&#10;Your objective: Control Lake Ontario by the end of the summer campaign, without losing your own squadron. The AI squadron's strategic objectives and battle tactics react dynamically to your moves.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Make decisions about ship missions and assignment zones. Scout and shadow enemy forces to identify them. Intercept detected enemy forces. Make amphibious assaults. Attack and defend supply convoys.&#10;&#10;What's special about this game:&#10;&#10;1. The only operational age-of-sail game that&rsquo;s below monster size, playable in approximately four hours, and requires no specialized knowledge of ship-handling or period tactics.&#10;&#10;2. This campaign has never before been the specific focus of a wargame. (To the extent that it appears at all in wargames, it&rsquo;s either been part of a full-war strategic game, or a small scenario within tactical naval games that cover the general Napoleonic period.)&#10;&#10;",

You will claim trade routes over the course of play, each specifying systems you may want to bring into your network. The better you can fulfill these trade routes, the more lucrative the deal is and the more credits you will gain. Connecting planets to your network will require resources, which, of course, you &quot;acquire&quot; from the planets where you already have agents.&#10;&#10;During play, you'll get to perform one core action each turn, which is then used up until you take a Deploy turn to reclaim all your spent action markers. The actions start out simple, but by gaining techs you can upgrade them. Cleverly upgrading some of your actions and leaning on them more heavily is crucial to success. By using your techs well, and excuting special bonus actions you can access by infiltrating trade guilds with your agents, you can outmaneuver your opponents and wind up with an enviable pile of Galactic Credits.&#10;&#10;",

The goals of the two included games are straightforward enough -- connect opposite sides of the board, or control the four center squares.  However, the pieces are something of a mystery.  Most will be blank side up at first, and it is only as they are overturned that you discover whether each moves one square at a time or an unlimited number (like a queen in Chess.)  In addition, there are certain special moves that can dramatically alter gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mangaka: The Fast &amp; Furious Game of Drawing Comics is a creative fast-paced card game in which players draw comic stories over four rounds combining Themes &amp; an ever-growing number of Trends.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing three Theme Cards (such as &quot;Kaiju/Giant Monsters&quot;, &quot;Robots and Androids,&quot; or &quot;Desire to be a Parent&quot;) to determine the subject matter of their comic. (These three Themes stick with the player throughout the game. Many but not all of the Themes have a manga/anime/Japanese flavor.) Then each player chooses a title and &quot;pen name.&quot;&#10;&#10;After players have had a few minutes to brainstorm, the five-minute timer is activated and core gameplay begins. Players have five minutes to draw their comics (on pre-printed Comic Pages) and express their Themes. When time is up, each player takes a turn reading their comic to the group (or, in the suggested 'professional mode,' the other players read the player's manga amongst themselves without the artist being allowed to give explanation). Based on the other players' judgement, each player earns 2 Fame Tokens for following each of the three core rules: (1) express your Themes (2) use 3 or fewer Word Balloons and (3) draw something recognizable in every Panel.&#10;&#10;Beginning with round 2, Trend Cards appear, putting more Fame in play. Trend cards (examples: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Shojo Manga, Sports, Destruction, Subtlety, etc.) provide new victory conditions in the form of instructions and a corresponding reward of Fame Tokens. Some Trend rewards can be claimed by every player simultaneously, others can only be claimed by one or two winners (such as &quot;Eager Audience,&quot; which rewards Fame to the first player to finish drawing before time runs out).&#10;&#10;In addition, each round after the 1st, the Comic Pages become denser, requiring the players to draw more Panels in the same amount of time. Round 1 is 2 Panels; round 2 is 4 Panels; round 3 is 6 Panels; round 4 is 8 Panels. The number of Trends also goes up from round to round. Round 2 has 1 Trend; round 3 has 2 Trends; round 4 has 4 Trends.&#10;&#10;When round 4 ends, the winner (the most successful comic artist) is the one with the most Fame.&#10;&#10;",

Mission Control will have a list of objectives to complete, and may only be able to communicate to the Cadet by use of command cards providing simple instructions to move East, West, North, or South, or to Collect or Drop objects. Each round a card will tell Mission control how many of these cards to give to the Cadet, but they are randomized before they are turned over. Work co-operatively, but without speaking, to figure out the solution within the allotted number of rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On March 1, 1815, The exiled Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte landed a small escort on French soil at Cannes, having escaped from the island of Elba. For the next 100 odd days, he would once again terrorize Europe at the command of the feared imperial French legions. Surrounded on all sides by armies of the great European powers, Napoleon's plan was to march north to Brussels, separate the Prussian and Anglo-Allied armies from each other, and defeat each in detail. Destruction of the armies would probably mean peace for France and the saving of the Emperor's Crown. Failure was unthinkable.&#10;&#10;HUNDRED DAYS BATTLES is Avalon Hill's strategy game for two or three players which recreates the climax of the Hundred Days Campaign. The division sized units of both sides are represented on the map by leaders who command their corps and army formations. Leaders march, force march, and influence combat according to their individual abilities. Combat is resolved by rolling a die on the Combat Results Table. To win, the French must exit units off the map towards Brussels, or destroy the Allied armies. The Allies win by preventing French victory.&#10;&#10;HUNDRED DAYS BATTLES comes complete with a colorful map of the historic battle areas of southern Belgium, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity Rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest); 4&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.&#10;&#10;A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.&#10;&#10;Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.&#10;&#10;In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.&#10;&#10;The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.&#10;&#10;",

They capture by moving simultaneously in a straight line any number of empty cells and landing on the trapped piece thus forming a stack of pieces. Stacks cannot grow larger than 3 pieces.&#10;A game of Attangle is won by the player who gains the third triple stack.&#10;&#10;These (now preferred) rules were slightly reworked by the author in 2008.

Can you combine these letters and repair those words?&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#231;&#141;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#185; (Dai Kaiju Kotobamodos) in English means &quot;The Great Monster Kotobamodos&quot;, with the name &quot;Kotobamados&quot; coming from &#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137; (kotoba) &quot;words&quot; and &#230;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153; (modosu) &quot;revert/undo&quot;, so the names means something like &quot;return the words to their original state&quot;, which is a monstrous task.&#10;&#10;This is a word game in which the master creates three words of three letters each behind a screen, then scrambles the letters face down and passes them to the other players. All players race to combine these letters to create the three words, and once someone does, they start a one-minute countdown timer. The first player to create three words scores 3 points, while anyone else who does so with the time limit scores 1 point. For each word that matches the master's word, a player scores 1 point.&#10;&#10;In English, the task of creating words would be relatively simple, but in Japanese, this is a much harder prospect. Japanese uses three writing systems, with Hiragana being the most broad. Hiragana has a lot more letters than the English alphabet, and fewer restrictions in combinations, so three characters can be used in a lot of ways.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a further element in Hiragana: &#230;&#191;&#129;&#231;&#130;&#185; (dakuten), which is a voiced sound mark similar to accents or umlauts. For example, &#227;&#129;&#159; (ta) combined with a Dakuten would be &#227;&#129;&#160; (da), or &#227;&#129;&#153; (su) and a Dakuten would be &#227;&#129;&#154; (zu). In this game, the letter tile for &#227;&#129;&#159; may be used for either &#227;&#129;&#159; or &#227;&#129;&#160;. From around fifty Hiragana letters, twenty of them can be combined with Dakuten. If the tiles offered to solve have several of these twenty Hiragana characters, it becomes very hard to deduce what the secret words actually are. Whilst the game could be played using English lettering, it would lose a lot of the complexity.&#10;&#10;In 2017, a new English/Japanese edition of this game was produced with the new name &#227;&#129;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188; (Ponkotsu Factory). &quot;Ponkotsu&quot; means something like silly or clumsy. This edition was co-produced with itten, with new artwork by Yoshiaki Tomioka. In this edition of the game, changes were made to allow for the differences between English and Japanese writing. When playing in English, the master constructs three four-letter words using twelve letter tiles, then mixes them thoroughly. The change to longer words should approximate the challenge of playing in Japanese with only three characters.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#131;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#229;&#183;&#165;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#174;&#181;&#233;&#154;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;4&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;12&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#143;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;12&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;4&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#179;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&quot;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#230;&#150;&#13

    "Description": "As legendary warlords meeting in the fabled arena of Ortus to decide who is superior, both players command a band of handpicked warriors, all schooled in one of the prime elements. The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.&#10;&#10;Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the &quot;Haven&quot;) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.&#10;     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.&#10;     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.&#10;     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.&#10;&#10;Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options. The excitement of the game lies in the careful planning of your attacks, knowing when to advance and when to withhold Energy as well as knowing whether to save or sacrifice your warriors.&#10;&#10;",

With a little cunning and the bat of a cat paw, you will push plates out of the grid to collect them. But beware of broken plates, you might attract the attention of those clueless humans.&#10;&#10;Collect sets or runs of a variety of foods to score points. It is the number on the plates in the group that scores and not the rank on any given dish. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;re just here for the food!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s always mealtime for these mischievous kittens! In this light strategy game, act as your favorite feline and snatch as much food as you can by pushing plates off the edge of the table. Food on the floor boosts your score! The cat with the most plate sets and sequences gets the delicious win.&#10;&#10;How will your hunger add up?

This high energy fur ball can take down a pawful of Christmas tree ornaments in a single swipe. And be sure to guard your dinner plate, because if it&rsquo;s fish night, Snowball will jump, drag and devour the salmon before you can say &ldquo;Bad Kitty!&rdquo; Will his youthful exuberance ever let up? Only time will tell for this fiendish feline!&#10;&#10;Fluffbucket &#10;Underneath all that fur is a well-muscled kitty ready to pounce. His favorite pastimes include batting at the window shades, chasing birds in the backyard, and hiding under furniture where he can easily attack an unsuspecting person&rsquo;s legs. One of his favorite foods is ice cream, but he is a bit of a snob and will only eat from a spoon.&#10; Cleo &#10;The cat of many colors! Nothing gets this gal going like the drip from a water faucet. She loves to squeeze her ample body into the sink, waiting as the anticipation builds. Then all of a sudden&hellip;drip! Cleo will try to catch the drip, eat the drip and stick her head into the faucet looking for the source of that crazy drop of water.&#10; Rusty &#10;Rusty is a handsome tabby with a knack for causing mischief. While he has all the cat toys his heart desires, his favorite toys are the ones from the trash can. This curious little kitty can&rsquo;t help but get himself into trouble. He&rsquo;s fallen out of every window in the house, been accidently locked in many a closet, and stolen countless snacks from his humans. Despite all his flaws, he&rsquo;s still a sweet little guy who&rsquo;s favorite thing is to cuddle with his best friend.&#10;&#10;Lola &#10;Lola is a giant beast with a magnificent mane and enormous paws, but looks can be deceiving. Unaware of her regal appearance, she squeaks and leaps into your arms at the slightest frightening noise. Lola loves people, and refuses to eat her kibble until she&rsquo;s been given an approving pet. She is happy to plop down on top of whatever her humans are doing, just to make sure she is always the center of attention.&#10;&#10;Flapjack &#10;Just about the time his humans are crawling into bed, Flapjack begins his evening prowl. Not content to walk along the floor, prowls begin with a leap from the couch to the fireplace mantle from there it is a small hop to the top of the flat screen TV, that he crosses with more grace than a tightrope walker. It is not until he is perched in the small gap above the kitchen cabinets that he assesses what to attack. Usually it is balled up socks, but he has been known to grab oranges and potatoes. Whatever his evening trophy is, he promptly tucks into bed with his humans.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Bohnanza, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Excalibohn plays much like Bohnanza except that most types of bean now have a special &quot;magic power&quot; associated with them. Each player starts the game with one magic card and can earn more. After planting one or two cards at the start of your turn, you now have a magic phase during which you can use potions and other special powers.&#10;&#10;",

Then during each turn, a player can perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;1. Add a die to the dice formation touching a friendly die - the newly added die cannot touch any of the opponents' dice.&#10;2. Move a die around the perimeter of the existing formation - the die's value determines the number of steps, and may reverse direction while moving.&#10;3. Merge two friendly dice, provided the player has at least 3 dice in the structure - add the value of adjacent dice, and replace one of the dice indicating the total.&#10;&#10;It is further required that the dice formation stays connected at all times.&#10;&#10;When a player merges two dice that add up to a value larger than 6, they win.&#10;Alternatively, if a player can't perform any action, they lose.&#10;&#10;",

One side marshals the forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham led by the Black Knight.  He leads Knights, Normans, Pike men and archers.  The other side is Robin Hood and his band of merry men.  Each side has strengths and weakness.  These forces contest each other in a power struggle to gain the most gold to support their causes.&#10;&#10;And gold can be gained or lost in many ways.&#10;&#10;The game includes a unique blend of medieval military forces with Knights, pike men, archers and leaders engaged in movement and combat, while it has a role playing element depicted  by the characters such as Robin Hood, the Sheriff, Marian, etc.  The characters can do medieval movement and combat and much more.

The game is played in five phases: Scavenge, Build, Fight, Heal, and Clean-up. In the Scavenge phase, you send survivors into the Badlands to roll dice in a real-time race for resources. In the Build phase, you take turns spending those resources to buy weapon, defense, and special development cards that enhance your compound. When threats attack, you roll dice and use abilities from cards you purchased to survive. You'll fight a Level 1 threat, followed by a Level 2 threat, then finally face down the Raider Boss.&#10;&#10;After the final attack, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins. Victory points can be scored from development cards, survivors, specialists, defeated threats, and special bonus tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins the game as one of a multitude of characters with a ch&acirc;teau that is rather, well....plain and empty. How will you ever attract visitors to your ch&acirc;teau and build your reputation if there are no fountains to admire, no paths to wander, and, most importantly, no flowers!&#10;&#10;Each round you will send your artisans to different parts of Paris to acquire floral beauties, hire additional help, earn coins, commission new garden features for your ch&acirc;teau, and do many other things that artisans generally do. But be quick! Resources each round are limited, and the first artisan to each location gets their pick of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. Each round ends with a garden party, where visitors from across the globe come to shower you with prestige and opportunity. Be wary of your neighbors, though! If their ch&acirc;teau is more attractive than yours, some visitors may be more enticed to attend your neighbor&rsquo;s garden party than yours. Sacrebleu! As word of the beauty of your competing ch&acirc;teaus spreads, more and more visitors will flock to your gardens. When one player gains enough Prestige, all players add their bonuses from their objectives and garden features, and the player with the most Prestige is declared the Host of the Grande Soir&eacute;e!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every character has a distinct development tree you can use to advance. Build and execute your unique combo, such as teleporting into any space on the map, gathering lament, gaining extra dice, and firing up a devastating attack on the boss. Sometimes a special electricity die will help you power up your armor, while at other times, you will forge magical bullets to be fired at the right moment.&#10;&#10;Who and where are you fighting? Each game you choose from multiple arenas, bosses, elites, and possible adventures. Every game is different and exciting. Instead of following a scripted campaign, dive right into a boss battle for an intense 2-3 hour gameplay session. Every boss offers a unique gameplay challenge, and bringing them down will be tactically demanding. You must work together and take full advantage of the arena and its resources to achieve your goal.&#10;&#10;During combat, strategically use dice allocation to move around the board, fire up different combos, and gather lament to grow in strength. Build your character in roguelike fashion and try to claim the ultimate prize. Collect too much lament, however, and you may turn into one of the beasts you were sent to hunt, with your fellow hunters unable to help you in time!&#10;&#10;",

The system rules are an evolution of the SPI classics Panzergruppe Guderian, Army Group South, and Cobra. Unit integrity bonuses include Soviet Corps and vary to show the increasing Soviet cohesion and decreasing German cohesion as the war progresses. HQ units provide higher level combat support and supply advantages to corresponding units in range. BITEs also incorporates standardized scales (unit size, distance, time) for easy comparisons.&#10;While the series rules allow players to play many games with the same core rules, the scenario rules add unique situational elements of each battle. Each volume includes two battles from one year with two copies of the charts and tables as well as scenario rules and set-up cards for easy reference.&#10;&#10;Bagration Stopped&#10;Warsaw, 1944: Operation Bagration had all but destroyed Army Group Center. Frantically the German army attempted to patch together a new defensive line. Armor reserves were rushed to the sector from as far away as Italy to hold the Vistula River line and Warsaw. At the same time 2nd Tank Army, working with 1st Belorussian Front, attempted to strike North, isolate Warsaw, and race for the Baltic to cut off all German forces in the North. The Soviets were unaware a new strike force was being assembled to prevent this, IV SS Panzer Corps. All is set for a classic armor thrust and counter thrust on the Vistula plain.&#10;The game runs from 27th July 1944&ndash;20th August 1944&mdash;ten game turns.&#10;&#10;Sandomierz Offensive&#10;Vistula Bridgehead, 1944: Army Group North Ukraine had been driven backwards in the Soviet Summer offensive. More concerning was that the army group&rsquo;s front had a huge hole between 1st Panzer and 4th Panzer armies. The Red Army moved to exploit this and cross the Vistula River. This was the last major obstacle to capturing Southern Poland. The Wehrmacht fought to delay the Soviet advance while drawing mechanized reserves from across the Eastern front to launch a counterattack. This would include the first use of King Tigers in action.&#10;The game runs from 28th July 1944&ndash;20th August 1944&mdash;ten game turns.&#10;&#10;Game Contents&#10;&bull;&ensp;One double-sided 22&times;34 inch game board&#10;&bull;&ensp;440 die-cut 5/8-inch counters&#10;&bull;&ensp;16-page system rules booklet&#10;&bull;&ensp;System charts card (2 sets)&#10;&bull;&ensp;Scenario rules/setup cards (2 sets of 2)&#10;&bull;&ensp;Scenario display card&#10;&bull;&ensp;1 six-sided die&#10;&bull;&ensp;Storage bags&#10;&#10;Battles in the East Series&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 2&ndash;4 hours&#10;Map Scale: 3&ndash;5 miles per hex (5&ndash;8 km)&#10;Counter Scale: Regiment&ndash;Division&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire: High&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
