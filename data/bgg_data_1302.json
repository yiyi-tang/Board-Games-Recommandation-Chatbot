Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system&mdash;the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again&mdash;so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for the different game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game Expansion: Thanos is an expansion for any standalone title in the Funkoverse line-up.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game Expansion: Marvel 101 Thanos Expansion is an expansion for any standalone title in the Funkoverse line-up.&#10;&#10;",

An electronics store was giving away a free Nintendo Switch, but didn't use a sensible method of picking the winning number. As a result, two customers had the numbers either side of the winning number. The game designer used this event as the inspiration for this deduction game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a suit of 1-13 cards from a normal deck of playing cards. One player is the retailer, the other players are the customers in the lottery. The retailer shuffles the 13 cards and removes one in secret, which nobody sees.&#10;&#10;Then the retailer divides the 12 remaining cards into two piles and sorts them each from low to high numbers, placing them face-down. The players take turns to draw the top card from a pile and after getting three hand cards, a player make declare the hidden card. If they are correct, they win.&#10;&#10;If the cards run out and no player has guessed correctly, the retailer can declare a number card that a player has (deducing in reverse). If the player does hold that card in their hand, the retailer wins.&#10;&#10;As with other games from Loserdogs, this was produced in a simple ziplock baggie with only a page of rules and 13 playing cards.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War Stories is a series of smaller expansions, much like Heroes of Normandie's Gazettes from before, but with a tighter focus on historical events and soldiers.&#10;&#10;Where Gazettes where products designed for die-hard fans, War Stories will be more accessible, requiring less of the massive backlog of previously released expansions. War Stories will mostly be playable with just the core box, and the content of a War Stories issue itself, obviously.&#10;&#10;Each issue will focus on a War Hero and will include a biography, his exploits, a dedicated scenario and one or two punchboards to integrate it into your game.&#10;&#10;The first issue will be for Heroes of Stalingrad, and focuses on Otto Carius, a German Tiger tank commander who destroyed a total of 150 enemy tanks. This issue will also include a section of T34s for the Russian forces as well as the errata of the Frontoviks from the Heroes of Stalingrad game base box.&#10;&#10;Featuring new artwork from Nicola Angius.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Forts &amp; Forests: The War for North America, you command one of the 18th century&rsquo;s great superpowers in a struggle to control Canada, the American colonies and the vast wealth of the continent beyond.&#10;&#10;But the French &amp; Indian War is only part of a greater global conflict, so resources are limited and must be allocated with care. Militia is easily raised but unreliable. Regular forces deliver power and strength under fire, but they are expensive and must be transported across an ocean. Then there are gifts to the Indians, whose speed and fierce ambushes can turn the tide of the war, but only if their pricey allegiance can be maintained.&#10;&#10;Forts &amp; Forests begins with the British poised to launch an ambitious four-pronged attack to bring the war to a speedy end. They have greater numbers, naval superiority and secure ports, but much of their army is made up of untested colonial provincial forces. The push inland from the Atlantic coast will be difficult, and the support of the powerful Iroquois is tepid at best.&#10;&#10;Though outnumbered, most French troops are battle hardened regulars recently arrived from Europe. They are supported by fearsome hordes of western tribes who have been convinced to take up the hatchet against the English invaders. New France also has a geographic advantage; troops and supplies can be moved quickly along the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes with relative ease. But the connection to France is tenuous, especially if the bastion at Louisbourg were to fall!&#10;&#10;Forts &amp; Forests&rsquo; unique combat system captures the challenges and uncertainties of the wilderness war. Over 300 historically accurate unit cards capture their differing combat, ambush, break, and speed ratings. No battle is a sure victory regardless of numerical superiority!&#10;&#10;It will take strategy, determination, and a bit of luck to conquer a land of Forts &amp; Forests and win the War for North America.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this environmental game, players try to prevent greenland from being covered with mud. In his turn, a player reveals a situation card that shows a positive or negative environmental behaviour. In the case of negative behaviour, the bad figure &quot;Schmutzich&quot; is moved towards a target field, in the case of positive behaviour, the good figure &quot;Knud&quot; may be moved towards the target field. In addition, the player rolls the dice and can move his own figure or &quot;Knud&quot; towards the target field. If &quot;Schmutzich&quot; reaches the target field first, mud is placed on grassland, if &quot;Knud&quot; and a player arrive before &quot;Schmutzich&quot;, a rainbow piece is placed. The players win together if they manage to lay 4 rainbow pieces. The players lose if &quot;Schmutzich&quot; was able to lay 4 mud pieces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Players are athletes competing in a road race across mountains and valleys. But the course has obstacles and the players push each other around or use items to get the jump on the others. The first to the finish line is the winner.&#10;&#10;The race course is made of large tiles placed in a line. The game has a starting tile, and five course tiles, of which four are used, and a finish line. The course tiles have a variety of icons; walls, pits, arrows and objects.&#10;&#10;Players choose the turn order, and the last player puts their athlete where they like on the start line, then the next player and so on. In this way, the start player does not get an advantage.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice and move their athlete. If they end up on an icon, or push another athlete onto one, the actions are completed.&#10;&#10;Pits make a player fall back 2 places and miss a turn. Walls delay players, and arrows push them in the direction of the arrow. The ? icon lets the player draw an object card from the deck. These objects allow the player to make advances, or delay other players, or even change the position of the course tiles.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the finish line wins the race.&#10;&#10;The designer Misaki notes that this was one of their earliest designs. It became the third game published by the doujin circle, but had been a car race game sent to a magazine five years previously. The prototype was made 15 years before 2009, making it 1994. The designer thought it was too good a game to waste and brought it back into production in 2009.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arithmetic game with a traditional card deck, from David Parlett, creator of Ninety-Nine.  From a hand of 5, players play a card at a time, either deducting from or dividing into the current sum. Totals start at 101 each hand and go down to as close to 0 as possible. The catch is: If card played divides into the sum without remainder then it may not be deducted but must divide. (For instance a 5 played to 20 must divide for 4 rather than deduct for 15, whereas a 3 must deduct since it can't divide into 20 evenly.)&#10;&#10;An Ace counts either 1 or 11. A Jack played repeats the same value as the previous card. A Queen reverses the digits of the current count. However, you may only play a Queen if reversing the digits reduces the count. A King divides by any desired number higher than 1 and lower than the current, provided that it leaves no remainder.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when one player plays their last card or is unable to play without going below zero.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game puts you behind the wheel of one of the most important tech companies in the last century. You will relive the stories of some of the most influential technology innovators in history that paved the way to what we are capable of today. People like Edwin H. Land, a scientist who invented a whole new paradigm in photography with Polaroid, or Nolan Bushnell who executed on the first ever video gaming ideas with Atari, that drove the world into an age of digital video games and personal computers. It will be like being inside an interactive documentary, where you play the founder first person.&#10;&#10;You start as a simple tech start-up and through multiple plays you and the story evolve into giving you the responsibility of turning your first product successes into a real tech company that people worship. A company that aims to take over the world with cutting edge inventions by visionary and quirky personalities.&#10;&#10;You will attract the best talent, develop prototypes and turn them into mind boggling customer experiences. You will need to compose a sweet spot of skills in product design and engineering, business, management, marketing, and people. Talent with certain know-how can help you create better quality products. But to make all that happen you need investors and business-savvy individuals who can open the doors you need to succeed in a competitive consumer space of other tech companies - your opponents who you meet over beers at conferences and in courtroom disputes over patent infringement.&#10;&#10;Through a new and profound way of pairing a board game with an app on your phone, the initial barrier of getting past a complex set of rules is replaced by a progressive approach that teaches you the game through a simple first start-up story. Then it grows more and more complex over the course of multiple play sessions towards transforming you into becoming a massive tech giant in the end.&#10;&#10;The app will also be used to communicate the narrative through audio storytelling, to communicate every mechanic&rsquo;s tie-in to the theme and context, to manage gaming sessions in this new narrative format, where you can save your progress between play sessions, and to be a rules learning or reminder companion, to get you quickly back into the game, if you have had a break from it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Rakugaki means graffiti, Kyokasho is a textbook for children. The second game Yosegaki Kyokasho means Write Jointly Textbook.&#10;&#10;The game is from Japan and is home-made. Packaged in a large pencil case, the components include large plastic sleeves with paper inside, wipeable marker pens, and a variety of small cut-outs of portraits and images of various kinds. These might be from famous Western artworks, such as the Mona Lisa or Venus, or famous people such as Beethoven or Napoleon, or animals or objects. Likewise there are popular Japanese characters such as writers, samurai or politicians (including Admiral Perry!), or figures from ukiyo-e scrolls.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to mimic writing graffiti in your school textbooks. Players put the cut-outs inside the wallets, backed with the white paper. They then use the markers to write their jokes and graffiti on the outside of the wallet, as if writing on the schoolbook. Then players compare their jokes and the funniest is given points. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;The designer says &quot;Let's draw a bikini on Sakamoto Ry&#197;&#141;ma!&quot; (famous samuari and democrat).&#10;&#10;The alternate game has players taking turns to choose a theme, such as 'alternate hairstyles', and players draw images to that theme in the same way. This is for players who are not used to making up rude jokes.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Billions of years ago&hellip;&#10;Mars was a flourishing planet teaming with life and vast seas. As the magnetic field over Mars weakened, radiation began to dry up the seas and solar winds caused the atmosphere to deplete. This in turn reduced the planet&rsquo;s ability to maintain heat. After centuries of research, Mars&rsquo; leading scientists have developed a way to slow the depletion of oxygen and the cooling of the planet; however, it&rsquo;s too little and far too late. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the planet becomes completely uninhabitable. In this harsh environment, the few remaining races of Mars dangle from their last thread of existence.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Each player will represent a leader of one of the remaining races of ancient Mars. They will struggle to maintain the morale of their populace, while helping to keep the planet survivable for as long as possible. Players will also need to maintain control of lands to provide food, water and other resources&mdash;a task which may require force. Players will take turns placing multi-use cards on action spaces. The action space chosen will determine which part of the player&rsquo;s card is activated (political, civil, or military). As the game progresses, players will expand their influence to gain more powerful actions, develop technologies to help combat the planet&rsquo;s condition, gather resources to help keep their populace happy, and train armies to maintain their lands and resources. Each race is equipped with a unique ability allowing for various approaches to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quadragon is a card-driven strategy game in which players build an army of dragons and dragon-riding wizards in order to steal their opponent's treasure and protect their own.&#10;&#10;Each card in Quadragon uses both sides of the card, and both sides are split in two, meaning that each card can be used in 4 different ways. One side contains a dragon and treasure, the other a wizard and spell. Dragons are used to attack your opponent's treasure and defend your own. Treasure is used to pay for wizards. Wizards can also steal treasure directly, or ride similarly-colored dragons for even more points. Spells can be cast by wizards to directly manipulate the battlefield, for example rotating or flipping cards, or scoring points. Each side of a card can only be used if the text is facing you, and all cards rotate after use. For example after attacking with a dragon it rotates to reveal its treasure, which makes it vulnerable to attack.&#10;&#10;It is always a thrill to chain together a sequence of spells to flip and rotate cards, culminating in a massive points-scoring attack. The first player to reach 50 points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The French, defending with seven H39 tanks and ten squads make this an action-packed, instant classic.&#10;&#10;RPT173 Opportunit&eacute; Fugace &ndash; MONTCORNET, France, 17 May 1940: The French 4 e Bataillon de Chasseurs Port&eacute;s and 2e Compagnie, 46e Bataillon de Chars de Combat, 4e Division Cuirass&eacute;e is attacking with seventeen squads, two D2(L) tanks and eight (yes 8) Char B1 bis tanks to the clear some buildings defended by eleven squads of the Pioneer Bataillon 37, Panzer Division 1 and knock out their three FlaK18 88mm guns. With ten tanks on a wide attack frontage, a battery of 88s, a flamethrower and DCs, there will be lots of movement and intense action in this medium sized, 6.5 turn scenario set on boards 11, 12b and 78. It is sure to become a classic.&#10;&#10;RPT174 Ejected From Eloi &ndash; MONT ST.

The deck balance is 0.&#10;&#10;The basic game (&quot;Draw&quot; or &quot;Dr[4]w&quot;) rules:&#10;Each card (quad) has 4 pieces (qarts) in one colour (dark or light). These ones define the quad's cost in pts. Dark (purple) qarts have non-negative costs and vice-versa. Center purple qart gives 4 pts as all four hearts intersect each other here. Triangular qart so gives 2 pts and outer one (leaf) means 0. For example, The Good Sign (a quad with 4 purple qarts in shape of full heart) costs 8 pts in total. Players (2 by default) pick 4 quads in a turn. The summary quads' cost in each hand multiplies by 10 (multiplier from 4 to 40). Other number quads to pick is possible (with an appropriate multiplier). The number of turns is conventional (1 by default). The leader in pts wins.&#10;Actually, many traditional card games can also be played with the Quad Deck. The new game logic brings a new experience into a regular game-play.&#10;&#10;[4] The Good Sign is first of all... [4]&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Get the numbers on your side and win the war of multiplication! The fun starts with two or more players. The deck contains 90 cards, divided evenly. On each card you'll find one multiplication equation. To &quot;battle&quot; each player reveals the top card of their stack. The player with the highest equation result wins. For instance, 2 x 2 = 4 defeats 2 x 1 = 2. The winner takes all the cards played in the round. Sometimes battles result in a &quot;draw&quot; where players end up with the same number. When this happens the two must duel in a &quot;war&quot;. Players take two cards from their hand, placing one face down and the next face up. Whoever has the higher face-up card wins the war, and takes the other players' pair of cards. Players who run out of cards during the war immediately lose. The game continues until only one player emerges victorious with all 90 cards!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Movement is determined by a die.&#10;&#10;The players form two teams: the police and the robbers. Any player may move any figure of hie own team. The robber team decides in secret which robber is the main culprit and which bag contains the loot. From this information they create a secret password from the main feature of the main culprit and the letter of the bag with the loot, for example Moon Boot (Monocle + B 001). The card with the number of the loot bag is removed from the stack and the stach is placed front down on it's space on the game board. The robbers and the bags (front down) are placed on the railway bridge and the police officers at police headquarters.&#10;&#10;The robbers try to reach a hideaway (circular blue spaces), which can't be entered by a policeman. If a robber reaches a hideaway the player takes a bag from the bridge and places it inside the hideaway. The police have half an hour to find the main culprit and the bag with the loot. They try to reach the railway bridge while there are still some robbers and bags.&#10;&#10;If a policeman gets to the railway bridge, he may turn over all the bags still there and takes all robbers still at at bridge to the prison to interrogate them.&#10;&#10;If a figure gets on an orange space, the player takes the upper card from the stack and follows the instructions printed there, depending if he is a policeman or a robber. Some cards contain information for the police about empty bags.&#10;&#10;The policemen take robbers into prison to interrogate them, if they land on a space occupied by a robber. During the first interrogation the robber has to tell the password. In further interrogations the police asks about the features of the main culprit (main feature, clothes, tie, ...). The robber has to answer truthfully wit &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Additionally the policeman may turn over any bag and ask, if this bag contains the loot.&#10;&#10;The police wins, if they discover who is the main culprit and which bag contains the money inside half an hour. If not, the robbers win. The robbers win also if all get into hideaways, where they are safe from the police.&#10;&#10;",

As you grow stronger, you can take on more powerful monsters and, if you plan well, even defeat a dragon.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, each player takes five crystals, then you shuffle together as many kingdom decks as the number of players, then lay out six cards (either items of enchantments) on the journey track. In the game, players take turns to embark on quests, collecting cards from the journey track by paying with crystals. Acquired cards are placed into adjacent stacks, with something like &ldquo;Long Sword&rdquo; going into the item stack and cards like &ldquo;of Fire&rdquo; going into the enchantment stack; combined, these cards create the &ldquo;Long Sword of Fire&rdquo;, and cards grant both temporary bonuses (upper icons and skills) and permanent ones (bottom icons).&#10;&#10;Included in the Deluxe Box :&#10;&#10;Overlords decks: Bandits, Cultists, Unicorns, Gnolls, Goblins, Draco, Barbarians, Faires, Angels, Troglodytes , Undead, Dark Elves, Golems, Mages, Slimes and Demons&#10;&#10;Odyssey decks: Centaurs, Gladiators, Harpies, Medusae, Mermaids and Mummies&#10;&#10;East Quest: decks Ninjas, Monks, Samurais, Nagas, Pirates and Geishas&#10;&#10;Event Deck&#10;    Class Deck&#10;    Banner Deck&#10;    Coop Deck&#10;    Mythic Deck&#10;    Wound Deck (eshop exclusive)&#10;    Quest Deck&#10;    all Villages&#10;    all Overlords&#10;    Banners and classes&#10;    Crystal set&#10;    Plastic Wound tokens&#10;    Shuriken Tokens&#10;    Pearl Tokens&#10;    Defence and attack plastic tracker tokens&#10;    Fate cards for Solo play&#10;    Neoprene kit&#10;&#10;",

Players choose a theme and have a limited amount of time to collect cards to make up words in Japanese that are associated with the theme. Players take up cards to make a word, seeing the Hiragana side.&#10;&#10;For example, if the theme is 'summer', then players could make japanese words like &#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139; (watermelon), &#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138; (sunflower), &#227;&#129;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#138; (bon odori), &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#143; (uchiwa) and so on.

So if a player uses the R card for the Hiragana &#227;&#130;&#138; (ri) in sunflower, then another player will not be able to complete 'bon odori'.&#10;&#10;2) &#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186; Three Letters&#10;The deck is shuffled and players are dealt three hand cards. Players hold their cards with the roman alphabet facing out to the other players.&#10;&#10;In turn, players draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand. A player is trying to get to a Japanese word using the Hiragana that they see. Once they have a word, they declare, and other players have 20 seconds to guess the word they've made from seeing the roman letters.&#10;&#10;For example, if the player is showing KNK as their three cards, is their word &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#147; (mushroom), or &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147; (Kinko), or &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#141; (Konki)?&#10;&#10;3) &#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186; Misty Memories&#10;This is a team game played in 2 v 2 or 3 v 3.&#10;&#10;Players are at a reunion, having a nice conversation. However, it's been a long time, and memories are hazy. Try to get through it with a reasonable answer!&#10;&#10;Players use the cards they have been dealt to compose word using all the vowel sounds, AEIOU. The theme is decided by the letters on top of the deck, such as N &rarr; &quot;The moment I wanted to cry&quot;. Then one team asks the other team to tell a story, using the roman letters to make a word key to the story. For example &quot;Tell us about that time when you really wanted to cry. It was about... TKS!&quot; The challenged team has to reach into their memories, and recount a story using a Japanese word formed from TKS and vowels. If they can make up a good story, they get awarded points.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",
