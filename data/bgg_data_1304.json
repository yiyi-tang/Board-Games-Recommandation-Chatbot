Everyone knows that a well-placed Butterfly Weed can set you apart from the crowd. Of course, sometimes the most important part of being a trendsetter is knowing when to buck the trend. Should orange blooms become popular, you&rsquo;ll need to know when to quit.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re comfortable with the harmonious blend of pinks and purples in the base game of Tussie Mussie, the Orange Flowers expansion is the perfect way to add a pop of color to an old favorite. Orange flowers push the player interaction with their diverse scoring: depending on which you find first, you may want to gather them all for yourself or spread them around the table. There&rsquo;s also the Nasturtium, a potentially powerful (though situational) card that lets the player reorder their arrangement before scoring. Don&rsquo;t let another player find out why its meaning is &ldquo;victory shall be ours&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;&#10;A good flower arrangement is as much about the framing as it is the flowers. Long-stemmed roses are always in vogue, and the gentle addition of a leafy fern can enhance the beauty of the blooms. Be sparing with your greenery, however: this is still a flower arrangement, after all.&#10;&#10;The Greenery expansion introduces 5 cards that work in an all-new way. Greenery cards are great for adding a few extra points to your arrangement...as long as you don&rsquo;t go overboard. One will do just fine; any more than that and you&rsquo;ll lose points. Every face-down offer could be the Greenery that tips the balance, adding a delightful layer to the already rich decision-making of Tussie Mussie.&#10;&#10;&#10;What good is the gift of flowers without a bow to tie them all together? If you really want to catch the eye of your beloved, don&rsquo;t neglect the ribbon. A proper ribbon accentuates the arrangement rather than merely being an add-on. The extra effort is sure to pay off handsomely.&#10;&#10;If you thought Greenery added something new, get ready for Ribbons! This expansion adds 8 Ribbon cards featuring extra goals that players can score in addition to their arrangement. These goals are visible throughout the game and each game will have 1, 2, or 3 of these cards based on player count. Ribbons don&rsquo;t add to or replace cards from the deck, so they can easily be played alongside the other expansions for maximum enjoyment.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to have three victory points provided by hatched dragons wins.&#10;&#10;The heroes are usually spending their time in the inn, waiting for adventure. They wait until all four are present in the party - fighter, thief, mage and priest. These days there is a high demand for captured dragons so then they go to the dungeon and return with a captured dragon egg (well they do their best to choose an egg with a dragon inside but sometimes they pick the wrong one containing something worthless like a giant snake or an ostrych). This is the most noble and heroic way to acquire a dragon egg. Real heroes do it this way.&#10;&#10;There are some players with less honor who take an easier approach. An approach that includes stealth and shady figures in cloaks. Those players may simply steal eggs from other players. (Actually this happens pretty often) You may say that this is not that heroic and noble but the result is the same and the dragon egg is as good as one that the heroes could get from a long and exhausting adventure.&#10;&#10;The acquired egg still needs to hatch. If you have the right cards - two mages - you can hatch the egg. This is a very delicate process where the mages have to use their magic very carefully so that the creature inside the egg is not hurt. (but usually they just blast it with fireballs) Hatched dragons give victory points and the player who first has three wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Feel free to adapt to centimeters should you do not have the space or use a smaller scale of miniatures.&#10;&#10;In an ideal battlefield situation the enemy was pinned in place by the threat of cavalry or disorganised by the missiles of infantry. Once this was accomplished, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork between units, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim in this game, is not to annihilate the enemy&rsquo;s units to the last man, but to inflict enough damage, indicated by chips, that morale is reduced and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the tabletop. By a clever combination of movement, shooting and dashing cavalry charges, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a group, but also between groups and as such, the whole army.&#10;&#10;Your role will be that of a commander in an ancient or medieval army. Should more than two players per side be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.&#10;So onwards, to glory!&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;     making a plan&#10;     roll for initiative&#10;     Command (movement, including initiative moves)&#10;     shooting&#10;     hand-to-hand&#10;&#10;&#10;An IGo UGo system&#10;&#10;Cards or special dice (The dice have 0, 1, 2, 3 and B on them&#10;0-3 dictates how many moves can be made by units in a Command.) are available separately.&#10;Markers and chips can be downloaded in the download section&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

So they use their tweets and followers to promote themselves and their trends, through stealth marketing. Players can like tweets and retweet, and try to make the festival more exciting.&#10;&#10;The players have a personal trend and combine this with a stall to create up to 20 different combinations. They each secretly support three of the stalls.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of tweets (using the actual twitter accounts from the doujin circle and their friends), and retweet cards. By playing tweets, liking and retweeting, they can promote the stalls they support.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they get to do any two actions from three (same action if they like):&#10;&#10;Choose one of the three posts on the common timeline and 'Like' it to apply the card effect.&#10;&#10;Refresh the timeline, which turns on new posts and removes old ones from the timeline.&#10;&#10;'Retweet', which brings back to the timeline a post that was liked in the past, although its use is limited.&#10;&#10;As they players perform the actions, their stock of customers goes down. The game ends when all the customers are gone.&#10;&#10;The player who earns the most points wins the game by comparing the number of customers in their supporting shop, secretly decided at the beginning of the game, and finally adding up the bonuses for meeting special conditions.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The biribaki are put to one side for the time being, and the remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table facing down. They are the &lsquo;closed cards&rsquo;.&#10;To begin the game, the dealer draws a card from the stack of &lsquo;closed cards&rsquo;.&#10;The letter of this card will receive double points throughout the game.&#10;Each word can only contain one atout card. &#10;  A word must contain at least three letters.&#10;  The Atout cards represent any letter of your choosing, but have zero value.&#10;Thereon, the player has a choice:&#10;&#10;take one card from the stack of &lsquo;closed cards&rsquo;, or&#10;     &#10;    Collect all the disposed cards, which face upwards and are visible; the &lsquo;open cards&rsquo;, but only if s/he can use at least one of these cards, (to either form a word or add letters to already formed words).&#10;&#10;The player will form as many words as s/he can, which are deposited on the table.&#10;&#10;Then, she/he deposits a card onto the stack of &lsquo;open cards&rsquo; (or forms a stack of &lsquo;open cards&rsquo; if there are none). This marks the end of his/her turn and the beginning of the next player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;The letters in the words created are &lsquo;locked&rsquo; and cannot be used to form other words. It is however possible to add letters at the beginning or end of a word.&#10;&#10;In teams of two, the players must sit opposite each other. One player is in possession of the team&rsquo;s cards, whereas the formed words are placed in front of him/her.&#10;&#10;It is only possible to move onto the second round and receive a biribaki, once the player or team has used all other cards and has completed a word consisting of 7 letters.&#10;&#10;At the end of all the rounds, the players sum up the points they earned from the words they created, including any bonuses, and they deduct points lost from the cards they were unable to use, including any penalties.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Market Trend is a market game from Japan, with players working as jewellers. The price of the different gemstones varies according to demand; when players put out new designs and clusters, prices go up, and fall for the gems out of popularity. Players aim to be the richest jeweller by the end of four rounds.&#10;&#10;The game has 120 gem cards for different types, from 10 diamonds to 24 jet. The deck is varied for the number of players.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is prepared and shuffled, players are dealt 8 hand cards. (If the deck is exhausted leter, discards are shuffled over).&#10;&#10;Players then select one card to keep as stock, placing it face-down in front of them, and pass their hand to their neighbour (alternating each round). Then players can sell gems or sets of gems from their hand and make cash.&#10;&#10;The value of what they sell is determined by a scoring plan, and alters each round. At the end of the game, there is a final bonus too.&#10;&#10;Players can now move the prices of the gem types up or down, according to what they did and did not sell. After this, players are dealt back to 8 cards (or as best can be done), and the game continues.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the stock cards the players have been collecting are scored for a final bonus. After this, most cash wins.&#10;&#10;The distribution of the gem cards matters, and players try to keep in mind which gems they have seen and which have been sold. Understanding which are going to be rarer by the end of the game is a key strategy.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subway Network is a game from Japan. Players are constructing rail networks in Tokyo or Osaka. By building stations, operating typical businesses on the stations, such as convenience stores, and increasing passengers, players score points to win.&#10;&#10;The game has a board on which track cards are placed. Each card has three rail lines in different patterns and hence 6 points of entry/exit. Each card also has two stations, of municipal, dept store or skyscraper types.&#10;&#10;The 12 business cards score victory points when built. They come in three types, cafes, retail, and two hotels.&#10;&#10;The passenger cards score points when certain conditions are met. For example, 2 points for each municipal station on the line.&#10;&#10;Players have their own markers; station, train, and action markers. The train markers go onto spaces around the board, marking the start and finish of their rail lines. The action markers go on an action board, which sets player order. In the round, players move their markers to select their actions in the round.&#10;&#10;Players can select a business action, draw business cards and select the one they want, passing the remaining cards to other players who selected the same action. Being able to build a mix of businesses can earn bonus points at the end.&#10;&#10;Players can then build out their rail line from hand cards dealt at the start and place a station marker. Completing lines allows a player to recover their markers. After this, some additional actions can be triggered, such as building tunnels.&#10;&#10;Then conditions are checked for four open passenger cards. If a card is satisfied, players can score points, and the card is discarded. A fourth card is drawn, until no more are available.&#10;&#10;The players action markers are moved back to determine the turn order, and rail cards are dealt back to each player and the game continues.&#10;&#10;When the map is filled out, the game ends and players calculate their final scores. The most points wins the game for the best subway network builder.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

While moving under oars, these ships can move as if at Battle Sails, no matter where the wind is coming from. However, as the crew is busy rowing, the ship will shoot with an additional -2 penalty. Galleys may also deploy their sails, following the same rules as all other sailing ships. However, in order to switch from sails to oars, or vice versa, a ship must spend one full Turn without shooting.&#10;&#10;Originating in the Mediterranean by the early naval powers &ndash; notably the Greeks, Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Romans, the galley remained the predominantly used types of vessels used for both war and piracy in those seas until the end of the 16th century. Though the advent of the lateen sail used in hybrid vessels like xebecs had displaced the use of galleys by the 18th century, the vessels still saw some use. The last recorded battle where galleys took a significant part in the Mediterranean was at Matapan in 1717; however, the vessels enjoyed a brief resurgence in the wars of the 18th century between Russia, Sweden and Denmark.&#10;&#10;This pack includes one large galley for inclusion in Black Seas fleets.

Being paid well also serves them on the battlefield, as they know they don&rsquo;t want to lose that next paycheck.&#10;&#10;",

But once the battle has started, a whole new facet of the unit becomes apparent: they're also master archers. Archers are generally slower units in an army. Obviously, that's not the case when your archer is also a master rider.&#10;&#10;The A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game &ndash; Targaryen Dothraki Outriders unit box gives House Targaryen players a swift ranged force for their army. These lightly armored mounted troops make full use of their horses both before and after raining arrows down on their opponents. With their great speed, the Dothraki Outriders can reach out and deal damage to enemies normally considered safe along the back lines of an army. Enemy commanders will have a difficult time pinning down these highly mobile troops.&#10;&#10;",
