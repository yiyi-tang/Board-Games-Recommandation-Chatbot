As the game goes on, scoring for abundance will become trickier, diversity more valuable &mdash; and you&rsquo;ll want to watch out for the weeds.&#10;&#10;So keep your wits and weedkiller about you and get planting!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Castle-Mate Game Cards are incorporated into the normal game of chess (World Chess Federation, FIDE, rules apply). White, without taking a card, makes the &#239;&#172;&#129;rst move. Black has the option to make a regular chess move, or take a card.&#10;&#10;Take a card and let the fun begin.&#10;&#10;With every turn, the players have an option to make a regulation chess move or take a card. If the King is in check, the player cannot take a card and must use the turn, to move the King to safety. A player can use any of the cards, he or she currently possesses, to aid in the King&rsquo;s safety.&#10;&#10;The Castle-Mate cards are designed to appeal to Chess Players of any age and skill. The level of sophistication is really determined by the skill of the players. However, Castle-Mate adds an unpredictable element to the game: &ldquo;Luck of the Draw&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Selection of a particular card, at any given moment, can dramatically alter the outcome of the game. As in the regular game, Check-mate wins. Resignations, Stalemates and Draws are applicable, as stated by World Chess Federation rules. You can also win by drawing speci&#239;&#172;&#129;c cards at the right moment.&#10;&#10;",

This discard exists to force the player to play cards here he may want for other discards.&#10;&#10;The Battlefleet discard is a temporary holding area for cards to add up to either 11 (for the Jack), 12 (for the Queen), or 13 (for the King) to knock invaders off their draw piles.&#10;&#10;Aces represent Events. There are only 4 events in the game, cumulating in the final event, a Truce, which ends the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn you Explore (flip top card of each unblocked draw pile), then Expand (assign those non-face cards to discard piles), then Exploit (use Events if Aces are drawn), and Exterminate (assign cards from the Battlefleet pile to a blocking Invader card to discard it out of play).&#10;&#10;The best score you can hope for is 10 points.&#10;&#10;",

We have all seen these cute creatures in the wild and our backyards, yet few know much about them. Finally, for the first time a board game has been created to simulate the life of a typical tree squirrel from nest born, to adulthood, and ultimately parenthood.&#10;&#10;Full of humanizing and amusing nuances, both children and adults will enjoy many hours of fun and entertainment. With cleverly designed game rules, it also helps kids develop important social, math and negotiation skills that will benefit both their personal and professional lives for years to come.&#10;&#10;The general objective of the game is to gather a certain number of food pieces (i.e. acorns, strawberries and pumpkins), as well as obtain five tail rings signifying squirrel life milestone achievements. The first squirrel/player to accomplish this wins.&#10;The minimum number of food pieces that needs to be acquired are:&#10;&#10;     10 acorns &#10;     10 strawberries &#10;     10 pumpkins &#10;&#10;&#10;The milestone achievements that are represented by five tail rings are:&#10;&#10;     2 nests (2 green tail rings)&#10;     2 litters of babies (2 pink tail rings)&#10;     1 hospital trip (1 yellow tail ring)&#10;&#10;&#10;Generally there is no special order of events except that your squirrel must have at least one nest before having babies. The yellow tail ring signifies that you made at least one hospital trip and proof that you received a rabies vaccination.&#10;&#10;The food pieces for our Classic Version are made of cardboard, and for our Deluxe Version PVC injection molded.&#10;&#10;",

You must own either In the Trenches: Doughboys or In the Trenches: Devil Dogs to play 1916.&#10;&#10;In the Trenches: 1916 breathes new life into Tiny Battle Publishing&rsquo;s popular In the Trenches system.  Delve into the gritty tactics of the Battle of the Somme and the Eastern Front&rsquo;s Brusilov Offensive in SIX action-packed scenarios by esteemed designer John Gorkowski, featuring British, Canadian, German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Polish forces.  Lead your men through the great muddy lengths of Regina Trench, across the battle-pocked fields from La Boiselle to the Sausage Valley and through narrow lines dug in at forest&rsquo;s edge at Kostiuchnowka on three beautifully rendered maps.&#10;&#10;Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&#10;&#10;Note:  The six scenarios of In the Trenches: 1916 were originally published in 2009 by Grenier Games, as part of their In the Trenches: The Lost Generation expansion.  We have taken these scenarios, tweaked and polished them, and treated them to brand new artwork by Jose Ramon Faura and a full-color eight-page scenario guide.&#10;&#10;&middot;         220 Unit Counters (yes, there are two full pages of counters)&#10;&#10;&middot;         132 Operational Markers&#10;&#10;&middot;         Three 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Maps&#10;&#10;&middot;         1 Player Aid Card&#10;&#10;&middot;         1 Game Turn Track&#10;&#10;&middot;         1 Full-Color Scenario Book&#10;&#10;&middot;         6 Scenarios&#10;&#10;Game Design: John Gorkowski&#10;&#10;Art: Jose Ramon Faura&#10;&#10;Players: 2&#10;&#10;Duration: 90-120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orbots is an easy-to-learn and quick-playing game in which you maneuver your orbital robots (orbots) around a tiny asteroid to collect power crystals in different combinations to generate the most power (points) by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Orbots features just a few simple rules for movement, combined with a few simple rules for scoring. Each turn consists of moving your orbot up, down, left or right to reach a power crystal to add to your collection, or to reach a tunnel to move to another part of the board. There are four different types (colors) of crystals and each resonates at a different frequency (values of 0-5 or 0-8, depending on the number of players). Combining crystals of the same type, but different frequencies is what generates power and scores points. The greater the difference between two crystals, the more power is generated. There are also special crystals that increase the power generated by a pair of crystals, or that changes how crystals combine, boosting power if you can get to them in time.&#10;&#10;Orbots also includes optional goals beyond simply generating the most power, for a more strategic and challenging layer of gameplay, as well as added replayability.&#10;&#10;The combination of simple rules, intuitive strategy and quick gameplay makes Orbots a great gateway game for newer or younger players, as well as a compelling and satisfying filler game for more experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;Orbots is currently in late-stage development and is scheduled to launch on Kickstarter in the fall of 2017.&#10;&#10;",

You may also collect prestige icons which have no effect during the game but convert into victory points at the end of the game. Each card also has a piece of wall on one of its 4 sides. By placing the cards in a certain way, you might be able to build a long wall and score a lot of points.

    "Description": "Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Christmas Eve, The Race to Help Santa will be the go-to Christmas board game for players around the world.&#10;&#10;We have one goal: to be a fun filled, Christmas board game for families and friends alike - a game that becomes an annual tradition.&#10;&#10;Not only will Christmas Eve, The Race to Help Santa appeal to families and children alike, but a variation of the rules will also allow for more adult versions of the game play.&#10;&#10;Christmas Eve, The Race to Help Santa is more than just a dice rolling game; it includes mini games, challenges and card duelling as well, creating an intensive, fun and competitive Christmas experience that can be tailored to the age of the players.&#10;&#10;The Game Concept&#10;&#10;Here is an introduction to some of the detail behind the game mechanics:&#10;&#10;Objective of the Game&#10;&#10;Reach Santa first, with a minimum of 4 presents that you've found, fought for or won on your journey to the North Pole &#10;Move around the board via the dice, player interactions and by completing game tasks&#10;&#10;Interactions with other players&#10;&#10;You can work with other players to help you achieve your ultimate goal of reaching Santa and winning the game (co-op Vs. the Grinch), or use the mini games and your card deck to try to sabotage other players and take their presents. Winners earn their Christmas wish, which they declare at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Interactions with the board and mini-quests:&#10;&#10;As well as the classic board game and board game spaces you could expect, Christmas Eve, The Race to Help Santa goes further to include strategy, fighting, collaboration and challenges. Some of the mini games include:&#10;&#10;Card Battling: where playing cards you have collected can be used to fight with other players with the goal of stealing presents. &#10;Avalanche: where you can roll a snowball in an attempt to knock down a player's piece - allowing you to take their presents. &#10;High-Low Bridges: where you must correctly guess the next card to be turned.&#10;The Dark Cave: close your eyes and try to get through the cave with your presents.&#10;Present Throwing: throw your presents to the catcher piece on the mini-game, each catch gets one of your presents across the frozen lake.&#10;Snowman Sleigh Ride: roll a ball to knock down at least 3 snowmen to make it to the bottom and continue with the game.&#10;Interactive Player Challenges: move away from standard board game etiquette and complete a Christmas themed challenge to enter the North Pole.&#10;&#10;The game, its goal, challenges and quests exist to put you and your fellow players in the spirit of Christmas whilst providing a fun and rewarding gaming experience. We are now working on the song play-list to go with the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of distinct characters, each with their own 'Job of the Future' and unique set of preferred future conditions. They compete to create a world where their future job is relevant and secure.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Up to 5 players choose from 10 &quot;Jobs of the Future&quot; with differing back stories and victory conditions. They draw and play cards from a deck of 100 Impact Cards that relate current technological trends to future conditions. They assess and discuss the likely primary and secondary impacts of each card on one or more of 10 different &quot;domains&quot; (e.g. Manufacturing, Energy, Security, Home, Work) and place or remove influence cubes. &#10;There are also Disruption Cards that indicate large-scale or sudden shifts in the system that pose larger challenges to the players. &#10;After each round of play (every player has had one turn), players collect the played cards and generate the &quot;Headline of the Era&quot; from player suggestions.&#10;When a player sees that the number of influence cubes equals or exceeds the win condition on three of the domains specified for their &quot;Job from the Future&quot;, they reveal their role and win the game.&#10;&#10;This game was originally designed by Idea Couture in collaboration with Policy Horizons Canada, an organization within the Public Service of Canada that examines emerging policy challenges and new ideas and questions posed by trends in technological and social development.&#10;&#10;There is not a great deal of strategy or mechanical challenge in this game, but that's not the point; the purpose of the game is to get the players thinking and discussing the possible second-order effects of current developments, using their logic to persuade other players on what other domains could be affected besides the obvious ones. &#10;This game appears to be aimed at wannabe policy analysts, amateur futurologists and soi-disant speculative thinkers generally.&#10;&#10;",

The other two games in the series are Election 1960 and DEFCON 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis.&#10;&#10;The Game is played over a period of 4 Rounds, with 10 turns per Round.  The solitaire player, takes the part of Kennedy as he tries to successfully complete missions against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands in 1943.  Each Round has several phases, which include drawing cards which represent Random Events, Missions, and possible contact with Japanese military units, such as Barges, Destroyers, Aircraft attacks, etc.  If Contact is made it leads to a Combat phase.&#10;&#10;Once the player knows what his orders are (his Mission he must complete), he must prepare his PT boat for the mission.  This includes a series of decisions as to the amount of fuel, ammunition, medical supplies, etc. that he will need to increase his chance of success.  Victory Points are accumulated over the four rounds to determine if the player has scored enough points to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is play, rather than story, focused; the Matches are meant to highlight some of the possibilities inherent in the system, rather than to represent any overarching theme or narrative. As such, Heroes might be allies in one Match, and enemies in another.&#10;&#10;Heroes &amp; Hirelings is a fantasy skirmish combat game. Players control a Party comprised of two kinds of Characters: Heroes and, you guessed it, Hirelings. Heroes are powerful, named Characters with special abilities. Hirelings are anonymous mooks who give adjacent Characters the benefits (and detriments) of Buffs. The object of a Match is typically to Defeat a certain number of your opponent&rsquo;s Heroes. The game is played with 2 Maps, 88 Counters, Markers, Cards, and several eight-sided dice. That&rsquo;s eight, not six or ten. Everything but the dice is provided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Donetsk: The Battle for the Airport is the feature magazine game included in Yaah! #9 by Flying Pig Games.&#10;&#10;Donetsk is not like most tactical level games on the market. First, it differs in scale - while units are relatively small (squads,individual teams and vehicles) the hexes are relatively large(approx. 150m). This was done to simulate the relative emptiness of the modern battlefield as compared to earlier conflicts. Modern combat units move slower and more cautiously due to the increased range and lethality of modern weapons. These factors explain why leg unit movement factors are low and there are no &lsquo;close assault&rsquo; rules like earlier conflict period tactical simulations.&#10;&#10;Second, even though the battle was called Little Stalingrad, unlike the forces involved in that pivotal WW2 battle, the forces in these battles were very brittle. It did not take many setbacks and casualties before a side lost their aggressive spirit and will to fight. The central game mechanic that depicts this, which the player needs to manage, is initiative /Hesitation. Protecting your Initiative Level is critical to keeping your tactical options and chances for victory open. Initially the player with the highest initiative normally gets to activate first - especially if in a close quarters battle in the Terminals the ability to fire first or withdraw from a bad situation before the other side can fire can be critical. Later, if your initiative level drops to your Hesitation Level then your options become very limited. If on the Offensive, the player is left with ranged fire hoping to attrition the defender to victory. If on the Defensive, then the other player can be more aggressive and it becomes very hard to hold important objectives in the face of a determined assault. Therefore,being sensitive to casualties is critical to winning.&#10;&#10;",

The wisp wields a ghostly lantern used to lure the living off their paths and into the treachery of darkness. Both spirit and the living have the power to cast charms or glamours which affects the movement and state of all the other players on the board.&#10;&#10;If the villagers all reach their homes safely, then they have won the game &ndash; but if they should not, then the wisp has won the game by luring them into the shadows.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 2 -4+ players based on the TV show Lost Girl.  Players move their pawns around a circular track collecting the tokens needed to solve a central mystery and its complications.&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track with 12 spaces around which players move in a clockwise direction.  The spaces on the board allow players to gain tokens, or draw cards from the various decks.&#10;&#10;There are six token types each representing one of six traits: Guile, Lore, Search, Heart, Fight, Magic&#10;&#10;There are 3 common decks of cards:&#10;&#10;Mystery Deck&#10;&#10;       Each card represents a mystery that must be solved or resolved. To solve a mystery a player must collect 3 of each token type, plus extra tokens required by individual mysteries and complications.  An individual mystery card lists any extra tokens required in addition to the 3 of each type. When a mystery is solved, the solving player keeps the card and a new card is drawn from the mystery deck to be the new mystery. &#10;&#10;&#10;Complication Deck&#10;&#10;       When a player lands on the complication space on the board, they draw a complication card. This card is placed face up next to the board.  This card lists extra tokens that need to be gained to solve the current mystery. This additional burden applies to all players.  When the current mystery is solved, these cards are discarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;Assistance Deck&#10;&#10;       When a player lands on the assistance space, they draw an assistance card. This card gives that player one or more extra tokens. The assistance card is then discarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;To start the top mystery card is placed face up in the middle of the movement track. Players then take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move Phase&#10;         Roll 1 die and move that many spaces clockwise along the track. &#10;    &#10;     Action Phase&#10;         Most spaces when you land on them give you 1 or more Tokens. &#10;         If you land on a Deck space, draw a card from the indicated deck. &#10;         If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s Pawn, steal 1 Token of your choice from him.  Skip all other actions you would take at that space. &#10;    &#10;     End Phase&#10;         If you have enough of the right tokens to solve the Mystery and all of its complications, declare your intent.  Keep the Mystery card and discard all complications. All players discard all of their Tokens. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to solve 3 mysteries.&#10;&#10;",

The fishing rod is placed to one side, within reach of the players.&#10;&#10;GAME DEVELOPMENT:&#10;In turns, the player has to fish a fish, turn around to see what he has underneath and if the number or color has it in his fish chart he associates it and places it on top, like a bingo. If you do not have it, leave it with the other fish, with the number or color face down.&#10;The first player to complete his fish card will be the winner of Navy Loto!&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher (Spanish):&#10;&#10;PREPARACI&Oacute;N DEL JUEGO:&#10;Cada jugador escoge una de las 6 cartas pez, 3 de las cuales son con colores y las otras 3 con n&uacute;meros.&#10;La caja del juego con los pececitos dentro se coloca al centro, tal y como se observa en la imagen.

Making combinations allows players to place summoning Seals to block opponents, cast crafty spells, and in the end summon a powerful (but benevolent) Spirit.&#10;&#10;In a typical turn, you may use your two actions to either draw or place a numbered Sign card next to another card of the same value, one higher/lower value, or the same suit. Additionally, by discarding a Sign card onto an open spell slot, you may cast the spell of that card's suit, and by placing Seals atop a Sign card marked with a &quot;V,&quot; you may invoke the effects of one of the eight game-changing Virtue cards. When specific poker-like combinations of cards are made, a number of Seals corresponding to the strength of that combination may be put down. When someone has laid down all 7 of their Secondary Seals, they must create a combination of cards that yields more Seals than the the central Spirit card demands. The number of Seals indicated on the Spirit card (1 to 4) indicates the difficulty of the end game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seven Suitors&nbsp;is series of three games designed by Chris Wray.&#10;&#10;The four-player game, Seven Suitors, is a partnership trick-taking card game.&nbsp; The game uses a custom deck of seven suits with eight cards each.  The first suit is numbered 1-7, the second 2-8, the third 3-9, and so on and so forth, with two of each 7 card in each suit.&#10;&#10;Seven Suitors is a &quot;marriage&quot; trick game, and the goal is to be the first team to capture and &ldquo;mark off&rdquo; all seven suits. &nbsp;To mark off a suit, you and/or your partner must capture both 7s in a given suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).&#10;&#10;Players start the hand by passing one card to each other player.   The player with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; card will lead the first trick, but he or she need not play that card.&nbsp; The suit of the first card led by the start player becomes the &ldquo;trump&rdquo; for the hand.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;After a card is led, players must follow suit if possible.  If not possible, they can play any card.&nbsp; The highest card of the trump suit will win the trick, but absent a trump, highest card of the suit led wins.&nbsp; In the event both sevens of a suit are played and would win the trick, the first seven played wins.&nbsp; The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;All captured sevens are public knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Play until one side has marked off all seven suits, which will generally take multiple hands.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;There are two alternative end conditions included in the game rules.  Additionally, four special cards -- each with a different power -- are included as an additional variant.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Anti-Cupid is is a trick-taking game for five players where each player gets a chance to act as Anti-Cupid.&#10;&#10;Each player gets dealt 12 cards.&nbsp; One of the players --- the player with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; card&rdquo; --- will be the first to act as Anti-Cupid.  The first and third players from his or her left will be partners for this hand.  The second and fourth players from his or her left will also be partners for this hand.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the most points after five hands.  The player acting as Anti-Cupid will rotate, so each player will take on the role once.  &#10;If you are not Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; you and your partner capture. &nbsp;A marriage trick means you and/or your partner captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).  Additionally, all players that are not Anti-Cupid earn points for each marriage trick Anti-Cupid captures.&#10;&#10;If you are Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each suit where a marriage trick is not formed by the end of the hand.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;A Traitor of Love is a trick-taking social deduction game for six players.&nbsp; Players are on teams of three matchmakers, competing against each other to see who can make the most marriages.  But there&rsquo;s a traitor in their midst that is helping the other team make matches!&#10;&#10;Players sit with members of the opposing team to their left and right.  Each player gets dealt 10 cards.&nbsp; Additionally, from one of the sets of suit tracking cards, six suits are selected, making sure to include hearts.  One of the players will be the Traitor of Love (the &ldquo;Traitor&rdquo;); he or she is the player that receives the hearts tracking card.  The other five players will be plain Matchmakers; they will have received tracking cards representing other suits.&#10;&#10;After cards are dealt, each player passes one card to each other player of the opposing team (i.e. each player passes three cards and receives three cards).&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game, which comes when one player has more than 15 points. &nbsp;If you are a Matchmaker, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; your team earns. &nbsp;A marriage trick means you captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick). If you&rsquo;re the Traitor, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; the other team earns. &#10; Additionally, for Matchmakers on the Traitor&rsquo;s team, if they correctly identify the Traitor at the end of the hand, they get 2 bonus points.  The Traitor loses 1 point for each teammate correctly identifying him, but he gains a point for each teammate not guessing him.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.&#10;&#10;",

Cards can be a combination of positive cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), negative cards (-1, -2, and -3), and special Action Cards. Each player mixes and matches their cards each turn to create as many 6-point hands as possible with the ultimate goal of playing all of their cards (thus scoring zero points) and catching other players with points. The lowest score after 6 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Each player creates their own Laydown Pile of 6-point hands during each round. As a twist, when every player has started a Laydown Pile during a round, the board becomes Open for Business, and players can start making 6-point hands off the top of other players' Laydown Piles.&#10;&#10;Several Action Cards allow players to both help create additional 6-point hands and also block (or at least delay) other players from making their own 6-point hands. Action Cards include both offensive and defensive cards, cards for stealing hands or forcing other players to steal each other's hands, cards that change positive cards negative or negative cards positive, and cards that force other players to draw varying numbers of cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player selects which monster to use and places that monster face up ion the table. You can only play adjectives that match the colors on your monster card. All players simultaneously make their monsters scarier by placing scary adjective cards on the table next to their monster. Once everyone has played their scary adjectives on their monster, everyone draws back up to 7 adjective cards.&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player can challenge any other player to a Scare Off. The scariness of each player's monster is the number of scary adjective cards displayed next to their monster card.

The game is over when a player either creates a line which results in a win, or the board is filled with no lines created resulting in a draw.

    "Description": "Beasts of Balance is a game of strategy and balance in which you build a tower of animals on your tabletop, then help them evolve in a connected digital world. By scanning NFC tags on the physical elements, an integrated app builds your world on a screen. Two to three players each take on the role of a Divine Creator of a single region: Land, Sea or Sky. The aim of the game is to fill your region with powerful beasts, while stealing and smiting those of your opponents.&#10;&#10;Battles takes all the physical pieces from the core game and gives you an adrenaline-filled competitive way of playing with them. In Battles, skilful stacking is even more important, as disturbing the tower means Alberick, the spirit of the volcano, rains down fiery lava damage on your beasts (and your beasts only)! So build carefully, or see your lead evaporate with one ill-timed collapse...&#10;&#10;Primal Power enters your world though a deck of 16 unique NFC Battle Cards. Each player wields a hand of these cards, enabling them to invoke a whole host of weird and wonderful effects on the digital realm. Some are focused on attack, some will aid in defence, and some will manifest in much more random ways&hellip; Each Divine Creator chooses a digital avatar in the form of a Guardian. Guardians manifest your will in the form of lightning bolts, tidal waves and dirty great lumps of earth. They also have special, customisable powers that modify the game in interesting, strategic ways...&#10;&#10;There is also a Legendary Beast: MAGMAAARGH the Cantakerous, an extremely grumpy old dragon with a bit of a beer gut and a ridiculous name. MAGMAAARGH brings an additional layer of strategy to the game once summoned by his special card. He's worth *a lot* of points if you have him in your region, but in order to keep him you'll need to feed him Star Energy. Leave him hungry for too long though, or let him take too much damage, and that temper will flair up and things might just turn ugly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players also have to contend with other players using their abilities to turn the game on its head, charging ahead of the pack, making a monster retaliate against someone else, or coercing other players into helping.&#10;&#10;This is a deck building game that incorporates strategical movement on a tabletop board. We have removed as many dice as possible to prevent the game from being too luck based, allowing your own strategies by what cards you acquire to thrive. The game also has multiple strategic levels. What cards to acquire, where to move on the board, and when to attack. All of these can alter what other players might be planning!&#10;&#10;",
