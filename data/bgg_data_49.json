    "Description": "Legend tells of the abandoned Spectral Manor coming to life at the stroke of midnight on a Crimson Moon &mdash; an event that rarely takes place more than once per century. On that night and that night alone, in certain rooms vast treasures appear, granting unspeakable wealth to those brave enough to find and claim them. But those who enter this mansion do so at their peril as some rooms awaken ghosts and curses that claim any who are foolish enough to enter. Rumors speak of glyphs and sigils found within the manor only on Crimson Moon night; these markings offer hints and clues &mdash; indicating both where treasures can be found and where paranormal traps lie in wait.&#10;&#10;In Spectral, players control competing bands of treasure hunters. These bands enter the Spectral Manor on the night of the Crimson Moon and race to uncover and stake out the locations of the treasures before midnight. As they discover and decipher the glyphs, they can avoid rooms where demons secretly slumber and selfishly keep such information from their rivals. Meanwhile, locations of the manor that promise to conjure the most treasure will see multiple clans clashing over the territory. Through deduction, bidding, betting, and bluffing, players will uncover and harness the secrets within. The game ends after a player has placed all of their treasure hunters or if all players consecutively pass. The band that claims the most treasure while avoiding cursed rooms will come away victorious.&#10;&#10;Spectral features multiple challenge levels &mdash; beginner mode, standard mode, and advanced modules &mdash; so that you can tailor the game to your experience.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Momiji, you attempt to fulfill objectives by collecting the most valuable autumn leaves from the Imperial Garden in ancient Japan.&#10;&#10;You start with a hand of six leaf cards and a series of three landscape powers that combine to form a unique panorama. (For the first game, landscapes are assigned, but they can be drafted in subsequent games.) Leaf cards come in 4-6 types depending on the number of players, with values of 0-3 in each type. Start with four random cards in the central playing area, sorted by type. Place 4-6 randomly chosen objective tokens in the center of play; sample objectives are collecting the most 0s, having the most cards of a specific type, or having the highest sum of visible cards at game's end.&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose one of these three options:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect leaf cards: Take all the leaves of one type from the central display and add them to your hand; if you wish, pay one acorn token to reveal four new leaf cards prior to choosing a type.&#10;     Play leaf cards: Place 1-2 leaf cards of the same type or two or more cards of different types in your player area. Each type is placed in its own pile, with 0 being the first card you can play of a type; each subsequent card must the same number or at most one larger. Once you play a 3 on a pile, cover that pile with a torii token as that pile is now closed for you. If you play different types, then after playing, each pair of adjacent topmost cards in your area; if both cards show an acorn on the adjacent corners, you take two acorn tokens from the reserve.&#10;     Activate a objective token: Pay three acorn tokens to place an objective token in your player area. This activates the objective, and anyone might score for it at game's end.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once during a turn, you can discard two cards from your hand for one acorn token or spend an acorn to use a landscape power or do both of these actions. You can use each landscape power at most once during a game.&#10;&#10;When the leaf card deck is empty or after 4-6 leaf piles are closed with a torii token, the game ends. For each pile of leaves, you score points equal to the value of the topmost card multiplied by the number of cards in the pile. Remaining acorn tokens are worth 1 point each. For each activated objective, you see who best meets the condition and therefore scores points; if the player holding the token scores, they receive 10 points, whereas anyone else who scores that objective receives 3 points. Each player scores in case of a tie. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

All questions have a numerical answer, so even players that don't know the subject matter at hand can make a guess!&#10;&#10;Players then have a limited time to either bet on themselves or bet on another player's answers. The winning answer is the one that is closest to being correct, but no higher! Players earn points for either getting the winning answer or for betting on the player who does. The one with the most points after 7 rounds of questions is the winner!&#10;&#10;Gambit categories include: Business &amp; Economy; Art &amp; Literature; Geography &amp; Nature; History &amp; Government; Pop Culture; Science; Sports &amp; Leisure; and Wild Card. The set of questions in Gambit 7 were designed to be culturally appropriate for each specific language version.&#10;&#10;While Gambit 7 can be played with as few as 3 players, the more friends and family you gather, the more fun and excitement you will experience! With more than 7 players, simply split into teams of 2 or 3 and work together to answer the questions and decide how to bet.&#10;&#10;A german mini edition was published in 2008 for promotional use under the name &quot;Gambit 7 Das mini Spiel&quot;.

    "Description": "In 982, a Viking jarl called Erik the Red sailed from the western coast of Iceland and discovered a new land. He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.&#10;&#10;At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.&#10;&#10;The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.&#10;&#10;A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.&#10;&#10;If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? &#10;The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nefarious forces threaten the world as we know it, and it's up to a small group of heroes to come to its rescue. With the enemy's minions closing in and innocents in peril, our heroes will need to work together to stop the villain's plans and save the world &mdash; but will they be able to save it in time?&#10;&#10;In Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R., players work together to challenge the forces of evil. Play as iconic heroes like Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Black Widow, and race across the globe to complete missions, battle enemies, and square off for the final showdown against the nemesis. Choose the best aspect for your hero, pull off awesome combos, and wait for the perfect moment to unleash your ultimate ability. Team up with your allies and take on dangerous threats as you become the greatest heroes in the world!&#10;&#10;In more detail, &quot;D.A.G.G.E.R.&quot; stands for &quot;Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Emergency Response&quot;, and the &quot;Alliance&quot; and &quot;Emergency Response&quot; elements drive how the game is played, with heroes needing to strengthen themselves via combos in time to take on the nemesis.&#10;&#10;There are two types of combo tokens: empowered tokens and primed tokens. When a hero becomes &quot;empowered&quot;, they can later discard their empowered token to add one success to any attribute test they perform. When an enemy is &quot;primed&quot;, a hero attacking that enemy can remove a primed token from them to add one success to the attack result, which means more damage dealt.&#10;&#10;What's more, each hero has at least one &quot;combo ability&quot; that requires either an empowered token on themselves or a primed token on an enemy to trigger. Triggering these combo abilities comes with an extra benefit: advancing the team-up track, a resource shared by all heroes that's used to pay for &quot;team-up abilities&quot;, the strongest abilities in each hero's arsenal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you increase your assets, you can build a building and use that building to acquire resources and victory points more quickly.&#10;&#10;The more buildings players construct, the more actions that become available on future turns. On a turn, players take one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Production: Choose a resource card or building card in the production action area, and gain the item shown on it; or,&#10;     Trade: Discard resource cards from your hand to acquire resource or building cards of the same value or less from the available cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition, players can use the effects of each building they own once per turn (including on the turn during which they were acquired). An example of a building effect is: exchanging a thread card in hand for cloth available in the play area. Chain together cards, buildings, and actions to create more victory points.  The player who collects 10+ victory points first wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these peoples.&rdquo; - St. Patrick&#10;&#10;Legend has it that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland. True, there are no snakes anywhere on the island- but there have been none since before the last Ice Age! The legend is actually an allegory about his successes in converting Ireland to Christianity.&#10;&#10;Banish the Snakes is a cooperative game that simulates Ireland in the 5th century, while the Roman Empire was collapsing in the west and Ireland was turning to the Christian religion. Players represent Saints- Patrick and others (up to six of you) who set out to convert the pagans on the island. You must work as a team to convert the people of Ireland before the barbarians completely overwhelm Britain- if you fail, the Irish will not be able to save Civilization in the following centuries!&#10;&#10;The game board shows a map of Ireland in the 5th century, with four Provinces-the same as today- but no counties yet. Wooden tiles represent the People, Druids, Chiefs, and Kings, and of course the High King at Tara. It is your job to break into the interrelated influences between these groups of people and get your new ideas accepted.&#10;&#10;Each turn a card is drawn, throwing new challenges at your team. The severity of the event is determined by the previous card, and so no two games can ever play the same. The cards introduce events and ideas of the time, new saints, and historic figures- like Neil of the Nine Hostages.&#10;&#10;There is a diagram of Great Britain to keep track of the steady decline of Roman civilization in Great Britain. As different parts of Britain succumb to the barbarians, more and more difficult challenges are added to the deck, until finally Britain is completely overwhelmed, cutting off Ireland from the continent and ending the game.&#10;&#10;If you succeed in your endeavor, Christianity will thrive in Ireland, while paganism overruns Western Europe. The arts, writing, literature and history will flourish on the Emerald Isle! Soon, Irish missionaries will bring these civilizing attributes back to Great Britain and mainland Europe- as Thomas Cahill says in his book, the Irish will save Civilization.&#10;&#10;But if you fail&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game further captures the mood of those stories and the feel of the planet.  The game uses a further refinement of the wrap-around mechanism used in Lunar Rails to simulate travel across a 3D  opposed to a 2D map.  Having to think in 3D wraparound mode adds additional &quot;brain-burn&quot; to the Empire Builder franchise... sometimes the shortest distance between two points isn't the obvious straight line.&#10;&#10;See crayon rail games for more crayon fun.&#10;&#10;",

Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.&#10;&#10;Each Agent card features a &quot;command&quot; on one end of the card and &quot;points&quot; on the other end. The direction in which you place the card determines from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents scores the points; if you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command. With 25 different Agents, each with its own unique ability, Agents can be turned, killed, extracted and swapped &ndash; making the game ever flexible, variable, unpredictable and a test of forward planning and quick thinking. As you learn about each Agent's special abilities, discover how Agents work together or against each other, and weigh up the advantages of collecting points for yourself versus using the commands to further your goals and sabotage your opponent's strategies, the game becomes increasingly complex, dynamic and challenging.&#10;&#10;Missions, played alongside Factions of Agents, provide interesting, strategic conditions which, if fulfilled, score you big points &ndash; but if you race ahead, you'll also become a target for attack. The better you're doing, the more under fire you'll be.&#10;&#10;",

The two wild cards are identical and can be played in place of any other specific single card.

The remaining cards form a draw deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn you can add 1-4 cards connected to the grid established by the starter card. All cards must be placed in the same line. A line consists of 2, 3 or 4 cards in a row in which each individual property (color, shape and number) is either the same on each card or different on each card. You can also choose to pass and place some, none or all of your cards on the bottom of the draw pile and take new ones.&#10;&#10;Maximum line length is four cards. Cards needn't be placed right next to each other as long as they are in the same line, and some spaces on the grid will be impossible to fill.&#10;&#10;To score a turn, add up the face values of cards in lines either created or extended on that turn. If any of those cards are part of two lines, they're counted twice. If on a turn a player completes a line that is four cards long, all points for the entire turn are doubled. Double again for any additional four card lines created. Double again if you play all four cards on a single turn. A four-card line is called a lot.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw pile is depleted and one player plays his last card. Double points for that turn. The game is over. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Build sky scrapers and develop transport in the city that never sleeps.&#10;&#10;A game of New York City is played over 5 game rounds. First, players each draw 3 cards from the deck.  Then deal out cards in sets of two cards equal to two times the number of players plus one additional. In turn order, players draft a pair of cards until they have a total of 7 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Next comes the bidding round, where in turn order players will play cards to bid to determine the strength of their action, with the player who bids the highest getting a bonus. In order, the actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Press: Advance on the Press track to determine player and tie-breaking order. &#10;     Money: Receive money to be used for special actions. &#10;     Characters: Take a character with a special ability or scoring up to the value of cards played. &#10;     Building plans: Take a number of skyscrapers from the general supply.&#10;     Prestige: Receive points equal to your bidding value. I addition, the first and second place bidder gets to increase the value of a borough. &#10;     Skyscrapers: Players place skyscrapers from their board into borough currently being visited by the mayor. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played over five rounds (there are six boroughs, one is randomly not visited each game). Each game, the value of boroughs is randomly assigned, and the player with the most skyscrapers in a a borough receives full value, and the next player receiving half, and so on. There is also a bonus for building in every borough. Points are also awarded for certain characters, and the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Based on Rialto, a previously designed game by Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;",

The police quickly take a suspect into custody and try to solve the murder case for a long time - in vain. In order to exonerate her arrested husband, the suspect's wife hires you to solve the case. Will you succeed in connecting the complicated events in Westerfelde and keeping a clear mind?&#10;&#10;One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the murderer, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.&#10;&#10;As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.&#10;You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.&#10;&#10;Languages&#10;This game is available in:&#10;German: Gr&uuml;nes Gift&#10;British: Green Poison&#10;French: La mort en vert (coming soon)&#10;Italian: Veleno verde (coming soon)&#10;Spain: Una soluci&oacute;n venenosa (coming soon)&#10;&#10;",

You combine two of these half puzzle pieces to craft your own dominoes. This mechanism is meant to provide more variability and randomization in each play.&#10;&#10;Instead of building your landscape around a central castle, you start from the river and expand away from it.

Become a character from 1001 Arabian Nights and build graceful minarets, dazzling gates and soaring cupolas to draw the eye of the sultan and carve your name in history. Players will carefully select the best building tiles to erect the most impressive structures, scoring points for following patterns and fulfilling secret objectives. Earn sapphires, and use them to secure the services of the mighty Djinn, whose aid will be invaluable in your quest to create the most stunning palace the city has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;Players start out with a board, with a &quot;triangle&quot; of 3-tiles worth built, and have to expand that out to make the best (most VP-earning) palace. There are separate stacks of tiles for each layer of the palace, color coded (blue, red, green, and sky). Besides the color-coded levels, there are attributes that have to match up, like doorways and columns.&#10;&#10;To get tiles, players reveal tiles from one pile and display them in front of the pile (up to 3 can be showing - the top of the pile is face up but can't be taken) and then choose a tile from any of the available tiles in any color. You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.&#10;&#10;Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can't make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.&#10;&#10;Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile. The player that scores the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: Classic can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this thinly-themed game, players seek to uncover the three spies who have their identities hidden.  There are twenty-seven possible suspects, represented by twenty-seven lettered cards (with the umlauted O).  Three of the cards are removed, as they are the spies.  The remainder are dealt out to the players.  Then players take turns 'asking' each other for information by playing a card with three letters in front of the informant.  He must then look at his cards and place either zero, one, two, or three chips on the card, depending on how many of those letters are part of his secret collection.  The first player to correctly identify the three missing spies (letters) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An explosion of creativity and violence erupted in the Aegean Basin in 800 B.C. that defined ancient Greece. This combination of science, mythology, development, and war was led by powerful city-states like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Troy, Byzantium, Corcyra, and Thebes. These states vied for control over their rivals and dominated the lesser states around them. In time, some of them became so well known that they are remembered even today.&#10;&#10;Hellenica: Story of Greece is a 3.5X civilization game in which you harness the powers of one of seven beginning city-states to dominate the world around you. Your goal is to become the preeminent symbol of Greece for all posterity by completing a combination of secret and public goals. Will you be remembered as a warmonger or a peaceful philosopher? Great priest or apostate? Will you develop a devotion to the gods or focus on the advancement of your people?&#10;&#10;Can you guide your civilization during these turbulent times? Will your vision of Hellenic civilization be remembered for all time, or will you merely be a stepping stone for another&hellip;?&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with an individual board that indicates the Rebel cell they are leading: Intelligence, Leadership, Support or Tactical. The player boards depict the Base of Operations &mdash; Tatooine, Alderaan, Yavin 4, or Lothal &mdash; and team leader (starting character asset) for each player: Captain Cassian Andor, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Hera Syndulla.&#10;&#10;Players must coordinate efforts to recruit iconic characters, such as C-3PO, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Admiral Raddus and Han Solo, and organize their cells to thwart the Empire's rise to galactic domination.&#10;&#10;The main game board features a custom-sculpted 3D Darth Vader bust that commands the Imperial operatives and actions with orders to wipe out the Rebels and to make the Death Star operational. Meanwhile, in a race against time, players must be one with the Force as they direct their Rebel efforts across different locations in the galaxy, including Scarif, Eadu and Jedha. To restore freedom to the galaxy, the Rebels must defeat enough sinister agents before the Empire can either complete construction of the lethal space station or eliminate too many Rebel assets.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: Dark Side Rising will be available only in European, Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) regions due to licensing restrictions.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: Dark Side Rising is designed for two to four players ages 10 and up with an estimated runtime of 45 minutes. The cooperative game includes:&#10;&#10;1 custom-sculpted Darth Vader bust &#10;1 Death Star board with 6 components&#10;51 asset cards&#10;4 Base of Operations / Rebel cell player boards&#10;17 custom-sculpted dice&#10;Mission and Alliance tokens&#10;Damage and Operation counters&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's early on July 1st, 1863, and Union Brigadier General John Buford&rsquo;s 1st Reserve Cavalry Division is deployed to the west of the town of Gettysburg battling unidentified Confederate infantry advancing on the town.  All morning long, the men in gray have pressured the Union cavalry. Help finally arrives in the form of I Corps commander Major Gen. John Reynolds. He rides up to the Lutheran Seminary, where Buford is directing the battle from its cupola. Reynolds calls to Buford, &quot;What goes, John?&quot; The cavalryman simply points to the long lines of advancing Confederates and says, &quot;The Devil's to pay!&quot; Reynolds then asks, &quot;Can you hold?&quot;, to which Buford responds, &quot;I reckon I can.&quot; Reynolds ends the exchange with, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride out and see all about it.&quot; And with that rather brief, mundane conversation began one of the most important and iconic military engagements in history &ndash; the Battle of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;A Most Fearful Sacrifice is an epic two-player wargame with over 15 square feet of playing area and 526 playing pieces depicting the fighting that occurred during all three days of this decisive clash. The game utilizes a new ACW operating system called the Black Swan system, which is closely related to the popular Blind Swords game system first introduced in the game The Devil&rsquo;s To Pay! by Tiny Battle Publishing. This version of the system is specifically designed to handle larger-scale battles yet keep rules overhead low. Players can simulate huge encounters in a reasonable amount of playing time. This is accomplished in one way through the use of card draws rather than chit pulls. Also, players will trigger activations by Corps instead of by lower-level formations but they still have tactical decision-making choices by needing to determine which Divisions get activation priority. Though at a grander scale, this system maintains a tactical feel about it and still emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of war &hellip; the Fortunes of War, the Friction of War and the Fog of War. Players will be challenged to deal with a constantly developing battle situation, never quite sure of what the Gods of War will throw at them, and thus they must always be prepared to deal with historically realistic &ldquo;black swan&rdquo; events.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Food and artifacts are kept face down, but weapons and mammoths are kept face up. Whoever hunts down the biggest mammoth in the summer phase will start the winter phase.&#10;&#10;Players also have to visit the four winter camps during the summer to store supplies for the upcoming winter. If a player is not able to visit all four camps during summer, he will have fewer hunters in the winter phase.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of different tiles:&#10;- Food tiles score 1 to 3 points at the end of the game, depending on the type of food.&#10;- Rare and valuable artifact tiles increase in value depending on the number of identical tiles you collected.&#10;- Weapons are used to hunt down mighty mammoths.&#10;- Path-tiles remain on the board and guarantee a minimum amount of maneuverability.&#10;- Caves are connected with each other and may be used to cover big distances while moving.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the same prototype as Zombiegeddon.&#10;&#10;",

Racers can choose between single races lasting 10-15 minutes or the Championship mode, which offers unique rulesets changing from race-to-race before a winner is named.&#10;&#10;Wacky Races: The Board Game will be released in both a regular and a deluxe edition, with the deluxe edition including pre-painted miniatures, while the regular edition will have one-color miniatures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you will go through one of these dungeons. Each player also has a character card that shows some amount of life (red) and mana (blue) along with a special power.&#10;&#10;What's actually in a dungeon is determined by dice that you roll at the start of the round. You roll sixteen dice, then let them settle in a 4x4 grid. The dice show red and blue monsters in both small and large sizes, as well as blue potions and red strength. You decide where to enter the dice dungeon and which dice to pass through in a continuous line that can change directions only orthogonally, and you draw this corresponding line on your personal grid until you exit at some other point of the dungeon without crossing over your line. You then claim the lowest available number card, with the number of cards matching the number of players.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has finished drawing a line through the dungeon, you trace out that path step by step, removing life (1 or 2) to defeat red monsters (small or large) and mana (1 or 2) to defeat blue monsters (small or large). You place new tokens on your character as you pass through potions and strength spaces. Once you're through the grid, you score points for the monsters you defeated, and you choose one of four quests on your sheet for bonus points. (In the second round, you choose one of the three remaining quests, so your choices diminish over time.) In player order based on your number card, you take one of the available treasures, which provide points and powers. Your life and mana levels carry over into the next round.&#10;&#10;In the second and third rounds, you replace one of the dice with a labyrinth die that can be passed through only in certain directions, and in the fourth round another die is replaced with the big boss die, giving you something giant to take on before ending the game and tallying your final score.&#10;&#10;",

Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the &quot;Grand Scenario&quot; that covers historical trends throughout the period.&#10;&#10;Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.&#10;&#10;Each player may attempt to perform up to five &quot;Endeavors&quot; per 25-year long Turn.&#10;&#10;There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &quot;Year Cards&quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.&#10;&#10;An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.&#10;&#10;Optional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.&#10;&#10;The Sword And The Stars is a galactic empire game based on the Empires Of The Middle Age game system.&#10;&#10;",

Roll steel balls down your slide in order to knock the wooden ball in the central arena into your opponents' goal. Players compete in teams of two, with each team trying to protect one goal between them. (If you play individually, you will likely need to alternate between slides as it's difficult to roll balls down both slides at once.)&#10;&#10;If you run out of steel balls, then you're at the opponents' mercy until they shoot, which will likely land a steel ball on your side of the board. If you knock the wooden ball into the opponents' goal, you score a point, then the next round begins with the steel balls remaining on the half of the board where they're currently located. The first team to score five points wins!&#10;&#10;BONK features the same gameplay as Rollet but the games have important differences that affect play (and their prices):&#10;&#10;&#10;    The BONK game board is smaller, so gameplay tends to be faster.&#10;    The BONK game board is made from a single piece of curved wood whereas Rollet is made from two; this difference affects the curve of the game board and therefore the movement of the balls.&#10;    The slides in BONK are plastic whereas Rollet uses wooden slides.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players try to collect points in four different suits, but along the way points can be made negative instead of positive or even canceled entirely by taking one of the 'Nicht die Bohne' cards.  With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.  A note to the wise: although this game shares a common theme of beans (Bohnen) with Bohnanza, that's about the only similarity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fool's Gold takes place during the gold rush of 1849. Players are investors who send prospectors on a quest to find gold at various locations &mdash; in the mountains, in a forest, at a river, etc. &mdash; with each location having perils, gems, quantities of gold and bountiful supplies of silt. As players remove valuable gold cards from the location decks, silt becomes more prominent and gold harder to find.&#10;&#10;Each player starts Fool's Gold with six coins and 2-4 prospectors, depending on the number of players. The game lasts five years (i.e., rounds), and at the start of each year, each player receives an additional coin and an additional prospector, giving you both more to spend and more on which to spend. Each year consists of two phases: the prospecting phase and the mining phase. During the prospecting phase, the start player rolls ten dice, then places the dice on the mines of the same number, with 6s being placed in the central camp. Each mine has a path to it starting with the numbered die, then spaces numbered 0-6. After placing dice on the mine paths, players take turns taking one of these actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a prospector on a mine path, paying the cost of the space you cover; whenever you pay coins, place them in front of your player screen.&#10;    Place a wild die on a mine path, paying 1 for each die already on the path.&#10;    Place a prospector in front of your screen to take back three coins.&#10;    Pass, place all of your remaining prospectors in reserve next to any mine or mines of your choice, then take back all coins and prospectors in front of your screen.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has passed, the mining phase begins. Starting at mine #1, shuffle the mine deck, then draw a number of cards equal to the product of the number of prospectors and the number of dice at the mine. Foul weather forces fewer cards to be drawn, while false alarms might result in treasure being snatched away from everyone. Players then choose rewards from the mine in order of priority, which is determined by the number of prospectors each player has at a mine (include those in reserve) and their location on the path; players must redetermine priority after each action at a mine. The player actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a gold card from the mine.&#10;    Take a gem card from the mine, but only if you don't already have this gem.&#10;    Take two coins from the bank, which gives you additional funds for the rest of the game.&#10;    Lay down your prospector (removing it from priority) and wait for winter.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once all standing miners have been removed, roll the winter die and draw that many cards for winter. If any goods come up, those layabout prospectors finally get to profit; if not, tough cookies, sourdough! After five rounds, players compare their findings, losing points if they've failed to collect gold from each mine. In addition, each player must throw out all the gold from the mine where he found the most. Turns out it was so easy to find because it was fool's gold! Players then sum their nuggets and score 1-15 points for their gem collection. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Both sides have a variety of star-ships and ground forces to choose from, and the game is notable for how the two sides are asymmetrical: their forces aren't identical and their economies work differently.&#10;&#10;Movement takes place via 'jumps' from one star to the next, and conflict is resolved at these 'points'. There are two types of star-ship weaponry, short-range beam factors, and chiefly long-range missile factors also used for planetary bombardment.&#10;&#10;",

A good combination of tile placement and card management can result in very impactful turns, where several cards are completed and the city expands. Interaction between players is important, because all players are building on the same board and can take advantage of what other players have built on their previous turns.&#10;&#10;You will try to build the most harmonious city possible, because that will be vital for your score: in the end of the game you will score normally the regions where you have your two highest scores but you will triple the score of your lowest scoring region.

On a turn, the active player rolls two dice &mdash; a colored d6 and a numbered d4 &mdash; then optionally rolls both dice again. The two dice determine which specific quadromino &mdash; that is, which colored shape and in which orientation &mdash; all players must &quot;drop&quot; into their grid. To represent this, you draw an outline of the block at the bottom of your sheet as if you had dropped it in from the top, then X out the spaces covered by the quadromino.&#10;&#10;If you cover a circle on the grid that's the same color as the quadromino just placed there, you collect two energy points. By spending one energy point on a turn, you can possibly &quot;rotate&quot; the quadromino to be placed depending on what dice were rolled; by spending five energy points, you can place exactly the quadromino you want, ignoring the result of the dice. As you collect energy, you might cover an X on the energy chart; if you do, you track these Xs on a separate &quot;extra point&quot; bar, with the points escalating for each X you collect. If you complete 2-4 lines through the placement of a single quadromino, you collect an additional 1-4 Xs for this extra point bar.&#10;&#10;Each player has three bombs they can spend to blow up a block instead of placing it, but by doing so you give up endgame points.&#10;&#10;As soon as you can no longer place a quadromino in your grid, your game is over. Once everyone has filled their grid to the top, tally your points. In addition to the extra points bar and any bombs unused, you score 1-5 points for each horizontal line that contains 8-10 Xs, with these line points doubling, or even quadrupling, as you go higher in the grid. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&quot;Brikks&quot; also contains rules for a duel mode and a solitaire mode.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Compass games website:)&#10;&#10;In November 1700, King Carlos II of Spain died without an heir. The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two-player Card-Driven wargame that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.&#10;&#10;The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.&#10;&#10;The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;&quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two player Card-Driven wargame depicting the &quot;War of the Spanish Succession&quot;. The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance. One player represents the interests of the French claimant, Philip V (the Bourbons), while the other player represents the interests of the Austrian claimant, Charles III (the Alliance).&#10;&#10;Each turn is one year. Each unit represents approximately 10,000 men of all arms. Leader counters represent the named personality and his staff.&#10;&#10;24 pages of rulebook including extended example of play and designer's notes.&#10;&#10;",

In others, the Renaissance produces a plutocracy, which leads to a utopia &mdash; or perhaps to anarchy; it's all in the subtle details. As a time-traveler, you've seen it all, and it all has its place. What's important is who's in control in the long run when time travel is invented. With other time-travelers mucking with things for their own reasons, your course is clear: you will tamper with history as much as is needed, stepping on however many butterflies it takes, to get a perfect world under your own benign rule.&#10;&#10;In Temporum, the board shows the possible paths history can take and the actual path it currently takes. On your turn, you can change history, travel through time, and visit a point in history. You draw cards, play some of them for money and abilities, and score some of them to advance your power through history. Having more power in a time period gives you abilities, but your goal is to have all of your power in the last time period, the time from which you come.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a medieval monk, you are charged with increasing the prestige of the abbey's collection of historical and sacred texts. By acquiring the resources for manuscript illustration and reproduction, your abbey produces and sells its valuable works, thereby bringing in finances necessary for maintaining a fine abbey. Will you succeed in making your abbey the most prestigious of all?&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice is a revision of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game, which is itself a dice version of Biblios (originally called Scripts and Scribes).&#10;&#10;The object is to acquire gold and to collect resources &ndash; scrolls, manuscripts, pigments, quills, ink &ndash; to exchange for gold. It follows the same basic theme as Biblios, but with interesting changes due to the use of dice. As in Scripts and Scribes, players compete in five different categories, and the values of the categories change during the game. In addition, depending upon the dice roll, there may be many or few auctions during the game in which players auction their resources for gold or auction gold for resources.&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice differs from its earlier version Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game in a few important ways. Regarding the production and components, Biblios Dice has much nicer artwork, the game board has been divided into separate boards, and the resource dice are etched. Regarding the rules, Biblios Dice has a few important changes.  The goal of the game is now to collect the most VPs, rather than gold. There is only one type of auction in this game, and the first and second place winners of the auction get dice (not winner take all). The auctions also do not happen as randomly, but can be predicted based upon the progress of the mule on the market board.&#10;&#10;",

Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko: MAGNACI, presents the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from its heyday during the Union of Lublin (XVI century) until the collapse of the state (XVIII century). Players take on the roles of the magnates, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Polish and Lithuanian Union.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.&#10;&#10;During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic. The fate of the country results from the sum of the activities of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players fall into a mutual fight for titles and advantages, the Republic will fall under the pressure of neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;This game for 2-5 players with a game time not exceeding 90 minutes reimplements Martin Wallace's Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko from 2010, using the same principal title in Polish edition under an agreement with the author.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game box:&#10;&#10;The MAGNATES: A Game of Power is a strategic board game for 2-5 players which is fast and full of historical atmosphere and rich interactions. It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130;, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family. Some of these characters are outstanding people, capable of great deeds. But there are also less useful people, able to spoil any undertaking entrusted them... unless, thanks to the player's decisions, even those lesser ones will do much for the family.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will manage their deck of characters so that, in competition with others, they can achieve as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Commonwealth. Players will clash during the creation of the state's internal policy, as well as in response to external threats and opportunities arising from the international situation. And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?&#10;&#10;Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sixth Fleet is a simulation game of near-future combat for control of the Mediterranean Basin.  As commander of the U.S. or Soviet fleet and respective allies, you must form your ships into Task Forces  and attempt to cripple the enemy&rsquo;s capital ships and submarines.  Your limited air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions.  Commando, parachute and amphibious assault units stand at the ready to capture vital objectives.  Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&#10;About 14 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenarios).&#10;&#10;Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.&#10;&#10;",

By July of 1941, the German Army stood at the very door of Moscow.  The Soviet forces before them had been routed and the path to yet another great victory for the Wehrmacht was seemingly undefended.  But it was here that the Russian Army successfully rallied.  For the first time in this terrible war, the Germans faced an enemy that was implacable and resolute.  With victory so close, and with Germany closer to world domination than they would ever be before or since &ndash; the Russian line held &ndash; it was A Victory Denied.&#10;&#10;Building on the enormous critical success of A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943, A Victory Denied is a wargame that offers the same elegant simplicity of A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943 but also covers the unique aspects of this great battle.  While the system remains the same, upgraded supply rules and command structure rules will be added to model how important these problems were in this battle &ndash; and air power and Stalin&rsquo;s Organs will make their first appearance in the system.  But what made A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943 so special will still be in full force &ndash; easy rules, unpredictable chit pulls, wild game play, and the ability to play the game almost right out of the box.&#10;&#10;International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 7 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 Km&#10;Units: Division &amp; Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page rules booklet&#10;Two Palyer Aid Cards (2-sided)&#10;Two dice (One 10-sided &amp; One 6-sided)&#10;&#10;Solitaire rating: Excellent&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;Playing time: 4 hours&#10;Scenarios: 1&#10;&#10;",

The player pieces and resource cards fit into drawers on the side of the game board, which folds into a trapezoid.&#10;&#10;Catan: Traveler &ndash; Compact Edition includes a two-player variant using cards that allow one player to force a &quot;trade&quot; with the other.

One player controls the Western Allies and the other the Soviet Union in their joint effort to destroy the Axis. Though the two players share the goal of defeating the Reich, each seeks a victory that favors their dominance in post-war Europe. To this end, each player controls two factions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Western player commands the Western Allies faction and the OKH faction, that is the German and minor Axis armies battling the Soviet Union in the east (Oberkommando des Heeres).&#10;     The Soviet player commands the Soviet faction and the OKW faction, that is the German and Italian armies facing the Western allies in the west (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht).&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay is driven by Downfall&rsquo;s innovative initiative track. The faction with the initiative chooses an order, pays its initiative cost by advancing their marker along the track, and performs the order. Then, the faction with the initiative (based on the updated positions of the markers) chooses the next order. There is no set sequence of play; initiative expenditures determine who goes next. The progress of faction markers along the track also trigger strategic events, changes in weather, and advancement of game turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood and Bridges is a complete stand-alone World at War module that depicts the struggle for control of the bridges in the Rhine River Valley. Fresh Guards units are spearheading the assault into Western Europe, bending defending NATO forces to their breaking point. It is up to forces of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), to stop the Soviet advance which, if successful could ultimately threaten Britain itself.&#10;This stand-alone expansion to the Award Winning World at War: Eisenbach Gap System, contains everything you need to play right out of the box. A new, fully updated and expanded rulebook covers the entire original World at War rules and adds new rules to expand the on-map action. Included are regulations for bridging units like Soviet MTU-55, improved positions and air power, which was a special scenario rule in Death of the First Panzer (An earlier add-on covering West German forces with an 11x17 map, 40 new scuff-resistant counters, and 6 new scenarios). Now the NATO forces will have improved positions to help them cope with the Soviet onslaught. Air power becomes an official game element, with rules and counters representing American A-10's, Soviet SU-25's, and British Tornado's. Birds that can deal out a massive amount of destruction on the battlefield, and look sexy doing it. At least as sexy as a cardboard chit can look. Also, expanded artillery rules, introduce Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), and electronic warfare.&#10;In addition a new table brings battlefield chaos effects to the game. War never goes as planned and great leaders must deal with adversity when it happens. So we thought, 'Let's shake things up a bit&quot;. In games with this option, if you draw the &quot;battlefield chaos&quot; counter, a roll is made to see what the gods of war have hefted upon you, your enemy, or both of you. Anything from bad weather, extra support missions, shell-shocked troops, or skillful battle plans, can come your way.&#10;&#10;The war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong with top-of-the-line Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more. There is only one mission here. Hold the bridges or see Soviet armor on Channel coast. Are you up to the task?&#10;&#10;World at War: Blood and Bridges is the latest complete game in the World at War series. It features 352 counters (we just added an extra half sheet of admin counter goodness), a mounted 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 12 scenarios, two player-aid cards, dice, and a complete rules set.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Who Goes There? is a cooperative game of growing paranoia. At the beginning of the game, all players are human and there is no reason not to trust each other completely, but as the temperature drops and mistakes are made, players start doubting everything and everyone around them.&#10;&#10;You must build, trade, and upgrade to prepare yourself for the Antarctic Terrain, rabid dog attacks, crazed madmen...and most importantly, the alien entity that is now loose in the camp. Everything you build and upgrade has one purpose...keeping you alive and human! During the entire game, you will want to trade with other players and help each other build stronger weapons and better equipment, while also passing food and med kits around. Although, make sure your trust them, since trade is a huge opportunity for The Thing.&#10;&#10;Staying inside may keep you from freezing to Death, but it won't help you or your fellow humans win. The only way to secure victory is by venturing out of the camp! The problem with that is, being away from camp is the number one way to come across The Thing...leaving you vulnerable and exposed to infection. Whether fixing the boiler, repairing the door, or fighting the frigid temperatures outside, you will all need one another to survive. But trust is a hard thing to come by when you must be wary of...Who Goes There?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Changes in Second Edition:&#10;&#10;     A new Frostbite mechanic to help mitigate early player elimination.&#10;     Everyone now has access to keys in the storage deck or specialty decks that can help bypass a locked camp door.&#10;     Some of the duplicate events got revamped or replaced with new scenarios. (there's even a new event class, Dubbed &ldquo;Caution Events,&rdquo; that occur at the end of the round.)&#10;     Added a buildable host test to the storage deck. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A war game that fits in the pocket!&#10;&#10;When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!&#10;&#10;Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.&#10;&#10;Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.&#10;&#10;Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.&#10;&#10;Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs is the second game in the series of &quot;Pocket Battles&quot;, after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.&#10;&#10;The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).&#10;&#10;On your turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on your unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.&#10;&#10;When one army has eliminated half of the other's original deployment value, that battle round concludes the game, and the player who has defeated the greatest total point-value of opposing units is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.&#10;&#10;After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:&#10;&#10;Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.&#10;&#10;Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.&#10;&#10;Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.&#10;&#10;Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.&#10;&#10;Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 series rulebook&#10;1 playbook&#10;3 countersheets&#10;2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)&#10;1 die&#10;Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

    "Description": "&quot;Gold, Gold, Gold &ndash; A Ton of Gold&quot; &ndash; this was the Seattle headline heard 'round the world announcing the discovery of great stores of gold in the Klondike. This was the beginning of an exodus of would-be prospectors dreaming of a better life, a chance to escape the toil caused by the financial recessions and bank failures of the 1890s. Gold rush hysteria was pulsing through the veins of the country and tens of thousands were willing to risk it all for the chance to have it all.&#10;&#10;Lost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North and about the grueling journey that these would-be prospectors undertook, traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads through severe weather and  with ever-dwindling resources.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, players must explore an ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber, or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner. As you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you'll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness.&#10;&#10;In addition to expanding the player count to 2-6 (from 3-4) and shortening the playing time, the second edition of Lost Valley rebalances the gold nugget distribution; provides a third path to victory; and (thanks to the included expansion modules) allows players to build canals, learn new abilities, and stake claims on gold mines.&#10;&#10;Join the Stampede&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Why would someone attack a policeman? It's one of many questions you've been obsessing about since you received this ransom demand following your daughter's kidnapping.&#10;&#10;As you begin walking toward the front door of a manor house deep in the woods in Captive, your hand cramping above your weapon, your spirit satiated with fear, you anticipate that things will turn out badly. Your intuition will not betray you &mdash; even if you were far from imagining what was actually in reserve for you on the most horrifying evening of your entire existence.&#10;&#10;Captive is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is an operational level simulation of the greatest airborne campaign of World War II. In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.&#10;&#10;Information from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Two 20&quot; x 28&quot; maps - connected by their short edges to create a long, thin map area&#10;Two countersheets - 520 half-inch counters&#10;1300 meters/hex&#10;Three (3) turns/day&#10;&#10;Complexity - high.&#10;Solitaire suitability - medium.&#10;Number of players - (1 or) 2 players (also recommended for team play)&#10;Playing time - from 5 hours for a short scenario to 25 hours for a complete campaign&#10;&#10;",

Players are forced to make difficult trade-offs between expending resources in the Political Phase vs the Action Phase and attempting to influence one faction at the expense of others. Players utilize a shared deck of 66 Political Cards.&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, players use Action Cards to conduct operations (activating a space for combat or movement), take replacements, place reinforcements, make strategic moves, seize initiative in combat, gain diplomatic traction with the factions or implement special operations. Leaders have these capabilities including exploitation, reinforcing battles, withdrawing, counter-attacking and conducting multi-space attacks. Players are forced to make difficult decisions thwarting threats and capitalizing on opportunities. Each player has their own deck of 55 Action Cards. Additionally, a deck of 44 Leader Cards (for a combined total of 220 ToC Cards) provide historical details regarding the various personalities in the game.&#10;&#10;During the Logistics Phase, players rebuild/repair units, determine if various factions withdraw from the combat, check for the effect of In-Fighting within the RED and WHITE camps, check for attrition, purchase political influence, buy leaders and check for victory.&#10;&#10;",

Both of these feelings come together in D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, with players reacting to cards as they pass to grab repeated objects.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the 36 object tiles are spread out around the deck of cards. These objects are each pictured on cards in the deck exactly twice. The cards in the deck are revealed one by one, and if you think that an object on a card has appeared previously, then you can grab the corresponding object tile and place it in front of you. Are you sure of what you saw? You better hope so because if a newly revealed card matches an object tile lying in front of you &mdash; and an opponent spots that tile in time and identifies your false memory &mdash; then you're out of the rest of the round.&#10;&#10;Once you finish going through the deck, players score points for the items they collected. A total of three rounds are played, and with each subsequent round players might find it harder to remember exactly what they've seen. Was the object shown before, or am I thinking of the previous round? Whoever collects the most points after three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",
