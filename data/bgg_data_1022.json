    "Description": "Company of Iron is a squad-based skirmish game that reinvents WARMACHINE and HORDES battles as smaller confrontations between fewer warriors and their character leaders. Average games are played with 10&ndash;15 miniatures, and Company of Iron is compatible with the majority of the existing miniatures in the WARMACHINE and HORDES product lines. The rules for Company of Iron have been streamlined and do not include warcasters or warlocks but can include light warjacks and light warbeasts.&#10;&#10;The Company of Iron box set is designed for two players and will contain two 20-point armies, including a unit of Cygnar Stormblades and a unit of Minion Farrow Brigands. Additionally, two all-new character solos will be included to lead their respective units: Lieutenant Gwen Keller and Agata, Queen of Carnage. These new models can be used in both Company of Iron and in WARMACHINE and HORDES. All components needed to play the game are in the box set, including rules, tokens, and two types of cards that allow players to choose specialties for their squad leaders as well as battle plans that can provide powerful effects and advantages in combat.&#10;&#10;Company of Iron uses the core rules of WARMACHINE and HORDES but has been tailored for the scale of the game and the absence of warcasters and warlocks. Emphasizing its fast-paced skirmish scale and the focus on small squads and solos, gameplay revolves around players taking turns activating one model at a time as opposed to the alternating activation in WARMACHINE and HORDES, in which players activate their entire army during a single turn.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We have designed Company of Iron as an ideal entry point for new players who want to play in the world of WARMACHINE and HORDES,&rdquo; said Chief Creative Officer Matt Wilson. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also a product the existing WARMACHINE and HORDES community has been requesting for years, and it scratches that itch for players craving a fast-paced tactical experience that can be played with a shorter time commitment.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Fake News or Not? is a game about phony funny stories and ludicrous true tales!  Life writes the craziest stories, but what can we believe and what is just a pack of lies?&#10;&#10;One player (the News Anchor for that round) reads a News Card to the other players.  Each News Card contains the first part of a news story and 4 possible conclusions to the story.  One conclusion is correct and the true (Real News) answer, but the others are made-up (Fake News) falsehoods.  The News Anchor reads the Real News answer and picks one Fake News answer to read.  The other players then vote on which they believe to be the Real News.  Each player who votes for the Real News answer receives 1 point.  A different player takes on the role of the News Anchor each round.  The game ends after each player has had two turns as the News Anchor and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Honour is everything! Tribal provides players with a game set in a pre-gunpowder tribal/clan setting. The rules  offer some new and exciting approaches to wargaming.&#10;&#10;In the book you get: the basic rules; optional rules for missile fire, dirty tricks and honour pools; four scenarios you can play in a variety of tribal settings; in-depth explanation of culture, weapons and combat for Maori, Vikings, Aztecs &amp; Gladiators; extra rules for Stone-Age, Heian Japanese &amp; Iroquois.&#10;&#10;Honour is used to drive the narrative of the game. Players are rewarded in honour for the things that they do in the battle. Honour determines who wins Tribal rather than the normal determinants of wargames (killing enemy/taking ground). In turn, honour is a dynamic part of the game - it can be won and lost during combat, the deeds of combatants can win or lose honour, players can spend honour to do 'dirty tricks' to win combats etc.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a normal deck of cards. Cards determine movement, unit activation and - most importantly - combat. While cards still have the randomness of the draw from the deck, players can actually be involved in the combat through playing/holding particular cards. Attacking, defending, waiting for an opening, bluffing the opponent - these are all strategies the player can use in a round of Tribal combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you play strategically and negotiate successfully with fellow players, or Growers, you can increase your odds of doing well at the Farmer's Market, which dictates crop values and market pricing.  &#10;     Game-play consists of turn-based die rolls, accompanied by trading between turns.  Multiple events may occur on die rolls, allowing for a nonlinear and more engaging style of play.  Players, or Growers, must adapt on the fly to ever-changing in-game conditions.  A Grower may only score an OOF-DAH! if they grow the right crops on the right cover crops, and if they harvest the correct crops according to the ideal growing season.&#10;     Additional scoring opportunities are facilitated by novel features such as Crop Combos, Crop Cartels, Undercutting, and targeted Guard Token protections.  Only the savviest Growers with the keenest sense of what's hot and what's not in the Market, will meet all challenges, earning the right to say, &quot;OOF-DAH!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Many, but not all ID cards say they are &ldquo;Unique&rdquo;, and therefore only one ID card with that set symbol and collector number can be added to your force. When adding an ID card to your starting force, you must also add an associated ID character to your Sideline. [ID cards have a cost of 5.]&#10;&#10;Here is the text of ID cards:&#10;Inspiration: &ldquo;A specific effect that varies from ID card to ID card.&rdquo;&#10;Setup &ndash; At the beginning of the game, choose a character on your sideline with a name or real name matching this ID Card and turn it to a starting line. This character is called an ID Character. You can&rsquo;t have more ID characters on your force than you have characters placed on the map at the beginning of the game. (If the card is Unique, it will say so here.)&#10;Call in Help &ndash; At the beginning of your turn, you may activate one ID Card per force. To activate an ID Card, choose a friendly character that has no action tokens and is equal to or more points than the ID Character's starting line. Give the chosen character a power action, place the ID Character adjacent to it, and then remove this ID Card from the game and your opponent scores it. The ID characters can&rsquo;t be carried, given double power actions, replaced, or assigned resources. The ID character returns to your sideline immediately: (a) at the beginning of your next turn, (b) if it's not within 5 squares of the chosen character, or (c) if it is removed from the map by another game effect.&#10;Inspire &ndash; When a character friendly to an ID Character is in an adjacent square, they can use that ID Character's Inspiration.&#10;&#10;",

As the realms recover, the Gods that once fought together now vie against each other to claim the empty throne.&#10;&#10;As a player in the game, choose to be one of several Gods from different clans, each with unique powers and abilities. Players direct their tribe to build, battle monsters, and explore new territories. As a God, players can choose to be Benevolent, focusing on building their tribe or giving gifts to other tribes, or Malevolent, striking down the resources and Heroes of their own or that of other tribes.&#10;&#10;The game combines elements of 4x with a deck building mechanic. Each game play is designed to be unique, with multiple characters, a modular map, and several actions for each player to choose from each turn. The race to claim the throne is won by the first player to achieve 12 Victory Points. You can choose to expand your tribes through villages and shrines, build a magnificent temple and collect tributes, go the battle route and fight monsters, take a balanced approach or more.&#10;&#10;Deities Domination is a versatile game, designed to maximize replayability. While players may have temporary setbacks, no one is eliminated from the game, and the structure of the game allows for recovery from asymmetric distribution of power, giving players the ability to recoup from disadvantageous situations. The combination of new map layouts, Gods&rsquo; abilities, and multiple paths to victory creates an inimitable experience each game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As well as a host of new companies to fight or, bring on, the darkness that threatens to engulf the Old World.&#10;&#10;You will meet old enemies such as Vlad Tepes, Prince of Wallachia, and his nemesis Abraham van Helsing. Play the brave men of the Imperial Nightwatch as they test their modern might against the terrifying vampire minions of the immortal Countess Bathory. Rouse the Village mob to drive out Baron Viktor von Frankenstein and his abominations. Tread the corridors of power as a member of the Illuminati or, join the Gypsies to hunt Werewolves under the full moon. Witness Sampson Caine and the Nuns of the Order of the Bringer of Salvation defend the innocent from the predations of the Dread Monks of Sucevita. Unleash the Unborn upon the terrible White Slavers. You can also upgrade and test your existing IHMN companies against these many terrors.&#10;&#10;New scenarios and landscapes will take your companies into dark forests, mist shrouded castles, ancient ruins, pagan altars and grim, fortified villages the length and breadth of Transylvania, Wallachia and the ever-forbidding Carpathian Mountains.&#10;&#10;This is classic Victorian Gothic Horror at its grisly, horripilating best. It is not recommended for ladies and gentlemen of a nervous disposition, for the darkness will feed upon their terror.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: Gothic is not a stand alone game, and you will need a copy of In Her Majesty&rsquo;s Name from Osprey publishing in order to play.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most wins at the end of 5 rounds is the victor.&#10;&#10;The biggest feature of this game: the fact that you cannot tell for sure what card (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) you are playing until it&rsquo;s too late. There are a total of 16 numbered cards and while Card #1 and Card #16 are clearly defined as Rock and Paper respectively, it&rsquo;s impossible to say what range is defined as Scissors until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;After five rounds of placing out your cards, you use the two remaining cards left in your hand to figure out what range of cards actually count as &ldquo;Scissors&rdquo; for each individual player &mdash; and therefore how many of the five rounds you actually won.&#10;&#10;A playful game of psychological warfare that combines funnily illustrated cards with serious strategy as you guess what cards your opponent could possibly have left in his or her hand and play your own hand accordingly.&#10;&mdash;user

They are followed by heavily armored warriors, intimidating everyone with a cacophony of metallic sounds made by their chains, net launchers, and other weapons of post apocalyptic war.&#10;&#10;First, the riders are going to surround and entangle you with their web of steel. Melee fighters will follow soon after, bringing pain and destruction. Even if you are going to defend yourself, even if you manage defeat one of them, more replace their fallen comrade.&#10;&#10;Death is coming your way. You can try to run. You can try to hide. But sooner or later, you are going to fall into their hands.

Chain connects two units with that ability if there is a straight line between them, and it allows them to target and hit any unit on that line.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Through the ritual invocations based on their champion&rsquo;s affiliation, a cult will eventually be able to summon their avatar to join their deck. These avatars are not only powerful characters, but the direct path to the Sigils of Ruin.&#10;&#10;Once the avatar has served their purpose on the mortal plane, they can be sacrificed to channel the cult&rsquo;s corresponding sigil. When conjured, these sigils are immovable auras that bestow their cult with unique abilities and victory conditions. Although no two paths are the same, they each demand equal favor from the Dark One.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THE STORY&#10;&#10;Year 2067: global warming is no longer a prophecy but a reality.&#10;The world, as we know it, has changed. Cities, governments, and nationalities got diluted giving way to a single world power, the World Federation. This new order represents few privileged, citizens of former first powers who today live protected from the chaos and misery that invades the planet. The rest of humanity migrates aimlessly on the run from war, hunger, and destruction left behind by climate change.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the new world, driven by state-of-the-art technology, raises its walls seeking isolation from chaos. Set in the form of Smart Cities and defended by machines, the new world order is forced to find a solution to uncover illegal immigrants who manage to cross its borders and disguise among its citizens. Andrana Project, a Nano chip implanted in the nape of its inhabitants is the new identity document. From this moment on, everything involving a person is linked to their nanochip: their identity, bank and medical details, properties, titles... everything.&#10;&#10;Project Andrana is well received by the majority of the population, although many are opposed to its potential risks. In this context, an old ideological movement begins to acquire strength and prominence: The Neoluddites.&#10;&#10;Convinced that technology has a negative impact on people, their communities and the environment, Neoluddites believe that social and ecological collapse condemns most of the world's population to live in misery. Although this ideology has been alive for years, its followers had just passively abandoned technology until the arrival of Project Andrana, after which they started to get organized to act as a group. Neoluddites are dispersed all over the world and they know no frontiers. There are different factions, some more pacifist, and other more radical ones, determined to end the hegemony of the World Federation, which has taken technological evolution to the extreme. In time, some citizens of the World Federation will join this movement, tearing their nanochip off, becoming exiles and preparing to fight the system.&#10; Constant confrontations between the World Federation and the Neoluddites will shape the fate of humanity.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This is the plot of Andrana Project, an independent game that will be able to test your strategic ability, emotional intelligence, teamwork capacity and leadership skills.&#10;&#10;Andrana Project is a phygital social game, this means that it is a group game, played face to face, supported on your smart phone or tablet.&#10;&#10;To play Andrana Project you need a minimum of 4 players with smartphone/tablet and Internet connection. Every player needs to download the game, one of them will start the game and each of them will be assigned a team and a character.&#10;&#10;In Andrana Project there are two opposing teams: the Neoluddites and the World Federation. Players from both teams have to discover their opponents to shut them down. The game has different missions that will get upgraded depending on how much it&rsquo;s played.&#10;&#10;Each player will be assigned a different character from each team, which means also different abilities and power inside the game.&#10;&#10;These are the main powers of each of them (among many others):&#10;&#10;The Neoluddites leader: As the Leader, he can recruit citizens. If he recruits a citizen he/she will become a Neoluddite and will fight for his team.&#10;&#10;Neoluddites Doctor: As a Doctor, she can heal herself or any player she wants, so she can prevent that person of dying.&#10;&#10;Neoluddites Citizen: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo; life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.&#10;&#10;All Neoluddites have to be careful when stealing the access. If they steal the wrong person their identity will be revealed to that player.&#10;&#10;Cybersecurity: As Cybersecurity, they can spy on one player to know his/her identity. They have the module, the Andrana server&rsquo;s access. The Neoluddites want to steal them. The Agent knows who this person is and he will try to protect him.&#10;&#10;DCS Agent: A DCS Agent can arrest other players to disable them in the next round. They are the only one who can recharge their weapon and attack more than once.&#10;They must protect Cybersecurity, being aware of shooting him, if they kill him their team loses the game.&#10;&#10;CITIZEN: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo;s life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.&#10;&#10;Each player needs to hide its identity from the rest, and at the same time observe their opponents to uncover theirs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cypress Legacy: The Board Game is for 2 to 6 players taking place in one of the Cypress Mansions. Players will take on the role of trying to work their way through the massive mansion while trying to achieve their objectives, and prove to be Lorna's true friend. Each player knows of the other players that are within the mansion and views them as someone who is trying to steal what is there. The player to achieve the goals, will be considered the winner and thus the true friend of Lorna. You will have at times, skills that you can earn or possibly steal. You can also acquire assets and or weapons that will aid you in your task at hand.&#10;&#10;Classified Prototypes are very hard to get but are extremely useful if acquired. One example of a Classified Prototype is being able to gain control over the Knights for one turn, be able to capture as well as then send adversaries to the Storage Room and be locked in.&#10;&#10;The mansion has its own elements that are going to be hard to get around but with how it has been designed there are also a few very useful elements it also offers. One such benefit is the Security access key, that if acquired gives you additional passages to expedite your journey. Using these and planning your moves well are very important to locate and acquire the &quot;Inheritances&quot;. Once achieved then your next task is going to be getting all required items to get out without losing what you have and is needed to take back to Lorna.&#10;&#10;Each time a player has a turn, they will draw and event card prior to their role. This will effect their planning and next move or in some cases change everything with the fact the Mansion, Vonya and the Knights are a ever present factor. There are (158) Event Cards Alone.&#10;&#10;Additionally in a players turn they can choose to have PVP prior to drawing or roll of dice, depending on cards you may hold and where the other player may be.&#10;&#10;Your movement, planning and deck building, will be key to your acquiring what you need and escaping the mansion! (327) Total Cards In Cypress Legacy: The Board Game&#10;&#10;Whether you are two players or six, from the first roll to success, the drama to acquire what you need and escape grows continually. This feature is in the game every time you play and with the design, also gives great replayability.&#10;&#10;It has taken some time and a lot of changes especially over the last year and a half, but we do now finally have our first run in and are also taking in dealers now. The game has undergone a lot of revisions and art changes. We wanted to take the extra time to adjust the game play and have a very good balance to the game. Now we are very happy with the results and are beginning to get the game out. (Please note this is not a &quot;Legacy&quot; game, this is part of the title because of the overall story.)&#10;&#10;Cypress Legacy: The Board Game is based on the Cypress Inheritance Saga.&#10; OBJECTIVE: Use Weapons, Skills, Assets, and Classified Prototypes to be the first player to escape the Cypress Mansion with all the required inheritance items and be Lorna&rsquo;s proven friend.&#10;&#10;STORY: The story you are playing within begins with Lorna Ritten just learning of Alfred Cypress, the grandfather she has never known. Lorna has always wanted to find out more about her biological family, which has always been a mystery. Her grandfather&rsquo;s attorney, Phillip Brandt, tells Lorna of an inheritance, which includes one of her grandfather&rsquo;s many mansions and its contents. Her desire to know more marks the beginning of a very unique and potentially dangerous situation. Lorna has no idea just how important this actually is to her and will be to others. As Lorna is studying some of the inheritance documents before visiting the mansion, she realizes there are objects that hold key information hidden throughout the mansion.&#10;&#10;Also note the complete Cypress Legacy: The Board Game Manual in the files below. (Note the player versus player elements in the manual)&#10;&#10;The Novel Series has gone through a lot of changes as well and the first novel will be available soon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "6th century ... Saint-Beno&icirc;t has just finished writing his rule. He describes in 73 chapters how the life of the monks should be managed. Here comes the time of the monastic orders. They will organize themselves and seek to develop their influence.&#10;&#10;In Pelegrinus, you lead one of them, launch yourself into the spiritual conquest of Europe. Consolidate your influence by building commandies across the continent, then erect powerful abbeys to assert your power in different regions. Do not forget the intrigues of the papal courts, for the support of the sovereign pontiff will often be valuable to you. Lastly, gather under your protection various relics and maintain a firm control over the lucrative pilgrimage routes. However, you are not alone; other orders intrigue in the shadows to double you on the path of power.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player is in charge of a different color group of houses in the neighborhood.This game uses territory control and &quot;Take-that!&quot; game mechanics. Every time The Beast is moved to a different house or is annoyed by his neighbors, he gets angrier and angrier. The cards present methods of moving The Beast or rearranging the layout of houses in the neighborhood, and have different anger values for each such method. When The Beast's total anger value reaches the breaking point, he RAGES and destroys all houses adjacent to his.&#10;&#10;Each player must manage when and where The Beast rages, thus destroying the houses around him. The ultimate goal is to have more of your opponents' houses destroyed than yours. When The Beast lives in one of your houses, you actually gain points. When The Beast lives next to one of your houses, there's risk of him destroying them in a fit of rage, costing you points. All other houses out of harm's way (not adjacent to The Beast) tally point values as well. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Bluff, audacity and deterrence are essential compensating factors for the success of such empires.&#10;It would be sage to mention that these empires share their intrinsic apprehension with the clarity, ruthlessly attract players fanatic of the order, suspecting and nosing without intransigence or even players without morals that such parasites survive to them.&#10;Let us mention again the Lithomanian players who under the blindness of their autarkic devellopement bring to their entourage the severe weight of their misdeeds and spells.&#10;zEach puzzle of these great strategic currents offers their pieces, free to each of them to arrange on the woof of an original and inventive strategy.&#10;We are dealing here with a fierce competition for limited resources, whose pecuniary values and interest in terms of objective correspond to a tight and fluctuating timing.&#10;Within this latent tension it is up to the players to contain their disconveniences because expansion and margins of actions are amply dependent on a collaboration of good quality, sometimes forced, if not imposed.&#10;A world where raptors and wolves live under the cover of a lamb will be very sad if the spirits of the stones are displeased by so many lithurgical vacarmes and human activities, mingle with the party, leaving their apparitions to their disappearance that a trail of desolations, whose effects will be crescendo with the power of the players, frequencies of irruption will go along with the frenetic appetite of the players for the inestimable stones.&#10;- The Prestige, A balancing act&#10;This game will still be far too wise if there was this subtle tension of the tightrope walker on his rope, handle this wrist of markers &quot;Useful to do everything&quot; and which at the slightest false step sticks crumpled after crumb at the bottom of a chasm, offers salt and pepper to the most deceitful.&#10;Players will judicieusemet, meticulously, split their markers to see the immobilized on options broken down between the game board, the recruiting board and their personal trays.&#10;- The Prestige, deep strategy&#10;Like a game of chess the order is reversed here, the beginning of the game wide open, the abundance and the adaptability of the choices (however tempered by some pecuniary need&#10;and the always too measured coming of the stones) nourish the naivet&eacute; of the player, alas for the most part the net does not close too quickly, the voices of survival is reduced and the actions which there will be no need for an interest in an andean are gradually taking on a disproportionate importance.&#10;The players will end up breathless, until the last final moment, but is it not out of breath that it builds the prestige of a victory?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two division level American Civil War games. Uses the same system as the designer's previous At All Hazards game with two changes plus additional game specific rules.&#10;&#10;Corps, Cavalry, and Supply wagons are activated by chit-pull. Each unit on the map is a Division with off map tracking boxes for supply, fatigue, and stragglers for each Division.  Divisions have between one and four steps. Turns represent 3 1/2 hours and map hexes are approx. 1/2 mile across.&#10;&#10;Gettysburg is won on geographical objectives with step losses counting, too. Mine Run is won solely on the basis of damage to the enemy force.&#10;&#10;Only a playtest version produced.  The designer also produced an experimental order system inspired by the Gamers' CWB (but without writing).&#10;&#10;",
