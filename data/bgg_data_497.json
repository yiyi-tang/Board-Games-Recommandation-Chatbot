At game end the attacker wins if more soldier units have crossed the river than the defender has collected units of money. Otherwise the defender wins. If the soldier/money unit count is tied at endgame then the conflict is tied; so be it.&#10;&#10;",

So the players - as detectives (private eyes) - are appointed to find the loot.&#10;&#10;The game uses a special movement system regarding the famous German pub game &quot;Knobeln&quot;. It is all about bluffing and hunting for the best cards. Sudden events can alter the personal strategy.  Each player gets 5 small (movement) sticks.  Acting simultaneously with his neighbor both hide a certain number of sticks in their hands, then open their hands and count up the total amount.  Players may move if both hands show different numbers of sticks and the total amount does not equal 5; if you end on a loot slide check it (value 0 - 4) &amp; keep it.  If a player lands on another player, it offers you an opportunity to steal.  If the stick-count equals 5 players add a barrier, and an equal number of sticks held by each player forces them back to the starting point, and they draw an event card.&#10;&#10;",

Men who are not fed are flipped over and all their abilities are halved for the next turn. Subsequent non-feeding will result in the elimination of the men.&#10;&#10;While hunting mammoths is relatively easy at the start of the game, it gets harder and harder, because players must manufacture new weapons and pitfalls and thus only some of the men can be used for hunting.&#10;&#10;The game ends, when the first player has lost all tribesmen.

The player then traces a path ('reaction') through as many pieces of the opposing colour as he can. A path is a continuous line passing from a piece of the player's colour to one of his opponent's. Once the path is established, the opponent's piece is flipped over and the piece rotated in such a way that at least one of the lines on it joins up to the path. If there are now no lines on the new piece that point to another opposing piece, or if the flipped piece is a Burn-out, the 'reaction' is over, and the player's turn ends.&#10;&#10;The objective is for each player to have the most pieces showing his colour at the end of the game. If there are an equal number of each, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

The value of a set depends on how up market the publications are - lowest points are awarded for evening papers (6) then provincials (16), then dailies (24), then Sundays (32) then weeklies (40) then magazines (48). The players don't wait turns but on the word &quot;Go&quot; from the dealer start shouting the name of the paper they want to sell by trading cards. The first to collect a complete set and lay them down shouts &quot;Fleet Street&quot; and scores the points for that set. The cards are reshuffled and dealt again. Winner is the first to reach 250 points.&#10;Each of the 48 newspapers/magazines have their own individual depiction of the front page - the magazines are especially colorful.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scrimmage was invented by Chuck Eskridge, and David Williams.  It is a football game in which one side controls the offense and the other controls the defense. Movement is accomplished by dice rolls, with slower players have lower maximum movement capability. Each side has pieces (players) of varying strength and speed.  Any player can tackle any other player, but only players of equal or greater strength can block opposing players.  The offense sets up, and then the defense, with a twist: the defense does not know whether the offense is running a passing play or a running play. (The choice is disclosed after the play starts.) If it is a passing play, the pass can be thrown to a designated grid but only after the play has had time to develop.  If a play breaks down, the offensive player draws a card to determine whether he can recover.&#10;&#10;The passing mechanism works wonderfully: the offense places two men downfield in one of several grids, and secretly chooses a card identifying the grid to which the pass will be made. Each team then moves players (including the potential receivers) with the roll of the dice. When the pass is made, the offense chooses which square in the grid the pass will go to. The choice of squares determines how easy it is for the receiver and the defensive back(s) to get to the square to which the pass is made: if the receiver gets to the square and the back does not, the pass is complete.  If the back gets to the square and the receiver does not, the pass is intercepted.  If both get to the square, the pass is incomplete.&#10;&#10;The running game and the pass rush depend on the the success of the blockers and the defensive line.  There is luck in the dice rolls, of course, but the luck evens out over the course of the game and a good play can survive a little bad luck.  Card drawing can also be important. Sometimes tacklers reach the ball carrier but fail to make the tackle, or make the tackle and force a fumble, which can be recovered by either the offense of defense.&#10;&#10;This is one of the few games non-simulation football games (i.e., not strat-o-matic football or its cousins) that really feels like you are playing football.  You choose your play in advance, and, like real football, sometimes it works as planned, sometimes it fails, and sometimes you have to improvise during the course of the play.&#10;&#10;Only about 800 copies of the game were sold, primarily in game stores in the South.  Two versions were created, the original version and a second version that included an optional &quot;monster man&quot; with good speed and power.&#10;&#10;This game is not to be confused with the SPI game of the same name-- and almost the same year.&#10;&#10;",

The Touhou games are known for their intricate and complex bullet patterns, unique fantasy setting, many characters, and prodigal amount of fan-derived works...this card game included.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a two-player turn-based dueling card game. Each player starts out by choosing four characters (repeats are allowed), and designates one as the leader. Your leader has an initial health point (HP), border value (BV) and evasion value (EV), which will be used throughout the match, as well as some special abilities. Your starting spell point (SP) is zero. The other characters are to allow you access to other cards; the character requirements can be seen at the top of each card.&#10;&#10;After you've picked your team, you get to choose 40 cards (duplicates are allowed up to a total of three) that comprise your deck. Obviously you will pick cards that you can actually use.&#10;&#10;You will keep track of your HP and SP using counters. The game ends when one person's leader's HP drops to zero or when his or her deck has been depleted.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Victory consists of capturing or sinking all enemy Merchant Shipping so that the enemy is completely blockaded and cannot obtain further supplies from Neutral sources.&#10;&#10;The Map shows four countries (two sets of paired enemies).  The land war between them is considered to be locked in a Maginot Line type of stalemate so the battle hinges on the war at sea.  The map has 32 ports (5 in each warring country and 12 on the coasts of the neutrals).&#10;&#10;Each country has a different starting mix of units (for example Leoland is high in Naval Formations and Adlerreich has the most submarines).  The player round consists of moving all your cargo ships 1 space then rolling the dice and moving your units. A player may make a single air attack instead of moving any naval units.  The air units have unlimited range and the number required to make an attack is based on the target.  Losses are also based on the target and are automatic (for example it takes 4 air units to attack a naval formation and 2 air units are automatically lost).&#10;&#10;A merchant ship can join a naval formation and create a convoy for more protection. Naval combat consists of a surprise attack (by submarines) and open attacks between naval formations.  The surprise attack can be triggered by a roll of 8 or higher and an open attack requires the player to spend 1 or 2 pips of the dice roll.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules: In brief the purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 48 states shown on the map of the United States as possible.&#10;&#10;Description from the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Three hundred years ago the world powers were moving.  Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.&#10;&#10;It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &quot;Order of Conquest&quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.&#10;&#10;In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.&#10;&#10;In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.&#10;&#10;In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.&#10;&#10;To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules:  G.H.Q. is a Strategic war game for two players, one player representing the Allied Armies and the other the German Army.  The theater of War is the Western Front and the territories of countries adjacent to that front.  The Object is to occupy ONE of two capital cities of the opponent.&#10;&#10;On the map the principal towns are shown as red circles and connected together by thick red lines which represent the road and railway systems.  Towns with black centers are Corps garrison towns and the associated units are marked on the map.  The units (armoured, motorized and infantry corp) are represented by different shaped wooden pieces with Flags attached.&#10;&#10;The Germans always go first and movement is governed by a roll of the dice.  The roll will be between 1 and 3 and the number thrown indicates the number of units which may be moved.  Armoured corps can move 3 spaces, Motorized 2 and Infantry 1 space.  Destruction of units is based on having units adjacent to the target enemy, 3 friendly units are required to kill an armoured unit, infantry and motorized are destroyed by two friendly units in adjacent towns.  For every enemy unit destroyed the player gets another roll.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The goal of the game is to be the Diplomat that creates the Greatest World Empire by controlling strategic location cards, collecting Colony and Independent Country Flag cards, capturing soldiers, battleships and bombers.&#10;&#10;The map consists of a circle of spaces with flags representing various countries of the world, across the center of the circle is the Bridge of Flags representing the six great colonizing countries.  At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &quot;Start&quot;.&#10;&#10;The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &quot;Isolation&quot; spot.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.  Flags, and captured tokens are worth points and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

For a while a 5th Columnist spy may escape detection and cause much damage and many heartaches&hellip; but from the days of old... No 5th Columnist Spy has yet escaped.&quot; Excerpted from the rules section A Word About Spies by James Boyle - Former Special Investigator.&#10;&#10;5th Column  Spy Hunter is a point to point movement game for 2 teams.  Players act as either the 5th Columnists or the Spy Hunters and move around a map of the United States based on Official Number Code from the Decoder (a spinner).  The spinner provides moves based on a separate &quot;code&quot; list for 5th Columnists and Spy Hunters.  5th Columnists score points for ending their moves on designated spots (for example: air naval or army bases to steal documents), the Spy Hunters get points based on failures by the 5th Columnists.   The winner is the first team to 15 points.    Both teams are expected to record their routes so that a second game can be played to crown the &quot;Champion Spy Hunter&quot;.  The teams exchange routes and take turns listing the order of the states they entered and their capitols.  Points are awarded for correct answers. Mistakes cost a team their turn.  The Champion is the team with the highest score.&#10;&#10;",
