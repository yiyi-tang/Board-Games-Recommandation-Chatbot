Each side of a Nautches card is marked with notches indicating a value between 0 and 5. Each of the 120 cards has a unique sequence of notches. Each card also has one of six suits and one of two colors. Most games are based on placing such that the notches on any touching sides of cards have matching values.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's Kind of a Fun Story is a getting-to-know-you storytelling game for acquaintances or a revealing party game for friends you thought you already knew everything about. Players tell stories, compete to best fit card descriptions, and sometimes steal cards from one another, in a bid to get to know each other and win!&#10;&#10;To begin, each player takes one 'Nope' card and two 'Hear Me Out' cards. The deck is then shuffled, placed in the center of the table, and ten 'Take a Chance' cards are placed beside it.&#10;&#10;On your turn you draw a card and follow its instructions. There are four types of cards. The Story Cards are worth two points, while the others are all worth one.&#10;&#10;When you draw a Story Card, you must answer the question on the card, such as 'what was your least favorite job?' or 'who was your arch-nemesis growing up?'. If for some reason you do not wish or do not have a story for the card, you may skip it and draw a new card. Another player may take a skipped card to answer on his turn rather than drawing a new one if he wishes.&#10;&#10;If you are the only one who answered the Story Card, you place it in your score pile. However, a player may discard a 'Hear Me Out' card if she also wishes to tell a story for the prompt. Players then vote on who should win the card. If you have already used your 'Hear Me Out' cards, you may place a 'Take a Chance' card into your score pile instead, in order to answer another player's Story Card. These are worth negative one point.&#10;&#10;The 'Left or Right' cards require you to decide which player on either side of you best fits the description on the card. The 'Point a Finger' card requires everyone to vote on who best fits the description. Finally, for the 'Everybody Answers' card, each player gives a brief answer to the prompt or question and then votes on who wins the card.&#10;&#10;If, during a story, the topic ever veers into territory you are not comfortable with, you simply hold up your Nope Card, and the story immediately ends. There is no penalty and the current player simply draws a new card. Nope Cards are not meant to be used in any competitive fashion, and are simply there to keep everyone comfortable with the game content.&#10;&#10;When a player wins a card they place it in their scoring pile. The first player to 7 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, are YOU ready to lay all your cards on the table?&#10;&#10;The game contains 320 cards and an endless amount of stories to be shared.&#10;&#10;Trying to keep this PG? All our decks are customizable with Rated-R cards that can be removed if your mom wants in on the fun. (Or keep them, your call).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Before the game begins, Commanders will customize their capital ships and corvettes to suit their playstyle and strategy.&#10;&#10;Star Eater uses an inertia based movement system. Each turn a commander can fire the capital ship engines to gain, bleed off, or redirect their momentum. Acquired momentum is tracked with tokens and each turn the momentum will continue to affect the capital ships movement turn after turn until it is removed.&#10;&#10;Each turn, both players will place face down: an engine Dial with a setting selected and 2 command cards.&#10;When both players agree that they are ready, they will reveal their engine dials at the same time, then apply the relevant momentum to their capital ship. All capital ships on the board are then moved according to the momentum they possess.&#10;Once movement is complete, the players reveal their command cards simultaneously and play out their effects.&#10;&#10;Most commands attract cooldown which removes them from the game for a set number of turns after use. The amount of cooldown attracted by a particular command is determined by the components that commander has chosen to outfit their capital ship with.&#10;There are 8 command cards, each of which will activate one component of the warship; main and broadside weapons, point defense turrets and shields, emergency engine power and various special abilities. Controlling corvettes is also done via command cards.&#10;&#10;Capital ships are composed of many sections. Each individual piece of the capital ship has its own armor rating, and the ship as a whole has an internal structure health. To damage your opponent's structural health, you must strip away their armor and then land shots in the resulting gap. When a capital ship runs out of internal structure health, it is destroyed and their opponent wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Instead of players trying to identify the hidden word, they have to fit words to hidden categories. The game can be played just for fun, or can be played more seriously to win or lose.&#10;&#10;In Mock Word, one player is a Respondent, the other players form the Support, a co-operative team, of which one player is an Ojama. At the start of the game, the team players compose a series of words by secretly writing a single character at a time of cards. The cards get passed around, so each player contributes to forming the words. The Ojama is acting a sort of spoiler, secretly trying to make nonsense words as they form. This can produce hilarious words and makes the game a lot of fun.&#10;&#10;Once the words are set, the Respondent tries to identify the theme words that fit each of the composed words. If they can, all the players score points except the Ojama. If the Respondent cannot match the words to the themes, then the Ojama scores points. At the game end, most points wins. &#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Runeslingers: The Awakening&quot; is a strategic customizable card game that ingeniously melds board game and dueling card game elements into a wholly unique strategy gaming experience. It promises to challenge even the most seasoned gaming veterans with its myriad strategic win conditions, card combinations, and decision trees that confront players each turn.&#10;&#10;Take on the role of a Runeslinger, a wielder of magical incantations known as runespells. Much of the game's art features runestones, ancient stone artifacts that empower your Runeslinger with runespells. Each runespell possesses a class affinity that provides guidance on its thematic origins and strategic pairings but does not limit card pairings in deck construction.&#10;&#10;The game's objective is straightforward: diminish the enemy Runeslinger's power from five to zero. Achieve this by dealing damage, applying ailments, or discarding the enemy's cards to weaken their power. Reduce the enemy Runeslinger's maximum health to zero, or deplete their entire deck and discard pile to secure instant victory! With five distinct win conditions coupled with a unique ailment system, &quot;Runeslingers&quot; stands as an exceptionally complex yet rewarding strategy game that introduces significant mechanical advancements to the genre.&#10;&#10;Customize your Runeslinger with a unique stance and ability to further develop specific strategies, limited only by your creativity. Select from a pool of over 180 unique cards in the Alpha set, and assemble a 40-card deck with no class or color restrictions. Employ six unique ailments that dynamically alter gameplay on a moment's notice. Master the art of shouting, Runeslinger's distinctive take-that mechanic that enables you to disrupt enemy actions, even when it's not your turn!&#10;&#10;If you seek a challenging and genuinely strategic game, your search ends with &quot;Runeslingers!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

These texts were written in the 12th century by great Islamic scholar and jurists Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani and the polymath Ibn Rushd (Averroes). They provide guideposts for behavior, but it&rsquo;s up to you to decide how to solve dilemmas.&#10;&#10;Set in medieval North Africa, towns are built by families like yours. Take on one of five roles in a struggle to address dilemmas, overcome crises, and avert disasters that threaten to destroy everything you know and love. Look out for your family, but be sure to collaborate with your neighbors as well. Any number of players can win, but if anyone goes destitute, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;Explore the ways in which these medieval religious legal systems helped to hold society together and helped to keep neighbors cooperating with one another. Optionally, you can pair Lost &amp; Found: New Harvest with the original Lost &amp; Found and take on both Jewish and Muslim roles, and explore how these laws play out for these two communities living in Fustat (Old Cairo) in the 12th century.&#10;&#10;Will you follow the laws of lost and found possessions? Will you break them? Will you go above and beyond the law?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Division Command is an operational game pitting the Union and Confederate Armies against each other during the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg. Each side is represented by each of the Army, Corps and Division Commanders at the Battle of Gettysburg and the Brigades under their command. Take control of the Confederate Army and use their consolidated command structure to try and wrest control of Gettysburg from the Union.&#10;&#10;Or, take control of the Union Army and work to delay the Confederates long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Can the Union survive the confusion of command before Meade can arrive with the Army artillery reserves? Can Lee push forward far enough on the first day to sustain his position for the second and third days? Can you win the Battle of Gettysburg and decide the fate of the American Civil War?&#10;&#10;The Division Command level is designed with the ability to take and hold ground. This is represented by controlling the critical road network surrounding the town of Gettysburg. This is accomplished by taking control of specific points along the roads called &ldquo;March Circles,&rdquo; and thus scoring Victory Points.&#10;&#10;A standard Division Command level game covering all three days of the Battle of Gettysburg can be played in about 8-12 hours. Victory occurs either when you force your opponent&rsquo;s army to retreat, or you have the majority of the 43 Victory Points by the end of the game. You force your opponent to retreat by having double their amount of Victory Points at the end of a day of battle, thus earning a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Division Command can also be played as a Campaign Manager within the Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Brigade Command game. This allows the Division Command game to act as a &ldquo;campaign battle generator,&rdquo; creating tactical battles that can be played in 2 to 3 hours, skipping past unnecessary actions and combats in the Brigade Command system and shaving a 40 to 60 hour long game down to 25 hours or less.&#10;&#10;While Rally Round the Flag was painstakingly designed with historical accuracy at its heart, the outcome of the game is not predetermined. The design reflects the tactical, organizational, and operational limits of both Union and Confederate armies and their generals, but how you manage them is up to you. In this battle, your decisions make the difference.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There is also a solo mode new to Shaolia which introduces a Boss for the player to battle.&#10;&#10;A game of Great Houses proceeds much the same as one of Warring States, but with the addition of the Noble House tiles and Quest cards. These two new components work in tandem.&#10;&#10;Noble House Tiles&#10;These tiles can be purchased during the purchase phase of the game. The currency to purchase them are Quest cards that players have earned in the game. After a Noble House tile has been purchased, it is immediately replaced by another from the deck.&#10;&#10;Noble House tiles are placed near the player&rsquo;s territory board, and function the same as Level 1 &amp; 2 cards, with one important exception: They cannot be attacked, blocked, or destroyed, so a player will benefit from their abilities until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Quest Cards&#10;If a player completes the requirement listed on a Quest card during their turn, they get to take the quest card into their hands. Another Quest card from the deck is immediately drawn to replace the one taken.&#10;&#10;As mentioned previously, Quest cards can be used to purchase Noble House tiles. Alternately, you may sell one a Quest card for 2 gold.&#10;&#10;There are two types of Quest cards: ones that are immediately achieved by meeting their requirements, and ones with 2&ndash;3 open slots that require players to repeat the action listed on the card that many times before they complete the quest. Cards with these repeating quests can only be completed by whoever does the action first, claiming it with one of their quest trackers.&#10;&#10;A game of Shaolia: Great Houses ends the same turn that someone either gains 18 culture, or does 12 damage to their opponent&rsquo;s palace. Additionally, there will be that previously-mentioned third victory path achieved through completing quests.&#10;&#10;",

Instead you are a summoner who skates out complex magical diagrams to summon Figures - mythical gods and creatures - to fight giant monsters of chaos in high-speed, tactical battles.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Summon Skate is divided between puzzle solving/investigation and tactical combat. Players will check out strange happenings in their city to piece together the true nature of the chaos manifesting there. These investigations generally involve making checks using the simple 3 Attribute, 2D6 roll-under resolution system. Once the mystery is solved, the chaos gathers and takes on a physical form born from human nightmares - a Chaos Figure, the main enemies of this game.&#10;&#10;Once combat with the Chaos Figure begins, the players are teleported to a magical stage represented by a 12 x 12 grid. Each turn, players must use their limited movements points to draw out summoning diagrams on the grid. Once a diagram is completed, players can summon the Figure tied to the diagram. Summoned Figures are the primary means of fighting, guarding, healing and supporting in the game. Meanwhile the enemy Chaos Figure will spend its turns trying to either kill the player characters directly or shatter the stage by creating cracks that extend from one side to the other. If all the players run out of HP or the stage is completely shattered, it&rsquo;s game over and the world falls to chaos. You&rsquo;ll need cooperation and planning to make it through these battles alive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players who stop here will use their imagination and Islamic skills to the best of their ability to answer this question, and other players will judge whether the answer is good or bad. A guidebook written by Mr. Nakata for this purpose is included as a reference book. This guidebook can be used as a guideline for judgment, but it does not contain absolute correct answers. In the end, you will have to make a decision based on your own reason and conscience.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest total Virtue and Fame at the end of the game is the winner. The game ends if:&#10;-When the caliph was elected. The game ends with the player taking a turn up to the one before the player who became the caliph.&#10;-When the deck runs out. The game ends immediately when the last deck is drawn.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player may receive additional points or conceded points depending on the situation.&#10;&#10;",

Action cards allow you to do things like collect doubloons, draw cards, and steal from other players.&#10;&#10;You can choose to spend doubloons in order to recruit pirates onto your crew. These pirates give you effects that can be used once on every turn. Different combinations of action cards and pirates allow you to accelerate your path to victory and decelerate your opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ULUS is a game aimed at preserving knowledge about Mongolian culture. It is published by the Endangered Alphabets Project, which strives to preserve the many writing systems of the world that are under threat of extinction, including the Mongolian alphabet.&#10;&#10;The game is set at the time after Genghis Khan's death, when his successors wondered what form the huge Mongolian empire should have in the future. Should the nomadic culture be preserved? Should Mongols adapt to an urban culture?&#10;&#10;Each player adheres to one such idea, asks the support of a deity and a totemic animal and begins to gather the assets that will help their idea to prevail. The game is divided into two phases. The first phase is mostly to gather assets and to attack other players to thwart their plans. Players can choose to play an attack card which the attacked player can defend against. The player of the weaker card will lose strength points which will make it harder to fulfill their tasks in phase two. Alternatively, players can pass or try to force a trade on another player. If they know about a card another player holds, they can ask for it in exchange for any other asset card.&#10;&#10;In phase two of the game, players arrive at the great summer festival of Naadam. Here, they compete in three traditional Mongolian sports: archery, horse racing and wrestling. Winners are decided by adding asset modifiers to a player's strength. &#10;After a final round of trading or attacking, players reveal their collected assets and add their strength to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Rules will be included in English and Mongolian.&#10;&#10;",

By playing Bits &amp; Bytes, children are developing the logical foundations for programming computers, thus when they start to learn actual coding later in life they already have the required mindset.

    "Description": "Following the British victory in the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845 &ndash; 1846) the Lahore Durbar, the Sikh Government of the Punjab, effectively came under the control of the British East India Company. In April 1848, two British officers were sent to the prosperous south western city of Multan to take over the running of the province from its governor, Diwan Mulraj Chopra. They were murdered by soldiers of the city&rsquo;s garrison, apparently acting spontaneously and without the prior knowledge of the startled Mulraj. Nonetheless, after some prevarication, he supported their actions, and thereby found himself the leader of a rebellion against the British.&#10;There were few Sikhs in that part of the Punjab: the garrison was mainly Muslim, and the Mulraj was a Hindu. Because of this, the East India Company regarded the uprising as a purely local affair and sent troops to lay siege to Multan in the expectation that this would quell the rebellion. These included a large body of Sikhs, supposedly loyal to the British, under the command of Sher Singh.&#10;&#10;It is now late October 1848. Coming to sympathize with the Mulraj&rsquo;s grievances against the British and to appreciate how these are shared by the Sikhs, Sher Singh has changed sides.   His men have withdrawn from the siege and are marching north east towards the Punjabi capital, Lahore. Sher Singh&rsquo;s father, Chattar Singh, has also rebelled against the British and is besieging the fort at Attock which guards the road to Afghanistan. Inspired by the defiance of Sher Singh and Chattar Singh, anti-British disturbances have broken out in towns and cities across the western Punjab.&#10;&#10;In response, units of the British East India Company are assembling at Firozpur where they will become the &ldquo;Army of the Punjab&rdquo;, under the command of Lord Gough. Gough plans to march against Sher Singh before he is reinforced by Chattar Singh. The monsoon season has ended. Campaigning can commence. So begins the Second Anglo-Sikh War 1848 &ndash; 1849.&#10;&#10;Into the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth is a two-player beer-and-pretzels game which gives players the opportunity to replicate the British success in re-establishing control over the Punjab, or to re-write history by leading the Sikhs to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The rules are different, and there is more emphasis on speed.&#10;&#10;The general framework is like in Borel. The cards describe probability experiments with yes/no answers, for example: &quot;You roll the d10 four times. Will the maximum roll exceed 8?&quot;&#10;&#10;You draw a card, and read aloud the question, the players vote yes or no, and you then conduct the experiment. Being good at probability will give you an advantage, but you can also win if the dice roll your way.&#10;&#10;In the original game, you bet various amounts of money using chips, and you reveal your bets simultaneously. In this game, the first person to put forward their yes/no card, becomes the &quot;Leader&quot; and gets their preferred outcome, while all the others must bet on the opposite outcome. You get 3 points if you bet correctly. The experiment is then performed a second time, where the players are allowed to bet freely, except for the Leader, and you score 2 points if you bet correctly. First player to 25 points win.&#10;&#10;By being the first to commit to a bet and becoming the Leader, you can force all the others to bet the opposite. However, the Leader is not allowed to change their bet in the second round, so betting too quickly can be dangerous, too.&#10;&#10;",

Players grab handfuls of candy with different types (different colors, different brands, etc), and hide their stash from the other players.

Players roleplay through those interpretations, using their own cards and rolling a 12-sided die to influence what happens in the story.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game choosing one of the 18 Aspect Cards, becoming that character in story. Do you want to use muscle like The Warrior, or perhaps your intellect, like The Scientist. Are you more in tune with something spiritual, like The Shaman? There are many ways to play it!&#10;&#10;Card by card, the story unfolds...&#10;&#10;Each round, the storyteller lays contributed cards, as well as a few unknown cards, in a face-down spread. The reading of the images is performed similar to how a fortune teller would read Tarot, with images deriving meaning, and the orientation of the cards mattering. &quot;Ordered&quot; cards (correctly viewed) add positive events to the story, and perilous events happen when cards are &quot;Mirrored&quot; (upside-down).&#10;&#10;During the reading of a spread, players are given the opportunity to say what they would like their character to do, and roll the die to see if their actions were successful. If players are successful, they may begin to turn cards in the spread to become ordered. A spread containing an Ordered Mind (blue), Body (red), and Spirit (green) card is considered a success for The Miri, and flips the next of five Suspense tiles in favor of The Miri.&#10;&#10;However&hellip; Being unsuccessful in Ordering the cards allows the dark forces known as Ichor to get its clutches on the story! If all three Clutches of Ichor tokens are placed on the cards in the spread, you flip the next of five Suspense tiles back over in favor of Ichor.&#10;&#10;If all five Suspense tiles show &quot;The Miri&quot;, you WIN and conclude the story with a victory for the players! ...Unless the story was lost to the Clutches of Ichor!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
