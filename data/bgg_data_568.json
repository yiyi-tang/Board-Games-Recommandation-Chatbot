    "Description": "In Power, each player is an individual character who ages, has a job, may get married, have children (who turn into additional characters), start factories, etc. All of this is controlled by playing cards on your own or other characters. Characters also have levels, which may be gained in various ways, including accumulating certain large amounts of money.&#10;&#10;The object is to have the last living character. This may be accomplished by outliving the other characters, as characters of low level automatically die at age 70 (although if they have children, their players are still in the game). It is also possible to kill other characters, either by using certain cards or by being enough levels above them. An alternative way to win is to reach the sixth level.&#10;&#10;",

Even the gaming die is included. (For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&quot;&#10;&#10;Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.&#10;&#10;Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.&#10;&#10;The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.&#10;&#10;",

Each word's score is the sum of its cards' values; proper names from the Bible are doubled.  If a player plays all their hand in one turn, their total for the hand is doubled.  Play until reaching an agreed number of points or hands.&#10;&#10;Novar Cottage also published a different version called Alphacard Word Rummy.

    "Description": "Naval Thunder: Clash of Dreadnoughts is an exciting, fast paced miniatures game of World War I naval combat. Its first in an exciting line of naval wargames from Steel Dreadnought Games and is designed for use with miniatures of scales 1/1800 - 1/6000.  Newcomers will appreciate how straight-forward and easy to learn the basic system is, while naval wargaming veterans can take advantage of the optional rule system to add additional detail to the game.&#10;&#10;NT: CoD has been designed from the keel up to be fun, fast paced, and full of flavor so that you can focus on the thrill of commanding a ship or fleet at sea instead of tedious charts or calculations.  A battle involving a dozen battleships and battlecruisers on each side can be fought to a conclusion in a couple hours while offering a play experience with significant tactical depth.&#10;&#10;The robust optional rules system allows the game to grow with you as you gain experience - ensuring that Naval Thunder will be your naval miniatures system of choice for years to come.  There are more than 20 completely modular optional rules that allow you to model historically accurate factors influencing naval combat of the era.  You can pick and choose which rules to include allowing you to tailor the pace of play and level of detail to your personal preference.&#10;&#10;Just a few examples of the kinds of historically accurate details you can add to the game include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Poor design of British shells causing them to shatter on striking heavy armor&#10;     Poor cordite flash precautions&#10;     The impact of historical commanders&#10;     Crew training levels&#10;     The influence of wind direction on gunnery&#10;     Using submarines to soften up your opponent's battlefleet&#10;&#10;&#10;Optional shortcuts allow you to use Naval Thunder: Clash of Dreadnoughts to run huge fleet actions such as Jutland in a fraction of time other non-abstract systems would take.&#10;&#10;Included with the rules are data cards for 80 classes of ship, representing hundreds of historical vessels, allowing you to model nearly any action between the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine during the first world war.&#10;&#10;",

Two new powers - the United States and Japan - were entering the world stage, even as many in the old guard began to creak under the weight of their own might. Communism, in the person of Vladimir Ilych Lenin, had begun to rear its head in Czarist Russia. Technology and the industrial revolution were changing everything, including the weapons of war. And while the &quot;Boxer Rebellion&quot; in China was easily quashed, the incident demonstrated growing resentment of European dominance.&#10;&#10;Starmada: Iron Stars reveals a world in crisis. Recovery from the Martian Invasion is slow, and its effects will be felt for decades to come. Hopes that the extraterrestrial threat would result in a new spirit of cooperation and coexistence have been quickly dashed, with the Great Powers scrambling to take advantage of technological tidbits left behind by the invaders. While recent conflicts have been thankfully limited in scope, it seems only a matter of time before Humanity is engulfed in a new conflagration, this one of its own making.&#10;&#10;This supplement is a unique &quot;crossover&quot; project, combining two of our most popular gaming systems. The intent is to introduce fans of the Iron Stars universe to the Universal Game of Starship Combat, while at the same time exposing those Starmada players who may have been reluctant to jump into a different environment a glimpse at an alternate Earth in which the Martian Invasion really happened.&#10;&#10;Outside of the thrills of Edwardian space combat, there is plenty in these pages to expand any Starmada setting, including new options like:&#10;&#10;* Faceted shielding&#10;    * Crew-killer weapons&#10;    * Etheric movement&#10;    * Critical damage&#10;&#10;And more!&#10;&#10;Starmada: Iron Stars is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada: The Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.&#10;&#10;",

Most rules are designed around the size of the miniature figure - for example, figures can move 3x their standing base length in a turn. Combat rules are resolved around a simple rock-paper-scissors method for hand-to-hand combat and shooting rubber bands or rolling balls for ranged combat.&#10;&#10;Throughout the rulebook are reminders that this is a wargame for young children so it is appropriate to let them reshoot misfired shots or make forgotten movements. The goal of the game is to have fun with your children - not slaughter them with your superior gaming skills.&#10;&#10;",

Different games are included, like high score, or first to hit all zones, etc.  This game has a nice wood construction with an approximately 24 inch wood board, built up score zones, and metal rails for the wood coin catapult to travel on.&#10;&#10;",

Plays any words out of hand that have at least 3 letters.  Previous words may be lengthened to make new words by adding letters at either end; if an opponent's word is lengthened, it becomes your.  You may also start a word in hopes that your partner could complete it in his turn; incomplete words may not be stolen. &#10;3. Discards 1 card.&#10;&#10;Once he has spelled at least two full words, a player may go out by emptying his hand.

One point is subtracted for each card left in the hand.  The team with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;",

When you lose your last disc you're knocked out.&#10;&#10;It's a matter of speed and reaction. Even when sliding your gadget all the way forward, your hammer may not reach the tube of your opponent.

If a player runs into a Police Dog (again, literally a dog dressed like a police officer) or triggers the alarm, they lose a life. Lose 9 lives, and it's game-over for that player. The first player to remove the jewels from the safe wins.&#10;&#10;The game uses a roll-and-move mechanic. On his turn, a player rolls the dice, and may then decide either to move his Cat Burglar, or to move one of the two Police Dogs.&#10;&#10;The board is assembled from four large puzzle-piece shaped segments, which depict various rooms inside the mansion. A plastic dial is inserted into each corner of the board, which players use to track lives. A fifth board section, made from plastic, depicts the vault room, and sits in the middle of the board. This section has a safe which the players must crack, and several of the spaces on the middle section are alarmed.&#10;&#10;The key feature of the game is the plastic &quot;vault room&quot; which sits in the middle of the board. All the spaces in the vault room are potentially alarmed - There are small metal contacts embedded in each space. Some of them are decoys, and some will trigger an alarm when the metal base of the cat burglar pieces comes into contact, completing an electronic circuit. The safe itself is a dexterity mini-game; although players are given the combination for the lock at the start of the game, if their hand shakes, or they get the combination slightly wrong, it triggers an alarm.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;4 Mansion Room puzzle-piece board sections&#10;4 Coloured plastic Cat Burglar pieces with a metal base&#10;2 Plastic Police Dog pieces&#10;4 Plastic Gems (one of each player colour)&#10;4 Plastic dials for tracking lives (one of each player colour)&#10;1 Plastic vault room plus battery cover&#10;1 Plastic safe core plus lid&#10;Dice&#10;Rulebook&#10;&#10;",

They can potentially repair the ship if it does get damaged. They also have to manage the ship's power, which must be allocated each turn to various systems.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the monster player gets to allocate points to various areas: strength, movement, concealment, life level, and defense against each possible kind of attack - which is why the crew player does not know how effective a weapon is until they try it.&#10;&#10;",

There are rules for artillery, air power, night fighting, minefields, and specialized tanks (Rhinos, flail tanks, etc.), among other things.&#10;&#10;Tables of organization and equipment are provided for the American, British, French, Soviet, German, and Italian forces for 1939-45.&#10;&#10;",

This practice, known as Chevauchee, is the inspiration for this game of medieval and Renaissance warfare. Designed for fun and playability, Chevauchee is perfect for novice and veteran gamers alike and offers a basic set of man-to-man combat rules, expanded optional rules, and a special system for simple siege warfare. It can be played with almost any appropriate miniature figures, each of which can use whatever weapons it is armed with and is equipped with whatever armor the model wears, eliminating paperwork and speeding play.  Each turn represents 20 seconds of action.  Essentially, combat is resolved with 3d6 rolls (with modifiers) versus a target number.  There is no set size for a playing area.  Distance is measured in inches.  The game works best with 1/72 scale or 1/35 scale figures.  50 pages.&#10;&#10;Table of Contents:&#10;&#10;5   Introduction&#10;7   Basic Rules&#10;21  Optional Rules&#10;33  Siege Rules&#10;46  Glossary&#10;&#10;",

Each character has a special ability that helps mold their ideal strategy.&#10;&#10;Mechanically, Shamus is designed to make use of the cubes and Battle Tower from Queen Games' Shogun.  Players select cubes they want by placing Detective Markers (DMs) on the various locations that they must travel to via car, cab, trolley, or good ol' fashioned shoe leather.  The cube drop determines if they draw cards, solve cases, or sling lead with Bugsy Siegel.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played with 8 bishops, 8 knights, and 1 king per player.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game the pieces are placed on the opposite long edges of the game board:&#10;The King is placed on the space marked with a crown.&#10;The knights are placed on the light spaces and the bishops on the dark spaces.&#10;&#10;The pieces move like their counterparts in chess, but even the knight may not jump over occupied spaces. The only exception is the center space, marked with a crown. It may only be occupied by a king and only then other pieces may pass this space.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to beat the enemy king or to take him prisoner. The later being the case if the king is not able to make a move without moving to a space where he may be beaten by an enemy piece.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This wargame recreates the turning point in the Spanish &quot;reconquista&quot; against the Muslim occupation in 1212. Still it took three more centuries to conquer the remaining kingdom of Granada, but from this battle onwards the Muslim armies weren't in position to defeat the christian kingdoms any longer.&#10;&#10;On one side were the Almohades with their Califfa and his army and his famous bodyguard of chained slaves. On the other were the Kings of Castilla and Navarra with their armies. Sancho &quot;el Fuerte&quot;, King of Navarra, himself cut with his sword the slaves chain in order to reach the Califfa's tent. Still nowadays Navarra's shield is a set of chains on a red field remaining this fact of arms.&#10;&#10;It was the first modern wargame ever published in Spain by the Spanish company NAC. It's print run was minimum, and it's impossible to find even a picture of it.&#10;&#10;The game system could be considered &quot;classic NAC&quot; hex-and-counters with combat and movement factors and a dice with no 1 or 6 instead two 3 and two 4. You multiply the dice by the combat factors involved in each side and eliminate the looser side. All other wargames published by NAC in the following year used this system just changing the pictures.&#10;&#10;Fue el primer wargame publicado por NAC, lo tuve en mis manos a los nueve a&ntilde;os, pero me compr&eacute; un Colditz, cuando volv&iacute; ya no estaba.&#10;&#10;Si alguien lo tiene por favor haga algunas fotos y las cuelgue aqui.&#10;&#10;Siempre lo busqu&eacute; y nunca lo encontr&eacute; por eso dise&ntilde;&eacute; mi juego sobre esta batalla&#10;&#10;",

The grid is variable, created by placing black tiles on the board before the game.&#10;&#10;Each letter tile has 3-5 letters on each side (in the players' colors), only one of which is used when forming a word. Once a tile is placed, any of the letters can be used in forming a crossing word. Some of the letters (marked with dots) cause the tile to go to the opposing player (and cost points) - otherwise all tiles in the word played are turned to the player's side.&#10;&#10;It is a requirement to play in the row or column (that has at least one empty space) with the greatest number of tiles. It is not required to form words in the other direction, as it is in Scrabble, but it is possible to do so to capture more tiles.&#10;&#10;The object is mainly to have the most tiles on the board in your color at the end of the game, although points can be scored in other ways (negative for using dotted letters, positive for placing identical tiles next to each other).&#10;&#10;While the rules say that the game can be played by more than two players, in teams, no guidance is provided on how to do so.&#10;&#10;",

Each card represents a territory in England, France, Ireland, Scotland or Wales and has a dollar value which doubles when you collect a set.&#10;&bull; Land on a battleground and you may win or lose the battle. Either way, you pick up a card from the top of the winner's pack or loser's pack, and learn your fate.&#10;&bull;If you encounter a barricade which prevents you from advancing further, you have three choices to overcome it: one is to bribe each player with $3000 to let you through.&#10;&bull; There are also safe-houses for refuge in bad times.&#10;&bull; Land on any Action square and you must pick up an Action Card from one of ten packs in a plastic tray. each has an instruction for you: you may obtain more territory, make your fortune or advance speedily across the board.

Each player represents an investigator that was summon to the city in order to uncover a mystery. Each mystery is a game in itself for there is a set of original events that describe something that is happening as well as an original background different from the other stories. This is a game of story telling as well, because beyond the generic encounter the investigators will  be able to interact with the system in several ways: bribing, buying, paying, taking buses, walking, fighting, healing. Also there is the mechanic of Day and Night that make the encounters relevant both in information and in danger.&#10;&#10;All the stories will be written so they lead to a thrilling conclusion and each event will have as much atmosphere as possible. Players will feel as their investigator is wounded and need to move to the hospital, or if they need to reach to someplace at a specific time of the day to retrieve some information. Still finishing a story won't mean to render that story useless. Since the puzzle the investigators have to complete is random, the replayability is unlimited.&#10;&#10;The nights in the Twilight City are very dangerous but there is no time to waste for the evil forces are always plotting for the doomsday and if you take too much time you will certainly fail.&#10;&#10;The board has generic places that will be referred in the events with their own names. For example: &quot;Go to the abandoned &quot;WAREHOUSE&quot; and meet Herb &quot;The Rat&quot; at 5 o'clock (AFTERNOON). He knows what's going on in the house of the terrible old man (OLD HOUSE)&quot;. This way you know you have to go to the WAREHOUSE at any time in the AFTERNOON. But you won't find Herb &quot;The Rat&quot; at any other time. So time is essential to the plot. And the board serves to shape a new city with every dark mystery.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 36-card deck is a simple means for helping small children learn letters and numbers.  There is one card for each letter of the alphabet, and one for each numeral 1-10.  On the back is the letter or number, on the front the same with an illustration (e.g. Z &quot;zebra&quot; with a picture of a zebra; or &quot;5 balls&quot; with a picture).&#10;&#10;Simple games include:&#10;&#10;- Simple Spelling Game.  Spread out the letter cards, and pick out the first and last letter of a common word, e.g. C-T.  Let the child figure out what goes in between, with help if necessary.&#10;&#10;- Easy Counting.  Have the child count the items out loud on the illustrated side, or have two numbers and have them figure out what the sum is.&#10;&#10;Some editions have rules for advanced games:&#10;&#10;- A.B.C. Rummy.  Deal 7 cards to each player.  In a turn, draw 1, lay down 3 or more consecutive letters or numbers and/or add to existing sequences, and discard 1.  First one out cards wins 5 points per card in others' hands.&#10;&#10;- A.B.C. Kasino.  Deal 4 to each player and 4 face up in the middle.  In a turn a player plays a card to the table, capturing other cards if adjacent to them, or leaving it there if unable to capture.  After the cards are played out, deal 4 more each, etc., until all cards are played.  Remaining cards go to the last capturer.  Most cards captured wins.&#10;&#10;- Snip &amp; Snap.  Deal the deck to 2 players, who take turns exposing the top card in their pile.  They &quot;Snip&quot; each time, unless the card is adjacent to the opponent's last card, when he says &quot;Snap&quot; and captures his whole face-up pile.  Continue until someone has all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This early word card game has players all trying to find words simultaneously, from the same set of cards.&#10;&#10;There are two decks of 56 cards each.  The green-backed deck's cards have single letters or 2-letter combinations on them, and is suitable for children as well as adults (2-6 players).  The red deck is for larger groups (4-10) and older players, and has 2- or 3-letter combinations, as well as individual letters in red ink.  Each card also has a point value attached.&#10;&#10;Any even number of cards is dealt out, so the total is about 50 cards with one deck, 100 cards for both.  (E.g. 25 for 4 players, 20 each for 5, 18 for 6, etc.)  The remainder makes a face up pool in the center.  Players hands are kept face down, and all start by turning up the top card, starting their pack.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of exposing the top card of your hand onto your pack (and presumably waiting a short time for people to think).  At any time, if a player can make a word out of 2 or more of the visible cards, they call it out and play stops.  If the word is verified, the caller takes the entire packs containing the cards he used, and places them at the bottom of his hand.  Red letters may only be used as the first or last letter of their word.&#10;&#10;If two players call out at the same time, the longer word wins; if tied, the packs involved go into the pool.  If a word is wrong and challenged, the challenger gets the packs; if the challenge was incorrect, the challenger's pack goes into the pool.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who gets all the cards; or, after a set length of time, it is the player with the highest total value in his cards.&#10;&#10;",
