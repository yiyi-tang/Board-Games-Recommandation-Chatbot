The bottleneck area held by German forces was no more than a few miles wide and defended by no more than three divisions. From the East, the Soviets would toss a total of 14 divisions and 100 tanks to smash the Nazi. From the West, across the Neva River, another 2-3 divisions and a tank brigade would conduct an amphibious assault. The battle would last over 30 days and desperate for both sides. At first, Red forces seriously broke through, forcing Hitler to cancel his own offensive to seize Leningrad and divert General Mainstein's forces to save the impending disaster. The battle was also the debut for Germany's new AFV, the Tiger tank!&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;&bull; 11&quot; x 17&quot; map&#10;&bull; 280 counters&#10;&bull; 11 page rules&#10;&bull; 2 page Player aid&#10;&#10;",

(For example, the orange die has farm-related objects, so it is set aside if the players are in a town or city.)&#10;&#10;The game is designed for a single player or multiple players working cooperatively, but includes rules for playing competitively with multiple sets.&#10;&#10;",

Game board has a wonderfully lithographed fantasy land where one takes paths to get to the Enchanted Isle.  The center of the board has two castle, woods, bears, a tent, a windmill and a church.  The paths weave along the outside and into the center.  The paths along the outside represent water and has pictures of a steamboat, canoeist, serpent, and whale.  The four corners of board are one city scene, one house scene, one mermaid and one lighthouse. This particular version, with a plain box (likely considered &quot;deluxe&quot; at that time) is later than the first 1876 version, which probably featured a more decorative printed image on the box cover. This version probably dates from around 1900.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sandbox hill is a miniatures wargame that uses plastic army men as soldiers and die-cast metal cars as tanks and can be played in about any location.&#10;&#10;The game requires you supply:&#10;&#10;    Soldiers: at least 60 army men preferably in two colors&#10;    Tanks: at least 6 die cast metal cars (hot-wheels, matchbox, etc)&#10;    Artillery: several hundred large rubber bands&#10;    Mines: a hand full of quarters (or equivalent coins)&#10;    The Injurator: One large pair of scissors&#10;    The Mauler: One large hammer&#10;    The Moverator: A piece of string twelve inches long.&#10;    The Rangefinder: A standard twelve inch ruler.&#10;    The Iron Dice: One or two six-sided dice.&#10;    Eye Preserver: Two pairs of safety goggles&#10;&#10;&#10;In the game players take turns activating 5 soldiers or tanks, most can move and shoot on turn but there are a variety of different troop types with some special abilities modifying this. Dexterity based rubber band flicks are used for ranged combat and die rolling for close combat. Damage is represented by either a die roll that tells what part of the infantry figure to cut off with The Injurator (large scissor) or for tanks a blow with The Mauler (large hammer)&#10;&#10;The game rules are available for free download as a full color PDF from http://www.animalball.com/games.html&#10;&#10;",

The nouns are reserved in a stock for players to select one when they want/need to. A players hand goes down by one, except when they play a noun.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one to get rid of all their words first. The strategy is therefore to block other players and force them to select nouns because they cannot play any other valid words.&#10;&#10;Along the way a lot of fun is had by placing unexpected nouns in the sentences.

    "Description": "This is a game system aimed at providing a campaign framework for players of General Quarters III and other naval wargames for their Solomon Island games. It is the first part of ODGW's Decision at Sea series.&#10;&#10;The game determines weather, random events, intelligence reports, etc. for each month-long campaign turn. Scenarios are generated by a decision tree approach rather than map based movement. Air, submarine and surface warfare is included. The initial Battle of Savo Island includes scenario specific rules and can also be played separate from a campaign. The game can be played with or without a referee.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1959 and world has descended into madness. A Capitalist Empire, lead from Washington D.C., is locked in mortal conflict with the Communist Bloc, controlled by an iron fisted Kremlin. For how eagerly the two sides have rattled their sabers, neither power is truly prepared for total war in the nuclear age. Tanks and missile cruisers, jet fighters and Kalashnikovs, roll off assembly lines and straight into one of a dozen charred wastelands strewn across the globe. Each side prays for a quick victory, as neither can sustain the horrors of the nuclear age for long.&#10;&#10;DEFCON 1 is a diceless wargame meant to loosely simulate a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. The game supposes that neither nation&rsquo;s economy is prepared for nuclear conflict. Production represents the sole random chance element in the game. Each turn, players draw random units according to the size of their economy, and strategically deploy them across the globe, each side struggling to achieve victory by taking their opponent&rsquo;s homeland before their economy suffers total collapse.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you get all your balloons safely into the stratosphere?  But watch out for falling hailstones!&#10;&#10;Each player has 4 balloons and tries to move all of them from the bottom to the top row of the Sky Grid.  The first player to do so wins the game.  If a balloon hits a hailstone then the balloon is burst and returns to the bottom row.  Players may also burst other players balloons by squashing it between their own balloons and/or a hailstone.  Balloons can jump diagonally over balloons of the same colour (counts as one move) all the way up the Sky Grid thus being an efficient way of using the action-points allocated each turn.&#10;&#10;To begin a game, the 10 hailstones are lined up in the stratosphere (one in each square).  Each player places their pawn on the corresponding 'Big Balloon' space on the Flight Path on the outside of the board.  Then players place their balloons on any squares on the bottom of the Sky Grid (each player places one balloon in turn until all balloons are placed).  Several balloons can occupy the same square for the first 3 rows (green area).  Beyond row 3 (in the blue area) - only one balloon to a square.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn they roll a 10-sided dice and move their pawn around the Flight Path.  When the pawn lands on or passes certain squares it gives that player a number of action-points (1-4) in which to move their balloons in an upwards direction (vertical or diagonal).  The action-points may be split among the player's balloons as they see fit.  When a player's pawn lands on a 'Storm Clouds' square on the Flight Path the player must move any hailstone of their choice down one square.  If a player's pawn lands on a 'Wind Clouds' square the player must move any one of their balloons one square sideways (if that is impossible - their lowest balloon is deemed burst, and falls back to the ground.)&#10;&#10;Players can choose to stop their pawn on the Storm/Wind Clouds squares even if the number thrown on the dice could take the pawn past.&#10;&#10;When a player's pawn passes or lands on a Kite/Cloud square in the corner of the Flight Path the player also throws the dice to determine which of the 10 hailstones moves down one square.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has moved all their balloons to the top of the Sky Grid or when a hailstone hits the ground (in which case each balloon carries a score for the height it has reached, the highest total score then wins the game).  For a quicker game, players can agree that the first balloon to reach the stratosphere ends the game - then the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

On the delivery stations (beige), one of each of the eight destination tiles are placed randomly, face up.  On each of the pick-up stations (green), two passenger/freight tiles are placed randomly, face down.  Players roll a die to move (and sometimes advance the sun along its path in the sky).  As trains arrive at a pick-up station, players reveal the goods/passengers.  Sometimes, the player will load them onto their cars (limited number of cars on each train).  Sometimes, they will leave them for other players to pick up.  A player can even take a passenger part-way and leave them for another train to complete the job later.&#10;&#10;The idea is to work together to see how many jobs will be completed before the game ends.&#10;&#10;",
