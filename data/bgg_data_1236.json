Each turn you will roll and choose a path to mow. You also have broken down trucks in the yard that you have to mow around. Though your prized mower is faithful, its only faithful in the fact that it gives you headaches! These headaches are problems that arise with your mower that you have to contend with during the game. If you get all the spaces mowed, eliminate the ant hills, and make it home, you win!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Roberts Award nominations and awards &mdash; Alexandros and I Am Spartacus. This expanded edition features both games along with their multiple expansions, three in total, to round out this impressive, DELUXE package with two full-size game maps and updated graphics throughout.&#10;&#10;Alexandros: Conquest &amp; Empire&#10;This Mike Markowitz design originally appeared in issue 10 of Command magazine in 1991 to immediate acclaim. It earned a final nominee spot for the Charles S. Roberts Award for &ldquo;Best Graphics,&rdquo; and won the award for &ldquo;Best Pre-World War II Game.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It covers all of Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns from 334 to 323 BC. One player commands the Macedonians and the other the Persians. It&rsquo;s easily adaptable for solitaire play. The area map is based on the province boundaries of those times, and game turns are quarterly. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate battlefield display with units assigned to various sectors of the engagement. There are also special rules for besieging cities.&#10;&#10;Play lasts a variable numbers of turns, depending on the course of the larger war. There are several ways to win, including the killing of enemy leaders and conquering a large mass of territory, which can end the game at any time. Otherwise, play continues to the summer of 323, when Alexander actually died historically. An optional rule allows play to go to 318.&#10;&#10;BONUS MATERIAL: Also included, are two expansions that were published in later editions of Command Magazine.  &#10;These are Successors: Clash of Generals, 323-301 BC and Xenophon: March of the Ten-Thousand, 401-400 BC.&#10;&#10;I Am Spartacus: The Slave Rebellion Against Rome, 73-71 BC&#10;This second featured game design by Mike Markowitz originally appeared in issue 15 of Command magazine in 1992. The game earned a finalist spot for the Charles S. Roberts Award for &ldquo;Best Pre-World War II Game.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;This is a two-player (solitaire adaptable) simulation of the Third Servile War, the slave revolt that shook the Roman Republic from 73-71 BC. Barring the capture of Rome by the Rebel player, or the capture of Spartacus by the Roman player, both of which are sudden death victories, the game is won on points for territorial control and other issues. At the end of 17 turns, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;BONUS MATERIAL: Also included is yet another expansion from a later issue of Command Magazine entitled Pyrrhic Victory: Legion vs Phalanx, 280-275 BC, and several historical and informational articles on the period.&#10;&#10;Complexity:  Low to Medium &#10;Solitaire Suitability:  Medium&#10;Time Scale: Alexandros is Seasonal &ndash; I Am Spartacus - Monthly&#10;Map Scale: Both are area strategic&#10;Unit Scale: Legions&#10;Players: Two&#10;&#10;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Now it is time to upgrade your ships to the limits of today&rsquo;s technology, and ready them with the brave pilots. Now it is time to go beyond the deep blackness of space into the truly unknown universe&hellip;&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black, players have access to four new ships that they can upgrade their original ships to. To do this, they will need to hire specialized pilots. There are many pilots to hire, each possessing a unique special ability. Pilots are also specialized in what ships they are trained to use. Hiring the right pilot for a ship reduces that pilot's cost. The more ships a pilot is specialized in, the weaker their special ability is. Pilots are hired by spending unused dice that correspond with the four different ship types, and are worth victory points during play. Pilots are shuffled into a deck and splayed out like planets.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black introduces a press-your-luck exploration option for players. This allows players to venture beyond the planets and into deep space where they might encounter dwarf planets worth victory points, or rare materials that yield resources... or they may encounter cosmic threats like solar storms, black holes, and even supernovas. Either way, exploring deep space provides a player with exploration badges. These badges are tallied up at the end of the game and players are rewarded bonus victory points based on who has the most of a certain badge type. They are four types of badges to collect.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black also comes with additional planets and new and exciting secret missions to explore!&#10;&#10;",

Players are competing to manage and grow their entire mining outfit while acquiring the most gold before the ground is too frozen to dig. The Alaskan countryside is an inhospitable environment, so players will face hardships that affect their entire outfit &ndash; not to mention the ever-dropping temperature that will shut down their operation.&#10;&#10;In Pay Dirt players start with a small basic crew, an unimpressive claim, mediocre equipment and just a little bit of cash to make a go in one of the toughest competitions this side of the globe. Gold mining isn&rsquo;t cheap and players will have to sell their gold throughout the game to keep the equipment running and their workers happy. Through clever use of their equipment and workers, players can make their mining outfits more efficient and dialed in to their preference of play. Will you recruit heavily and stack your camp with workers or will you keep your eyes on better and more efficient equipment? Will you have what it takes to hit to strike it rich and hit pay dirt?&#10;&#10;",

The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Defenders The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.&#10;&#10;These new features include a Campaign Mode, with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.&#10;&#10;Caravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.&#10;&#10;Skills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.&#10;&#10;The Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part of the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As player progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans are critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This entry is for deluxe edition of Tiny Epic Western, which also includes Kickstarter Deluxe Promo Pack.&#10;&#10;&#10;HOOK: Poker meets worker-placement&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION: The West is growing day by day, and you&rsquo;re looking to stake your claim. To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner! Yippie kay yay a!&#10;&#10;",

They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions&rsquo; leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace&hellip; but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.&#10;&#10;You have fought hard and established your Kingdom, but peace never lasts.&#10;&#10;Your scouts report that hordes of treacherous monsters is approaching the outskirts of your Capital City.

    "Description": "This entry is for deluxe edition of Tiny Epic Quest, which also includes Quest for the Golden Mushrooms expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.&#10;&#10;Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.&#10;&#10;Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.&#10;&#10;During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Welcome to a world of total warfare. Your wizards used to be powerful enough to hold your enemies at bay, but ever since the monks discovered the power contained in The Six Great Temples, everything has fallen to chaos, and none of your industrial weapons can restore peace to your lands. Your only hope for survival rests in forbidden and forgotten magic: To save your people from extinction, you must harness the power of the four elements and awaken the protector of Eden.&quot;&#10;&#10;Titans Of Eden is a fast-paced deck-building card game for 2-6 players. Each player starts with a deck of basic cards, and has to choose each turn whether they want to play powerful cards to battle their opponents, or energy-granting cards that add elemental cards to their deck for future turns.&#10;&#10;There are four main elements in Eden, and the strategies and abilities of each element are strong against one other element. This leads to fundamentally balanced gameplay: For example, if your opponent is going hard on an Ice strategy, you can use Fire cards to neutralize their cards and counter their moves. To do well in Titans Of Eden, you must build a balanced deck that can effectively respond to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, you battle your opponents. Once you destroy their three temples, you win the game. With this victory condition, you have to play to win, every turn, because you're never more than 3 turns from victory, and never more than three turns from defeat.&#10;&#10;Titans Of Eden includes a classic (Dominion-style) deck-building format for casual play, and a constructed format for competitive play. In the constructed format, each player builds a spellbook before playing, which they use to take on their opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To categorize it, Chlorination is a strategic, card-based board game that consists of a number of competitions. During the game, you&rsquo;ll need to choose your actions carefully. You&rsquo;ll also need to plan your economy and most importantly you&rsquo;ll need to practice enough to win the competitions throughout the game.

Before and between every competition, every player get five actions. The actions can be found on the game board and you can either work to earn coins, you'll need coins to pay competition fees and for other things. But you can also practice using skill cards. Whenever you work you earn a certain number of coins and skill cards depending on where you choose to work. Whenever you practice you move your cube on the score table the number that skill card shows. The player with the highest skill level in the the swimstyle of a competition wins and the player with the most medals wins the game in the end. A gold, a silver and a bronze medal are handed out every competition.&#10;&#10;Watch the tutorial to learn more about the game of Chloriantion.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Unconditional Surrender! Western Campaigns (USWC) is an strategic-level game covering World War 2 campaigns fought between the Axis and Western Allied factions in Western Europe. With its emphasis on force projection, players focus on the big picture of managing their military forces. Using simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the action without complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.&#10;&#10;Plucked from the game Unconditional Surrender! WW2 in Europe (USE), USWC provides shorter, smaller footprint scenarios for those wanting to play the Unconditional Surrender! design but lacking the space and time needed for the much larger USE. USWC also serves as an alternative way to teach it to other players. Owners of USE that have the space and time for it, do not have to buy this game. However, it may be worth it, if you are looking for something much more portable to bring somewhere else to play or for an inexpensive gift for a wargaming friend.&#10;&#10;DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS:&#10;&#10;Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is incredibly low.&#10;Simple Stacking: No more than one of the same type of unit per hex.&#10;No Factors on Counters: No combat or movement factors on counters.&#10;Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air or ground combat.&#10;Integrated Movement &amp; Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation.&#10;Ergonomically Friendly: Easily fits in extremely limited gaming space.&#10;&quot;Use it or lose it.&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping.&#10;Easy to Modify: The relatively simple mechanics make it easy to modify the game.&#10;Unconditional Surrender! World War 2 in Europe Compatibility: The ground and air units, event markers, and combat system are the same in both games. The scenarios are similar except for the elements that were abstracted. If you later decide to play USE, you will have additional rules to learn but little to unlearn.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: Monthly Turns&#10;MAP SCALE:  30 to 40 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Army, Fleet, or Wing&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2&#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENT LIST &#10;6 8.5&quot;x11&quot; maps&#10;1 Countersheet&#10;1 Rules Booklet&#10;1 Play Book&#10;2 11&quot;x17&quot; Player Aid cards&#10;1 Faction Card&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Game Box&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Lorraine Forces are modelled on those of France with not dissimilar uniforms, while the VFS - the United Free Provinces - are a fairly tight agglomeration of small principalities, republics, city states and so on, united to oppose Lorraine. The VFS uniforms, inspired by a number of European armies, provide a colourful contrast to the white of Lorraine.&#10;&#10;This action takes place in a fairly remote northern area of the border between the two adversaries, the line of demarcation being the River Kneller. On the Lorraine side of the border, to the south, is the small province of St.Michel which unknowingly is about to become the focus of enemy operations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Limited Edition Ancient Gate of Targa!&#10;&#10;This deluxe resin terrain piece depicts a massive and ancient stone portal, flanked by monolithic alien statues on either side of the shimmering gate! Constructed eons ago by the Ancients of the Targa Plateau, these powerful portals could create stable gateways to OtherWorlds across all of time and space. A stunning centerpiece, this set also includes a brand new Mission (When Worlds Collide) using the Ancient Gate in your games of Shadows of Brimstone.&#10;&#10;Mission: When Worlds Collide - An ancient alien portal has been unearthed in the hills and accidentally activated by a local group of miners, creating a shimmering gateway in the weathered stone portal. With an arc of crackling energy, the alien Void Crystals powering the gate overloaded and shattered, scattering fragments of crystal across space and time! As the gate flickers, cycling its connection through several different worlds, it wreaks havoc across dimensions. The Heroes must race against time to venture through the gate and recover the fragments of shattered Void crystal from across worlds before the stone portal overloads and explodes!&#10;&#10;This set includes an all-new scenario set piece for Shadows of Brimstone: the mysterious and alien ANCIENT GATE from the Targa Plateau, plus a new Mission that utilizes multiple Worlds and a brand new Void Storm Depth Event chart to add extra challenge to Adventures. As the Heroes hunt for the fragments of a shattered Void crystal, the malfunctioning Ancient Gate shifts its connection between worlds and begins to merge them, crossing the World Card effects and Enemies of one World onto the next!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The house is secure, so it&rsquo;s time to turn your attention further afield and sort the gardens of Creepstone Manor.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, being a ghost has certain disadvantages. For one, handling a spade is tricky when your hand keeps passing straight through it! But help is on hand. The resurrected gardeners from the Manor&rsquo;s heyday have returned to lend their rotted expertise to you. Use your crew of Zombies, Skeletons and Ghouls to grab plants and ornaments for your part of the garden; hire new crew members such as werewolves and vampires to boost your work and get those extra flowers planted before the night is over. But beware! Only those ghosts who show the greatest aesthetic eye will impress Spookie and be the best undead Haunticulturist.&#10;&#10;During their turn, players will bid for plant and ornament tiles using the monster cards they have in hand. Each monster has a gardening skill number (the higher the better) and up to two special abilities. During bidding, players will need to consider both the row and column their monsters are in when trying to grab those tokens. On top of this, if a player can play the third in a row of a particular monster type (say zombie or skeleton) they'll be rewarded with a boosted special ability on that card.&#10;&#10;Players also can earn gold in the game, either through clearing 'junk' from their player board or various monster abilities. These can be used to hire 'special monsters' that have enhanced skills and abilities which the player keeps from round to round, replacing the basic monsters the player starts with.&#10;&#10;After bidding, each player will place any plant tokens onto their personal flower bed (even the bad ones that score negative points!). How these are placed will affect the players' scores at the end of the game. How each plant will score can be varied by the players, changing the challenge from game to game.&#10;&#10;Players can also use the gold earned earlier to build any ornament tiles earned during bidding. Do you fill up on gnomes to get the highest score, or shoot for the all-or-nothing fountain?&#10;&#10;Finally, players can earn points for a secret objective card selected at the beginning of the game. These feature a way to score that is unique to that player, and can be the difference between winning and losing.&#10;&#10;The game ends after four rounds, at which point each player tallies up their score for plants, ornaments and secret objectives with the highest score being crowned Head Haunticulturist!&#10;&#10;Haunticulture also includes rules for solo play&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

If you know how to play Werewolf, you already know how to play Shitty Werewolf, but here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the rules&hellip;&#10;&#10;Everyone is secretly a villager or a werewolf, and over a series of night/day rounds, the werewolves will secretly eat villagers at night while the whole town will execute someone every day. The villagers are trying to kill all the werewolves while the werewolves are trying to eat enough villagers to outnumber them before they are executed. The game requires a moderator to run things and with special powers can get really complicated, but the core is a very simple game based around arguing with each other.&#10;&#10;Unlike traditional Werewolf, the roles/powers in Shitty Werewolf frequently break not just the conventions of the genre but also the basic play loop of the game itself all while exploring the social dynamics present in all group interactions. With roles like the &ldquo;Socially Awkward Friend Who Hates Werewolf but Didn&rsquo;t Want to Make a Fuss About It&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mansplainer&rdquo; games can start to unravel around the all-too-real social conventions and conversational baggage we bring to the experience of playing Werewolf. But this high mindedness is coupled with roles like the &ldquo;Swearwolf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Raccoon&rdquo; that make it clear that this is still a game about being weird together, even if you might end up with some deep thoughts along the way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pixel Dorks is an action/strategy duel for 2 players&#10;For eons, the Red and Blue Dorks coexisted in harmony, until one fateful day, a joint team of Dorks of both colors made an imaginary and nonsensical scientific breakthrough. They discovered the underlying building block of all life -- The Pixel. Harnessing the power of the Pixels allowed the Dorks to manipulate reality at its most basic levels, permitting magical feats of greatness. As the Dorks are vaguely human-like, war inevitably ensued.&#10;&#10;You control Mages battling each other for control of Towers, because that's where they store their Pixels, I guess. Use your imagination, do I have to do everything?&#10;&#10;Summon and command your Minions.&#10;&#10;Upgrade your Mage into a force to be reckoned with.&#10;&#10;Cast spells and time the use of your special Powers to overcome your enemy.&#10;&#10;Take Control of all the Mage Towers to win!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Features:&#10;Grid movement on a Map of Terrain with varied effects&#10;Flip &amp; Write&#10;Hand-drawn Pixel Art&#10;Large variety of Spell cards&#10;Big Player Mats&#10;8 characters with unique abilities&#10;8 different Maps to play on&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The royal city of Thaera&acute;Ijun is the starting point of your expedition all the way across the continent. From here, you&rsquo;ll set out to face thrilling adventures and perilous challenges. You&rsquo;ll pass by endless grassy plains, advance into the depths of impenetrable forests, traverse the Obsidian Islands of the Westbound Reach, enter the legendary City of Outer Sands, leave the hostile Great Salt Desert behind you, walk the mysterious Nowhere Trail, find a way through Stonewalled Lives and finally &ndash; after slipping past the great Ice Wall and its dangerous narrow places &ndash; arrive, emaciated and exhausted, at the foot of the mighty fortress in the ice. And here, your greatest test awaits you.&#10;&#10;Gather Companions around you, overcome epic tests and vanquish the mighty walls of the Citadel. Always remember: In the contest to conquer it, you&rsquo;re competing with other fellowships. It isn&rsquo;t the first player to get hold of the Crown of the Princes of the Northern Lands who&rsquo;ll definitely be able to claim the glory of victory, but the one who, using a well-thought-out strategy, captures treasures (Victory Points) and valuable objects (cards) at the right points in the game.&#10;&#10;Arkenshield is a turn-based, &ndash; deck building &ndash; boardgame for 1 to 4 players. It combines components of a boardgame with those of a card game. Thanks to the large number of Companions, movement tokens, cards, and events, it&rsquo;s never boring, as it offers new and different possibilities &ndash; especially in interaction with other players. The use of dice is explicitly avoided. Instead, it is more important to succeed with your strategic abilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player selects a player piece. All players then place their player piece on the cash point square of the outta section of the game board. All players roll the dice, the player with the highest dice roll is the Banker, who distributes assets from the Bank to the players. Each player is given 3,000 in cash divided as follows: two 500s, ten 100s, ten 50s and twenty five 20s. All remaining cash and other equipment go to the Bank.&#10;&#10;General&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, the player roll the dice and move his/her player piece forward the number of spaces as rolled on the dice. If the player owns any Shows or Props, they can move these between their owned bars during their turn.&#10;If the player lands on an unowned bar, the player may buy it for the price listed on that bar&rsquo;s space. The money is given to the Bank in exchange for the Property Acquired Card for that premises. Shows can be purchased immediately and added to the premies, increasing its earn when visited. Props can be added when a player owns 2 properties next to each other and Hotel Deals can be purchased when a player owns 4 properties in the same district (colour).&#10;When players land on a property owned by another player, they must pay the player the amount stated on the Property Acquired Card including extra charges if the premises has Shows or Hotel Deal added.&#10;If the player lands on his or her own property, nothing happens.&#10;When players land on Lotto spaces they must contribute 100 Benidorm Bucks to the prize pool in the centre of the board, any fines, the money will be also added to this prize pool.&#10;When players land on Jager spaces, they must draw a card from the Power of Jager Deck, this will either have good or bad consequences.&#10;If the player is sent to &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo; to sleep it off, they must roll above a 6 to wake up and continue playing, unless they have an &lsquo;Energy Drink&rsquo; card to play.&#10;If the player lands on &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo; space, he or she is &ldquo;Just Passing Through&rdquo;. No penalty applies.&#10;If the player lands on the &lsquo;Spin Out&rsquo;, he or she must move his Player Piece directly to &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo;.&#10;Every time a player passes a Cash Point they collect 200 Benidorm Bucks from the Banker.&#10;You may sell Shows or Props back to the Bank for the full purchase price or sell properties to other players via mutual agreement at any point during the game.&#10;Players can loan other players money and make agreements during the game.&#10;Doubles&#10;When doubles are rolled, the player gets to play again during the same turn.&#10;&#10;The Beach&#10;If instructed to &lsquo;Go to the Beach to sleep it off&rsquo; via either landing on the space stating that or drawing a Jager Card with that instruction, the player must enter the beach and roll above a 6 to continue playing, they can try once per turn.&#10;&#10;Whilst passed out on the beach, if other players enter &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo;, just passing through, they can challenge the player for a bar of their choice, each, and the higher roller wins both bars.&#10;&#10;Lotto&#10;Ant ime a player lands on a Lotto space, they must pay 100 Benidorm bucks to the Prize Pool in the center of the game board.&#10;&#10;Bottom Line&#10;Each turn, try to foresee where players will land after your turn to maximise income and bankrupt your competitors.&#10;&#10;",

Amabie said &quot;draw me and show me to the people, so that you can be free of disease&quot; according to historical experts.&#10;&#10;The game consists of only 6 cards one of which is Amabie. The cards are worth differing points from 0 to 3 (Amabie). Players each look at one card from their hand, the rest remain facedown and then give the other player a card from their hand for 3 rounds. the player at the end with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

While the game is intended to be played by 4 players, they'll soon find a fifth card has been played to each trick: but by who?&#10;&#10;The power is out, and the players must keep a candle from burning out by playing candle-suited cards periodically in the hand.&#10;&#10;There is an amulet suit, and players will use these amulets to ward off the mysterious Fifth Person at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The Fifth Person enters the game after the second trick, with their own deck of black cards.  If a player wins a trick that contains the Black 9, that player is kidnapped, and cards played to tricks they or the Fifth Person win will not have their affects activated (such as re-lighting the candle.)&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players win if the candle remains lit and all players have enough amulet to ward of any black cards they obtained.  A partial victory is granted if at least one player does not have enough amulets.  All players lose if the candle goes out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The hottest football game not just for football fans! Footballiser is a board game in which you can conquer the world of football as both a team leader, club owner and a football player. A game where you not only get to use your strategic skills alongside your dexterity, but also have to exploit both if you want to win the cup!&#10;&#10;The objective of Footballiser is to be the first player to obtain all 6 Stadium Development Items and to win the league final! Footballiser is a turn-based game, meaning in each round players get to decide what action(s) to take. Each round comprises two phases: using of an Action Card and carrying out an operation. An operation may be opting for a Stadium or Team Development (either via trading in trophies previously won for successful matches, or by rolling the Development Dice), or playing a match.&#10;&#10;Stadium Development Items are to be put on one&rsquo;s Development Board, except at the start all 6 sections of the Development Board are occupied by a certain number of flags. To remove flags and therefore to make place for possible Stadium Developments, one has to win matches. When it comes to playing matches, a player has to draw a Match Cards. Match Cards come in four different difficulty levels, often depicting famous football situations. All 50 Match Cards are unique, providing you a pool of possibilities that would be extremely hard to get bored of. The Footballiser Field consist of numbered cells, making Match Cards easily understandable, and the footballer figures easily placeable on the board. One must flick the figures in a way that the figures push to ball to a selected few cells that count as a successful pass, and repeat the process a few times to kick the ball through the goal line.&#10;&#10;After winning the match, the player gets to decide which section to free up for Stadium Development, although it shall not be random, as the usage of Action Cards and Power Cards are often conditioned on a certain level of Stadium Development. Power Cards provide you with a higher chance of winning matches, for example by allowing you to try again certain shots or skip otherwise necessary passes on your way to the goal. Action Cards either provide help for your development in game, or offer up an opportunity to set someone else&rsquo;s development back, for example by having them put Development Items back in the pack or by making them skip turns or limiting their choice when their turn comes. If all the flags are taken off of the Development Board, all Stadium Development Items are placed on their rightful places on the Development Board, you may proceed to play the league final. When you win that, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wolfenb&uuml;ttel War concerns the hostilities of Charles&rsquo; two fictitious mid-eighteenth century combatants, the Grand Duchy of Lorraine and the Vereinigte Freie St&auml;dte (VFS). The scenarios are applicable to any horse and musket period with little modification.&#10;&#10;Where this mini-campaign differs from its predecessors (Raid on St.Michel, The Annexation of Chiraz) is that it is loosely based on a real campaign &ndash; that of the Hundred Days, culminating at Waterloo. The four scenarios and the movements between them are drawn from the battles of Quatre Bras, Ligny, Wavre and Waterloo. However, while the campaign sequence is followed the outcome is far from certain.&#10;&#10;The book provides the fictitious background to the war, planning details including the selection of forces, the instructions for each army, table top maps and orders for each side. There are instructions for the game organiser and options for forces in each battle if fought as a stand alone wargame. The book is illustrated with photographs of each battle as it was fought with Charles&rsquo; armies. Newspapers and a Who&rsquo;s Who, not to mention the Ballroom scene, add colour to the story of the Wolfenb&uuml;ttel War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
