Players move the number of spaces indicated by the number on a card; odd numbers move only one piece, even numbers can be split evenly between two pieces.  Spaces on the board result in the gain or loss of treats (victory points).  Players can also acquire &quot;trick or treat&quot; cards which can be played for extra movement.  Movement is restricted by a rule that a child may never be more than five spaces away from a parent.  There are short cuts that may be taken only by a parent and child together.&#10;&#10;",

A player rolls four dice and puts them in any order he wishes so that they make a four-digit number.

Then the next herd of dinosaurs starts their trek on the path to the finish line.

Each turn represents fifty years, more than enough time for several changes of monarch. Therefore, players are not taking the part of a king. Instead, they represent the changing political goals of their Tribe&rsquo;s collective leadership.&#10;&#10;Players will quickly realize that this is not a game where one Tribe can build an empire and hold onto it for the length of the game. Historically, as soon as any political system becomes set, decomposition begins. In short, empires decline. The effect of economic inflation and administrative inefficiency is built into the game. Victory lies in creating as glorious an empire as possible and cutting losses when it falls.&#10;&#10;",

Then it is a matter of setting up the other colorful bits such as the starting stalls, the finishing post and of course the five lovely plastic horses complete with weighted swinging jockeys.&#10;&#10;Players then present their stall cards to get their starting places and have an opportunity to bet on who they think will hit the finish line first.&#10;&#10;From here it is a matter of turning a crank at the starting line which causes the track to vibrate under the horses propelling them slowly forward, until a winner emerges.&#10;&#10;As far as I can determine this seems entirely random (although the weighted jockeys seem to behave differently each time). Though the game would be a great beer and pretzels action affair or for those loving horse racing. Due to the random nature and betting I wouldn't really recommend for youngsters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Svenskt br&auml;dspel (Swedish Tables), more commonly known as just Br&auml;dspel or Br&auml;de, is a Backgammon relative native to Sweden. It's the last surviving member of the 17th-century Verkehren/Revertier family of games, that mainly differ from Backgammon in forbidding the closing of the first eleven points - making it possible to win by &quot;locking out&quot; one's opponent, called jan in the Swedish terminology. Br&auml;dspel adds to Verkehren a third objective - arranging one's pieces in one of four preset patterns - and rules for hitting a closed point under special circumstances.&#10;&#10;A Br&auml;dspel table was brought aboard the warship Vasa on her ill-fated maiden voyage in 1628. When the ship was salvaged in 1961, that board rekindled interest in the game, helping it survive where other Verkehren games died out. Today, the game is governed by the Swedish Tables Association of the Vasa Museum, which holds annual championships right next to old Vasa.&#10;&#10;RULES: &#10;(Slight variants may exist. These rules are based on the (lengthier, complete) rules used in the Swedish Championships.)&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board (similar to a backgammon board), 15 checkers (game pieces) each of two colours for a total of 30 pieces, and 2 regular dice.&#10;A full match is usually played as best out of a predetermined odd number of games. Winning a single game gives 1-4 points as described below.&#10;&#10;The fields are called tongues and are numbered from 1-24 for each player, starting with 1 at the top right tongue as seen from the player, and going counterclockwise around the board with 24 in the lower right corner. Tongue number 1 is called  a player&rsquo;s &rdquo;home&rdquo; and number 12 is referred to as &quot;huk&quot;. Fields 1-6 constitute the first quarter, 7-12 the second, 13-18 the third, and 19-24 the fourth.&#10;&#10;Preparations: Each player choses one color and places all his/her 15 checkers on his/her home tongue in the upper, right corner. The starting order for the first game is determined by rolling one die each after which the player with the lowest result goes first. In consecutive games the loser of the previous game starts.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: &#10;The players take turns throwing the dice and (if possible) moving their pieces. The game pieces are moved counter-clockwise according to the dice. If a player is able to make a move it is obligatory to do so. If only one die can be used it is mandatory to do so. The player can choose to move the same piece for both dice or move a different piece for each die. If moving the same piece for both dice it is forbidden to add up the the numbers and land immediately on the field corresponding to the sum. The piece has to be moved first according to either of the dice and then according to the other. If both dice show the same number they are counted double, e.g. if two fives are thrown the player moves 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 steps and the player can distribute these four moves freely on 1-4 game pieces.&#10;&#10;There must never be game pieces of opposite colors on the same tongue. A player may have no more than one game piece each on tongues nr 2-11, and once the home has been reduced to one game piece the same applies to that field. On tongues 12-24 the number of the player's own game pieces is unlimited. If a game piece lands on a tongue with a single opponent piece, that piece is &rdquo;beaten,&rdquo; meaning that it is temporarily taken out and has to re-enter the game by landing on a tongue in the first quarter that is either vacant or has a single piece of the opponent&rsquo;s colour. (See exception under blasting &ndash; b below) No other moves are allowed for a player with one or more beaten pieces until they are all back in play.&#10;&#10;Two or more pieces of the same colour on a tongue are referred to as bands. A game piece may normally not land on one of the opponent's bands. (Exception explained under &rdquo;blasting&rdquo; a-b below.)&#10;&#10;Blasting: &#10;Though it is not normally allowed to land on a field containing a band of the opposite colour there are two exceptions. Beating more than one piece at once like this is called blasting. &#10;a) If a player has bands on six or more consequtive fields the opponent may beat all the pieces on one of these fields by landing on it.&#10;b) If the opponent has bands in a player&rsquo;s first quarter and the player&rsquo;s only opportunity to get all his beaten pieces back into play is by landing on one or more of the opponent&rsquo;s bands he is allowed to do so, blasting the opponent&rsquo;s pieces.&#10;If a player has exited all pieces but one from the game it is no longer allowed to blast with that last piece.&#10;&#10;Winning conditions:&#10;There are several different winning conditions (five if counted as below) plus the possibility for a player to surrender a game. A surrendered game gives one point to the winner. A player can surrender at any time as long as he has not yet formed any band in his third or fourth quarter. After doing so surrendering is no longer allowed, even if the band(s) has/have since been broken.&#10;&#10;1. &quot;Home play&quot; Exiting the board with all 15 checkers. (1 point for winner)&#10;Once all of a player&rsquo;s pieces are in the fourth quarter he can start taking them out of the game by throwing at least the number required to reach an imaginary 25th tongue. (If a piece is beaten at this stage it has to re-enter and move all the way into the fourth quarter before any furher pieces of that colour can exit.)&#10;&#10;2 &rdquo;Beautiful game&rdquo; (1 point for  winner)&#10;There are four different winning conditions referred to as &quot;beautiful game&quot; which are all obtained by arranging the game pieces in specific patterns in the fourth quarter. They all give one point to the winner. Both dice must be counted, i.e. a player can not win this way by only moving for one of the two numbers thrown. However, if a player can win through &rdquo;beautiful game&rdquo; by casting one die only he may chose to do so. In case of failiure he may only cast one die on each of his two following turns. The four variants of beautiful game are:&#10;2a. Three pieces each on tongues 20-24 &#10;2b. Five pieces each on tongues 22-24&#10;2c. Three pieces on tongue 22, five pieces on tonge 23, and seven pieces on tongue 24&#10;2d. All fifteen pieces on tongue 24.&#10;&#10;3. &quot;Monk&quot; (2 points for winner)&#10;3a) &rdquo;Homeplay with monk&quot; Winning by homeplay while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.&#10;3b) &quot;Beautiful game with monk&quot; Winning by beautiful game while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.&#10;&#10;4. &quot;Jan&quot; (2 points for winner)&#10;If a player beats more of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces than can possibly re-enter the game (due to a lack of available tongues in the first quarter) that player wins the game. This is called &rdquo;making the opponent Jan&rdquo;&#10;&#10;5. &quot;Blast-Jan&quot; (4 points for winner) &#10;Making the opponent Jan by blasting a band.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This a little dice game that we play in our town (Oruro, Bolivia), the popular name is Capi Futbol because it's based on another dice game called Capi Manda (or The Captain give orders) that is kind of like poker dice...&#10;&#10;In order to play you just need 5 dice, a cup, and you have to draw a sketch of a football pitch (divided in 5 areas: goal area - field - midfield (the mid line does is not a divisor line) - field - goal area) and a counter that represent the ball (we almost always use a bottle cap).&#10;&#10;The game starts with the &quot;ball&quot; at midfield. After a &quot;toss&quot; the one who has the kick off shakes the dice in the cup and the other player does the same (always after the one who is the Captain at time), then the non-captain player can re-roll from 1 to 5 dice, after he does the captain can do the same, they both can no use the re roll (see SIT DOWN below).&#10;&#10;This way they play &quot;poker hands&quot; with rankings like this: 5 same (Grande), 1 different (Poker), 2 same 3 same (Full House), 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6 or 3,4,5,6,1 (Escaleras, in ties the higher straight wins, 3 of the same (Tricas, 111 the higher, 222 the lowest), pairs, if neither of you has anything then both players put all the 5 dice in their cup and play simultaneously with no re-rolls with highest winning.&#10;&#10;Every time a player wins a hand, he moves the ball one space towards the opponents goal area.&#10;&#10;When you are playing in the goal area if the Attacking player wins it's a goal, you can play to a certain amount of goals,or with a time limit.&#10;&#10;suggested optional rules.&#10; DESPEJE (Shot from the goal keeper) after winning a hand in his own goal area a player may choose to made a Despeje.&#10;&#10;If he does he rolls one die and moves the number of pips in spaces towards the Goal area of the opponent, but when it reaches the goal area then the ball goes back towards the field (some people choose to not let the ball go back to the goal area or field of the shooter).&#10;&#10;After this shot the opponent keeps possession and is now the Captain).&#10;&#10;SIT DOWN (Mid distance shot at the goal) there is no re roll if you are in the &quot;Field&quot; area next to your opponent's Goal area, if the attacker wins its a goal (some people prefer to Announce the shot before a SIT DOWN happens), if the defender wins it's a DESPEJE but this time the defender keeps control after the play.&#10;&#10;&#10;3 LINEUP CHANGES to represent the 3 substitutions of players allowed in a football match, the player can Voltear (turn a dice over to its opposite side) 3 times in a match (i.e. a 3 can become a 4 if using a change, a 2 can become a 5, a 6 can become a 1 etc.) Some people let the attacking player do 1 Volteo each hand if he desires except when he is at the opponent's Goal area.&#10;&#10;Well this game is fun and you can play it anywhere  (because it is a modified game of Generala it's like our national game) and of course it's about luck but not pure luck.&#10;&#10;",

To assist the artistically-challenged, we permit the sculptor to make motions with the dough, however noises (aside from laughter) are forbidden.&#10;&#10;The hilarious game features two varieties of uniquely scented dough that will last several years if maintained properly, and because it is water based, it won&rsquo;t make a mess.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boar Hunt:The Dark Ages Game is a game that appears simple at first glance because there are only 9 spots on the board and 8 playing pieces which all remain on the board during the game after they've been placed.&#10;&#10;Boar Hunt has two teams of 3 Dark Ages &quot;Hunters&quot; and a &quot;Wild Boar&quot;. One player plays the red set and the other plays the white set. The object of the game is to be the first player to capture their &quot;Boar&quot; between 2 of their &quot;Hunters&quot; either going across the board or along the outside circle.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 2 phases as in a 9-Mans Morris Game. The players take turns placing their Boars and Hunters on the board and if no one wins in the placement phase, the players take turns moving their pieces to capture their own Boar between their own Hunters while trying to block their opponent from winning.&#10;&#10;Though there have been countless games through the centuries which use a small format game board (Mu Torere and TicTacToe to name 2)but Boar Hunt is the first that uses 2 teams trying to achieve different but similar goals.&#10;&#10;Boar Hunt:The Dark Ages Game started out as a small game with a leather &quot;Acorn&quot; board with glass playing pieces packaged in an attractive wood box.&#10;&#10;The deluxe version features a solid wood game board with nice details and the playing surface is burnt into the wood using the &quot;pyrography&quot; decorating technique. The playing pieces are hand finished castings of the original playing pieces which look like they were carved in the actual Dark Ages. The playing pieces have a nice heft to them and the game is quite attractive when set up.&#10;&#10;The size of the board (6&quot;x9&quot;x3/4&quot; - 16cm x 23cm x 2cm)and the sculptural quality of the playing pieces will make this an attractive game to leave set up on your desk, coffee table or bookshelf.&#10;&#10;",

Acorn Games has always wanted to produce a game with a solid wood board and playing pieces that allow you to play a multitude of games. They have gathered together four classic games from around the world and have designed four of their own games that can all be played on a classic &quot;Alquerque&quot; board.&#10;&#10;They found some games which use 12 or less pieces of each color that can all be played on the same board. Next they set out to design a series of new games which use the same pieces and board but have either more modern moves or conditions of victory to make them appeal to today&rsquo;s game players.&#10;&#10;The classic games that you will find in the book are;&#10;&#10;Alquerque(&quot;Alquerque&quot; is a Checkers variant) from Spain&#10;Seega(&quot;Seega&quot;) from Africa and Egypt&#10;Cercar La Liebre(similar to &quot;Catch the Hare&quot;) also from Spain&#10;Five Field Kono(&quot;Five Field Kono&quot;) from Korea&#10;&#10;The new games from Acorn Games in the book are;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fortress&quot;, a &quot;condition&quot; game&#10;&quot;Centaurs&quot;, a &quot;replacement&quot; game&#10;&quot;Troop&quot;, another replacement game&#10;&quot;Neutrino&quot;, another condition game&#10;&#10;In a &quot;Replacement Game&quot; the players are each trying to get from&#10;their starting point to where their opponent started out from.&#10;Sort of like in &quot;Chinese Checkers&quot;&#10;&#10;In a &quot;Condition Game&quot; the players&#10;are trying to be the first player to DO something. This may be to&#10;get something like getting 3-in-a-row as in TicTacToe but not&#10;mattering WHERE on the board you achieve this.&#10;&#10;Solid wood construction and pieces as well as a clearly written rule book with diagrams make this a sure bet with teachers and game players alike.&#10;&#10;Not described but playable with the included board of the board game collection as well: &quot;Bagh Bandi&quot;, Bagh Chal from Nepal, and Fanorona Dimy (a Fanorona variant on a five times five board) from Madagascar.

The only problem was how they would get to the other side? They thought that a path of lily pads pads would be the answer, but there were not enough lily pads to go around. Their problem can be solved with the help of the die, so join them and catch the fly!&#10;&#10;In Hop Little Frog, the frogs hop across the pond to catch the flies, but to do so they must first of all &quot;make the lily pads grow&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Announcing Ultra-Quick Tennis!&#10;&#10;My goal in designing this game was to develop a mechanism to quickly play through a tennis tournament. With other tennis games, either the game took too long to realistically complete a full tournament, or the game was too simplistic and produced far too many upsets. As with all of my games, I wanted a quick playing design that closely mirrored reality in the tennis world. The end result is a game that I&acute;m very proud of.&#10;&#10;Ultra-Quick Tennis has been thoroughly tested for statistical accuracy. I am extremely confident that the formulas employed in the game accurately represent each player. To make it a game, I&acute;ve added some elements of chance, as well as some rare play results. Overall, I think you&acute;ll find the winners to be on par with what you would reasonably expect.&#10;&#10;Ultra Quick Tennis includes over 300 professional men from the 2005 ATP Tour and well over 400 professional women from the 2005 WTA Tour. Also included are the full schedules for both Tours.&#10;&#10;Players are accurately rated for each playing surface found on the respective Tours. You'll experience the sheer dominance of Roger Federer on grass. Clay court specialists like Guillermo Coria will shine at Roland Garros, but prove to be mortal on the hard courts at the US Open. Every player will realistically perform as they did in actual tennis competition during the 2005 campaign.&#10;&#10;All of the unusual events that can happen in tennis like injuries, retirements, loss of concentration, arguing line calls all happen in Ultra Quick Tennis as well. The ball is in your court, purchase Ultra Quick Tennis today!&#10;&#10;",

When an Action Card is drawn, the player must follow the command designated.  These can range from announcing, &quot;I am stupid&quot; before taking a drink, to revealing one of your most embarrassing moments, to acting as servant to all of the other players by refilling their drinks, and even making up your own rule as the &quot;Rule Master.&quot; Oh yeah, be weary of the Prison and Hospital spaces, however, you can gain relief by hiding out in the &quot;Safety Zone&quot;.&#10;&#10;Contents: One party board, 100 Action cards, 60 Letter cards, two die, and six tokens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An instructional card game meant to teach players the names, history, functions, and associations of characters and locations in classical mythology.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 76 different cards, which each tell the story of a different mythological figure.&#10;&#10;Included is a pronunciation card, a 2-sided instruction card, and a 4 pages &quot;background&quot; by &quot;the compiler&quot;: Laura Wheaton Abbot Cooke, Chicago, Ill., March 1884.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to collect the cards into &quot;books&quot; (melds). The one who collects the greatest number of books wins the game.&#10;&#10;A book is composed of five specific cards (i.e. Jupiter - the number 1 card- +Saturn + Neptune + Rhea + Ceres). A typical card from the deck shows the name of a god, a small illustration of the god, the names of the four other gods which form a book, and (the largest section) a History, which is not used in game play. Note that the cards are in black and white, so the books lack the modern convenience of color-matching borders.&#10;&#10;There are also a couple of &quot;location&quot; cards which have special effects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Glass Bead Game was created by the Dutch game inventor Christian Freeling in the late 1970s. It was named after the final novel of the German writer Hermann Hesse which was published in 1943 (&quot;Das Glasperlenspiel&quot;). Hesse was put on the Black List of the Nazis while living as a refugee in Switzerland. After continental Europe was liberated, Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. Freeling's game is one of many conceptualizations that were inspired by Hesse's novel.&#10;&#10;The game differs from most traditional Mancala games in having counters with different values. Another unusual concept of the game is that there are two types of capturing (direct and indirect). The game can be played online at Freeling's homepage.&#10;&#10;",
