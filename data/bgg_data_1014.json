    "Description": "A card drafting game for 2-4 players in two parts. In the first part the players build up their dance schools. In the second part the schools participate in competitions.&#10;&#10;There are 3 Decks. The build deck is only used in the first part of the game. The Judging and Competition decks are used in the second part of the game.&#10;&#10;Build Phase:&#10;&#10;The build deck card types include: Students, Teachers, Classes, Numbers, and Modifier cards. Cards have a score in one or more traits, or will give other cards a bonus to their score in one or more traits. Traits include: Base, Beginning, Intermediate, Advanced, Jazz, Tap, Ballet, Contemporary, Modern, Lyrical, Musical Theatre, Hip Hop, Solo, Duet, Form, and Heart. All traits are assigned a score.&#10;&#10;The top 12 cards of the build deck are laid out face up. Players take turns picking 1 card at a time until all 12 cards are picked. This constitutes a round. A short game will have 3 rounds, a medium game 4, and a long game 5 rounds. After the first round, the first player to pick goes to the player who was the last to pick in the previous round. Picked build cards are placed face up in front of their owner in a grid format and remain in play for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Build cards are placed next to each other in a grid like matrix. Side by side (orthogonal) cards and cards whose corners are touching (diagonal) are considered to be adjacent. Many cards will give point bonuses to adjacent cards: &#10;&#10;     Teachers give bonuses to all adjacent students. &#10;     Students give bonuses to adjacent numbers if their style matches, so for example: If it is a jazz number, the number will get jazz bonuses equal to the jazz bonuses of any adjacent students.   &#10;     Some cards give bonuses to all cards of a particular type even if not adjacent. &#10;&#10;&#10;Competition Phase:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Before a competition, each player may switch the places of 2 cards within his grid.   &#10;     First shuffle the Judging deck and draw 5 cards. These are placed face up in the middle of the table. Each judging card lists a trait that the judges are emphasizing. &#10;&#10;&#10;All scores in these traits are doubled for all players in this competition. &#10;&#10;     Next, shuffle the Competition Deck. Each player draws 4 cards and places them face up in front of them. Competition cards will modify a player&rsquo;s base score. &#10;     Each player adds up the total value of all of his cards including build cards, current competition cards and current Judging cards. &#10;     The player with the highest total score wins that competition. At the end of the competition discard all judging and competition cards.  Repeat as necessary dependent on game length (1 round for short game, 3 for medium, 5 for long).&#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the play with the highest overall score after the appropriate number if rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "KING OF THE BATTLEFIELD&#10;&#10;On February 5, 2439, the Mackie obliterated all opposition during its first combat trial, ushering in a new era of warfare. The BattleMech&mdash;King of the Battlefield&mdash;was born. BattleMechs reached their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their toll and by the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields was a mere shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory Core unlocked the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental technologies for the first time in centuries.&#10;&#10;Technical Readout: Succession Wars is the perfect &quot;first Technical Readout&quot; companion to the BattleMech Manual. Combining the &rsquo;Mechs previously found in Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075, this volume features some of the most common &rsquo;Mechs from the Age of War to the Succession Wars. Each machine is illustrated in detail, and accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, along with their most famous pilots.&#10;&#10;Note: This is a compilation volume. The entries in this book are reprinted from Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075. Players who own those Technical Readouts will find the same units presented in Technical Readout: Succession Wars.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A self-contained hardcover, the BattleMech Manual is intended to be a mech-only up-to-date rulebook for tabletop use.  It contains the majority of the most-used equipment and rules expansions from Total Warfare, Tactical Operations, Strategic Operations, and Interstellar Operations that are relevant to typical mech-only games.  However, the most niche equipment and optional rules are not included, making those books still necessary if you're a completist.  Construction rules are not included.&#10;&#10;New material is limited to nine new Quirks, a complete lists of quirks for all mechs that had not yet had any assigned, a variety of simplified advanced terrain and fire rules, and a new quick-play system called Battlefield Support, which allows you to add artillery, air strikes, and minefields in an abstracted quick-play fashion.&#10;&#10;While the rules in the Manual follow the standard BattleTech ruleset as presented in Total Warfare, in response to complaints from players they were rewritten and re-laid out from scratch in order to focus on clarity and ease of use at the tabletop.  As such, the Manual is much easier to reference than Total Warfare.&#10;&#10;With reference to the 2019 box sets, the BattleMech Manual is suggested as a follow-on to the &quot;A Game of Armored Combat&quot; box set.&#10;&#10;Publisher ad-copy:&#10;&quot;Using the most up-to-date rules text, the BattleMech Manual has been designed from the ground up to cater to the BattleTech player wanting to engage in an all-&rsquo;Mech battle. Includes a variety of optional rules, terrain and more. Welcome to the most table-usage-friendly BattleTech rulebook ever published!&quot;&#10;&#10;The 2019 second printing incorporated errata and changed the cover art to a blue background with a red Marauder mech in the centre. The 2020 third printing incorporated errata and added an index. The fourth printing and later (in addition to further errata corrections in each) change the cover art yet again, featuring a Crusader against a jungle backdrop.&#10;&#10;",

You have led a small group of survivors to safety, but you notice that you are dangerously low on supplies. To make matters worse, the military has informed you that a rescue team has been dispatched to your location but they are not expected to arrive for another eight weeks. If you&rsquo;re going to survive this, you&rsquo;re going to have to send survivors out to find more supplies, barricade your refuge, and kill as many zombies that you can.&#10;&#10;Refuge is a resource-management board game of pure survival. As players wait to be rescued by the military, they must recruit survivors to gather supplies and fight off the zombies and the biker gangs. Players will be forced to trade valuable resources with each other and decrease the zombie population to ensure that everyone lives through this nightmare. However, the zombies and the biker gangs are not your only concern. You will have to find food and water, so that you won&rsquo;t starve or die of thirst. Also, certain survivors in your refuge demand a little extra in exchange for offering their services, and if you don&rsquo;t deliver, you and your fellow survivors might not live very long.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, with each hero having its own special abilities; the zombies are controlled by one or two players. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.&#10;&#10;A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel.&#10;&#10;Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition includes a complete and updated version of Last Night on Earth as well as several new additions. The Experience System and Fire Rules, first introduced in the Timber Peak expansion, have been integrated into the original game, as well as new zombie cards, hero cards, a new set of upgrade cards, and a brand new scenario, &quot;Broken Down&quot;. The game includes a new comprehensive rulebook, featuring an updated version of the rules, as well as all of the web scenarios and expansion rulebooks released to date.&#10;&#10;This release features plastic miniatures for most counters, including wounds, XP, fire, Old Betsy, spawning pits, gas markers, and even the classic old truck. The CD soundtrack of original thematic music has been remastered and expanded, with new songs being added (the new total is 19 tracks).&#10;&#10;All of the classic heroes are included, plus four new playable hero versions of townsfolk from the original game. Everything comes packaged in a numbered collector's box, and everything in Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition is compatible with all previous expansions for Last Night on Earth.&#10;&#10;",

After the initial Birth of Creation storyline, the themes get more epic with galaxy and nebula-infused creatures. Drama rises within the Skyborn Guild, and two-thirds of their members betray the Angels to form the Order Guild. Order creatures make their debut in this set, taking their inspiration from Angels in their appearance while proving to be an entirely new &amp; powerful type on their own.&#10;&#10;Set Breakdown:&#10;This set consists of 62 cards, including:&#10;2 Secret Rares&#10;25 Rares&#10;15 Uncommons&#10;20 Commons&#10;&#10;Of the 2 Secret Rares, one of them (Efil the Everlasting Empress) can only be found as a fixed box topper in sealed booster boxes and not in packs themselves.&#10;The other Secret Rare (Altered Color Alana the Star Formation) has a packaging ratio of 1 in every 12 boxes, or 1 per case.&#10;&#10;Box Toppers&#10;Box Toppers are extra/bonus cards included as incentive when opening an entire booster box or display.&#10;Box Toppers are always Foil.&#10;1 of the 2 Box Toppers in every box is &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning it is the same card in every box.&#10;The 2nd Box Topper is a random Foil from the booster set.&#10;&#10;Sneak Peek Creature Types&#10;Starting with this first booster set, the creators have placed a hidden pattern in each booster set that identify which new creature types the next expansion will focus on. The pattern is 1 of that creature type in each main Rarity tier (Common, Uncommon &amp; Rare) within the set (excluding dual-types). For Galaxy Tides, the new preview types are Treefolk &amp; Shardfolk.&#10;&#10;Creature Types&#10;This set introduces the following creature types:&#10;Order&#10;Mountain&#10;Treefolk&#10;Leviathan&#10;&#10;Alternate Artwork Cards&#10;This set includes 2 Altered Art cards:&#10; Dimensional Dragon&#10; Dimensional Desperado&#10;&#10;",

Any number of people may play but this is an against the clock race and each player races in turn with normally only one skier on the course at any one time.&#10;&#10;Preparation&#10;&#10;Set up the board, draw for order of play by cutting the shuffled pack of move cards and the highest card takes the first turn. The Slalom is a two-legged race where the fastest time on aggregate is the winner and the second leg is run in reverse order to the first.&#10;&#10;Start of the Game&#10;&#10;Shuffle the move and start cards and take the top start card and then 14 move cards. Any number from 0 to 9 of these 14 move cards may be discarded by playing them face downwards and incurring a small penalty of additions to the time of 0.01 secs for each card discarded. This decision to discard (or not)a number of move cards can only be made before the start and from the initial 14 cards dealt. The further  move cards which will be required may be taken from the top of the pack at anytime but all cards taken add one second each to the time whether played or not.&#10;&#10;The run commences by playing one of the move cards and so as the first bend is a left hand turn just 2 spaces from the start then a black 2 followed by any black card will make the first turn a perfect one.&#10;&#10;The time display board should be maintained after each move allowing for standard course time (marked on the race board), start-move-error-skill cards and the last decimal place is determined by the value of the move card last played.&#10;&#10;After reaching the final turn line a player may cross the finishing line by playing any red card of value 2 or greater or a red 1 move card followed by any card.&#10;&#10;Finish&#10;&#10;After crossing the finishing line a check should be made of all cards in play to confirm the display time.&#10;&#10;",

A compellingly playable set of fast play rules provide entertainment and challenge for both the novice and veteran players alike, entwined with glorious pictures of the Bicorne English Civil War miniature figure range. The rules have been extensively developed from the author's and friends' house rules. These were purposefully designed to provide a fast, fun and challenging game for wargamers of all abilities, whilst encouraging the education of the readers into the troops and the realities of warfare in the 17th Century. There are many parts to the book in addition to the rules, including an introduction to the Civil War written by Linda Doyle, and a section detailing troop types and uniforms. This has all been designed alongside the catalogue of Bicorne troops where the reader is encouraged to collect and paint an army of model soldiers, with a view to playing enjoyable wargames with friends. To this end there is a section on how to build up your army if you are new to the period, as well as a couple of scenarios to give the reader a good idea of what can be achieved with this fun to play set of rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;INTRODUCTION:&#10;Skjuub is a combinatorial game for two players. The name comes from the playing pieces, which are 'skewed cubes'. Skjuubs are 'directional', meaning that their orientation is relevant to gameplay.&#10;Skjuub is in a sense a 'logical successor' to the Series: Tixel of games (Tix, Tixel and Regatta). The form factor is different but the 'gameplay structure' is very similar.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Skjuub is played on a 6x6 square grid. Each player has her own pool of 11 pieces, differentiated by color.&#10;&#10;A PLAYER'S TURN&#10;On a turn, a player can either place a new skjuub or move one of her own skjuubs already on the board. The orientation of a skjuub (which side the 'overhang' is facing) is decided upon when placing it on the board. A skjuub can be active or inactive and only active skjuubs may be moved.&#10;A skjuub is inactive if at least one of its sides is fully connected to a similarly shaped side of another piece (regardless of color).&#10;&#10;NORMAL MOVES; Placement&#10;When placing a new skjuub on the board you are not allowed make one or more opponent skjuubs inactive. A new skjuub may be placed next to one or more already inactive skjuubs in a way in which it becomes inactive itself as well. Such placement does not result in the player getting a bonus move (see section 'BONUS MOVES').&#10;&#10;NORMAL MOVES; Sliding and tumbling&#10;A move can be either a slide (in which the orientation of the skjuub remains the same) or a tumble (in which in which the orientation of the skjuub does change - the overhang 'switches' to the opposite side).&#10;In a single move a skjuub may be slid as many squares as wanted (horizontally or vertically along its row or column) but may be tumbled only once (to an adjacent square from where it started the tumble, either in the direction of the overhang or in the opposite direction).&#10;When placing, sliding or tumbling, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'; their locations and orientations must remain the same.&#10;&#10;BONUS MOVES&#10;Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks additional move types (besides placing, sliding and tumbling). If a skjuub that is slid or tumbled is made inactive at its end position - i.e., it's sacrificed - the player gets a bonus move. As a bonus move she can do one of the following:&#10;&#10;        - one of the normal moves; place, slide or tumble one of her other skjuubs. These slides and tumbles (but not placements) can themselves result in additional bonus moves.&#10;        - pick up one of her other skjuubs from the board (not the one skjuub that was just sacrificed!) and place it back in her pool of available skjuubs.&#10;        - turn one of her active skjuubs a quarter turn clockwise or anticlockwise. The skjuub that is turned must also still be active after the turn (it may not be sacrificed by the turn).&#10;        - pass the bonus move.&#10;&#10;&#10;When turning a skjuub, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'. When picking up a skjuub, other skjuubs may temporarily be moved aside to make picking up the skjuub easier but they must be returned to their original locations and orientations afterwards.&#10;One or more other skjuubs can also become inactive by a skjuub being sacrificed. Skjuubs may also be sacrificed adjacent to other skjuubs that are already inactive though (regardless of color).&#10;&#10;NO BACKTRACKING&#10;Players are not allowed to undo their previous turn by playing it 'in reverse'. If the previous turn had one or more bonus moves, only the very last bonus move may not be played in reverse.&#10;The main point of the rule is to prevent players from tumbling or sliding one and the same skjuub back and forth in consecutive turns. Therefor it is allowed to pick up a skjuub that was placed in the previous turn. Players are also allowed to alternate between sliding and tumbling the same skjuub repeatedly.&#10;There is one exception to the rule: Backtracking is allowed if it captures an opponent piece (and the piece that does the backtracking becomes inactive itself too).&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME&#10;A player loses the game if, at the beginning of her turn, she does not have at least one active skjuub on the board that is both able and allowed to slide and/or tumble.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a fast, fun and addictive card game&#10;&#10;Main Goal: you need to discard all your cards as soon as possible. Loses the one who has the cards on hand.&#10;&#10;Game Setup: Shuffle your deck thoroughly and deal three face-down cards in a row to each player. Then deal the same number of cards face up to cover each card that is laying face-down. Now you have six cards before each player: three face-down and three face-up covering them.&#10;&#10;You shouldn&rsquo;t pick that cards up until you shed all the cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;Deal each player three cards one more time, that will be player's hands. Place the deck of cards on the table within reach of every player.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: the starting player is the one who attended a party recently, closer to the day of the game then other players. Then players are taking turns clockwise. The player lays any card on the table (to start a pick up pile) and then draws card from the deck so they have at least three cards in their hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or they already have three or more cards in their hand). The next player must lay a card equal to or higher in value than the one at the top of the pick up pile. For example: the first player lays 5, the next player can lay 5, or 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. On top of 10 player can lay 10 or 0 (the Poop) or any of the special cards. If a player has no card to cover the the previous card, they must pick up the pick-up pile (put it in their hand) and end their turn, and the next player starts a new round with any card.&#10;&#10;A player can lay some cards of the same value in one turn. If a player is able to complete a set in turn (like four-of-a-kind 8*8*8*8) they can do so clearing (burning) and removing the entire pile from play. The player who clears may play another card after.&#10;Special cards (could be placed over any other card):&#10;&#10;MegaPug - when played, clears the pick up pile instantly. The player who plays it starts the next round with any card, game is played to increase (the next card may have same or higher value)&#10;&#10;BreakDancer - changes the rules from increase to decrease (so the next card may have same or lower value). When played the second time, rules changes back from decrease to increase, and so on.&#10;&#10;Poop (0) - resets the game. The next player can lay a card of any value from 0 to 10, game is played to increase.&#10;&#10;Game Ending: when the deck runs out, you must play all cards from your hand. When there&rsquo;s no cards in your hand, you have to play those cards that are laying the face-up in front of you, one by one. Then you play your &ldquo;Blind&rdquo; cards, that are laying face-down, one by one - no peeking!&#10;If you have no suitable card - take the pick-up pile in your hand and only when you shed them all you can return to play your cards on the table.&#10;&#10;When you have discarded all your cards - congratulations! You banished all your Pug-party animals! So you can chill out watching yours less lucky playmates.&#10;&#10;The Pug Party is an entertaining game designed for players from 6 years old. Duration: 10-30 minutes. Simple rules, a dynamic game process, illustrations of a talented artist of Ukraine &ndash; this is the formula for the success of the game Pug Party. The first edition of the game was sold out for six months. Because everyone loves funny parties and everyone loves pugs: children, youth and adults are just delighted with these funny little animals. We take an incendiary party, add cute pugs, and get the most explosive and cutest Ukrainian game!&#10;&#10;",

Veteran crews also found a new currency of honor in using their well-practiced skills to assist the artifact hunting fleets that scoured former human worlds for Forerunner relics and war trophies, with many turning quasi-mercenary and offering their services to Ministry leaders eager to one-up each other with treasures and baubles recovered from the glassed ruins.&#10;&#10;",

She does not care what sacrifices it takes to complete her machines. Her mechanic requires you to have played cards(not discard) in order to complete the required components(the card type determines what components it counts as). She is the hardest megami to learn , and will remain that way according to the designer.&#10;Thallya is a megami who was formerly a human from another land/country. She rides a motorcycle and fights with a &quot;sword-whip&quot;. Her mechanics revolve around her &quot;fuel&quot;, an extra resource that many of your cards require to use, or can make use of. She also has the ability to gain unique basic actions via transforming(utilizing her S4 special card)While she has a high skill cap she is easier to approach than Kururu.&#10;This expansion adds more difficult mechanics than prior expansions, according to the publisher it will likely remain the most mechanically difficult expansion.&#10;&#10;Sakura Arms is a Japanese dueling living card game made for 2 players, in which players build 10 card decks from a limited pool in order to reduce the opponents life to zero.&#10;&#10;",

The game is all about the art of the wrestling promo. Two players assume the guise of professional wrestlers and go head-to-head for verbal supremacy while a third player dictates the action as a Producer. Everyone not competing in the current turn (which we call a Segment) is the Audience and gets to choose the victor of the round!&#10;&#10;When a round starts, each Wrestler draws one name card from each of the two Name card decks. This is their wrestling persona. The Producer then draws a Segment card. This tells the Wrestlers where they are and what they are fighting about. The Producer then draws three Smack cards to play on either Wrestler during their promo. These cards dictate the action and can be played on either Wrestler during their promos.Each Wrestler has 45 seconds to cut their promo. After which, the Audience votes for the victor. If only three people are playing, the Producer decides.&#10;&#10;",

The game board is a geographical map of an island called Ende. Players try to score victory points by constructing buildings and/or winning battles on the island.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has a different set of four action cards, which varies by player order. Each round, they take turns playing action card until all players have taken three actions. At the end of round, they pass their set of cards to the player to the left.&#10;&#10;By performing an action, players may construct/upgrade a building, gain resources, raise military power, initiate a battle, etc. There are plenty of player interactions, such as limited nubmer of buildings in a territory and initiating a battle with a specific player. But battle is not always necessary to win the game.&#10;&#10;A player can win immediately by upgrading a building into the castle, but it requires much military power. Strategy selection (winning by castle, battles, buildings, or their hybrid) and action planning with consideration of rotating sets of cards are keys to winning the game.&#10;&#10;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#230;&#139;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#177;&#138;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#228;&#186;&#137;/&#229;&#134;&#133;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#149;&#230;&#142;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#228;&#186;&#137;/&#229;&#134;&#133;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#189;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#231;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

At first round, each player get 3 tiles from their pile and than draw one each subsequent round, maintaining 3 options to play at almost all time. In your turn, you must place one tile (considering that you cant extend the panel mor than 7x7 tiles away) and optionally rotate 90&ordm; clockwise another placed tile (only if the rotated tile is not forming a circle pattern yet). The turns goes until the 7x7 panel is created.&#10;&#10;You score one point creating circle patterns with absolute majority of your colour and 3 points if the circle created has only your color. You also score bonus points (1 for each circle) if the scored circle is created only by your pieces.&#10;&#10;Ar fisrt glance, Azzelij seems to be a simple tile placement, but as the game flows players faces lots of hard decisions to make: May I get a point or avoid another player to get a better position? May I close the 7 piece limit to stop opponents to grow at one edge or stay creating my pattern? May I risk to get a full-colored circle of mine or get two or more majority-only circle points?&#10;&#10;As the game flows, the decisions ar harder to take and the panel gets its 7x7 piece formation, that increases the difficulty and fun!&#10;&#10;",
