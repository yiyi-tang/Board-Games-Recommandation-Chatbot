    "Description": "In Deluxe Poker Rummy there are two sets of 4 different color tiles (black, red, yellow and blue) each numbering 2 through 10 plus Jack, Queen, King, and Ace; plus 2 jokers. The games comes with rules to play both the American Way and the International Way.&#10;&#10;How to play Deluxe Poker Rummy the American Way:&#10;&#10;Each players picks 14 tiles and must have a total of 25 points in one or more sets or runs in their hand in order to place those tiles on the table. After you place your initial tiles down you are ready to play the table (i.e. add to sets or runs already played) but if during your turn you are unable to play on the table you must pick a tile from the remaining ones. Jokers are wild.&#10;     &#10;     The first player who gets rid of all the tiles in his hand is the winner.  The other remaining players must total all the points left in their hand.  Each tile is worth the number of points as valued on the tile.  The jokers are worth 25 points.&#10;     Your objective therefore is to keep as few points in your hand as possible.&#10;&#10;How to play Deluxe Poker Rummy the American Way:&#10;&#10;The bricks are laid face down, shuffled and arranged - still face down - in one stack of 8 bricks and fourteen stacks of 7 bricks each, starting from left to right. The opener starts the game by turning face up the top brick of the last stack on the left which then becomes &quot;Trump&quot; for the round.&#10;&#10;The stacks are then dealt until each player has 14 bricks, except for Player #2, which will have 15. Player #2 takes an unwanted one from his hand and puts it on the table to his right, face up.&#10;&#10;The first stage of the game is to arrange the bricks on your stand in Sets of &quot;Runs&quot; or &quot;Groups&quot;. Players draw a brick from the pool and then discard either it or another brick from their stand. You can meld any Sets from your stand onto the table, provided their total value is 50 or more. Once a Set has been melded it may be added to, but not changed or taken back.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

However, you must convince the shadowy Council of Five to back you.  The Council collectively wield enough power to determine which of you will triumph and which will be ... forgotten.  To sway the Council members to back your claim, you and your opponent will each champion a unique series of policies.  Each policy will earn approval from one of the Council members, but simultaneously harm your standing with another.  Angering any one member too much can result in dire consequences.  To gain an additional edge, form secret alliances with Council members and dramatically reveal your plots to devastating effect.  A poorly timed decision and cost you everything, but the right ones will see you claim the mantle of Diktator.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THE STORY&#10;On an island far from humanity lies a secret facility run by a mad scientist. She is the most evil person&mdash;the most cunning, the most horrific (and did I mention evil?) person known to woman. Her facility consists of a laboratory, a torture chamber, holding cells, and a labyrinth.&#10;&#10;The laboratory is where the doctor performs her illicit experiments. She has kidnapped people around the world to be her test subjects. She not only has figured out how to clone her subjects but has figured out how to crossbreed animals with humans and vice-versa. One of her successful experiments was of a human and a rat. These hideous creatures are known as BREEDERS. They are half the size of an average human. They are fast, hard to detect, and only come out at night to feed on unexpected prey.&#10;&#10;The loud sounds you hear could only be the screams and moans of agony coming from the torture chamber. The torture chamber is where the doctor analyses each subject's tolerance to pain and suffering. She will push their limits until they break or die. Out of the hundreds of corpses that did not pass the test, only six have made it thus far.&#10;&#10;These six subjects are known as REAPERS. They are creatures that take on the form of a human and an animal that have been genetically modified and mutated. They are in their holding cells where they await to be released into the labyrinth and unleash their terrifying acts of evil. They are trained to prey on human flesh and they will stop at nothing until they do.&#10;&#10;While these are some of the ghastly things to come out of the doctor's laboratory, it does not end there. Some of her experiments consist of chemical solutions that alter one's abilities. Thus, giving them supernatural powers. This supernatural ability can range from running five times faster than a cheetah to being undetectable like a Chameleon. This chemical solution is called GEN-13. GEN-13 derives from 12 separate chemical solutions plus one unknown. When the unknown is used on a creature, it becomes the ELEMENTAL. The ELEMENTAL has the power to claim all 12 chemical solutions if present.&#10;&#10;The doctor is now looking to abduct new test subjects around the world to continue with her GEN-13 experiments. This evil doctor is known as Dr. Culebra.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;In The Island of Dr. Culebra, you play the role of one of Dr. Culebra's test subjects. You and the other test subjects will need to plan, strategize and work together to escape the labyrinth. You and others will be injected with a serum that has a chemical solution that alters your abilities. You and others will use your new ability to overcome obstacles, traps, and creatures in hope of finding a way out of the labyrinth. Will you and others be able to meet the challenge and escape the Island of Dr. Culebra?&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;The object of the game is to escape from the labyrinth of Dr. Culebra's Island. The labyrinth consists of obstacles, traps, and creatures. You will need to find the exit before the time runs out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The heart of the system is about bidding for and using Tempo Points: commanders must trade off speed of action against the ability to have greater control over all units.&#10;The game includes a number of scenarios from the three covered conflicts to give players a good idea of how big the various armies are and how they are organized.  It uses a variable scale, so smaller and bigger armies, battles and tables can all be accomodated.&#10;&#10;",

It helps connecting strangers and can function as a social&nbsp;catalyst, be an icebreaker for flirting attempts and makes the players to be attentive about the situations happening around them.&#10;&#10;Each player receives an equal amount of cards (depending on how many players will take part) which describes specific but arbitrary rules. After that the game begins.&#10;&#10;If a player notices that someone violates one of the rules described on his cards, he plays the card and the player who violated the rule will be sanctioned. After that he passes the card and swaps it with a card of the sanctioned player.&#10;&#10;The game has no fixed ending, it ends arbitrarily!&#10;&#10;The player who plays the most cards during the game will win. To count the amount of cards which each player plays, tokens such as coins or bottle caps are used.&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to survive the dungeons while you search and try to vanquish the Dark Lord that rules them.&#10;&#10;STORY&#10;The players take on the role of HEROES that are resting in an old tavern. While enjoying the music and drinking the ale, they listen stories about some ancient ruins on the outskirts of the town. A sinister place that is the entrance to a gloomy dungeon. It is said that one can find great treasures among the shadows of the dark rooms under those ruins, but even greater dangers. There have been countless occasions in which curious townsfolk or brave adventurers fall victim to this terrible place.&#10;&#10;The HEROES decide to enter the ruins and descend through the forgotten corridors until they reach the entrance of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;With determination they will choose their path, some of them for glory, others for treasure, all of them for adventure.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;The players have 12 different HEROES to choose from: Alchemist, Barbarian, Bard, Hunter, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Warrior, Illusionist, Rogue, Mage and Monk.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into Rooms and the Rooms into Encounters. At the same time, some Encounters like combat are divided into turns.&#10;&#10;Each HERO has 5 Talents. The HERO Special Talent has a specific ability (only available to that specific hero) on one side and a set of Talents that specific HERO can choose on the other. Each player will be able to choose from a pool of 30 different Talents in order to build their HERO.&#10; There are different types of rooms in the game. When revealing a new room the Encounters in it must be prepared and confronted. Encounters must be resolve in a specific sequence.&#10; Events must always be resolved first, since some of them can modify the other Encounters found in the room, then are the Enemies which are the most common Encounters and last but not least the Chest/Corpse. Only this last two Encounters are indifferent in which one is resolve first as well as optional to advance to the next room.&#10;&#10;While adventuring HEROES will eventually get hurt. There are 2 ways in which a HERO can receive damage in this game.&#10; There is fatigue which translates into Stress tokens and then there&rsquo;s physical damage which translates into Damage tokens.&#10;&#10;Players will need to learn how to work as a team, manage their resources and combo their talents...&#10;&#10;Are you ready to Delve &amp; Despair?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

We were just there, and it basically came down to staying alive and keeping your buddies alive.&rdquo; &ndash;Pfc. Edward W. Voros, Company A, 46th Infantry, Americal Division, March 1971.&#10;&#10;For most Americans, by the Spring of 1971, the &ldquo;light at the end of tunnel&rdquo; that had become the War in Vietnam was in sight. Peace talks were well underway in Paris, as was &ldquo;Vietnamization&rsquo;; President Nixon&rsquo;s official policy for turning over the bulk of the war effort and fighting to the forces of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). As part of the transition the 23rd US Infantry Division, the &ldquo;Americal&rdquo;, was due to be rotated out of fighting and turning over its positions to ARVN&rsquo;s First Corp. The Americal had earned a bad reputation two years earlier at My Lai, and the division was subjected to a complete review and re-organization following that atrocity. The higher-ups decreed there would be no more &ldquo;screw ups&rdquo; by this unit while it served out its remaining time &ldquo;in country.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;One of the most remote American positions was Fire Base Mary Ann, not far from Chu Lai, occupied by elements of the 46th Regiment of the Americal Division. By the last week of March an ARVN artillery battery had already moved in and the base was to be completely turned-over in early April. However, the local Viet Cong (Communist South Vietnamese) commander saw a growing opportunity during the transition to strike a final blow against the Imperialist forces of the US. Deploying the elite 409th Sapper Battalion for the attack, the Communist&rsquo;s &ldquo;parting shot&rdquo; was to remind both the US and ARVN that the war was far from over.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Angel Investor is a deck-building game for 2 to 4 players. Players are investors competing to become the most famous before they run out of money. The game is presented as a satire on silicon-valley start-up culture with card art that depicts anthropomorphic animals taking part in exaggerated acts of office politics.&#10;&#10;It features unique deck-building mechanics where all players modify cards in every &quot;start-up&quot; deck. It was designed by an artificial intelligence consulting company using their algorithms to optimize balance through simulation and boasts a simultaneously chaotic and high skill game as a result.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Whenever you buy a card, you can spend an additional turnip to recruit a Freebooter.

    "Description": "Update: Because of file size limits for uploading files, here is link to the newly published game tutorial in PDF. Available both in English and Polish: http://spinningdice.pl/game-tutorial/&#10;&#10;The Descendants of Volos is a competitive roleplaying adventure board game set in a fantasy realm inspired by Slavic mythology. Players will play the role of one of many characters called Velevits or &quot;The Descendants of Volos&quot;. They are born with mysterious abilities. Their common special ability is the presence of 3 souls (lives).&#10;&#10;The main goal of the game is to become the most powerful and authoritative character within a limited amount of time. You can do it by gaining victory points throughout collecting the achievements and influence tokens (those you get by completing randomly generated quest sequences and solving cases for your organization). There is no &quot;best way&quot; of winning this game. You'll have to improvise, adapt and overcome! This is a competitive game, so not only you should collect victory points, but also try interrupting the other players.&#10;&#10;When traveling around the peninsula, your character will fight various monsters, face various situations, grow in strength, collect unique gear, fulfill the quests, and become an influential and respected member of their organizations.&#10;&#10;The game is focused on adventures, PvP (Player vs Player) and plenty of PvE (Player vs Enemy) combats. Large and modular map gives incredible replay value. 800+ adventure cards stuffed with unique elements like trinkets, weapons, armors, enemies, side quests and situations. The character evolution is full of choices. Spending skill points on any attribute like strength, agility, intellect, or vitality will shape your combat abilities.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by 1 to 4 players and the number of players only slightly affects the playing time, as unique game rules allow half of actions in each turn to be performed simultaneously. It means that you're playing almost all the time, and the waiting time per turn is minimal. There are also special mechanics designed for players who end the game prematurely, so even though they lose, they can still play by becoming a &quot;minion master.&quot; The powerful monsters that were quietly sitting in the dungeons, have been now unleashed and are crawling out and chasing the remaining players. The intensity of the gameplay grows, and the player that lost prematurely can now take revenge, or simply troll the remaining players. This and much much more unique solutions will be revealed before the kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Furthermore, there, remained a situation of great hostility against Great Britain. When immense diamond veins were discovered in Transvaal, the following decades (1860-1890) opened the way for a new economical and armed conflict.&#10;&#10;&quot;Zuid Afrika: Those Restless Years - The Anglo Boer Confrontation 1883-1900&quot; is a card-driven wargame for 1-4 players that traces the path that led South Africa to the Second Anglo-Boer War (the most dramatic one), which ended in 1902, after a long, fatiguing guerrilla warfare.&#10;&#10;In Zuid Afrika (ZA), up to four players seek to influence the fate of South Africa. They are:&#10;&#10;     the British (government of the Cape colony).&#10;     the Natives, Bantu and older populations.&#10;     the Boers heirs of the Dutch colonizers.&#10;     the Uitlanders (literally foreigners) often technical and / or mining personnel, also discriminated like black labor men.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction uses its forces or abilities to influence areas on the map, has its own victory goal, different from the others. The British seek military victory in addition to neutralizing anti-racist demonstrations. The Natives try to turn mining workers into guerrilla warfare and try to establish communities in territories. The Boers try to enlarge their resources and exchange them with weapons. The Uitlanders promote a cultural struggle against apartheid  and act, above all, in the cities, seeking the favor of the population.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You play as a lone barbarian in a land of trees, sand, and mountains.  You are on a mission to reclaim your throne from a conniving usurper, but you must travel through the unforgiving lands of danger and peril.  Use and carefully upgrade your skills as you travel.  By the time this month passes, when the moon has gone through its phases, it will be too late.&#10;&#10;Players hold all the cards needed to play in their hand.  Taking into account the player's skill value in addition to the values on the cards, each event on the cards will have a level of difficulty.  Beat that difficulty, and the player succeeds!  Fail and the repercussions could be loss of health, water, gold or be forced to retreat.  Hex by hex, the player makes their way back to the city where the throne awaits!&#10;&#10;Deeply inspired by the 1981 game Barbarian Prince, I've made this game in an attempt to capture the fun and excitement of exploration, adventure, and wilderness-living; while avoiding a dense book of tables and the somewhat arbitrary nature of the classic 1981 game.  All the wonder of exploration, condensed into a mint tin, with only cards, paperclips, and the player's sense of adventure!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
