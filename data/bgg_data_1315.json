    "Description": "There are many nobles in Westeros that don&rsquo;t directly belong to any of the major or even minor Houses. They may have a title and some small wealth at their disposal, but they are basically landless, free to roam as they please. Setting them apart from your average vagabond is their ability to afford a suit of armor, a horse, and at least minor upkeep for both. These Hedge Knights, as they&rsquo;re so known, often band together and offer their services to anyone willing to pay their price.&#10;&#10;The Hedge Knights Unit Box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives commanders a new cavalry option for their armies. Being a Neutral unit, they will work for anyone willing to pay their price. While their armor and combat training might not be as robust as a Major House&rsquo;s heavy cavalry, they are still much better than many other mercenaries are capable of providing. These troops are an easy way to bolster any battle line when necessary.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But for House Mormont, their She-Bears gladly head to war, taking up arms just like any other soldier. Drawing inspiration in armor and weaponry from legendary warrior Lady Alysane Mormont, they are a rough and rugged fighting force that will stand toe-to-toe with some of the heaviest units other Houses can field.&#10;&#10;The Mormont She-Bears Unit Box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Stark players a durable unit for their forces. These tough women are outfitted with thick leather and sturdy plate mail, making them able to turn away enemy blows with ease. Offensively, they attack mercilessly with two-handed maces, able to crush enemy armor with a single blow. The more dire the situation, the harder the She-Bears fight, often carrying on in battle past near-fatal wounds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Clear cache locations to win rewards, or win fresh food fishing, hunting, or trapping on terrain locations. Be careful, though, because if you are forced to retreat from a battle, you must clear the location you retreat to or die trying.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you meet the end condition of the scenario, or if your survivors die.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Characters you have to choose from are varied with their own stories.&#10;In The End is a 1-6 player, 3 board game. It has ten unique bosses to fight and many events to overcome.&#10;The play mechanics are simple roll a d6, move up to that number. If you land in a square with Character, Event, or Item you pull that card and resolve the card. On each board the player must complete 3 Character Cards to reveal the boss. Once the boss is revealed you must move to that square and fight the boss. &#10;This is done over all three boards. In solo play you undertake this great journey alone. When playing in a party you all must fight the boss together. In Versus mode you are in a race to beat the three bosses. &#10;After defeating the third boss you find and are granted access to Sanctuary, a city where civilization is being rebuilt. You lose by dying or in Versus by not making it to Sanctuary first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guts &lsquo;N Glory is a World War II skirmish rules system for N-scale Miniatures.&#10;&#10;This innovative system allows for faster game resolution taking into account troop quality, leadership, and moral. &#10;The game was designed to be a pleasing combination of playability and realism.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game system is a fairly innovative concept (at least to historical gaming) that uses different dice rather than die modifiers. In most games, one type of dice is used and the &quot;success&quot; number for hitting a target, spotting a target or passing morale is determined by adding or subtracting a number from a base number. This forces the player to go through some mathematical calculations each time and the &quot;success&quot; number always changes. In Guts 'N Glory, the &quot;success&quot; number never changes. Instead, the dice you roll changes. &#10;For example, a successful morale check is made on a roll of a 4 or less. Veteran troops usually roll a 6-sided die to check morale (66% chance), but green troops roll a 10-sided die (40% chance). Of course, things happen to make troops more or less likely to pass that morale check. In Guts 'N Glory, these factors are taken into account by the use of &quot;die higher penalties&quot; or &quot;die lower bonuses.&quot; When checking morale, you put your finger on the &quot;dice hierarchy&quot; chart and move it to the right for each penalty and to the left for each bonus. No need to add/subtract modifiers&hellip;.No need to remember a different &quot;success&quot; number for every roll you make. &#10;For example, let's say a veteran fire team needs to take a morale check. There are enemy tanks visible to the fire team, they were under fire last turn and they are in cover. The enemy tanks and being under fire are both &quot;die higher penalties.&quot; The fact that the team is in cover is a &quot;die lower bonus. This yields a net result of one &quot;die higher&quot; penalty. The veteran fire team checks for morale by rolling an 8-sided die instead of the usual 6-sided die. The &quot;success&quot; number for a morale check is always a four or less. The use of this concept really speeds up play.&#10;&#10;Guts 'N Glory only considers factors that are necessary to create a realistic simulation. We didn't deal with details that added complexity/realism at the expense of playability. For example, in Guts 'N Glory tank armor is classified as light, medium, heavy or very heavy. &#10;There are bonuses/penalties on the charts for sloped armor, side armor, rear armor and top armor. Also, if a tank is hit, you then check to see whether or not it was immobilized or put &quot;out of action.&quot; This is all any platoon commander needs to know anyway. Therefore a Tiger tank is still a tougher target than a Stuart tank, but we didn't create an overly complicated system to model this. No need to find out exactly where the round hit, exactly what systems were taken out, or which crewmember was killed.&#10;&#10;Don't think that Guts 'N Glory is a beer and pretzels game though. &#10;It plays fast, but it rewards good tactics. It also punishes the player who makes tactical mistakes. &#10;The results are very realistic when compared with historical instances. &#10;Another concept that speeds play is the use of &quot;fire teams.&quot; Infantry are grouped in teams of 2-5 men. Three fire teams make up a squad. The troops are individually based on metal stands. The fire team stands are magnetic. This allows you to tailor your fire teams to the situation at hand. You can decide which weapons go with which team and your squad leader can be attached to any team you wish. The rules allow you to detach tank hunters as well. Squads generally were divided up into teams to execute real battle tactics. It speeds up the game considerably to allow you to move your men in similar teams. All members of a fire team direct their fire at the same target (with the exception of tank hunters&hellip;They need to be free to engage armored targets.) when they fire. This speeds up play and is very reasonable when compared with accounts of actual combat.&#10;&#10;Guts 'N Glory uses an initiative system and special fire modes or orders that allow both players to exercise control over their troops at the same time. &#10;It is not an &quot;I go, you go&quot; system. &#10;This adds realism to the simulation. I must admit that it is the hardest part of the system to grasp, but the most rewarding. &#10;For example, veteran troops are easier to control than green troops. They have a better chance of gaining the initiative and have more special orders to give. This makes them more flexible to the changing battlefield environment. We believe that this is how it should be!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is both entertaining and designed to teach the lay person about the criminal justice system. The player will be taken through the court process, starting with bail hearings and lawyer's fees through to the trial and sentencing. Players will enjoy playing the roles of police officers, lawyers and Judges (sic). The winner of the game is the player with the most amount of money, but, he must also have the least number of criminal convictions.&#10;&#10;Jailbait equipment consists of a board with crime squares, tokens for the various players, one die, Judge's dice, Jailbait money, small chips which are the players' conviction chips and 3 sets of cards&mdash;crime cards (which correspond to the various crime squares on the board), lawyer's fee/bail cards and pre-trial cards.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the person with the most amount of money after he purchases back all his conviction chips. The game may conclude at any time, simply purchase back the conviction chips and count your money. Alternatively, the game concludes when only two players are left playing.&#10;&#10;This game was designed to follow the actual process of the Canadian Criminal Justice system as closely as possible within the framework of a game. There are many aspects and possibilities that arise within the court system which were impossible to include: however, the pertinent section of the Criminal Code of Canada has been noted in the glossary when appropriate to enable the player to obtain further information if he or she so desires by referring to that document. The United States glossary version will follow.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Since that time, new research has been made available, and the game has been played countless times by many players around the world who have provided a wealth of feedback. The game system remains basically the same, allowing players to focus on planning and strategy and not an overbearing rules system. Based on that new research and feedback, many units have been adjusted, all of the maps have minor changes, and some whole rules sections have been revamped to better represent the historical reality, while minimizing further complexity. The original expansion is included in this Deluxe Edition (while remaining optional), and there are also new scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Below are the general rules for the cards that can be played.&#10;&#10;1. Single number (2 is biggest, 3 is smallest, Jokers are sometimes used).&#10;2. At least two same numbers of differing suits. Example: Heart 3 and Spade 3.&#10;3. At least three numbers in ascending order, the suit does not matter. Example: Heart 3, Spade 4 and Club 5. Note that playing 2 (the biggest card) followed by the 3 (which is the smallest) is invalid in this case since it is not ascending.&#10;&#10;Notes: &#10;1. The combination 4-4-5-5-6-6 can also be played, and the same suits do not apply.&#10;2. Occasionally players can be extremely lucky and have six sequential cards, such as 4-5-6-7-8-9.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to reach the opponent's baseline with 3 stones, or to hit so many of the opponent's stones that he becomes unable to move. The number stones may be moved one square at a time.

    "Description": "Oregon is a solitaire poker game, great for learning and internalizing the various poker hands and their ranked value.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook: &quot;For Oregon you need a normal Poker deck of 52 cards: thirteen values from 2 to Ace, in the four suits: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs. Simply shuffle and start. Your aim is to build the most powerful Poker combinations - same values, same suit, or consecutive values.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first five cards of the deck are turned over to form a row. Then, the player draws from the deck and decides to add the new card on top of a card in the pre-existing row or use the new card to begin a new row, then draw four more cards to complete the new row of 5. This choice is repeated until the deck runs outs. The better the poker hands created in each row of cards, the better the score.&#10;&#10;Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games.&#10;&#10;",

The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for.&#10;&#10;The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp; white illustrations. &#10;The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A few questions have been included in Ikra to show a contrast with Islam. This can initiate interesting discussion and can help us understand the place of Muslims in the world view at least a little more, insha-Allah. As such, there is something in Ikra for everybody!&#10;-In game summary&#10;&#10;Ikra is a game where the goal is the reach the center of the board by answering 1 of 3 questions on a given card and moving a player token counter-clockwise. Questions are largely focused on Islamic teachings, culture, and history, with the addition of general science and geography questions included. Once the player does a full lap and ends on their &quot;ladder,&quot; they can answer a corresponding question to achieve that pillar of Islam and go up one rung. Game ends when a player is able to reach the Ka'aba in the center.&#10;&#10;",

In order to do that, we just have to find the suitable body parts and sew them following the correct pattern.&#10;&#10;To be able to create our monster, the first thing to do is to find the suitable pieces. Each player shall take theirs. Keep in mind that each body piece has two different sides.&#10;Once we have all the body pieces, we take the thread and... let's sew!&#10;&#10;We shall join the pieces together in a way that the thread at the top seam coincides with our card pattern. We can pass the thread up to 3 times through the same hole. Look the pattern closely and make sure that there aren't more or fewer threads.&#10;&#10;When a player has finished their monster shouts 'It's alive!'. The rest of the players check the seams and, if they are correct, that player is awarded Student of the Month. However, if there's any mistake, the game continues and the player shall fix the possible errors.&#10;&#10;There's no turn order.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NANKU is a 3-dimensional game that uses a single &lsquo;dual&rsquo; piece composed of two cubes of different colours.&#10;&#10;In NANKU, players alternate turns placing or stacking pieces with the aim of creating a line of 4 cubes of their colour (a &lsquo;nanku&rsquo;).  Each player has an allocated colour (White or Black). Place the 40 pieces within both player&rsquo;s reach, but leaving room for the game on the playing surface.&#10;&#10;Starting with White, players alternate turns placing one piece from the supply in any position (even standing vertically) following these placement rules:&#10;&#10;a) The piece must align with the cubic grid.&#10;       &#10;    b) It must be adjacent (two faces touching) to at least one already played piece, if any.&#10;       &#10;    c) It must be fully supported by either the table or pieces below it; i.e. no overhangs are allowed.&#10;&#10;The first player creating a line of 4 cubes of her colour wins the game. Lines can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal and any two consecutive cubes from that line must be touching each other by at least one edge (not only a vertex). Also all 4 cubes must have at least one exposed (visible) face.&#10;&#10;If, at any moment, you knock a piece over, you immediately lose the game.&#10;&#10;It is recommended to play on a surface that can be rotated, and you&rsquo;re allowed to rotate it on your turn.&#10;&#10;On your first plays, you&rsquo;ll notice how black wins almost all the time. As you play more, then white will win most of the time (find the best opening for white). But once you gain more experience, games might last more than 30 turns and wins will balance out.&#10;&#10;",

This will mark the rhythm to follow.&#10;&#10;After the first time signature (one, two, three, four) the rest of the players will sing the note on their card at the same time.&#10;&#10;It the player has a (crotchet) card, it will last the same time that a number of the 4/4 time signature.

Those will have to switch between their notes from now on. For each number of the time signature, they will sing a note.

All the players keep their card with the highest score, except the one who made the mistake, who gives their highest card to the metronome.&#10;&#10;If nobody makes any mistakes and all the players get to sing their 4 notes during a time signature, each one keeps their card with the highest score and the metronome doesn't keep any.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards are shuffled again and the player on the right of the previous metronome becomes the new one.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the players have played as a metronome once.

    "Description": "6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.&#10;&#10;Year 1 - Re-Enforce adds 8 operators to the base game. All of them being from the first year, or the first season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&#10;&#10;For the attackers, Blackbeard is a more resilient Operator while Buck and Hibana are wall-breachers above all. Last but not least, Capit&atilde;o is all about creating &ndash; literal &ndash; chokepoints with his asphyxiating bolts!&#10;&#10;On the defenders&rsquo; side, Frost and Caveira provide very powerful reactions the attacker doesn&rsquo;t want to see triggered! On the other hand, Valkyrie and Echo are all about locating their targets: no one can escape their vigilant eye.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the players are correct, their bet is doubled, otherwise the chips are lost. The performing team is also rewarded depending on the number of tasks solved and the chips won can be used to increase the stake in the next round.&#10;&#10;",
