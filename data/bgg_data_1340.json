All outlaws already have their own special abilities. The functions for new items can be found on the following page. No prior knowledge of this adventure is required.&#10;&#10;Robin and his friends took the injured Guardian to the secret camp and were concerned if he would survive this unpredictable onslaught. Robin paced frantically, pondering who was behind this evil could. Because only he can save the keeper so that he can recover. It was clear that the Sheriff of Nottingham must be behind this curse, for the sheriff had been following her for a long time. The forest was a good hiding place and the guards always had great difficulty finding them. Suddenly voices were heard nearby. The sheriff's guards were alarmed, because Nottingham was swarming with soldiers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pagan: Beyond the Palisades is the first expansion for Pagan: Fate of Roanoke.&#10;&#10;Pagan is an asymmetrical card game for two players taking on the roles of Witch or Witch hunter. The Witch tries to carry out a ritual of renaturation before being exposed and eliminated by the Witch hunter. Nine villagers are under suspicion and only the Witch player knows who the real Witch is. Each turn, the players use their action pawns on active villagers to draw cards, play cards, gain influence and manage the Gloom. Moreover, the Witch can brew powerful potions, improve their familiar and cast enchantments and charms, while the Witch hunter enlists allies, claim strategic locations, and ruthlessly investigates the villagers.&#10;&#10;Beyond the Palisades introduces two new mechanics to Pagan: Gloom and Cleanse.&#10;Gloom is a new resource that benefits the Witch player as long as it is in play. It symbolizes the Witch's symbiotic&#10;relationship with the lands. Gloom enters the game through the play of Gloom-cards and can be reduced or increased&#10;during a game. Some cards can even break the natural limits of the Gloom on the cards.&#10;With sufficient effort and focus, it is possible to cleanse the Gloom encroaching on the village. Cleansing a card is done&#10;by removing every last bit of Gloom. Once a card is cleansed it is discarded.&#10;&#10;Content&#10;The game features 4 scenarios, 9 all new villagers, 30 Gloom tokens and 2 full pre-made decks for each player (50 cards each).&#10;&#10;",

You can compete one on one or form teams and embark on a real intelligence fight.&#10;The game begins with the first round of cards (101 to 150 cards and with 5 joker cards) to be shuffled and folded on the table. Cards are drawn in turn, questions are read aloud. If the game is a team based, team members can consult with each other. Answers are checked by the opponent or the opposing team. After playing the first round, the second is played on the same principle (from 151 to 200 cards and with 5 joker cards).&#10;1 point is awarded for the correct answer. For proper performance of the joker's task - 3 points. For transferring a joker card to another player (or team) without reading the QR code - 0 points. After scanning the QR code of a missed task, 1 point is deducted. The participant or team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The cards can be used as a stand-alone game or as an expansion for &quot;Golden Mind: a great board game&quot;.

A planning phase where players will move their characters around the ship collecting action points in the cannons, sails, spyglass, among others, that they will have to collect and then use in the exploration phase.&#10;&#10;In the exploration phase, players will take turns drawing cards from the exploration decks trying to get treasures, avoid the weather and defeat the pirates, while they are running out of supplies and the ship suffers damage that will have to be repaired if they do not want to sink. All this using their action points in the best possible way.&#10;&#10;The objective is to find in the depths of each deck the three map fragments that will take them back home.&#10;You will win the game if you succeed, and if you have the required amount of treasure in your coffers. But if a crew member drowns, they run out of supplies, or the ship sinks, they will have failed, and their ship will be one more lost in the depths of the sea.&#10;&#10;It will not be an easy task. Only cooperation, coordination and teamwork will bring you back.&#10;&#10;Beware of Pirates!&#10;&#10;The prototype of this game was awarded the &quot;Best New Latin Game&quot; award in the Quarantine Challenge 2020 organized by the game makers community in Mexico.&#10;&#10;",

By collecting and playing production cards with the requisite values for the genre you're aiming for&mdash;and whatever review you're aiming to get&mdash;you complete a production and rake in bucks at the box office. Earn more money than your competition and you win the game!&#10;&#10;Players collect and play Production Cards onto productions, in separate horizontal rows on the table in front of them, and can work on up to two at a time. There are four different &quot;roles&quot; for Production Cards: Directors (yellow), Actors (blue), On Set (red), and Post (green). Each card has a numeric cost indicating how many cards you must discard to play it on a production and most have one or more value symbols: afros, blood, boobs, buildings, explosions, fists, wheels, and reels.&#10;&#10;A production that contains all four roles can be wrapped (completed) by playing a Genre Card and Review Card onto it. Both cards show a value cost&mdash;met or exceeded with the value symbols on the Production Cards&mdash;and a box office haul for your completed film.&#10;&#10;Once a player has wrapped two productions (three in a two-player game), the game ends and box office receipts are totaled and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

It does not affect any of the restrictions regarding the placement of cards.&#10;&#10;LUNA Taxis: When a player places this tile in their Settlement, they may move one of the Project tiles they have already placed to any other empty site in their Settlement, in accordance with the standard placement rules.&#10;&#10;Astroburger: When a player places this tile in their Settlement, they may reserve one of the Project tiles that they have taken this turn by putting it on their Sponsor card.

This game is part of the Gold and Steel series which allows the campaigns of the late 15th and early 16th centuries to be played on a strategic and tactical scale.

It comes with 800 cards (200 per category - History/Geography, Famous People, General Knowledge for Adults, and General Knowledge for Children), each with 5 questions on it, for a total of 4000 trivia questions about Canada and Canadians. It also includes a gameboard with the Canadian map, 6 player pieces (which are stackable if two players land on the same space), 1 die, a plastic storage tray, and instructions.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to correctly answer a trivia question after reaching the last circle on the gameboard (in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Players take turns rolling the die to move. The color of the space they land on determines which category of question should be asked to them by the player to their right. When children are playing, they can be asked questions only from the easier children's category regardless of which color of space they land on. As long as a player continues answering questions correctly, they get to keep taking more turns. When they get a question wrong, then the player to their left gets a turn. When someone reaches the final space in Victoria, they must answer a final question correctly to win; otherwise, they must move 4 spaces backwards and wait for another turn to try again.&#10;&#10;The publisher considers certain topics &quot;integral to the educational aspects of the game&quot;, so there is some overlap between the adults' and children's questions, just with different phrasing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bear Trap: The Soviet-Afghan War is a quick-playing, low-complexity game simulating the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989). Bear Trap adapts the game system from Sekigahara to this new setting.&#10;&#10;One player takes command of the ruling Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its forces, supported by the Soviet 40th Army. The other player takes command of the local tribal rebels (the Lashkar) and Mujahideen guerrilla fighters. The Soviet player seeks to prop up the sympathetic local government and &ldquo;solve the Russian Ice-lock Problem&rdquo; while the Insurgent player seeks to expel the foreign invaders and secularist government.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of alternating turns playing cards to replenish, activate, and move units on an area-based map of Afghanistan, with battles occurring whenever units from both sides end up in the same space. Bear Trap adapts the core mechanics from GMT Games' classic Sekigahara, allowing for the possibility of betrayal and defections, but also adds several new aspects, such as hidden unit stances, powerful strategy cards, and a unique card-assisted solo mode for either side.&#10;&#10;Bear Trap is first and foremost a 2-player game, but it also includes rules for solo play (which utilizes a card-assisted flowchart bot).&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 16-20 months per Reshuffle&#10;Unit Scale: 1 Block = 500 - 8,000 soldiers&#10;Number of Players: 1 to 2&#10;Play Time: 2 to 3 hours&#10;Complexity: Low (3/9 on GMT's scale)&#10;&#10;",

The European division of Topps released a collectible trading card game in honor of this, with both a first edition earlier in the year and a 50th Anniversary edition later in the year. It was primarily sold in the UK.&#10;&#10;Alien Attax is a simple card game for two players. Each player lays 9 cards face-down. Decide who goes first by flipping a coin. The first player picks their first card and decides whether to attack or defend with it, while it is still face-down. The second player chooses which of their cards to respond with, again while it is still face-down. Then both cards are revealed, and their attack/defence numbers are compared to determine who wins that round. For the next round, the opposite player gets to make the first choice. After all 9 rounds have been played, the person who won the most rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The first-edition Alien Attax series had 240+ different cards available, and the 50th Anniversary series had an additional 160+ different cards. The 50th Anniversary cards have a grey Tardis '50' symbol in the top right corner of the fronts of the cards. Starter packs were available that included a &quot;Collector Binder&quot;, &quot;Collector Guide&quot; with checklist and how to play, and a two-sided paper play mat, in addition to cards. A Collector Tin was also offered with a bundle of cards.&#10;&#10;Note: Although 2012 copyright dates are stated on some items, this game was first sold in March 2013.&#10;&#10;",

Formula 90: Expansion #2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Barcelona and Silverstone.&#10;&#10;Race! Formula 90 is a car-racing game simulating all the typical elements of a motor sport event: car strategies, weather changes, pit stops, tire management, overtaking, doubling, and of course damages and crashes.&#10;&#10;In Race! every game turn represents one or more laps of the track, and each player is in control of only one car. Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.&#10;&#10;Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Race! Formula 90 differs from the original game with a new streamlined set of rules, better balanced strategies and skills, a companion rulebook with optional rules for shorter races, alternative weather system, new type of robot and a different race finish.&#10;All tracks completely redesigned and are circa 20% larger in size&#10;Strategy cards instead of tiles with rule reminders on the back&#10;A general improvement in components.&#10;&#10;",

The game seeks to answer the lofty questions: how do classes with disparate bases of power work together in a society, how do they struggle against each other, and who are the victims of this process?&#10;&#10;In this asymmetric card-driven game, each player plays as one of the four major caste groups (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra/Dalit) with the end goal of shaping the coming independent Indian nation-state to support their interests while dealing with their unique and unequal places in the hierarchy. Each faction has its own role to play in the game and its own method of earning victory points based on its distinct goals.&#10;&#10;In this game, the British are not a playable faction, but a non-player force that players will have to respond to, either by fighting against colonial forces, or working with them to oppose the other players.&#10;&#10;Designer note: Tyranny of Blood is about a hierarchical system that has oppressed people throughout history and has lingering effects that continue to cause suffering today. The game is meant as a condemnation of the system and a method of understanding it, not an endorsement or celebration. I hope that learning about this history will inspire players to think critically about the inequalities that plague the world today, and to struggle against them.&#10;&#10;",

The operation was viewed as only a limited offensive to secure the Mediterranean and force Italy out of the war. The Germans also intended only a limited effort to delay the Allies while a strong defense was established at the far North of the peninsula. Both sides scented greater possibilities in the early going and were drawn into what would become a grueling and expensive campaign.&#10;&#10;Using a modified version of rules from Desert Fox Deluxe, one player or team of players commands the Allied forces, the other the Axis. In general terms the Allies are trying to knock Italy out of the war and seize the greatest amount of territory as possible, while the Axis seeks to maintain control of Italian territory for the maximum amount of time.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents one month with up to six player impulses in each game turn.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios, but only the campaign scenario included in the printed rules.

The Salic Law of the Franks required that at a man&rsquo;s death, his property was divided among all his sons, which led to civil wars among Charlemagne&rsquo;s descendants when the inheritance in question was the Empire itself. From the various wills, wars and treaties dividing and redistributing the Empire during the 800s, emerged the nuclei of the modern states of France, Germany, and Italy.&#10;&#10;Each of the 10 scenarios depicts the period following a particular division of the empire, with each player taking on the role of one of the heirs. The object of the game is to reunite the Empire under a single ruler, while fending off not only fraternal Frankish rivals, but also the hostile surrounding foreign powers. Each game turn represents 1 year. The map scale is one inch to 75 miles. Each area is an historical region.

Operation Albion in part led to the collapse of the Russian Provisional Government and brought the final German victory in the East.

The game includes the post-Albion German intervention in the Finnish Civil War of 1919.&#10;&#10;Albion is a combined naval-air-land campaign. Players conduct actions which encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence, and other operations. A player can conduct one or more actions per turn. All units in the game use a similar combat system, showing the interaction of naval, air, and land forces. Each game turn represents from one day to one month depending on the pace of operations. A player may take multiple actions each GT. One inch on the map represents 40 kilometers. Ground units represent regiments, brigades, and divisions, or equivalent formations. Aircraft units represent squadrons. Ship units represent divisions of one to three battleships or battlecruisers, four to eight other cruisers, flotillas of twelve to twenty destroyers, or various numbers of other ships types.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22 x 34-inch game map 176 5/8-inch counters&#10;&#10;Published in S&amp;T #342&#10;&#10;",

Draw directly on the sheet to show where you go and what you score. When you landed somewhere it becomes your spot, no one else can score for that combination.&#10;When you land you also collect water resources to be able to roll more times and collect points to be able to win. If you want you can use your roll to instead invest in technology, to get various bonuses for the remainder of the game. This makes you more likely to reach the more difficult places to land on in our solar system and find the really high points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The French colony of Saint-Domingue produced more wealth than the rest of France's colonies combined. France chose to meet the demand for these labor-intensive crops by way of an explosive increase in slavery with nearly half a million enslaved West Africans working the Saint-Domingue plantations. The brutality and greed of the plantation owners and overseers, coupled with the extreme disregard for the enslaved Africans' humanity, set the stage for revolt. After months of hidden preparation, the signal was given following a secret Vodou ceremony. On the 21st of August, 1791, the fuse to the powder keg that was Saint-Domingue ignited with the flame of liberation.&#10;&#10;In the cooperative deck-building and strategic war game Liberation - Haiti. the players each control a geographical faction of enslaved Africans or those who escaped enslavement living in the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the early period of the Haitian Revolution, 1791 to 1793. These factions seek both the abolition of their slavery and social equality.&#10;&#10;Before rebelling and fighting for your liberty, you need to recruit people to your cause, gather information, develop maneuvers, and stockpile supplies, all while the game is opposing your actions. You have to face well-armed colonial militia and foreign armies, navigate fragile or fleeting alliances, and overcome both political and environmental challenges to win freedom for your people.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two stages: the Planning Stage and the Revolution Stage. In the Planning Stage, you use a deck of cards specific to your faction to acquire planning cards that represent intelligence, people, and materiel. Cards added to your pool will in turn help accumulate more and stronger cards of these types. In the Revolution Stage, you use your acquired card pool to overthrow the colonial slave system by deploying units to raid plantations, defeat enemy forces, seize control of strategic locations, increase the morale of your people, and meet political challenges.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces on yellow stars may not be captured, but can be on black stars.&#10;&#10;The first player to move all of his stones to the central star wins the game.&#10;&#10;A variant of &quot;Mensch &auml;rgere dich nicht&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Variante von &quot;Mensch &auml;rgere dich nicht&quot;.&#10;Gew&uuml;rfelt wird reihum. Wer seinen Zug auf einem schwarzen Stern  beendet darf im n&auml;chsten Zug auf die gelbe Innenbahn wechseln. Wenn sein Spielstein dort auf ein besetztes Feld trifft, muss er wieder auf die rote Au&szlig;enbahn wechseln. Spielsteine auf gelben Feldern d&uuml;rfen nicht geschlagen werden, auf schwarzen Feldern ist dies aber m&ouml;glich.&#10;Wer zuerst alle seine Steine auf den zentralen Stern bef&ouml;rdert hat gewinnt das Spiel.
