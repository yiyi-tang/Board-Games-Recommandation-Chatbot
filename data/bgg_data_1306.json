If playing the full game, players choose only a few clubs to bring to the links and must compete with only the dice recipes for those clubs. The tee and hazard locations move based on the holes.&#10;&#10;This was distributed as part of the Spring 2021 Market Crash pack and players must provide their own playing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

If the same cards are written by multiple players, the player with stronger hands will be eliminated from the game. Among the remaining players, the player with the strongest hands wins.&#10;&#10;In TrumPen Blackjack, you collect played cards so that the sum of the numbers you have is as close to 21 as possible. You score points depending on the sum of the numbers you have. The winner is decided after 3 rounds.&#10;&#10;In TrumPen Trick Taking, you play 3 tricks per round for 3 rounds, therefore you play 9 tricks in total and score the points.  Write down the numbers to 3 cards when they are dealt, then write the suit when you play. This is a trick-taking game with must-follow, no trump, and no bidding.&#10;&#10;In TrumPen Speed, you play your cards in a way that cards are stacked in sequential order as quickly as possible. The player who played all of their cards first wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Finding out about this Star Player&rsquo;s early career can be tricky, because once you go back far enough he starts appearing under two different names. That&rsquo;s because it wasn&rsquo;t until an unlucky run-in with an ambitious Necromancer that decidedly average players Franklyn Smyth and Steiner S. Scottward became more than the sum of their parts.&#10;&#10;After an illustrious career with his &lsquo;repossessed&rsquo; team, Frank &lsquo;n&rsquo; Stein was chased away from the Blood Bowl pitch after an unfortunate lightning strike sent him into a berserk frenzy, killing four players, a referee, and scores of unlucky bystanders. In a shocking twist, after his hugely popular Cabalvision commercials for Lightningade Electrolyte Drink, fans put down their pitchforks and he now plays for whoever can pay him the most.&#10;&#10;As if his huge and powerful frame wasn&rsquo;t good enough at stopping the opposing team dead in their tracks, the big lug&rsquo;s brutal play style often rears its head when an unfortunate soul he&rsquo;s grabbed gets an extra-large kicking.&#10;&#10;Combined with Steiner&rsquo;s size and Franklyn&rsquo;s keen tactical mind, Frank &lsquo;n&rsquo; Stein is an extremely dependable rock around which many Blood Bowl teams have been built &ndash; at least the ones able to pay his 250,000 GP fee. The Sylvanian Spotlight and Old World Classic teams that take him on will be glad to know he&rsquo;s sticking around for the long haul, what with the Regeneration and Thick Skull abilities keeping him in the game.&#10;&#10;The sky&rsquo;s starting to look a bit cloudy, and I don&rsquo;t want to be around the next time a lightning strike finds him, so it&rsquo;s back to you in the commentary box, Jim and Bob.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player counts the sizes of their visibly connected groups and multiplies their counts together. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Like Spao, each game will last exactly 30 moves. Unlike Spao, hidden connections do not count, and the combined removal and double placement leads to more complex and dynamic board positions.&#10;&#10;",

Mike Mullins (Bottom of the 9th, Pentaquark) did such a fantastic job capturing the feel of the multiplayer game when he designed the original Flower Shoppe that we knew we&rsquo;d want more of his work. Flower Shoppe built on the base game by using Turn cards which direct how cards must be dealt (and taken) while letting the player decide how they&rsquo;re actually assigned. It&rsquo;s a great solo mode, but it&rsquo;s still missing something that every Flower Shoppe should have: customers!&#10;&#10;The new Customers expansion features 6 Customer cards, 2 of which are added to the deck between each round. Whenever a customer comes up, their unique ability will be resolved. Customers might reorganize the player&rsquo;s arrangement, replace claimed cards, let the player sneak a peek at the opponent&rsquo;s cards, or otherwise change the game. Not all of these abilities are helpful: sometimes the player will have to adjust on the fly. Just remember that the customer is always right!&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents: 6 Customer cards&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;    During setup, shuffle two random customer cards into the Turn deck.&#10;    If the first card revealed in any round is a customer, set it aside and resolve it after the&#10;&#10;&#10;first turn.&#10;&#10;    All customers must be resolved unless the effect description includes the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.&#10;    If there are no valid targets for an effect, it is ignored.&#10;    After resolving a customer, it is removed from the game.&#10;    Between rounds, shuffle two new random customers into&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A map scale is not given.&#10;&#10;The rules leave a lot of basic movement and combat procedures unspoken (it is stated that familiarity with other games is assumed). Many rules are devoted to the difficulties of moving, fighting, and supplying units in the mountainous terrain.&#10;&#10;The game generally lasts for 12 turns but may be extended up to 16 by the Italian player at a cost of 15 victory points per turn. Victory points are earned by eliminating opposing units, holding certain cities, and (for the Italians) exiting certain parts of the map.&#10;&#10;Fixed reinforcements enter on the second turn and the Italians may bring in optional reinforcements later at a cost. A few British units and RAF support may appear later as well.&#10;&#10;The game can be combined with Egypt: David vs. Goliath &#226;&#128;&#147; The Italian-African Campaign and Crete, Gibraltar, &amp; Malta.&#10;&#10;",

Turning them over reveals the inner life, the organism, of the character on which the &quot;stimulants&quot; circulate. In addition to the luck of the dice, tactics also play a role in determining whether the character is in bad shape or whether you can help him break bad habits or get a grip on his alcohol problems.&#10;&#10;There are situations in which health is put at risk or promoted.&#10;To win you must have done the following things:&#10;&#10;     you must have your own token on all the colored consumption playing fields&#10;     you must not have a token on any of the sickness playing fields&#10;     you must not have any more tokens on the black points or the supply bag&#10;     the products on the target fields must be converted into apples.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the period of the war from 1942 to 1945 in Europe, when the USA became heavily involved in the war. The game uses the Triangle system, which is very flexible and allows many optional rules to be applied. The mechanics of the game allow simulation of battles with a large number of individual aircraft, with a fluid gameplay.&#10;&#10;The game may seem too simple at first sight, as most of the&nbsp;mechanics are numbers (speed, agility, firepower, etc.) which are modified by dice and several factors. However, while being easy to use, the basically simple mechanics form a very realistic set of physics, which simulate velocity, direction changing (both horizontal and vertical) and damage inflicted by firing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Give me money, players get smartphones for free with the MNP (Mobile Number Portability). You need to trick the portability system to get smartphones for free. The players are kids who will try to take advantage of the system and earn money by changing phone companies.&#10;&#10;We are playing with three different operators (colors). Each of them will offer phones to pick up when taking out contracts. These phones have different values and therefore will be more or less attractive to gamers.&#10;&#10;The cards are separated by operators and form three piles. At the start of the game a market is created by drawing as many cards as there are players in each operator deck (with two players two cards per operator so six in total).&#10;&#10;A round is made up of several phases. The game ends when you can no longer replenish the market. The final count is simple: add the yen tokens (1 point each) and the value of the cards and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;Possibly a spin-off from the Keitai Shoujo romance game app.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beat to Quarters is an official expansion to Flying Colors by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game (preferably the latest deluxe edition) to play.&#10;&#10;One of the most common criticisms of Flying Colors is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.&#10;&#10;Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.&#10;&#10;Individual tracking cards are included for all 562 individually named ships included with the latest, deluxe version of Flying Colors. But that&rsquo;s not all!&#10;&#10;As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Flying Colors. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Flying Colors. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the battle of Trafalgar without the space requirements for three game maps.&#10;&#10;With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Flying Colors!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Beat to Quarters can be purchased from:&#10;&#10; Volume I - Flying Colors&#10; Volume II - Serpents-of-the-Seas&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nantetta is a game of imagination. The title &ldquo;Nantetta&rdquo; means &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; in Japanese.&#10;&#10;The active player chooses one of the cards on the table at heart. They think of the phrase that would go in the words balloon of that card, and announce it. Imagine in your own way by observing the character's expression and situation. What kind of phrase would be suitable to tell the feelings you came up with?&#10;&#10;Other players imagine the feelings from the announced phrase, and search for the card that would be correct. The way the active player said it can be a hint. Look at the cards on the table carefully, and if you think you found it, take it as fast as possible. If you take the correct one, you get that card as a reward.&#10;&#10;Players take turns one by one, imagining the feelings from the picture, and announce the phrase freely. Other players may sympathize, or get surprised.&#10;Continue doing this, and the person who gets 5 cards first is the winner.&#10;There's no wrong phrases or right phrases. It's important to announce the phrase you came up with.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, you would feel very happy if others sympathize and understand what you meant. This experience of being understood helps them to think of the phrases that people can understand naturally.&#10;&#10;",

As visitors flock to this newly-formed island nation, the governing authorities are looking to make a splash on the global stage and entice people to take up permanent residence. What better way to showcase this beautiful country than by becoming a world power in the beautiful game? Take the reins of the national football squad, use a recruiting loophole to pick some of the best players from around the globe, and lead Antarctica to World Cup glory in this challenging card-drafting, dice-chucking game for one!&#10;&#10;In Pocket World Cup, you will play the role of team manager leading Antarctica through three years of World Cup qualifying. Each year you will draft 3 new players to your team and face 3 opponents in an attempt to earn momentum. Games are resolved by rolling dice for both sides, with each player offering additional dice or the ability to manipulate the dice in play. The players will get better as you progress from one year to the next, but so will your competition. If you earn enough momentum after three years, you will qualify for the World Cup: a 24-team single-elimination knockout tournament.&#10;&#10;For a greater challenge, you can play in Dynasty Mode: a campaign of four complete cycles of qualifying games and World Cups in which you earn victory points based on how far you advance each cycle. Earn enough and your name will be etched forever in the Antarctican Hall of Fame!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
