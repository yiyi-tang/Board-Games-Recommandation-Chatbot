They provide the opportunity to refight skirmishes in the Channel, the Mediterranean and the Pacific with MTB attacks on Convoys and similar furious engagements.&#10;&#10;A SET OF QUICK REFERENCE SHEETS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE&#10;&#10;&#10;     miniatures scale: 1/600 or 1/1200&#10;     Complexity: 8/10&#10;     Level of detail: 7/10&#10;     Dice required: D10, D6&#10;&#10;&#10;This edition of the rules has been updated and now uses the initiative system that appears in other products in the A&amp;AGE range. &#10;&#10;     Play alternates between the two sides, with the initiative winner deciding who will move first each turn. &#10;     The time scale in the turn is now about 40 seconds, and the models move 1cm per knot on the table. &#10;     The speed that vessels can move is regulated by the concept of Speed Settings, based on 1/4&rsquo;s of the ship&rsquo;s speed, and therefore constraining the model&rsquo;s movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shooting now takes the rate of fire of a weapon mount into account in more detail, and gun mounts may roll more than 1 dice to hit. Guns with slow rates of fire are penalised. As the game turn is now longer, the damage inflicted has been increased, and there is a bit more differentiation between different gun calibres. &#10;     Hull Damage and Special Damage is evaluated separately for each hit. Some weapons will not damage the hull but could affect the ship in other ways. You cannot sink a destroyer with a machine gun, but you could suppress the gun crews. &#10;     Torpedoes are represented by individual tracks, so the player needs to have a good aim and be able to judge the distance to the target.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The rules also allow for the use of Aircraft, Submarines, Minefields and Armed Merchant ships. &#10;     The data annexe has been expanded and now covers over 250 vessels and 200 aircraft.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game support material (template, record sheet, erratas) is available to download on the publisher's website.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence:&#10;&#10;     Determine initiative &#10;     Movement Phase: a)drifting vessels / b)Contact Markers and Ships / c)aircraft &#10;     Spotting &#10;     Damage Control and Repairs &#10;     Shoot guns, attack using aircraft &#10;     Torpedo attacks  a) Advance existing tracks  b) Launch new tracks  c) Resolve any torpedo attacks &#10;     End Phase &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tanares Adventures is a massive expansion for Arena: the Contest. With more than 40 miniatures and 70 different types of villains, it takes the cooperative campaign content beyond 100 hours of unique gameplay, and adds a new Combat Role to multiply the possibilities in PvP and Co-op matches.&#10;&#10;The PvP Game Modes (Capture the Orb, Tournament, Team Competition) become richer with the addition of the Commanders and their respective Companions. With a second miniature on the board, this new Combat Role (8th in total) brings to the table interesting and varied strategical and tactical novelties, and teambuilding synergies.&#10;&#10;The game's Co-op/Campaign Mode now develops in a semi-open world, where players can consult an Adventure Map and decide where they want to go next, instead of being linearly directed by the story.&#10;&#10;The Campaign runs in Cycles, each with three phases: City Phase, Journey Phase, and Quest Phase.&#10;&#10;In the City Phase, players have the opportunity to buy items, rest, and develop sidequests related to City Structures (that can be upgraded), Relics (rewards obtained by completing a Quest, that initiate optional story arcs with a puzzle vibe), and others.&#10;&#10;In the Journey Phase, players read a prelude related to the region they want to visit, in connection with the overall story, and prepare for the Quest, by studying what they may face (this changes according to Story Facts unlocked), assigning tasks to Assets (helpful NPCs that join the team as the story progresses), equipping items, and more.&#10;&#10;Finally, in the Quest Phase, the game board is assembled and dozens of different villains may be faced. The dungeon crawling and replayability vibe is heightened by the addition of random encounters, secret rooms with previously unknown content, events and interactions that require tough decisions during the mission, and more.&#10;&#10;All your decisions matter and significantly impact the Quests&rsquo; gameplay, modifying even the circumstances of the multi-part epic final mission, and determines the Boss (or Bosses) you might face, in an exciting campaign with multiple endings.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Modern Armor&#10;&#10;This rule system evolved from many play sessions of WRG&rsquo;s Wargames Rules 1950&ndash;2000,Advanced Squad Leader, Panzertruppe, and so on.&#10;&#10;The objective is a fast moving game that provides verisimilitude, and addresses basic problems present in many games with reaction to enemy actions.&#10;&#10;The figure scale is a single vehicle or squad of infantry, with a turn covering (very) roughly five minutes of combat.&#10;&#10;The rules are written to allow hex or map measurement, with one unit of distance equaling 50 meters. &#10;Typical scale is 1&rdquo;=50m as a decent compromise between the scale of micro-armor figures and playing spaces.&#10;&#10;Modern combat is extremely lethal, with the first to detect usually scores hits or kills. Ranges have grown immensely since World War II, where most tank combat was under 700 meters. Avigdor Kahalani famously engaged the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War at 3000 meters, and ranges stretched out even further in the Gulf War as computer-assisted fire control came into combat. Artillery support has become ever more mobile and fast reacting, with radar-assisted counter-battery fire. Air support is more nimble, too, especially once laser-guided munitions become commonplace.&#10;&#10;Core concepts are the alternating player turn, detection, and defensive fire during the active player&rsquo;s movement, and cohesion.&#10;&#10;Included in this title:&#10;&#10;     Complete Rule System, including vehicle and equipment charts covering 1945 to the present day.&#10;     Combat Tables&#10;     Game Counters and Artillery Templates&#10;     Sample historical scenarios&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Great War is usually portrayed and imagined with the blasted landscapes of the static, trench warfare that emerged late in 1914 and persisted far into the conflict. However, while it is fair to recognize that much of WWI was characterized by this stalemate, it is also fair to point out that the early and later parts of the war were witness to operations of maneuver in which armies sought to take key positions and outflank enemy forces.&#10;&#10;And it is these early battles of WWI which inspired us, some friends in the industry, and some wargaming collaborators to focus on that particular period of WWI. Our aim was to produce a set of wargames rules that caters to this style of fighting and challenges the players with constant tactical decisions and does not burden them with a lot of rules. 1914 shares some mechanisms with our WWII game, Iron Cross, so players familiar with that ruleset will recognize this one, but it plays differently.&#10;&#10;The battalion is the core tactical element in the game in a formation that is roughly the size of a British brigade. The game mechanisms are easy to grasp and make the game flow smoothly and ensure that both sides are always involved, especially when an opponent is activating units. 1914 is a game in which players act as the overall commander for the battle, developing and co-ordinating a plan for the achievement of operational objectives, and entrusting individual battalions to execute those plans. It is purposely uncomplicated to allow players to concentrate on the scale of the battle, but the action/reaction system ensures that all players are involved at all times, making tactical decisions affecting their own commands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with an army of 5 characters, which they place face-down in their castle on the board. It is played clockwise. In each turn, a player must either move one of their characters (only forwards, after the first duel in any direction, but never backwards),  or attack one orthogonal adjacent (or diagonal adjacent, if the player has only one character left) opposing character. When a player declares an attack, they choose the damage class (magical, weapon or body) and both characters are revealed (and stay revealed). If the attacking character has a higher value in this damage class, the defending character is captured (similar to chess). If both values are equal, the total sum of damage points is decisive. It that sum is still equal, both characters are removed from play. In each other cases (defender wins the duel), nothing happens.&#10;&#10;If a character is on the border of the opponent&rsquo;s area, it can be switched-out for another character. If a player has their last character, it is also possible to switch it on the corners fields of the central neutral area.&#10;&#10;When an opposing unit is offside, so that it is no longer possible for the other player to attack this character, that player may also move backwards until both characters are on the same line.&#10;&#10;The first player who reaches the opposing castle with one of their characters wins. When all characters have been captured (which may happen, if the last duel results in a tie), the game ends with a draw.&#10;&#10;",

The Coalition forces were strung out, navigating by compass and GPS. Fog, sandstorms and &ldquo;oil rain&rdquo; confused the picture on the battlefield. All of this, on paper, should have given the Iraqis a  fighting chance. Instead, by the end of the 26th of February, 1991, the best they had to offer had been annihilated.&#10;&#10;This scenario recreates the historical battle. Variants allow you to explore what would have happened if the Iraqis had been better prepared, luckier, or better trained.&#10;&#10;This scenario contains:&#10;&#10;     Historical information on units and deployment suitable for use with any micro-armor system.&#10;     Unit statistics and scenario rules for Modern Armor&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion is a campaign allowing players to live an adventure scripted in 5 scenarios which brings, collectively during the game, players to make choices that will tip the story towards Peace or World War.&#10;&#10;At the start of a game, players open an envelope containing the story, the special rules of the scenario and the extra cards for this scenario. Then, at the end of the game, each player receives different rewards depending on whether they won or lost and according to their own choices during the game (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;Thus, each one builds their Heritage over the 5 scenarios. The winner of the campaign is the one who wins the last scenario.&#10;&#10;The campaign offers 6 scenarios in all because there is a branch, depending on the choice of players in scenario 4.&#10;&#10;During the campaign and after the campaign, the players will unlock cards which can come to enrich the basic game definitively. The Heritage campaigns therefore offer players to live a story and gradually unlock a mini-extension to the base game offering a new mechanic, a bit like a Legacy, but totally replayable because there is no alteration of equipment.&#10;&#10;The campaign is also playable solo.&#10;&#10;Included in the Kickstarter Heritage edition of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Now you can enjoy a brand new way to play Mesozooic with the Jurassic Mini Expansion. Corporate has stepped in with instructions for what they think is best for your zoo. As franchise owners of Mesozoo Inc., you&rsquo;ll want to work together to take your zoo to the next level and fulfill Corporate&rsquo;s mandates. Then make your zoo even more entertaining by hiring costume mascots!&#10;&#10;In the Jurassic Mini Expansion you can play a competitive or cooperative variant to keep Corporate happy. When playing cooperatively, you&rsquo;ll shuffle the 16 mandate cards with the cooperative icon in the bottom-left corner to create the mandate deck from Corporate. Corporate may ask you to make sure your zoo contains at least 3 continuous monorail connections, or have at least 1 enclosure, 1 monorail connection, and 1 scoring attraction, for example.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll play three rounds of Mesozooic like normal, but your goal each round is to work together and collectively meet or exceed the score shown on the level card. As long as at least one player meets the requirements for the mandate, the card will be discarded. For each incomplete mandate, 10 points will be subtracted from the round&rsquo;s score. If the final total is lower than the value on the level you chose, players will immediately lose. So make sure to divide and conquer as you work together to keep Corporate happy!&#10;&#10;In the competitive variant, three mandates will be available each round to all players. Each player will score 3 extra points for each mandate they complete.&#10;&#10;In the Jurassic Mini Expansion there are 8 mascot cards. There are mascots for the enclosures, attractions and trucks, monorails, topiaries, and advanced cards.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, shuffle the mascot cards facedown. Then take mascots equal to the number of players and place them faceup in the middle of the table. Flip the timer and begin sliding cards like normal to create your zoo. At any time after the timer is flipped, when you don&rsquo;t want to slide any more cards, you can take one available mascot.

    "Description": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar is more than a game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a hobby. Build armies of plastic warriors drawn from the many warring factions that inhabit the Mortal Realms, paint your models to personalise your collection, and take them to the tabletop to play fast-paced games of strategy and action that will allow you to tell your own stories within the Age of Sigmar.&#10;&#10;The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar features the most comprehensive look at the core rules since the first Generals Handbook, and like those changes, the new ones will have an equally huge impact on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Artefacts of the Realms&#10;The Mortal Realms are enormous, and the factions that fight among them are characterised as much by which of the realms they hail from as by their Grand Alliance. Previously, we&rsquo;ve seen this represented largely through creative paint jobs and appropriate basing, with some hobbyists using clever conversions to identify where their force comes from. Now, in the new edition, you&rsquo;ll be able to represent where your army hails from with 84 new magic items. When you&rsquo;re writing your army list, you have the option to pick a Realm for your army to be from. As well as providing you with loads of opportunities for roleplaying (not to mention painting and converting), you&rsquo;ll be able to replace one of your normal Artefact picks with a special artefact from your chosen realm.&#10;&#10;Battling in the Realms&#10;The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar turns the Mortal Realms into rich backdrops for all of your battles. These aren&rsquo;t just optional expansions, but a core part of the game. Each of the Mortal Realms has a set of unique rules that create unusual challenges and opportunities for the armies fighting in them. Firstly, each realm has a command ability, apart from Shyish, which has two, and Ghur, which has wandering, feral monsters instead. Available to every Hero fighting in that realm, these abilities ensure that your army fights in a thematically appropriate way for the realm it&rsquo;s in. Secondly, each Realm has a set of Realmscape Features &ndash; a random in-game effect that&rsquo;ll often have a significant impact on how your game will go. Last, but not least, each of the Mortal Realms has a massive selection of spells associated with it, representing the unique powers that Wizards are able to harness. Each realm has seven spells, ALL of which will be available to ANY Wizard fighting in that realm. Finally, choosing a Realm has a range of impacts on certain warscrolls. Each endless spell, for example, is more powerful when cast in its associated realm.&#10;&#10;Command Abilities and Command Points&#10;There are loads of awesome command abilities in Warhammer Age of Sigmar, but in the previous edition, some would almost never see play because they belonged to models who weren&rsquo;t being used as generals. In the new edition, every Hero can contribute and use their command ability, whether they&rsquo;re your general or not. There&rsquo;s a twist, however &ndash; to use any of your command abilities, you&rsquo;ll need a new resource, known as command points. Command points represent the tactical cohesion of your forces &ndash; you&rsquo;ll receive one to add to your pool every turn, and you&rsquo;ll get an additional point at the beginning of the game per warscroll battalion you&rsquo;ve used. That&rsquo;s not all! There are now three command abilities every single army and every single general can use &ndash; a tweaked Inspiring Presence, At the Double and Forward to Victory.&#10;&#10;Endless Spells&#10;Magic is changing in the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, offering you something never seen on our tables before &ndash; physical sorceries with models and rules of their own. Endless spells are cast like normal spells, but rather than resolving their text with a mere roll of the dice, each summons a model to the table. This miniature then persists throughout the game until it&rsquo;s dispelled. Endless spells are moved at the start of each battle round after determining who gets the first turn, with players taking it in turns to pick a spell to move, starting with the player that has the second turn that round. You&rsquo;ll be able to move any Endless Spell with this move, not just the ones you control, representing their wild and untameable nature.&#10;&#10;Look Out, Sir!&#10;With the new command ability system making Heroes more useful than ever, the last thing you want is to watch a critical support character get shot off the table before they get to do anything interesting. In the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, we&rsquo;ve balanced this with a new ability for Heroes that&rsquo;ll make your smaller and more vulnerable characters a lot more durable at range. By keeping your heroes close to your units, you&rsquo;ll make them much harder for enemies to kill at range.&#10;&#10;Magic: Casting and Unbinding&#10;Magic is most interesting when each army&rsquo;s magic phase is distinct and defined by the unique character of the wizards involved. To do that, the new edition sees a change to two classic spells &ndash; Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield &ndash; to offer more incentive to use the unique spells each Wizard has access to. You&rsquo;ll still find these spells a valuable part of any wizard&rsquo;s toolkit, but they&rsquo;ve been toned down in comparison to others. Secondly, you can now attempt to unbind a spell at a massive 30&Prime; range, up from 18&Prime;, making unbinding much easier and also giving you a chance to deny your enemy key spells even in the first turn of the game, where you may not have had a chance to move your wizards into defensive positions.&#10;&#10;Measuring and Piling In&#10;We know most people play Warhammer Age of Sigmar measuring from bases already, so this is just a case of enshrining it in rules and making way for a more tactical era of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Piling in has changed to work with the new, official base-to-base system, to allow you to get as many models into combat as possible. Where previously, you could only pile in towards the closest enemy model before having to stop, now, you can pile in even if you&rsquo;re right next to someone &ndash; provided you don&rsquo;t move any further away from the nearest enemy model. This should make large units a bit easier to use and should make surrounding enemies a bit simpler. Secondly, you can&rsquo;t choose not to attack with a unit anymore &ndash; the combat phase only ends when every single eligible unit has piled in and participated.&#10;&#10;Shooting in Combat&#10;Shooting in the new edition is changing slightly. While you&rsquo;ll still be able to shoot whilst in combat, you won&rsquo;t be able to shoot out of it. This makes for a more dynamic game as far as shooting is involved. Taking a few fast-moving, durable units in your army will be key for quickly occupying shooting units that&rsquo;d usually play havoc with the squishier elements of your forces, while defensively, you&rsquo;ll want to screen your key ranged troops with support troops.&#10;&#10;Summoning, For Free!&#10;In the new edition, summoning has been changed to work better for everyone and to properly reflect the unique character of each army that uses it. Rather than summoning units through magical spells, every army that could summon units before now has a unique resource that allows them to bring fresh reinforcements onto the tabletop that fits with their army&rsquo;s background. The big change for matched play, though, is that summoning now no longer costs reinforcement points! Instead, you earn your summoned units with in-game actions: bloodshed, spreading plague, mastering magic, and other thematic goals.&#10;&#10;Turn Priority&#10;In Warhammer Age of Sigmar, the game is split into battle rounds, and players roll at the beginning of each round to see who goes first. This means, in effect, a player may occasionally get to take two turns in a row. In the new edition, the studio have added an extra level of depth, choice and chance to this mechanic, as well as removing some of the randomness, to make for more tactical games. Previously, players would roll off to determine who gets to decide who gets the first turn in each battle round, with the winner getting to choose. This works in much the same way in the new edition, but now, if the players get a draw, the player that went first in the previous battle round wins the roll.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Breaking Ball is a Sports themed game based on one of the Irish National Sports - Gaelic Football. It is a card and dice game with an emphasis on tactical use of your team players throughout a game.&#10;&#10;Each team has 15 'players' in various positions throughout the playing pitch from Goalkeeper to Full Forwards. It follows the proper rules of Gaelic Football.&#10;&#10;Each team tries to win possession of the football and beat their opponent in that 'zone' of the playing field before passing the ball via various attacking cards, while their opponent tries to intercept the ball by counteracting their moves with their defending cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player gets past their opponent and successfully  moves the ball through the playing field zones into their attacking half of the field they can attempt to shoot for a point from long range (using dice, the further out harder it is to score) or they can try and work their way in to shoot for a goal or an easy point, whilst their opponent tries to dispossess them of the ball (by means of card moves). A goal represents 3 points and a point is, well 1 point! (a point in Gaelic Football is kicking the ball over the crossbar and much easier to accomplish than scoring a goal).&#10;&#10;Players can get yellow carded and red cards sent off - there are star players on each team with added skills and the tactical element of how you deploy your players can have a big impact on the outcome.&#10;&#10;Its a 2 player game (2 teams) but players do join together to manage a team against other opponents.&#10;&#10;Tactics is a big part of the game and how you deploy your team and counteract your opponents star players will have a bearing on the outcome.&#10;&#10;So game play follows the rules to move up and down the field as each player tries to work their way into a possible scoring zone.&#10;&#10;Play in a real game lasts 30 minutes per half but players can decide a time limit. The winner is the player with the highest combined score (goals and points) at the end of the allotted time.&#10;&#10;",

Throughout the game you'll be trying to:  increase the size of your fleet, upgrade your fleet, purchase flight times between two cities, keep your planes fueled, and either rent hangar space for your airplanes that are waiting for demand or reassign your planes to a different route that is more lucrative.&#10;&#10;There will be a map of the USA with cities connected to each other by lines.  Those cities will have space (hangars) for small plane tokens.  Above the connection line will be flight times, which are spaces for tokens to claim to be able to fly the route.  Below the connection line will be space for passenger tokens to be placed, showing demand for the route.&#10;&#10;When you buy a plane you will receive a small plane board with a number of seats available for passenger tokens to fit into, as well as tracks next to the plane showing fuel status and amenities level this plane is at.  In addition, you will have tokens to indicate seats that are upgraded to first class seats, providing more income on your flight.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CROIX DE GUERRE brings the French order of battle back into print and adds DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE, the brand new Historical ASL campaign on the crossing of the Meuse in May 1940. In addition to the original eight CdG scenarios and the ten new DINANT scenarios, CROIX DE GUERRE includes 22 more out-of-print French scenarios updated for balance and clarity plus a bonus 1944 scenario on the Dinant map. Also included are mapboards 42 and 43 and a revised National Capabilities Chart.&#10;&#10;CROIX DE GUERRE not only provides the standard French blue counters for use in 1939-40, but also provides for the first time unique infantry counters for the Vichy French regime&rsquo;s overseas colonies (two-tone French-blue-in-German-blue) and for the Free French (standard French blue with a Cross of Lorraine). That means all the personnel, weapons, and uniquely French vehicle counters used by French forces throughout World War II, as well as the detailed Chapter H historical notes to accompany the counters and revised Chapter A rules to reflect the new French infantry counters.&#10;&#10;DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE takes players through the rapid movement of Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Panzer-Division 7 across the Meuse and through the &ldquo;impenetrable&rdquo; Bois d&rsquo;Ardennes and shows the fighting at the southernmost portion of the river crossing at the town of Dinant during 11-14 May, 1940. Facing the Germans were the exhausted men of the 18th Infantry Division, who had marched almost 50 miles in the preceding three days. High Command had stripped from them all their 60mm mortars, almost half of their motorized transport, and many of their 25mm anti-tank guns, giving those to units &ldquo;more likely to face action.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE features two historical 22&#203;&#157;&times;34&#203;&#157; map sections with several new terrain types&mdash;Road Tunnels, Railroad Embankment Underpasses, 15th Century Fortresses, Weirs, and Retaining Walls. The 10 scenarios showcase fighting at and around the area of the crossing. Players will navigate through a maze of narrow streets alongside the Meuse River at the bottom of 90&acute; high cliffs and then climb to the plateau above. The Campaign Game will also see the German player building pontoon bridges and assembling ferries for men, tanks, and equipment to cross the river, all while under fire.&#10;&#10;CROIX DE GUERRE is therefore much more than a mere reprint of its predecessor and showcases the French army as never before. Vive la France!&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;&#10;        11 countersheets &#10;        two 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (for DINANT: ROMMEL AT THE MEUSE)&#10;        two 8&quot; x 22&quot; standard ASL geomorphic maps (42 and 43)&#10;        French Chapter H and revised French Chapter A pages&#10;        Chapter DN (with the DINANT HASL rules)&#10;        41 ASL scenarios (including 11 for the DINANT HASL)&#10;        two DINANT HASL chapter dividers&#10;        one revised National Capabilities Chart&#10;&#10;&#10;The 22 out-of-print French scenarios included are:&#10;A52 Swan Song&#10;A64 Chateau de Quesnoy&#10;A66 Counterstroke at Stonne&#10;A89 First Day of Diadem&#10;A94 Last Defense Line&#10;A96 In Rommel's Wake&#10;A104 In Front of the Storm&#10;A108 Sudden Death&#10;A119 Showdown in Syria&#10;G46 Triumph Atop Taraldsvikfjell&#10;U Chance d'une Affaire&#10;J35 Siam Sambal&#10;J44 Audacity!&#10;J45 The Last Roadblock&#10;J69 The Army at the Edge of the World&#10;J70 Just an Illusion&#10;J76 Ultimate Treachery&#10;J90 The Time of Humiliations&#10;U1 The French Decide to Fight&#10;U20 Fighting at the World&rsquo;s Edge&#10;U21 The French Perimeter&#10;WO2 Failure to Communicate&#10;&#10;Note: Box says copyright 2019 but actually released in 2020.&#10;&#10;(from MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

In reaction, a groundswell of unified outrage has risen up from below, allowing Runners to fight back from directions never seen before.

    "Description": "There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in the town of Backwater that don&rsquo;t belong. It fills the air with energy, like it feels before a storm. Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.&#10;&#10;King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.&#10;&#10;For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.&#10;&#10;Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.&#10;&#10;With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;King of the West card game set 1: The Vigilant, including The Drifter, The Gambler, The Baron, and their locations.&#10;&#10;",
