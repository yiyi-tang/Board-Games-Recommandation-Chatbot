The pieces are tall Eagles with wings held up, and are the only thing this game has to do with Eagles.  The game could easily be played with an ordinary Checkers set.&#10;&#10;The board is rotated so that light-colored corners are closest to each player.  The closest square is empty, but the next closest eight squares are where the Eagles start the game for each player.  Players take turns moving and capturing each other's Eagles.  Eagles may move to one adjacent light-colored square in any direction.  They may jump a friendly piece, like in Halma, to an opposite vacant square.  Multiple jumps are possible but not required.  When jumping an opponent's Eagle in the same manner, the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  Jumping and capturing are not compulsory.  The first player to remove all his opponent's pieces from the board (or to trap them so they cannot move) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players earn bonuses for collecting species wanted by their zoo (these vary from player to player - it's a bit like the mission in Risk) and can transfer a species from another player into their own collection, adding a dimension of player interaction.&#10;&#10;The game has a finely-tuned probability mechanism - an understanding of probability therefore helps (details of the probablity distribution are on the publisher's website) but is not essential.&#10;&#10;Rule variations, including different ending conditions, are also available on publisher's website.&#10;&#10;",

You may need to be sneaky - You may need to out-bluff the others - You may need help from the Man in Black - Yet to win, you must collect 39 Clue Points first. May the cleverest Cahill control the world!&#10;&#10;Players work to achieve 39 clue point by playing in turns. The turn consists of a player playing one of five types of cards (family, clue, transportation, block/unblock, or person). The cards must be played in a certain order in the &quot;stack&quot;. With the exception of the block/unblock cards which can be used to stop a stack from progressing or to unblock a stoped stack. Once the pre-defined order is met the player that completed the stack gets to score the clue points from the stack. Sound easy?  It's not! When it is time for a player to score a stack, all players, including the player who finished the stack must subtract points from thier score equal to all clue points in their hand. Conversly whom ever has either Amy or Dan Cahill will score one point for each card even if they did not finish the stack.&#10;&#10;Game play typically lasts 20-30 mintues.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Communism in the West contains two games covering Communist insurections in the Western Hemishphere during the 20th century.  Both games use area movement and the same combat/game system. CHE is the introductory game in the system and Cuban Revolution builds upon the basic concepts used in CHE adding in Air, Naval, and Artillery units as well as more advanced game concepts.&#10;&#10;CUBAN REVOLUTION: Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.&#10;&#10;CHE: In March, 1967 the situation in Bolivia was chaotic and the country was ripe for the exportation of &quot;The Cuban Revolution&quot;.  Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara was sent to Bolivia to begin a revolution which ultimately failed due to the intervention of the CIA and US Green Berets who trained three elite Bolivian ranger battalions who captured &quot;Che&quot; Guevara and later executed him thus ending the Communist threat in Bolivia.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.&quot; - Admiral Helena Cain&#10;&#10;The arrival of the Battlestar Pegasus heralds a new era in the lives of the Galactica crew and the Colonial government, bringing badly needed manpower and firepower to humanity's ongoing fight against the Cylons. However, under the command of Admiral Cain there is no place for compassion or mercy. Now brutal necessity and hard choices erode humanity's moral compass. The Cylons, in turn, are changing as well. The more they are exposed to humans, the more their individual agendas begin to guide their actions. In a time of suspicion and desperate need, the line between right and wrong grows less and less distinct.&#10;&#10;The Pegasus Expansion for Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game brings players the next chapter in the popular Syfy series. In addition to more Destination, Crisis, Super Crisis, Loyalty, and Skill Cards, this expansion introduces many new card types such as Treachery Skill Cards, representing the underhanded methods used to sabotage humanity's struggles. New characters in the expansion allow players to play as Cylon Leaders, who can win or lose based on their own mysterious motivations. New gameboards allow characters to explore both the Pegasus and New Caprica. Finally, with the New Caprica Objective Card and board, humanity will be subjected to Cylon rule, and must defend themselves from their oppressive overlords until Galactica can return to attempt a daring rescue.&#10;&#10;&quot;We fight 'em until we can't.&quot; - Kara Thrace&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Utilizing an open orders system and double blind activation, the rules require both a strategic vision and the ability to improvise. Combat resolution takes the form of large dice pools, offering the chaos of war as well as a simple mechanic to seamlessly blend gameplay with the abstraction of combat.&#10;Scenario-based force creation and historical organization charts eliminate the need for army lists and point values, which allows players to use what miniatures they own for missions of their creating. Seven historically accurate missions from the Battle for Gate 18 give players a place to start as well as a chance to see how history may have unfolded differently.

Pieces are units, leaders and supply. In a turn  Americans move and then have combat, then the British. Both sides then roll for reinforcements and events, the latter represented by supply. ZOCs inhibit enemy movement, must move into an enemy hex for combat. Combat is by differential CRT, modifiers come from leaders and supply. If all enemy units are not destroyed, victory is determined by control of cities on the map.&#10;&#10;",

A standard 8 by 8&#10;checkerboard and a deck of cards are needed. The two ships are set up on the board, with edge squares representing shallow water. US moves and fires, then the CSA. Movement points are determined by card draws referenced against a different table for each ship, as are shots. Damage is accumulated except for Special Damage results which can lead to a Critical Hit table. Ramming can be attempted by the Merrimack while the Monitor can safely enter shallow water. Game is a draw if neither&#10;is sunk after 18 turns.&#10;&#10;",
