Once you blow off all 4 limbs (head, left arm, right arm, legs) of the opposing robot, you win the game. A unique stacking mechanic makes building your robot visually appealing and functions as an important part of the gameplay. Attacks and defenses are determined by die rolls. Years of playtesting with multiple teams across the country (Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota) has developed the game into a highly competitive format that is appealing for hardcore gamers and still very fun for the casual gamer. Rule variations support new players and tournament rules for more hardcore players.&#10;&#10;",

Lucky for you, you&rsquo;re that crack simian space station crew, but the astronaut food isn&rsquo;t cutting it. There&rsquo;s only one thing to do &ndash; Fling Poo, in zero-gravity!&#10; Space Poo is a fast-paced game where players take on the role of monkeys on a space station in the middle of a poo fight. Your goal is to be the last monkey standing, who is also the cleanest one. Each turn, each player gets to draw and play a card, usually to either fling poo or clean himself off.  Out of turn, players have the opportunity to play cards to foil other players' poo flinging.  If you get covered in too much poo, you're out of the game and the last monkey standing wins.  But watch out! Things can go wrong on the station and they spell disaster if you don&rsquo;t deal with them.&#10;&#10;",

Hiring Nerds (engineers) creates better products, which attract more users, who in turn generate money. Hiring Suits (Sales) generates more money, which can be used to hire more nerds. At the end of every year the best products steals users from the other products during showdown. Employees initially are very eager to stay with a company, but over time are more likely to move to competing companies, unless they get further (monetary) incentives.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 2-4 products (depending on how many players there are) and four event cards. The game is played over several years. Every year each product gets one turn, i.e. every player gets to play 2-4 times per year. Players adopts users, based on the number of engineers and a die roll. Then they earn revenue, based on the number of users and the number of suits. Third, the player can use money to hire more employees. Soon, no more new hires are available, and players must steal (or &quot;poach&quot;) employees from other players. The other players try to spend their money to prevent &quot;poaching&quot; from happening. During the product show down at year's end users shift towards products that invested wisely. Outside the regular turn order, event cards can be played by any player at any time, both to further their own objectives as well as to hinder other players.&#10;&#10;To win, a players needs to obtain the largest number of users. Players need a good mix of nerds and suits, and make smart decisions throughout the game. The constant back and forth over limited resources (employees) is different from many other resource based games and adds a lot of fun. The winning strategy depends to a large extend on guessing/reacting to other player's strategy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inverted Dice is a challenging tactic dice game for smart adults and curious children. The game introduces a new way to look at dice rolls &ndash; a way to regard five normal six-sided dice as one big twenty-sided die (with some odd probability properties). Normally, you would throw some dice and use the sum of the numbers being shown. In this game, you use the sum of the numbers not being shown:&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;Such a sum is called an inverted dice sum. &#10; You need five dice to play. The structure of the game is a bit like the one in Yahtzee, with a similar score chart and three rolls (or fewer) per turn.&#10; There are twenty rounds in the game. In each round, players take turns rolling five dice, trying to reach one of the inverted sums 1 to 20 (it has to be a number that the player has not previously achieved or zeroed out).&#10; After each inverted dice roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn, making a maximum of three rolls each turn.&#10; If a player achieves an available result, it is registered in the score chart.&#10; If the player fails (after three rolls), a number must be recorded as zero points.&#10; Every player must put either a score or a zero into a score box each turn.&#10; The game ends when all score boxes are used. The player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players can receive maximum three bonuses by achieving all scores in one or more bonus sections.&#10;&#10;",

It combines the co-op strategy of tabletop games like Pandemic with the dynamic narratives of digital games like The Walking Dead, powered by Six to Start's own brand of app-driven audio storytelling.&#10;&#10;Players gather around a printed map of Abel Township, the home base of the Zombies, Run! universe. The map shows nearby towns, forests, farms, along with vital information about the location of zombies, supplies, and other settlements. Working together, the players embark on missions across the map, searching for supplies, rescuing survivors, and investigating the cause of the outbreak.&#10;&#10;But danger is never far away, with our unique real-time &quot;running&quot; card mechanic forcing players to use all their skill, nerve and co-ordination to survive. Will they reach their destination safely, or will they fall prey to the pursuing undead?&#10;&#10;During a mission, the players act as &ldquo;Runners&rdquo; sent out by Abel. Our companion iPhone/Android app uses audio and on-screen prompts to immerse the players in the game and story - informing them of threats, opportunities and events. Players can choose to investigate these, finding life-saving supplies, new storylines, or perhaps a hidden horde of zombies!&#10;&#10;Uniquely, players must react to situations in real-time, making tough decisions as the pursuing horde draws closer.&#10;&#10;The missions they choose and the decisions they make will constantly transform the game world and map. Settlements become overrun with the living dead and must be crossed out on the map, or marked with warnings. Hidden trails are found, opening new paths to explore and new secrets to uncover. Reports are heard on the radio of hordes moving in from the East - but how close, and how fast? The players track their story on the map itself, with annotations, stickers and counters turning the game board into an ever-evolving picture of the world.&#10;&#10;",

It is part of the early 1980s board game offerings put out by Target Games.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay&#10; The mapboard is actually a rather accurate map of Stockholm, divided into areas of different sizes that regulate movement. Dividing the center of the board is a streak of water, Stockholms str&ouml;m, which is impassable to human forces but not to the monster. Certain areas are also spawn points of police and military forces, that randomly enter the fight against the monster as reinforcements each turn. There are also civilian counters, i.e. monster food.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is, for the monster player, to destroy a certain well-known landmark in Stockholm, including the old Tax ministry headquarters, the &quot;degenerate&quot; statue group Paradiset, the Royal castle et al. Before the game starts, the monster players chooses from a set of monster statistics that include which landmark it is to destroy, and also determines the monster start area. The objective of the human player is simply to kill the monster.&#10;&#10;Rules chrome includes the then renowned skinhead gangs of Stockholm that in the game are portrayed as violent, unkillable, and anarchist -- they randomly change allegiance each turn -- as well as the ceremonial palace guard, H&ouml;gvakten, at Stockholm Castle.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Introduction from the rules&#10; The following is a translation of the Swedish introduction from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Monster that devoured Stockholm is an exciting adventure game where tactics and good foresight are of great importance.&#10;&#10;The game is played by two players.  One is the &quot;monster&quot;-player who tries to destroy a certain part of Stockholm.  The other player is the &quot;human&quot;-player and controls Stockholms' military and police forces.&#10;&#10;The monster will try to reach its destination without being killed by defending humans. On its way, the monster may eat innocent citizens to regain its strength.&#10;&#10;The human player must try to figure out where the monster is heading and concentrate his military forces there while trying to reduce the casualties from innocent bystanders to a minimum.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10; The box contains:&#10;1 Gaming board 39x52cm&#10;2 Dice&#10;1 set of 60 cardboard counters&#10;&#10;(The rules is the only part of the game with Swedish text).&#10;&#10;",

Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and through reverse-engineering examine various explosive contraptions manufactured by the necromancer's enemies. But the task to gain hands-on knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out and the only way to do that is to survive long enough to earn the gold coins needed to bribe their way out of their miserable situation.&#10;&#10;To win players need to keep their heads, perfect their timing, make every card count and, above all, make sure not to be the one holding the bomb when it explodes.&#10;&#10;Compared to the original game, Big Badaboom has five more bombs, five more mechanisms, and a new category of cards: the resurrection cards. These optional cards add even more slapstick humor to the game. The resurrection cards are placed in a separate pile, and whenever a goblin is caught in an explosion and resurrected, the player draws one card. On it the player will find an annoying, but hilarious, side effect that the goblin has gained for the next round as a result of the explosion. Finally, Big Badaboom comes in a stunning &quot;anarchist bomb&quot;-style case.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Badaboom&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your goal in Milestones is to score as many points as possible as a team, but throughout the game you'll each be working on a goal individually with very limited communication during play.&#10;&#10;To set up, divide the deck of cards into three piles according to their difficulty. Each player draws a goal card of their choice and keeps it hidden. Flip the three-minute sand timer to begin play. To start, one player rolls all six dice, which have the numbers 1-6 on the sides with a different color on each side. Players then take turns in clockwise order grabbing and re-rolling as many dice as they wish from what lies on the table. If at any time the die results allow you to complete your goal card in hand, place that card on your &quot;completed goals&quot; pile, then draw a new card from the pile of your choice. Sample goals are have three dice with the same number, have three dice of the same color in sequence, have no visible red or black dice, or have a pair of a certain color and a different pair of a certain number at the same time.&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, tally the points for completed goals. To make the game more challenging, you can shuffle all of the goal cards into a single deck or you can lay out 1-4 public special goals at the start of the game; if you fail to complete all of the special goals, then your final score is 0 no matter what else you do.&#10;&#10;",

The value on one side differs from that of the other side by a maximum of two.&#10;The goal of the game is to collect series of four coins with consecutive values (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or 9-10-11-12). Series of four are exchanged for victory point cards. There are 12 victory point cards with values from 18 to 7. The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:&#10;&#10;     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.&#10;     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.&#10;     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.&#10;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Your deals with fellow players will ultimately determine your success or failure.&#10;&#10;The resources you need to build your trading empire can only be acquired by the highest bid, so you must balance fast expansion with longterm planning. If you strike too soon, your control may be easy to challenge.

Meanwhile, each person's map can be invaded by any opponent controlling its Right of Passage card.

(which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).&#10;&#10;The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).&#10;&#10;Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.&#10;&#10;Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences&#10;- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.&#10;- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.&#10;- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.&#10;- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.&#10;- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;!

Its market has become one of the most popular on the coast, and merchants are fighting to be able to install their stalls. Competition is tough to make a fortune, especially since the customer is demanding. This requires having well-stocked stalls to attract the wealthy customers and increase its reputation. But be careful not to incur the wrath of the consul as this could cost you. However, you can always count on the gods and goddesses to give you a boost, with, of course, some offerings. And yes, everything is paid in this world ...&#10;&#10;In Massilia, each player will be able to use different colored dice to perform actions. There are four different colors corresponding to four different actions. On his turn, a player can choose a die and perform the corresponding action: Buy goods at the port, move a client or the consul on the market, make offerings to divinities to recover bonuses (cards), and buy reputation. The value of the die shows the number of times that the action may be made. The goal is to obtain the highest reputation at the end of the day by setting up stalls on the market to sell goods at the best price that the player will have bought in port.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the cult television series, the game comes with a coffin for component storage, glow-in-the-dark vampire teeth (bonus --not used in play), a spinner, some tiny wooden stakes and four sets of glow-in-the-dark skeleton parts.  You race to be the first to assemble your skeleton on its scaffold.&#10;&#10;Spin the spinner and hope to get the correct bone.  The ring is wild.  When you get a stake, you collect one; if you collect three, you return the stakes and a bone to the coffin.  In the advanced game, you have the option of challenging another vampire instead.  Both challengers spin in turn, and the first to get a ring wins; if the challenger wins, the loser loses a bone.  If the challenged wins, the challenger loses two bones.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Larry, a.k.a. Bl&ouml;ff, is a bluffing card game along the lines of Cheat and Bullshit in which players take turns laying cards into a central stack and making claims about what they played. As long as the next person in line doesn't call their bluff, they're off the hook!&#10;&#10;To start a round, each player receives a hand of 5-12 cards, depending on the number of players; cards range in value from -2 to 7, with a handful of special cards also being present. A limit card shows a 7, with players playing clockwise. On a player's turn, he lays one card face-down on the table, adds the number on that card to the sum announced by the previous player (if any), then announces the new sum; the player can play any card and state any sum, as long as it's not higher than seven. The next player has the option of playing a card (under the same circumstances) or calling the previous player's claim. If he does this, reveal all of the cards and sum them, with action cards counting as zero. If the claimed sum is correct, the doubter draws two cards from the deck and starts the next round; if not, the previous player draws two cards &mdash; even if he played honestly on his turn. As soon as you make a claim, you're responsible for what everyone played before you!&#10;&#10;Actions cards can be played face-up for their action, and they allow you to give one card from your hand to another player, force someone to draw two cards, force an opponent to play her next numbered card face-up, or change the direction of play while simultaneously flipping the limit card; when first flipped, the limit changes to 5 and players must now abide by that limit.&#10;&#10;The deck also contains three gloating &quot;Larry&quot; cards, and if one or three Larrys are in the central stack, then a player's claim of a sum is always correct!&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the next player can doubt the total or let it stand. the player who went out scores 2 points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of little Larry symbols on cards still in their hand. After three rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",
