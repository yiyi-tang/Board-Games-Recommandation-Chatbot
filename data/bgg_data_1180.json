Ignite your burn pits and torch cards for points, but watch out: your opponent will try to stop you by any means necessary!&#10;&#10;The goal in Hot Garbage is to be the first player to score 10 points - primarily by playing wood to your burn slots, lighting fires, and burning cards over a timed countdown until they can be scored. Card abilities also throw chaos into the mix, as players seek to improve their chances of scoring while also hampering their opponents through mischievous counter abilities.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, during the Fire Upkeep phase, you rotate any active fire cards you control 90 degrees clockwise, reducing their burn time by one. When a fire burns out successfully AND a card has been placed on that fire (following specific rules), that fire burns out and the burning card is discarded and scored.&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, you have 3 action points that can be spent to draw cards, or play cards. Every card can be played in one of four different ways:&#10;&#10;     To add wood to a burn slot or existing fire.&#10;     To ignite a fire in a burn slot containing wood.&#10;     To be added to a burning fire to begin burning it for points.&#10;     To trigger the card's ability.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you'll draw back up to five cards.&#10;&#10;The game heats up quickly, however, as opponents play counter abilities to try to stop you (and volleys of interrupts and counters fly back and forth in delightful chaos).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The elves can be placed anywhere on the map of the elf player's choosing, but the Big Plastic goons are placed by playing cards from that player's hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The scale is 1 nautical mile to 10cm. The rules incorporate weather, spotting and minefields.&#10;&#10;The rules have been enhanced with the introduction of Crew Quality and the use of Contact Markers to replicate the initial uncertainty of where the enemy forces might be.&#10;&#10;A simple gunnery system requires a roll to hit with each gun, and an innovative damage system takes account of the range and penetration by specifying the dice that are rolled for damage. Torpedo and Mine attacks are resolved using similar mechanisms, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system.&#10;&#10;In line with the intention of the rules to provide a simple system, armour has been standardised for each type of vessel and guns have been grouped by calibre into 9 classes. A detailed differentiation between the performance of ships and guns is not used. Not all guns can engage all vessels, and the largest guns have a minimum range.&#10;&#10;A ship data list is provided covering the significant vessels of 10 nations in this period with over 130 vessels. A simple conversion system allows you to quickly put together the ship data you need for ships that do not appear in the data tables.&#10;&#10;Pre-prepared ship data records are provided for the vessels that took part at the Battle of Tsushima.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Current Edition 2.0 (PDF and POD)&#10;     Recommended scale 1/1200 TO 1/6000&#10;     Complexity: 5/10&#10;     Level of detail: 4/10&#10;     Dice required: D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gnomes and Wizards is a fantasy-themed skirmish game where players assume the role of a unique tribe of either gnomes or wizards. The object of the game is for a player or team to have the most points at the end of 10 rounds. These points are mostly gained by defeating enemy units. Each tribe has multiple units that can be summoned onto the board to be used in combat. These units have unique abilities that can be charged and cast with the use of the resource called Power Crystals. As more units come out onto the field, players will roll additional dice to increase their base stats and other core actions. Half-way through the game, the ground becomes unstable and starts to collapse in on itself. At this point, players will start their turn by flipping two tiles from the outside of the board, forcing battle into the Crystal Mines in the center of the board. Gnomes and Wizards is a game that is easy to learn but is hard to master and can be played with a wide variety of skill levels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Game of Life Savers is an Australian board game promoting the Life Savers sweets first invented in the USA in 1912. In 1922 the sweet was introduced into Australia and by 1925 a takeover consortium of other Australian confectionery manufacturers created a new publicly listed company called Life Savers (Australasia).&#10;&#10;The game is a simple roll and move mechanism with a colorful 'under the sea' nautical theme that can be played in pairs. The board has 200 squares descending to the bottom of the sea. Players take a counter and move around the numbered squares on the throw of a dice. On certain squares dangerous fish appear and players must follow the instructions. Other squares have a flavored Life Saver sweet which can save a players partner from a dangerous fish or a player can move 9 spaces if there is no partner.&#10;&#10;First pair or single player to reach the treasure ship at square 200 is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is recorded in the National Archives of Australia, first registered in July 1930 with the author being a Colin McAlister trading as the McAlister Publicity Company.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Benediction is a combinatorial abstract strategy game for two players. The game is played on the points of a tri-gridded hexagonal board, with flippable checkers and stones. The objective of the game is to capture one enemy king, or bless one friendly king.&#10;&#10;Players begin with a king on their starting point in opposite corners of the hex grid. Players fill their zone, which includes all points adjacent to the starting point, with men. Men are defined as a checker or stack of checkers. By default, men start with a stack size of 1 checker. Men move in any direction in a straight line, distance up to size of the moving stack or sub-stack. Stacks jump occupied points, but may not move onto or jump over blocks. Captures happen by replacement (like in chess). Capturing does not depend on stack size (small stacks can capture large stacks, and vice versa). New men can be created by merging and splitting stacks (which are defined below). By default, men are limited to making stacks no higher than two checkers high. To create stacks taller than two checkers high, at least one of them must be blessed, by interacting with enemy walls.&#10;&#10;The main mechanisms of Benediction are blessings, curses and kings. Blessed men can merge once with any friendly man. Points on enemy walls, which have the power to bless men, are adjacent to the opposite end of the board via each line of the grid (like a portal). Movement across enemy walls results in teleportation of pieces across the board via forward and diagonal-forward movement. If a man moves past enemy walls, he is blessed. If you connect your wall to the enemy wall with a connected chain of friendly men, they all become blessed, except those that are cursed. Cursed men, which become cursed when stacks split apart, cannot be blessed and can only merge with blessed men. Finally, players have kings. Men that land on any starting point, or that merge with a king, automatically become kings. Because kings cannot merge with kings, and kings cannot get cursed, the number of kings can increase until a player is no longer able to defend them all.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns of two actions per turn (12* protocol). The five possible actions include: Move, Drop, Block, Merge, Split. These actions are defined as follows: &#10;&#10;     Move = Move man to an empty point (or capture). He can't move again this turn, but he can merge or split. If he moves past enemy walls, bless him.&#10;     Merge = Move man or sub-stack onto a reachable friendly man. If a man is moving through enemy walls in the process of merging, bless him. Before completing the merge, remove any blessings/curses on the pieces involved.&#10;     Split = Move sub-stack to empty point (or capture). Curse both resulting stacks. If the sub-stack moves past enemy walls, bless that sub-stack instead.&#10;     Drop = Drop a new man on an empty point in your zone. He can't move this turn, but he can merge.&#10;     Block = Put black stone on an empty point. Blocks cannot be placed on adjacent points or on opposite ends of the same grid-lines. Men can&rsquo;t jump / move onto blocks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you do, then All Things Zombie &ndash; Evolution is not for you.&#10;&#10;Think of all the great and not so great Zombie movies and television series. Remember how many Zombies the heroes killed? I&rsquo;m betting you don&rsquo;t, but I bet you remember how they interacted with other survivors and how they finally overcame the obstacles in their way. In short, you remember the Story.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s what All Things Zombie &ndash; Evolution is all about, the Story; your Story.&#10;&#10;All Things Zombie - Evolution sweeps you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Who you are when the outbreak occurs is just as important as where you are. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for a while, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the humans from the zombies until maybe it&rsquo;s too late. Because it&rsquo;s all happening to you just like it would on Day One.&#10;&#10;Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you&rsquo;ll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days?&#10;&#10;THEN WHAT?&#10;&#10;All Things Zombie - Evolution starts on the first day of the Outbreak, but then let&rsquo;s you continue your life, building your very own future. It&rsquo;s a game where every detail has been covered, as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you, then hunt them down and take back what&rsquo;s yours. On the way you&rsquo;ll find that your most dangerous enemies aren&rsquo;t the zombies, but are your neighbors and sometimes your old friends.&#10;&#10;Play All Things Zombie - Evolution solo, cooperatively against the game, or head to head against one another.&#10;&#10;Play it as a one off game or part of an ongoing campaign.&#10;&#10;Play it on the Tabletop or on the Battle Boards we've included.&#10;&#10;It doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you play it, as the goal of All Things Zombie - Evolution is to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.&#10;&#10;Inside you&rsquo;ll find:&#10;&#10;Color card stock counters and two full color 8&rdquo; x 10&rdquo; Battle Boards.&#10;&#10;Three classes &ndash; Survivor, Ganger, or Militia, each with different goals and opportunities.&#10;&#10;Attributes, Skills, and more, that are used to define your Characters and make them unique.&#10;&#10;A light-book keeping Campaign System to reward you when you do well and punish you when you don&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;A variety of Zombies, from the old school Shamblers to Smarties and Ragers.&#10;&#10;Pre- generated scenarios that can be played alone or played together to build your Story.&#10;&#10;A fully populated Post-Apocalyptic town for you to adventure in.&#10;&#10;All this and much more.&#10;&#10;And we didn&rsquo;t even mention the Werewolves, Aliens or Vampires.&#10;&#10;All Things Zombie&hellip; Still THE Zombie game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Warships from the national navies of Russia, Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, United States, Austria, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden are provided in facsimile counters rendered at 1/4200 scale.  &#10;Ship types include battleships, armored cruisers, protected cruisers, coast defense ships (approx. 320 ships), plus 24 generic destroyers and 30 generic torpedo boats, allowing you to play many historical and hypothetical scenarios.  &#10;&#10;     Each turn (broken into four phases) equals 10 minutes; &#10;     one movement point equals 3 knots; &#10;     one inch equals 500 yards when measuring range.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have Battleship Captain 3d ed. or Tsushima 1st ed., should you consider buying Tsushima, 1905 2nd ed.?  We think the answer is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;.  While continuing to employ the Battleship Captain system, several new optional rules have been provided, including some minor tweaks to game tables, that are more specifically addressed to pre-dreadnought naval combat. To give but one example, fire ratings at Long range are now halved and rounded down instead of rounded up, as in standard Battleship Captain.  Plus, all ship ratings have undergone a thorough review, with many ships having ratings modified up or down just a bit.  This can particularly be seen with ships having Harvey armor. While you can still use Tsushima, 1905 2nd ed. with the ship ratings provided in Battleship Captain Warship Counters, 1890-1945, these new counters and ratings will be welcome for those who appreciate a focus on pre-dreadnought era combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Volume 5 of the Battlegame series, this 52-page book simulates the career of the Beatles in the 1960s, using a Diplomacy-style game system. &quot;This is truly a unique game, both in subject and system, with fascinating cross purposes among players... pulling in separate directions while &quot;Brian&quot; works for the common good.... And yet they must all work together.  I heartily recommend it to devotees of Diplomacy, Kingmaker, and, of course, to Beatle-maniacs.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player rolls all four dice, sets aside any he wishes, then rerolls up to two more times, with the option of rerolling dice set aside after the first throw. After his third roll (or earlier, if he wishes), he can take any one foot tile for which he has matching symbols on the dice (with suns counting as a wild symbol) and add it to his centipede&#10;&#10;The game ends after all the feet tiles have been claimed, and the player with the longest centipede wins. The rules include a variant for older players in which you can steal shoes from an opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Jeszcze wi&#196;&#153;cej n&oacute;g!

First player (Clue Giver) shifts his 1st card right to see the side bar of the 2nd card. This secret key indicates 2 target words on the 1st card, that must be bridged with one-word association, and 1 optional target word. The Clue Giver says the one-word clue and how many words he has bridged (2 or 3), then shows his card. Other players try to be the first to solve the clue. The fastest player covers the card and says his version. If all 2/3 words are correct, the Clue Giver and the Clue Solver each discard one card. If not - the Clue Giver says how many words were guessed right (but not which ones) and other players attempt to guess them. The player who is the first to get rid of his cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Mode HAZARDOUS TRAPS&#10;&#10;Opposite to the previous rules, the secret key shows the 3 trap words, that should be avoided. The Clue Giver shows his words, says his one-word clue, trying to bridge as many words (except the traps) as he can. Then he announces the challenge level: 2,3 or 4 points. Players have their player pads and erasable markers, and simultaneously try to choose and mark words on their pads, that look associated with the clue &ndash; as many as the chosen challenge level (2/3/4). Then all the players show their pads, and Clue Giver shows his secret key. Players who avoided all the traps are Solvers, others &ndash; Non-solvers. Scoring: 1) The Clue Giver gets challenge points for every Solver. 2) Every Solver gets challenge points + 1 point for every Non-solver. 3) The first Solver gets 1 additional point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The BAND PHASE, TOUR PHASE, BATTLE PHASE, and MOP UP PHASE. During the BAND PHASE, you're dealt cards from the Band Deck. This deck comprises mostly of band members and gear. When all players have constructed their bands then starts the TOUR PHASE.  Cards from the Tour Deck are played until a venue card is played. Venue cards initiate the BATTLE ROUND. This is where each player receives cards from the Battle Deck and wagers their Fan Cards. All the players take turns playing cards to either increase your playlist points or decrease another player's points. After 3 cards are played by each player, points are tallied up and everybody moves on to the MOP UP PHASE. During this phase, all battle cards and band cards that were played during the battle round are cleaned up and the winner collects all the wagered Fan Cards. The BAND PHASE begins again and the cycle is repeated until either all Fan Cards belong to one player or the Tour Deck is depleted. Player with the most Fan Cards at the end of the game is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Players draw cards to their hand, discard those they don't want to use, play character cards and event cards to the front of their playmat, and support cards tucked under character cards. Players tap cards to trigger actions and many cards have special events related to the card. The first player to reach seven points, or to drive their opponent to exhaust their deck, wins.&#10;&#10;The game is themed around building memories of popular anime series. The game is designed to allow players to mix up characters and events from different series, and so build their own adventures. Players can build decks around themes in different TV shows, such as a swimsuit deck. As such, the game is lavishly illustrated with artwork from many series, with each anime artist created on the cards.&#10;&#10;The game has a starter pack with a pre-built deck (1 type / 60 cards), rule sheet, and playmat. The starter pack weighs about 0.40kg.&#10;&#10;As with other TCGs, there are many extra decks, booster packs, and special bonus cards, that players may trade.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Player, who buys one of them, may place the miniature in a dedicated place on the board to gain new, powerful benefits. The location it will be placed is crucial, so it's essential to plan it right!&#10;&#10;Qilin, as a symbol of prosperity, allows gathering additional wood, gold, stones, or Meditation from a chosen Location. Qilin is like an extraordinary Clerk - it doesn't need any empty slot, and when it is removed from the board, you may place a regular Clerk in its place for free.&#10;     &#10;     Yinglong, a mighty winged dragon, will inspire your soldiers. You place Yinglong on a chosen Wall Section - it allows you to gather your forces in this place instantly. Additionally, Soldiers under Yinglong presence fight with great zeal, counting as two when gaining Honor for defeated Hordes!&#10;     &#10;     Spirit Turtle, a sacred shelled beast, blesses your army with resilience, lowering your losses on one of the Wall Sections. How? Your Soldiers won't die here!&#10;     &#10;    Finally, Fenghuang, a blessed bird, is a symbol of virtue. Exchange all your Overseers for Fenghuang and place it on a chosen Location. It acts as triple Overseer of the maximum level in this Location. Additionally, your former Overseers go back to your pool, so you can recruit them again in the Barracks!&#10;&#10;&#10;Other 8 Advisors are similar to Advisors from the core game, but in the case of the essential mechanics, the more the better - more choice and more replayability (but the base game offers tons of options).&#10;&#10;Here are a few examples:&#10;&#10;Allow your Cavalry to move freely between Walls!&#10;     &#10;    Gain more precious Honor if you are a leader!&#10;     &#10;    Take 1 Artifact and make it your own!&#10;     &#10;    Ignore the Honor penalty when you activate Location on your own!&#10;&#10;&#10;8 new Tactic cards&#10;&#10;2 new types of Tactic card (4 copies of each) will change your strategy.&#10;&#10;Here's your new options during battles:&#10;&#10;Hold the Line! - it rewards cooperation: all players that defend the Wall Section gain additional Honor. But, of course, you will gain the best benefit ;)&#10;&#10;Wipeout - raise the stakes! If you win, your Soldiers may attack again this turn! If not, they will die.&#10;&ldquo;Ancient Chronicle&rdquo; Game Modes&#10;&#10;6 new &ldquo;Ancient Chronicle&rdquo; Game Modes bringing further challenges for your game. Plan on how to gain an advantage against other clans using new rules introduced during each Year of the game.&#10;&#10;More themes and background stories, more exciting new special rules, buildings, setup changes and so on.&#10;10 Relics&#10;&#10;Players gain a new option of scoring - they may use new type of cards: Relics. Relics are similar to Artifacts, but:&#10;&#10;You can upgrade them, so they will grant better benefits for all (but you also give a signal to your opponents that you're interested in this Relic),&#10;     &#10;    You gain the rewards according to the place won on this Relic - the first place will gain the best bonus, the second a little worse, and so on.&#10;     &#10;    Some of the Relics may activated in each Year, not only at the end of the game&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pirates! miniature battles on the high seas&#10;&#10;the rules allow you to recreate quick and exciting (and sometimes hilarious) naval battles using 25mm scale ships and miniature figures.  Besides these rules, we also manufacturer a large range of 25mm resin cast ships, both historical and fantastic, to go with our game.  There is nothing to keep you from using ships by other manufacturers, or even scratch building your own!&#10;&#10;Many of our ship designs are based on Elizabethan era ships, prominent during the time of Sir Francis Drake and the Treasure Ships of Spain.  This allows us to utilize both sailed and oared vessels.  Our ancient ship designs are the result of painstaking research.  These 25mm ships are (very) roughly 10:1 scale to their historical counterparts as far as crew sizes, firepower and tonnages are concerned.&#10;&#10;For those of you who appreciate fantasy wargaming, an entire section of this book has been packed with rules for fantasy races, magic, scrolls, sea monsters, etc.  We also make a range of fantasy submersibles, airships and Jules Verne-esque ironclads.  And, as if that weren't enough, we included construct rules so that you could build your own!&#10;&#10;What's new in this version of Pirates!?  Most of the changes involve streamlining game play.  We got rid of rules that were seldom (if ever) used.  The crit charts have been reworked, and the old ramming rules have been completely scraped in favor of a newer, easier to use system.  The same can be said for the boarding and morale rules.  Some minor changes have been made to the weapon and crew stats.&#10;&#10;The biggest change, however, is our inclusion of the Pirates! Ancients rules!  That's right, now you can have battles between ancient galleys!  We are working hard on releasing a range of ancient galleys, and the first model, the liburnium, should be available very soon.  We are really excited about this part, and hope you will be too!&#10;&#10;What's Included?&#10;&#10;The Pirates! 3rd Edition rules include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Fourteen historical ship designs.&#10;     Seven fantasy ship designs.&#10;     Seventeen types of ordnance.&#10;     Rules for designing/using fortifications.&#10;     Rules for creating your own creatures and constructs.&#10;     Eleven historical races.&#10;     Twelve fantasy races.&#10;     Dozens of spells and magic items.&#10;     The rules for PIRATES! ANCIENTS!&#10;&#10;&#10;Pirates! 3rd Edition has the historical accuracy to recreate epic historical events such as the Armada Campaign or the Battle of Lepanto, while having the flexibility to let you wargame in your favorite fantasy universe.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;The basic game play of Pirates! hasn't changed since first edition.  Before each turn, every captain writes orders for his ship(s).  This is done on our handy-dandy orders sheet, and is very quick easy to do. Orders are written for speed and general direction of movement, for changing sail settings, raising or lowering anchor, and moving crew and ordnance.  If you are playing a fantasy game, then you write orders for which spell your navigator will cast, if any.  You do not write orders for ordnance or small arms fire, since that is all done as the opportunity presents itself.&#10;&#10;After all orders are written, the wind is checked for, to see if it changes direction or speed, or if something more... dramatic happens!  Movement takes place immediately afterwards, with the fastest ship going first, followed by the second fastest, etc.&#10;&#10;Ordnance fire is the next phase, and every captain places a splash marker for each ordnance fired to indicate his desired target.  Ranges are guessed, shots adjusted and all results worked out simultaneously.  The same is then done for small arms.&#10;&#10;Crew are then allowed to move about, and boarding actions and other melee takes place.  The turn ends with the repairs phase, where crew may attempt to repair damage to their ships, put out fires, etc.&#10;&#10;One of the things that has made Pirates! such a huge success throughout its various editions is the fact that play is simultaneous, so all players are getting to do something all the time!  This makes it ideal for game clubs, conventions or friends who want to play a game as a group.  An interesting &quot;side effect&quot; if this is that you can easily play a game where it's every man for himself!  We have run games with up to 30 players at once, and everyone gets to have a good time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Remaining Attack Cards are placed in a draw pile. The attacking pirate chooses a defending pirate and plays an Attack Card. The defender can play a higher matching suit Attack Card, play a no-suit defense card, or accept the attack. If the attack is defended, the attacking player or any other player can launch up to 6 attacks total against the defending player, or with as many cards as the defender has, whichever is fewer.&#10;&#10;Upon a successful attack by any player, the battle ends. The lead attacking pirate may look at two Legend Cards and select one, while the other attacking pirates may only draw one Legend Card. Alternatively, attacking players may choose to draw up to two Attack Cards (as able) or destroy a revealed Legend Card instead. There are different kinds of Legend Cards, and a player may only ever hold one of each type of Legend Card. If ever a player draws a Legend Card matching what they own, that player secretly discards this card to the Legend deck.&#10;&#10;After the battle, all Attack Cards played against the defender will enter the defender's hand regardless of the outcome.  The defender's cards will enter the bottom of the Attack Card deck face-down. The defending pirate will be the attacker in the next attack.&#10;&#10;Between attacks, players may choose to reveal Legend Cards, which, in addition to furthering the win condition, will give them a significant upgrade to their actions and firepower. However, showing a Legend Card opens the possibility that another player will choose to destroy their Legend Card versus collecting one of their own. Knowing when to show a Legend Card and when to rely on your hand is paramount to winning a game of Gunpowder &amp; Gold.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They can also play action cards that thwart another player's progress. Carefully time the placement of matches and be vigilant about watching the progress of opponents.&#10;&#10;Action cards represent film noir inspired twists. An &quot;Interrogation&quot; card allows a player to steal, an &quot;Amnesia&quot; card allows a player to block an opponents progress, a &ldquo;Flashback&quot; card allows a player to remove Amnesia cards or reveal matching cards hidden from view. A &quot;Brainwash&quot; card wipes out a player's decks causing them to begin from scratch but can be reversed with a &quot;Turn the Tables&quot; card.&#10;&#10;Game play varies from 15 to 30 minutes. Rules can be learned quickly and there are 100s of possible storylines, each using colorful characters, crimes and locales inspired by detective/gangster films and candy!&#10;&#10;",

Responders will have access to a set of four documented Procedures and will begin to take actions to try and investigate and resolve the incident. For every action, the Responder team rolls a d20 with any available advantages or disadvantages to see if they are successful. Successful actions will lead to revealing additional cards in the scenario.&#10;&#10;If all of the scenario cards are revealed or if the Responders take 10 rolls without revealing a new card, the game is over. When the game is complete, the team can discuss their successes and failures and apply what they have learned to their real-life incident response program.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hidden War is a card game that takes place in a new dark fantasy world, with 4 to 8 players belonging to three different alliances. According to the number of players there are different goals, but basically everyone has to take its alliance to victory by surviving. Each player chooses a Hero card to determine a unique ability and receives a secret Faction card to determine goals and alliances, if there is any (yellow factions play on their own, without being allies).&#10;&#10;Factions can be red, green or yellow. A player's Faction is kept secret, except for the green and red leaders. In the draw deck there is a hidden Hero &ndash; Aamon the witch &ndash; who can resuscitate dead players, who will abandon their Factions and will fight by her side, until the last breath of alive-characters!&#10;&#10;There are four different types of cards in the draw deck:&#10;&#10;     Action cards (red). Use them for attacking, defending yourself and having a tasty, fresh beer to restore health. &#10;     Equipment cards (yellow). Weapons, armies, bodyguards and so on: deploy them in front of your character, but&hellip; watch out! Your enemies can steal or destroy them.&#10;     Special cards (green). Using their special effects you can change the fate of the play, but never forget that your ally can turn into your worst enemy.&#10;     Event cards (blue). It can only be used one at a time and it targets all other players at the table.&#10;&#10;&#10;As chance is always by our side, you will find a Coin of Fate in the box: use it to hit or restore health.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Individuals no longer struggle with self-worth, self-image and self-concept and thereby are no longer competitive nature. Individuals no longer struggle to comprehend the abundant, endless nature of the universe and its resources, and thereby no longer feel the need to fight or go to war over resources or an inward sense of lacking.&#10;&#10;In this world devoid of competition with each other, there is still a desire to achieve great works for the sheer joy of it. Individuals practice absolute focus, mastery of every part of their body, precision, emotional clarity, strength of compassion, intuitive guidance, and tests of logic. After mastering these subjects in their first forty to eighty years of life, individuals move on to more advanced lessons: telepathy, levitation, full grokking of other beings, enmeshment with animals and plants, energetic biological influence, and direct manifestation (without the waiting period).&#10;&#10;The acolytes in the game represent six areas of study that are of great interest in this era: three areas from the study of earth and three areas from ether. You can read more about the setting in the manual which is available as a free PDF download.&#10;&#10;[Gameplay]&#10;&#10;Each turn you collect resources from your lands and acolytes, tracking them on your abacus. Then you spend as many resources as you wish to acquire more lands, acolytes, and technologies. Collect lilies to win. (With the Adventuring Acolytes expansion you have an ulterior motive &ndash; a hidden win condition unique to you.)&#10;&#10;The game uses a mechanic called &quot;splaying&quot; where cards overlap one another to create different effects depending on which direction the cards are &quot;splayed.&quot; Acolytes reside within Arcania (buildings) where they study and work. Acolytes who are apprentices are splayed to the right, revealing a single resource of their specialty. Technologies allow acolytes to further their advancement, changing which way they splay, and thereby how many resources they provide.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They each have a lesson to teach, whether it's how to spit really far or what kind of grass tastes the best. It's a lot to keep track of, but you're like an elephant: you remember everything. And you're afraid of mice. You've taken up riding. Horses are intimidating; they say you can lead a horse to water, but you haven't managed it, so you're working your way up, starting with dogs. So far so good; the dog hasn't bucked you off yet. Your menagerie got off to a poor start, with just a goat, two rats, and the advisor who suggested starting a menagerie. You couldn't get that fox you wanted, but it was probably bad anyway. Now you've got some camels, which are just as useless for sewing as you'd been warned, and a turtle that can hold its breath for longer than anyone can stay interested. Soon the animal kingdom will be yours.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Menagerie, the 13th expansion to Dominion, has 400 cards, with thirty new Kingdom cards. There are Horses that save a draw for later, Exile mats that cards can be sent to and rescued from, and Ways that give Actions another option. Events return. You need the basic cards and rulebook in order to play Dominion: Menagerie, which can be combined with any other expansion in the game series.&#10;&#10;",
