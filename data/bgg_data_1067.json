    "Description": "Players take on the role of mammoth herds by moving around barren tundra and transforming the board from invading brambles and trees to beautiful flora and grasslands. Mammoth is a tile laying game that appeals to ages 8 and up. Players place tiles to grow their specific color of flowers and to increase the size of their path as their mammoth moves through the plains. The game has both competitive and co-operative versions of play.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players place their mammoth to begin a field of colorful flowers. At some point during the game they can also place their other prehistoric mammals to claim a path. Then as they take their turns players place an octagon tile or square tile to increase their color grouping or path.  They can score maximum points placing a tile directly next to their mammoth and growing more color groupings instead of just their own.  The last round starts when the last octagon tile is played. The winner is the player who gained the most points by successfully transforming the barren tundra.&#10;&#10;In the co-op version of the game the players work together to accomplish a random color and path goal.  The players play as scientists planning how they are going to guide their mammoths through the park.  Players discuss what actions they want to take and then reveal the available actions for the turn.  Players then choose their actions without discussion and then complete them in turn order.  If the players succeed in accomplishing their goals and reach a required point total before the last octagon tile is placed, the scientists are successful and have transformed the bleak tundra into a beautiful plain.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pegboard Baseball is a two-player themed game based on chance and probability. It is a game of luck and skill. Background knowledge of batter statistics is advantageous. &#10;The game is handmade by the designer and consists of a 6 inch round piece of wood depicting a baseball diamond with cribbage peg holes around the baselines. Players are represented by team-colored cribbage pegs.&#10;&#10;Pegboard Baseball can only be played when watching a baseball game on TV or at the stadium. The main reason you need to be watching a game is because fouls count for one peg movement. The best way to tally foul balls is by watching (or listening to) a game.&#10;&#10;The score of the actual baseball game you are watching is not related to the score in Pegboard Baseball.&#10; The movement of your peg depends entirely on what the batter does at the plate. Any contact between the bat and the ball is awarded by movement of your peg.&#10;&#10;How to start:&#10;&#10;Choose two pegs that represents your team and the opposing team. Place the two pegs on home plate.&#10;&#10;The visiting team will start on the top of home plate (top of the innings) and continue around the bases on that line. The home team will start on the bottom on home plate (bottom of the innings).&#10; What it looks like&#10;when you are playing:&#10;&#10;The person representing the batting team holds the pegboard.&#10; Choose a goal for your game.  &#10;Possibilities include:&#10;&#10;--Follow an entire game and the player with the most points, plus furthest distance, wins.&#10;--Play for an equal number of innings and see whose peg traveled furthest (points plus distance). For example, prior to starting announce, &ldquo;We are going to play for three innings.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Peg movement depend on&#10;what each batter does at the plate.&#10;&#10;Foul Ball = 1 peg movement&#10;When the batter hits the ball foul, out of play, that equals 1 peg movement.&#10;&#10;Inplay Out = 2 peg movements&#10;When a batter hits the ball in fair territory, but the batter is out. This includes pop flies and ground outs.&#10;&#10;Single = 3 peg movements&#10;When a batter hits the ball and is safe at 1st base.&#10;&#10;Double = 4 peg movements&#10;When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 2nd base. Also, ground rule doubles.&#10;&#10;Triple = 5 peg movements&#10;When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 3rd base.&#10;&#10;Home run = 6&#10;Two run homer = 12&#10;Three run homer = 18&#10;Grand Slam = 24&#10; Bunt foul = 2&#10;Bunt infield but out = 4&#10;Bunt single = 6&#10;&#10;Optional Scoring&#10;&#10;Optional scoring prior to play:&#10;&#10;For more peg movement: see directions&#10;For less peg movements: see directions&#10;&#10;Optional scoring during play:&#10;&#10;Prior to any at-bat (or inning), a player can wager for more or less peg movements based on a hopeful outcome. Experienced fans may know when good players are coming up to bat and decide to risk their peg's movement.&#10;Players are encouraged to be creative in their wagers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Army Guys is a game for people who want to play strategy games, but don't want to sift through a novel to learn the rules or pay thousands of dollars to put together an army.  Army Guys is meant to be played with minimal accessories - you can play on the floor or on a table; you can use literally anything to make up the battlefield; and you only need a tape measure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the introduction&#10;&#10;The game is designed primarily for two opponents but does support more players; the game is intended to be quickly learned and rapidly played.  The rules assume (but do not demand) the game will be played with &quot;little green men&quot; plastic figures, and uses a suitable scale for movement.  Forces are purchased with a point-buy system.  Initial placement uses a &quot;hold and drop&quot; method (preferred) to randomize units in a close area.  Play proceeds in alternating turns.  During each turn a player may select five units and execute two actions with each unit.  The game supports only two actions - move and attack.  Attacking units have an &quot;accuracy&quot; value which must beat the defender's &quot;hitability&quot; value - in which case, hits are automatic.  Damage is randomly rolled.  Several types of special movement and terrain are supported.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Minotaurs&rsquo; enormous strength, minimal intelligence and vicious, depraved mentality would appear to make them almost perfect Blood Bowl players. Fortunately for most other players however, few coaches allow Minotaurs in their team. This is mainly because of their disconcerting habit of going berserk before, during and after the match and attacking anyone or anything that gets in their way: friends, foes &ndash; even the coach!&#10;&#10;This multi-part resin kit contains the components you need in order to assemble a Blood Bowl Minotaur. You can field him as a Big Guy for your Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, Chaos Chosen or Chaos Renegades team &ndash; he definitely lives up to this, looking both pretty big and pretty chaotic. Densely packed with powerful muscle, the Minotaur is stomping forth with fury, challenging any opposing player to get in the way of his bunched fists and enormous horns. He&rsquo;s not particularly heavily armoured, but the bits of armour he has strapped on are menacing and spiky, with a delightful skull on the right shoulder; this probably used to belong to someone who didn&rsquo;t get out of the way quickly enough.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'NOTE: An alternate version of the Blood Bowl Minotaur was a limited release in June 2019:'&#10;&#10;All minotaurs are slab-muscled and vicious as a rule. On top of all that, some of them carry mutations that make them even more intimidating and lethal, like this cruelly clawed brute. He&rsquo;s also been fitted with a suitably brutal-looking helmet to protect what&rsquo;s left of his grey matter. Minotaurs make ideal Blood Bowl players, but few coaches allow them in their team. This is mainly because of their disconcerting habit of going berserk before, during and after the match and attacking anyone or anything that gets in their way &ndash; friends, foes or even the coach!&#10;&#10;You can field this Minotaur as a Big Guy for your Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, Chaos Chosen or Chaos Renegades team &ndash; his enormous mutated claws and sturdy head gear blend well with the look of brutal and corrupted teams. Densely packed with powerful muscle, the Minotaur charges forward to challenge anyone who gets in his way. Well armoured, his kit is fittingly menacing and spiky, with a form-fitting helmet and bulbous eye protectors, as well as a delightful skull on the right shoulder &ndash; this probably used to belong to someone who didn&rsquo;t get out of the way quickly enough.&#10;&#10;This kit comes as 6 resin components and is supplied with a 32mm round Blood Bowl base, featuring a slot to place a ball in. Rules for the Minotaur can be found in Death Zone Season Two and the Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the game of Enigma Maze, you try to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of 15x15 square grid, while blocking the opponent's pawn by placing polyominoes.

The gameplay is language free, although published in Japanese.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you do the followings:&#10;1) Choose an unused polyomino and place it on the grid.

Each card contains two or three words.&#10;&#10;Players have 60 seconds to recall a song which contains as many words on the table or in their hand as possible.&#10;&#10;Then players take turns singing a song they have recalled for 15 seconds. For each card in which a word is sung this way, that player scores one point.&#10;&#10;This game stimulates the memory center, so it is effective in brain training and antidementia. It also gives whomever wants to sing a reason to sing!&#10;&#10;The game is published in Japanese but the designer has put a sample of English cards online.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;5&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;5&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#173;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#168;&#152;&#230;&#134;&#182;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#230;&#158;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#186;&#230;&#191;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#132;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#170;&#141;&#231;&#159;&#165;&#231;&#151;&#135;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#231;&#173;&#150;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#173;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quantified is a co-operative board game set in a world in which everyone's behavior is constantly surveilled and analyzed. A player's behavior results in a social credit score, determining their position on the social ladder. Players start from different positions on the social ladder, as refugee, unemployed or employed, with unequal access to human rights. The goal of the game is to make all rights accessible to all players and to fight the implementation of totalitarian policies.&#10;&#10;During a typical turn, players can move around the city, add non-player-characters to their network, attempt to solve so-called rally cards (initiatives that support human equality), attempt to prevent so-called threat cards (automatic, constantly approaching negative effects, such as invasive amendments, correction camps or totalitarian laws), or even simply work an official or illegal job. The trick is that not every action can be taken by every player. For example, those without the right to movement take longer to cross the city, while those without the right to free speech can't share their rally cards with others &mdash; and even the actions you can take must be taken with care as all actions leak personal data. If too much data is leaked, the players may have to face behavior analysis cards that negatively impact their collective game state!&#10;&#10;Ultimately, by solving enough rally cards or working their way up the social ladder, every player should have access to all four human rights. Once this is done, the players win! But if three totalitarian laws come into effect before then or the threat deck runs out, the players collectively lose.&#10;&#10;",

The board game includes a game board having markings of a conventional soccer pitch.

The players may pass, shoot, or to throw the ball in to emulate the play of a conventional soccer match.&#10;&#10;Players each control a soccer team that consists of discs representing soccer players. A small disc representing the soccer ball is flicked into the opposing player's goal to score points.&#10;&#10;The main mechanic used in ISBG requires players to flick a soccer ball token around the field by pressing the edges of the discs that represent soccer players down on it, thus causing it to move.&#10;&#10;The rules of regular soccer a followed when it comes to offsides, corner kicks, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to allow for several modes of play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Argute is an exciting trick-taking card game. If you like to play cribbage, euchre, hearts, Uno, etc., then this is the new game for you! Many people who have played have commented on how this game works equally well for 2, 3, and 4 or more players. Perfect for inter-generational social events.&#10;&#10;The game is intriguingly simple to grasp but allows for unlimited playing experiences.&#10;&#10;GOAL The winner is the first to score 6 points or more without being tied with another player. Win points by correctly bidding on the number of tricks you will take.&#10;&#10;The ARGUTE card deck is divided into play cards and bid cards. None of the cards have suits. The 42 play cards include 7 cards each of the following denominations: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The 28 bid cards include 7 sets of cards each of 0, 1, 2, 3.&#10;&#10;SET-UP To start each player is given a set of 4 bid cards consisting of a 0, 1, 2 &amp; 3, and will hold onto these cards for the duration. The scorekeeper is chosen and the first dealer will be the oldest person playing the game.&#10;&#10;BID PHASE The dealer shuffles the play cards and deals 6 cards face down to each player. Each player looks at their &ldquo;play&rdquo; cards and determines how many tricks they will be able to win from zero to three. They then pick the appropriate bid card and place it&#10;FACE DOWN in front of them. Each player only knows their own bid. Once everyone has bid, play begins and no one is allowed to look at any bid cards until the completion of the hand.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY Each 6 card hand is divided into 3 tricks. The first trick consists of 3 cards from every player&rsquo;s hand. The second trick consists of 2 cards from every player&rsquo;s hand. The last trick is 1 card from each player.  Each player only plays one card per turn. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left leads the first trick. The winner of each trick is the player with the highest total of the cards (ie. Count) played for each separate trick and will lead off the next trick. If two or more players counts are tied, the player who reached the count first wins the trick. (For example, if 4 people are playing and they all play a zero for the last trick (1 card), the player who played the first zero wins the trick.)&#10;At the end of the hand after the three tricks have been won players reveal their bid cards to the table. If a player has correctly bid the number of tricks, she scores that many points. If a player has incorrectly bid the number of tricks he would take, either higher or lower, that player loses one point regardless of his bid. If a player bids zero and gets zero tricks, she neither loses nor gains any points, her score stays the same for that hand.&#10;The deal moves to the left. If two or more players are tied with six or more points at the end of a hand, all players play another hand until only one player leads with six or more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Disease reduces the attack and physical ability of those wishing to confront them.&#10;&#10;The sewers are also filled with traps that can quickly neutralize intruders (or food). Event cards will make the place more dangerous, by making swarms of little rats show up or by making your heroes fall in deadly traps. There's still a positive side to all of this, though. With all the waste that is thrown in the sewers, some good surprises may sometimes be found.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

And at that point, it's pointless to try to hide&hellip; the fresh odour of fresh meat will attract them, wherever you may be.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the gloomy crypts, many morbid events may arise. Be careful where you set your feet, spectral hands may get you and hinder your movement. If there's a Necromancer around, his maleficent spells can create several fatal situations.

The players are battling each other using decks of cards with animals. One player has daytime animals, the other has nocturnal animals (some animals are both). Each player has seven stars. The first to take the seventh star off their opponent is the winner (you can vary this to make the game shorter).&#10;&#10;The game is deliberately designed to be easy for new gamers to play a trading-card style game (like Magic: the Gathering) by learning deck-building. The theme, artwork and gameplay make this an easy introduction into deck building and combative style TCGs. But there is no actual trading involved. The game includes all the cards you need.&#10;&#10;Each player's deck has various animals, from large and strong to small and weak. Each animal needs food and players collect enough food to be able to send the animal of their choice into combat on the player mat. Animals have values for strength and heart, the animal with stronger or equal values defeats the other. But food is consumed as they attack, and if the player exhausts their food supply, they lose.&#10;-user summary&#10;&#10;The publisher says &quot;Easy to play! Easy to start!&quot;. They say the game is for children and adults who would not normally try a TCG-style game like this. The simple illustrations and easy rules make it a good introduction. The game has 80 cards, 2 play sheets and 1 instruction sheet in Japanese. There is some Japanese text on the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Royal Mines is a brand new expansion that will enrich the OrcQuest universe with new enemies. With the Campaign Chapter included, your heroes will be able to infiltrate the dwarf mines, at the borders of the Kingdom of Istarra, and get precious artifacts. But be careful, the expedition will not be easy, and our heroes risk losing some blood there.&#10;&#10;The dwarves are a hard-working, meticulous and greedy people. They never stop digging galleries to exploit as many deposits as possible, to trade what they extract from them or to create the best crafts in the world. It is in one of these mines, northeast of the border of the kingdom, called the Royal Mine of Skatten, that legends tell a powerful weapon is hidden.&#10;&#10;The mines are heavily guarded. Patrols circulate regularly, because dwarves can never be careful enough. The alert level can rise very quickly, and the mission can fail at the slightest mistake. The mines are real labyrinths where it is easy to get lost. The access is forbidden to slowpokes and it will be important to be like the dwarves: methodical and effective.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Secret poachers have hired these ignoble beings to track down and kill any orc infiltrating the Kingdom of Istarra. So you can add porks as additional enemies in any chapter of the Main Campaign. You will also have the choice of playing them as heroes, allying with the orcs, and you risk seeing them kill each other at the slightest misunderstanding.&#10;&#10;As enemies of orcs, the Porks have a mission to hunt down and kill any green skin they encounter. The Pork Trackers will have their own Patrols instead of the normal Patrols. Except that here, the Porks &quot;feel&quot; the presence of orcs, thanks to their highly developed sense of smell. They will go directly to the heroes to try and exterminate them.&#10;&#10;In addition, Pork Trackers are not the only ones who resent greenskins. Three Pork bounty hunters prowl the area and may arrive at any time to do carnage, even if it means slaughtering everyone between them and their target.&#10;&#10;The Porks can also be used as heroes alongside the orcs and as a band of adventurers who have sworn to help the greenskins in their quest, provided they leave them the found treasures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Just a few days after release, they are already being used in many areas, from industrial production to show business.&#10;&#10;However, you &mdash; the scientists of the monster factory &mdash; have a terrible secret: You wish to use the monsters you have created to help you conquer the world! You are just biding your time while the public becomes used to them, then you will call them back and spread panic! You should train your monsters in the arena to learn special tricks to use in the final battle. Sounds easy? It might be, but you must watch out for your colleagues who have the same evil plan as you. You will have to fight them first if you want to win and rule the world!&#10;&#10;Monstrite is divided into two game phases. During the first phase, players amass monstrite tokens and by using the machine cards they create monster tokens. During this phase, players earn victory points (VPs) by selling monsters based on the contract cards.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, they call the monsters back and fight each other in order to become the undisputed leader. During this phase, player earn VPs by battling with their monsters and winning battle cards. Battles are solved by using a special bidding system and by the utilization of trick cards. At the end of the game, the player with the most VPs wins!&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Sono forti, agili, intelligenti e instancabili. I mostri sono una grande scoperta tecnologica e il miglior prodotto sul mercato. &Egrave; passato poco tempo dal loro lancio in commercio, ma sono gi&agrave; utilizzati in molti settori; dalla produzione in fabbrica al mondo dello spettacolo. Ma non &egrave; tutto oro quel che luccica. Tutti voi creatori di mostri nascondete un terribile piano; volete usare i mostri per conquistare il mondo. Sar&agrave; sufficiente aspettare che la gente si sia abituata alla loro presenza per iniziare a seminare il panico. Nel frattempo potrebbe essere utile allenare segretamente i mostri facendoli combattere nell&rsquo;arena, cos&igrave; che possano apprendere nuove tecniche di combattimento per la battaglia finale. Sembra facile? Potrebbe esserlo. Ma meglio ricordare che anche altri scienziati hanno lo stesso obiettivo. Solo chi vincer&agrave; la battaglia finale avr&agrave; il mondo in pugno. &#10;Gestisci la fabbrica, diffondi i mostri ovunque nel mondo e, una volta che sar&agrave; iniziata la guerra, sconfiggi i tuoi avversari in una battaglia &ldquo;all&rsquo;ultimo mostro&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;Monstrite si divide in due fasi di gioco. &#10;Durante la prima fase i giocatori devono accumulano i gettoni Monstrite e utilizzarli per costruire mostri sempre pi&ugrave; evoluti, grazie all&rsquo;ausilio delle carte Macchina. Inoltre, in questa fase si ottengono punti vittoria vendendo i Mostri, in accordo alle carte Contratto, a settori diversi, come quello industriale, quello dello spettacolo o l&rsquo;arena. &#10;Durante la seconda fase i giocatori richiamano i mostri sinora creati e li utilizzano per scontrarsi allo scopo ottenere il dominio incontrastato. In questa fase si ottengono punti vincendo le carte Battalgia contro gli altri giocatori, grazie a un meccanismo di aste e all&rsquo;ausilio di carte Trucchetto. &#10;Alla fine del gioco, vincer&agrave; il giocatore che avr&agrave; conquistato il maggior numero di punti vittoria.&#10;&#10;",

Character development is key, and a wide range of troop options and factions allows a high degree of individuality and personalisation. Players will also be able to recruit mercenaries and agents such as Hashashin and Varangian survivors to bolster their forces - potent but expensive additions that will add a distinct flavour to each encounter.&#10;&#10;",

(Requirement varies.)&#10;&bull; Bounties award/ represent treasure, the currency used to determine the winner.  (Reward amount varies.)&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&bull; Players start by separating the cards into five draw stacks by type (adventures, shinies, catchies, missions, and bounties).&#10;&bull; Each player draws 5 catchies to form their hand.&#10;&bull; Each player draws 1 mission to complete.&#10;That's it, you're ready to play!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Get the shinies is broken down into a series of rounds known as &quot;adventures&quot;.&#10;&#10;&bull; Before each round players replenish their hand of catchies, as necessary (up to the maximum of five).&#10;&bull; At the beginning of each round an adventure card is placed into the center of the play area to guide players through the setup and gameplay of each round.&#10;&bull; Players then take alternating turns matching their catchies with shinies to capture them as directed by the adventure card until the round is over.&#10;&bull; At the end of each round players check to see if they've captured enough shinies to complete their mission.  If enough shinies have been captured the player: exchanges the required number of shinies for a bounty card, discards the completed mission along with the required shinies, and draws a new mission.&#10;&#10;This process is repeated until 10 missions have been completed collectively, ending the game.&#10;&#10;When the game ends players discard any remaining missions, shinies, or catchies they have then reveal their bounty cards and add up their values.  The player with the highest treasure value wins the game!&#10;&#10;You'll need to manage your hand of catchies wisely while consistently making the right plays to hinder your opponent and advance yourself to ensure victory in this unpredictable contest because it's not a game of chance!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Extra attack and defense cards can be added to a nerd in battle, where their IQ value is the amount of extra cards they can add.  A nerd's attack and defense values can also be boosted by adding a confidence token.  Defeat 4 nerds and you win!&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game with 2 nerd cards, 4 battle cards, and 4 random confidence tokens.  At the start of a turn, draw 1 nerd card, or 2 battle cards. Then choose to pit your nerd against an opponents' to start a battle, or simply play an action card.  If you start a nerd battle, choose the player you want to attack, and put your nerd into play.  Add battle cards to your nerd to increase their attack defense, keeping the number of cards at or under their IQ value.  At this time, a confidence token can also be added to the nerd.  If the token matches the nerd, they get a permanent +2 to attack and defense.  If it's unmatching, it's only a +1 to those values, and is discarded at the end of the battle.&#10;&#10;Then, the opponent needs to put a nerd into play to defend the attack.  If they can successfully block the attack by getting enough defense to equal or be greater than the attack, they not only don't lose, but they may be able to add enough attack cards to counter attack and defeat the attacking nerd.  They are still limited by the nerds IQ, but can also add a confidence token.  Either way, the losing nerd hides in the winners basement (an area under the play area) and gets turned sideways.  After the battle, all battle cards are discarded, but any nerds that didn't lose stay in play, face up.  Discard down to 7 battle cards, and it's the next player's turn. First player to get 4 nerds in their basement wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hero Team Quest is a co-op game designed for young children.  Very few board games that kids are exposed to emphasize cooperation and team success.  With Hero Team Quest, all the players compete together and the outcome of victory or defeat is shared by all players.  The goal is to defeat the wizard before time runs out (when the goblin gives the crystal of magic to him).  The goblin moves 2 spaces on the board every round, closer to the end.  Players must get to the end and defeat the wizard before he gets there.&#10;&#10;Players first form a hero team of four characters and each may obtain a magic power at the magic school - each power is a weakness of one of the four bosses in the game.  As they move across the board, they look to avoid losing a turn by stepping in mud.  Players stop on the battle spaces to roll the dice to defeat the various bosses.  Certain powers will make the chance of success better for some characters.  If you should lose, you go to the cage where you must roll a 1 on your turn to pick the lock.  Otherwise, other players may come to your rescue if they should defeat the boss OR they can decide to continue on the path if time is of the essence.&#10;&#10;The game does offer some choices and teamwork/communication, but is ultimately a simple game designed for young kids that is easy to follow.  From a complexity standpoint, it's a step up from games such as Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry, etc. - but in a genre that most kids enjoy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
