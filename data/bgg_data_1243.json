    "Description": "Forog (which means to turn in Hungarian) is an abstract game for 2 players.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a rubberwood board foldable in 2 and 19 wooden marbles, coloured in 6 different colours (3 marbles of each colour) + a natural wooden marble, and a wooden pot.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to be the first player to place three of his balls in the opposing camp.&#10;&#10;To begin with, each player chooses 3 colours of marbles and places them in 3 different holes on the board (which has 6 + a central hole).&#10;&#10;In turn, each player takes all the marbles from one of the holes and deposits them one by one in the following holes.&#10;&#10;As soon as a hole in his own camp contains 5 balls, he can select one of his balls and put it in the central hole.   The other balls will be distributed normally.  This is only possible if the natural wood marble is not in this hole.   It is not mandatory.&#10;&#10;Concerning this natural wood marble, the 1st player who puts a marble in the centre has the possibility to put the colourless marble in the hole he has just emptied.   This marble then travels like the other balls during the game.   The natural wooden ball is therefore a double-edged sword: it allows to block the opponent and forces him to redistribute his balls, but keeping it in his camp implies sacrificing one of his holes.   Knowing when to keep the natural ball or when to send it to the opponent's side is therefore a determining factor in winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

Here's how easy it is:&#10;&#10;After the decks are shuffled and cards are dealt, The Fabulist begins by introducing the characters in the context of a grand quest upon which the characters will embark. The Fabulist has sixty seconds to weave the beginning of the tale, then play rotates clockwise. The next player selects a plot twist (PT) out of their hand and places it on the included playmat in the next open PT space. That player continues the story for 30 seconds, working in the words or phrases on the newly played card into the story. When the time runs out, draw a new plot twist card. Play continues clockwise. The lucky person who places the final plot twist card has sixty seconds to wrap up the story as best they can.&#10;&#10;Now that the fable has ended, everyone gets to suggest a &quot;Moral of the Story&quot;. The player with the funniest moral wins the quest card. If your group is competitive, the person with the most quest cards at the end of the session wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players will then play these procedure cards to triage patients to their advantage and commit medical malpractice in the name of the almighty dollar. At the end of each round, players will bill the patients currently admitted in their wards and claim any PR bonuses.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around a line management mechanic: Players will always admit the first patient in line in the waiting room, so carefully playing procedure cards to put valuable patients to the front of the line on your turn is key! Each player will also organize patients in their wards in five different rooms. Each room increases in the amount that you can charge a patient, so try to put more valuable patients to the right. However, if they go too far and must be shifted right, the patient will die. This lowers your Public Relations score, which lowers your chance at a bonus for the end of the round.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It covers the Shadow Wars of the Heresy: actions by the Knights-Errant, Shattered Legions, and Blackshields.&#10;&#10;The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution continues the unfolding saga of the Horus Heresy. As the fires of total war consume entire worlds and whole Legions clash, away from the front lines the Knights-Errant are abroad too, penetrating the warp storms that afflict the entire galaxy as they carry out a mission bestowed upon them by the very highest authority on distant Terra. The Shattered Legions pursue bloody vengeance against the hated Traitors, who in turn seek to hunt the Loyalist survivors down no matter where they might seek refuge. Blackshields &mdash; orphaned or outcast Legiones Astartes who have renounced their Legions and obscured their heraldry - harbour their own objectives, alone in the darkness, sometimes aligned with the Traitor cause, sometimes the Loyalist, but just as often for their own unknowable ends.&#10;&#10;This book explores the unseen Shadow Wars that raged across the entire galaxy as betrayed Legiones Astartes mounted bitter campaigns against their former brothers, determined that if death was to be their fate, their betrayers would share it. This tale is told across five chapters, describing five very different Shadow Wars of the Age of Darkness. Also included are a detailed campaign system and a set of special Shadow Wars missions, enabling players to undertake their own series of linked battles fought between the types of forces explored throughout the book.&#10;&#10;The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution is a lavishly printed, leather bound book. Its 297 pages contain a myriad of new rules, including those for combining Space Marines of several different Legions into a Shattered Legion force, and new Legiones Astartes rules for the Dark Angels, Blood Angels and White Scars Legions.&#10;&#10;Rules are also included for the heroic and elite Knights-Errant, the renegade Blackshields, and numerous new Rites of War for each Legion. In addition to this, unit entries are included for new consul types, heroes and war machines of the Legiones Astartes, including the Legion Mastodon Heavy Assault Transport and Dreadnoughts of the Leviathan pattern and Contemptor-Cortus class. The Mechanicum also gain new characters and units including Anacharis Scoria and the Arlatax class Battle-automata.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The main mode of Nemesis: Aftermath is the Epilogue Mode, a short (45-60 min.) 5-turn game, which is played after a regular game. At the start of this Epilogue, an unspecified amount of time has passed since the events that occurred in the Nemesis base game. The players use Characters (which haven't took part in base game) who enter the Nemesis to investigate. The ship bears many scars of its past tribulations, so any leftovers from your previous game will have effects on your Epilogue game.&#10;An Epilogue game is much shorter than a regular Nemesis game, but it is more difficult and offers a very dynamic playthrough. Instead of Objectives, players have to deal with seemingly simple Personal Requirements, while trying to cooperate in order to cope with various Alerts. In addition, players pursuing more selfish interests might accept the Lucrative Offer. The players also use the additional Shuttle board, which represents a new small ship (docked to the Nemesis) consisting of additional 4 Room slots. The Nemesis: Aftermath expansion also adds 4 new Rooms &quot;2&quot;.&#10;You can play the Epilogue game with less players than the number that actually participated in the regular game.&#10;&#10;TRAITS&#10;Nemesis: Aftermath adds a Trait card for each Character (both from the base game and the expansion). Trait cards gives specific advantages and disadvantages during the game. The Trait card is placed face up next to the Character board, and its rule is in effect for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;NEW CHARACTERS&#10;Nemesis: Aftermath adds 5 new Characters to the game. When the players choose their Character, the Character draft card they select allows them to pick either the base game or the Aftermath character of a chosen color. For example, the red Aftermath Character (the Convict) can replace the red base game Character (the Soldier). After choosing their Character, each player keeps their selected draft card, preventing any other player to choose the other Character of the same color. The two red Characters (the Convict and the Soldier) can never be in the same game together. The Aftermath Characters are very different from the base game Characters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A 17 page pdf includes:&#10;&#10;- Rules for creating an army.&#10;- Six scenarios that can be played alone or as campaigns.&#10;- Print-and-Play deck of Special Event Cards. &#10;- A complete magic system.&#10;&#10;Army Composition&#10;Armies are composed of 12 units total - a variety of infantry, skirmishers, missile troops, cavalry, generals and monsters. The game is model agnostic - so the number of models in these units is entirely up the players.&#10;&#10;Scenario Forces&#10;There are six scenarios included in Shieldwall. Once players decide on which scenario to choose, they randomly generate a force from their army dependent on the rules of the scenario. S&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;Units roll a number of dice dependent on their type, and results of 5 or 6 indicates a HIT has been scored on the enemy unit. Once a unit accumulates three or more HITs at the end of a turn, they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Special Event Cards&#10;The friction of battle is represented in Shieldwall with a deck of Special Event Cards that can be printed from the pdf. During a game, players will draw hands of cards and then play them to modify attacks, execute special maneuvers and cast powerful spells&#10;&#10;Magic System&#10;The magic system in Shieldwall is directly tied to the Special Event Cards. Players can wield the powers of Order, Chaos, Life and Death to scatter their enemies from the battlefield. Shieldwall assumes every army has wizards steeped in arcane knowledge or clerics beseeching the Gods for miracles, so you are never penalized for not bringing a wizard. However, if you choose to, you can make your General an Arcane Master which unlocks additional spell effects if you play cards associated the proper school of magic that the general has pre-chosen.&#10;&#10;So raise your shield, lower your spear, and join the ranks of the SHIELDWALL!&#10;&#10;",

The game is designed to grant an easy access for new players, while it is hard to master it`s full tactical opportunities.&#10;&#10;Story:&#10;&#10;At a time when kobolds and goblins were still resident in Goldstett, a deep vein of gold was found within the local mines. Both parties heard about the good news at the same time. The kobolds were happy, as it was enough gold to bury it at the end of the rainbow.  On the other hand the goblins would rather invest the gold to attend the &quot;All-You-Can-Drink&quot; event in their local pub... However, the fact that both parties had their eyes on the gold vein poses a problem for the opponents: the gold was not enough for everyone, and even though the kobolds and the goblins were equally good at digging and making tools, they were awful fighters. So both decided on their own to intimidate the rivaling party with elaborately crafted weapons and to chase them out of the caves...&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each turn consist of 3 parts. &#10;-The active player rolls the dice (2x 10d-dices)&#10; Those indicate which tunnel plates yield resources.&#10; Each player occupying the corresponding plates draws resource cards.&#10;-The active player may then move his 3 worker on any tile that is attached to his tunnel system&#10;-and perform one action.&#10; Each worker may either:&#10; 1) dig to exchange the tunnel plate he/she is standing on&#10; 2) attach on unoccupied plate to the tunnel system of the  &#10;    player&#10; 3)or frighten away a rival worker&#10; To frighten away a rival worker the player needs to equip &#10;enough resource cards to reach a suitable frightening level,&#10;while the rival players may use their resource cards, to reduce the effect of the players invasion.&#10;&#10;The team that either occupies the goldmine in the center&#10;long enough to get 9 gold pieces or banishes on rival player from his/her cave wins the match.&#10;&#10;Each player may support his/her teammate with resource cards at any given time.&#10;&#10;If there are less than 4 players, players may also utilize the workers and cave from their &quot;missing&quot; teammate.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Two players select one-one tile, and if both tiles have that color that the players have, throw away the color tokens and put the tiles under the board. These tiles will be the next part of the rain dance. Do the known part of the rain dance (tiles shows some moment instructions). If none of the players have any color tokens, the players win together after they do the whole rain dance.&#10;&#10;",

If your opponent has gained 251 points or more, you score 1 victory point; if they have gained 250 points or fewer, you score 2 victory points. First to 5 (or 10) victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The path is not for the timid, if enlightenment were easy, everyone would attain it. It is ever changing, and there are perils to keep even the wisest from succeeding. Choose your actions carefully!&#10;&#10;Ni-j&#197;&#171;-san is a set-making and tile-laying card game where the play path is continually changing! The game is played in two phases. In the first phase players lay cards from their hand on the table to form a path. In phase two the players use the cards from their hand to move their tokens along this path. The player who reaches the end of the path and plays 23 (ni-ju-san in Japanese) wins!&#10;&#10;There are numbered cards and special cards. The numbered cards are used to form the path on the table, but they are also the primary means to move tokens along the path. Players discard sets of numbered cards that match the numbered path card in front of their token in order to move forward. Special cards may be played to do many things. These cards can move players forward and backward along the path, reshuffle player hands, and most importantly: change the path. Cards on the path can be swapped out, and the path can be extended or reduced in size. It can also be split to form multiple ends.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 2042. Due to The Unfathomable Events of 2037, madness reigns across the cruise industry. The four remaining cruise lines now pursue market share through warfare. As a result, cruises are more popular than ever, because everyone is nuts (also due to The Unfathomable Events of 2037).&#10;&#10;The &quot;cruise&quot; part: as the Admiral (formerly CEO) of a cruise line, you must send out your fleet of ships to navigate the treacherous waters of the Caribbean, dock at various tourist traps, and return to your home port. The &quot;bruise&quot; part: rival cruise lines are out to destroy your fleet via missiles, torpedoes, and maniacal passengers that live to raid other ships. The Admiral who finds the best balance between cruising and bruising will win.&#10;&#10;Bruise Cruise is a hexagonal map-based, turn-taking strategy game with relatively simple rules that lead to complex outcomes.&#10;&#10;2-4 players control a fleet of up to six ships using a hand of multi-use cards. 82 Action cards allow each player to sail, dock at ports, or acquire weapons or life preservers (the currency of 2042; they literally preserve your life). 18 &ldquo;Unfathomable&rdquo; cards allow players to do truly Unfathomable things, such as warping their ships to the Shady Offshore Bank or Warlord Island.&#10;&#10;(Each Action card also features flavor text that teaches you strange and amusing facts about the ports and countries you&rsquo;ll visit during game play.)&#10;&#10;Victory points are scored for docking ships at ports, firing weapons at your competitors, and returning ships to their home port after they have completed their cruises. The game ends when the cards run out, though there are a few endgame rules that make the end particularly intriguing and encourage taking big risks.&#10;&#10;A 2-player game between experienced players will take about 30 to 40 minutes. A 3- or 4-player game will take between 50 and 80 minutes.  Recommended for players aged 14 and up, though 11-13 year-olds with board game familiarity will do just fine.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1905: Days of Decision is the third game in The Scandinavian Wars Trilogy* from Pantero Games.  The game is a strategic level analysis of potential war that could have happened when the union between Norway and Sweden was dissolved in 1905. Units are battalions and regiments, with a few squadrons of cavalry and dragoons thrown in. The game will use the same basic set of rules as the other games* in the series  and also has a few separate rules to account for the time period and way of war in the early 1900's. The map depicts the border area in southern Norway and Sweden, from Trondheim to Gothenburg. The game also includes a set of naval rules and units, to account for the fact that both navies were mobilised and had been modernised heavily before 1905.&#10;&#10;As the Swedish player your goal is to keep Norway in the unions by capturing Christiania, take control of the border fortresses and force the Norwegian parliament to resign or accept a continued and renewed union. As the Norwegian player, your goal is hold the Swedes back long enough, and cause enough casualties to make King Oscar II order the Swedish forces to stand down and enter negotiations.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of an adventurer, exiled from their homeland, they journey to the new world beyond the sea. Working together players travel the world clearing out locations, from treacherous swamps to abandoned cities. In the process they will enhance their character with new abilities learnt by defeated foes and training with NPC's. They will also build a new home, that serves as a hub for characters to return to in-between scenarios, this home can also be developed and allows the characters to advance their attributes.&#10;&#10;This is an open-ended adventure game, designed to be played over many sessions. Before each scenario, similar to a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book, players will choose where and how the story continues. They then build and prepare their characters for that journey. Scenarios are cooperative, where players will fight against automated foes that use a unique card system to determine their actions and skills. These Scenarios are played on large maps with many enemies.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own deck, and building and optimizing this deck is part of the game. You start each of your turns by drawing up a number of cards to your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Cards can be skills, actions, abilities or generated resources. Used cards are placed in a face up discard pile, and when you need to draw a card and your decks empty, you shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. As players progress through the world, they will acquire new cards to add to their hand and each player's deck and strategy's will develop as the game unfolds. After finishing a scenario, players return to their home to upgrade, swap cards, reconfigure their party and choose their next destination on the world map.&#10;&#10;In Beyond the Sea, players create their own goals through the choose your own adventure story elements. Characters can also be taken into other players worlds where they will be able to share information about specific skill, NPC and trainer locations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

She is not part of the Viking Team Heroes, but rather a stand-alone Hero Class in her own right. A Mythic warrior in the service of Odin, the Valkyrie is one of the strongest fighters around. As the Valkyries, by definition, are female, the Valkyrie Hero Class does not have a &lsquo;Male&rsquo; version on the back of the Hero Character Sheet. Instead, there are two different versions of the Valkyrie herself, each with different Starting Gear and stats.&#10;&#10;The Valkyrie Shield Maiden is a defender of light sent by Odin to protect the world of mankind against the spread of Darkness. Heavily armored with a helm, shield, and Spear, the Shield Maiden can challenge foes, shrugging off damage with her Valhallan Armor and turning aside blows to protect herself or others with her Mythic Shield, while skewering them with her warrior&rsquo;s spear.&#10;&#10;The Valkyrie Avenger instead embodies the sum of Odin&rsquo;s wrath! Equipped with a helm and spear, she has forgone any heavy armor for speed and agility. Cutting through enemies with each stroke of her Avenging Blade, a mythic sword that can actually slice Enemies in half, potentially killing them outright!&#10;&#10;Includes Valkyrie Character Sheet, Game Cards, Upgrade Skill Tree, Rules Sheet, 1 Female Valkyrie Shield Maiden Miniature, and 1 Female Valkyrie Avenger Miniature, with 30mm bases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the crew of Ponce De Leon that explored the wilds to discover the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternals succeeded in their quest for immortality, but at a grim cost. By drinking the Fountain's water, they were granted eternal life, but live out their days in a constant state of withering away, gaunt and pale. Only by cutting down Enemies with his tainted Ghost Blade, and stealing the life essence from his foes, can the Cursed Eternal hold his deterioration at bay.&#10;&#10;A full new Hero Class for the Spanish Conquistador theme, the Cursed Eternal Kickstarter Exclusive Promo Hero is not part of the Conquistador Team Heroes, but rather a stand-alone Hero Class in his own right. This means that he has his own unique Abilities, Starting Upgrades, and Skill Tree, but he does not benefit from all the synergy that being part of the Conquistador Team Heroes brings. For instance, the Cursed Eternal is still considered a Conquistador for Team Ability cards, but he does not generate any of these cards for the Hero Party, he must rely on the cards that the other Conquistadors bring to the group. Having drank from the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternal is blessed and cursed with immortality. Taking Hits every turn (more so as the Darkness grows stronger on the Depth Track) from the withering effects of the curse, he must fight to stave off the deterioration, consuming the souls of his foes with his magical Ghost Blade to heal. Even if KO&rsquo;d by Wounds, he can automatically Recover at the start of the next turn, rolling for Injury and Healing as normal, and Recovering a Grit, as he stands back up from even the most grievous of injuries! Carrying with him a small amount of the Fountain Water in a bottle, he can drink from it once per Adventure to Fully Heal and remove all Injuries, Mutations, and Status Effects that have built up on him. Of course, Madness is another story.&#10;&#10;Includes Cursed Eternal Character Sheet, Game Cards, Upgrade Skill Tree, Rules Sheet, 1 Female Cursed Eternal Miniature, and 1 Male Cursed Eternal Miniature, with 30mm bases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

Typically you need to move through the entire dungeon to finally face one of the Order of No Quarter, but not these wandering vagabonds! They'll attack you mid dungeon, depending on whether or not they are spawned from the Spawn Card Deck. Once they are spawned onto the board, you start drawing their cards like you would during a normal boss fight, once after every boss...the difference is that you'll also have to contend with the stage and enemies themselves as well! They will also be usable as end-of-the-dungeon Bosses.&#10;&#10;-description from Kickstarter page&#10;&#10;",

They&rsquo;ve raised their teams and are now ready to unleash their horrors on a pitch near you!&#10;&#10;Necromancers often hire Werewolves to liven up their teams, calling upon ancient pacts and promising them plenty of fresh meat &ndash; as long as the wizards get to keep the bones. Meanwhile, Flesh Golems have long been, ahem, a &lsquo;staple&rsquo; of Necromantic teams, adding their custom-built combination of strength and unnatural resilience to the team&rsquo;s line of scrimmage. That&rsquo;s not all &ndash; Necromancers have begun to call not just upon the bodies of the dead, but the spirits of the damned too! We&rsquo;re not sure about the skills of the new Wraiths, but they definitely look like they&rsquo;ll have some sneaky tricks up their sleeves.&#10;&#10;Necromancers are notoriously anti-social, so you&rsquo;ll just have to wait a little longer to learn more about the Wolfenburg Crypt-Stealers. But rest assured, this won&rsquo;t be the last you&rsquo;ll hear of these Necromantic Horror teams! Keep a watchful vigil for these creatures that go bump in the night, lest they catch you unawares.&#10;&#10;- description from publisher&#10;&#10;Necromantic Horror teams are compatible with the 2016 Edition of Blood Bowl using the &quot;Teams of Legend&quot; optional rules published by Games-Workshop.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Fourth Interstellar War (ISW4) is a scenario supplement for Third Edition Starfire, based upon the novels &quot;In Death Ground&quot; and &quot;The Shiva Option&quot; written by David Weber and Steve White. &#10;The Fourth Interstellar War started when a Terran Federation Navy survey flotilla conducting the routine survey of a new star system in 2360 and stumbled upon a home system of the Arachnid Omnivoracity, which immediately launched a genocidal attack upon all of the known races of the Grand Alliance. &#10;And worse, the Omnivoracity had the fleet and resources to succeed. &#10;The war lasted 10 years and could only end with the destruction of the Grand Alliance or the Omnivoracity; nothing less was permissible. &#10;This supplement includes new rules for gunboats and new technologies for HT6 through HT13.&#10;&#10;The Fourth Interstellar War requires the 3rd Edition Tactical Rulebook to play out the scenarios that are included as part of the story line.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
