Because the alien experts don't know what humans were actually like, they can infer results that might be based on complete nonsense. Because YOU are the expert, however, no one can say &quot;You're wrong!&quot;&#10;&#10;The scoring in the game inspires collaborative storytelling. After a debate, all players vote on someone who told the most convincing backstory for the object or reference. That player scores two points, but then must award a bonus point to another player who best helped them come to that conclusion!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mur is an abstract strategy board game for two players, which was invented by Canadian, Desmond R Davies, in Atlantic Canada in 2021. The concept behind Mur's game design draws inspiration from the book of Genesis. The Mur board is a round grid with 25 intersections and the playing pieces are small checkers engraved with ancient galleys making the game set reminiscent of the ancient city of Atlantis as described by Plato in his Critias dialogue.&#10;&#10;There are a total of 15 game pieces: 14 ships and one kraken. Seven ships are black and belong to the first player, seven ships are white and belong to the second player, and one piece&mdash;the kraken&mdash;is red and is a neutral piece. During a turn a player may either place, move or (if forced) withdraw a ship. Since there is no capturing and therefore no permanent elimination of material or territory, the game of Mur functions as a perpetually shifting puzzle. A ship forced into or found in a surrounded solitary position, which is called a trap, must be removed from the board by the owner, not the opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to surround the kraken OR acquire three ship traps. Visit murfederation.com to learn more!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Calling all Knights is a 2-5 player trick-taking card game for the whole family.&#10;&#10;Players act as potential rulers of the kingdom trying to rid the land of pesky monsters. They do this by hiring Knights to fight on their behalf and claim bounties. There are 54 different unique looking knight characters making up the knight deck. For each monster on the field, players send one of their knights out to battle. The best knight slays the beast and gets points for the player.&#10;&#10;Monsters are slain by the knight with the highest number. If the knight matches the color of the monster, they trump the other knights of a different color. Monster point values are based on how impressed the villagers are. For example, dragons are worth the most at 4 points each. However, if you slay the bunny, that's negative 4. They just don't realize that the bunny is the most dangerous of them all.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 5 rounds. The game starts with each player having 2 knights per hand, but that amount increases by 2 each round with the final round having 10 cards in each players' hands. Each round players bid on how many monsters they will take. If they guess correctly, they get extra points. Bonus points increase each round as it gets more difficult to predict. At the end of the last round, whoever scored the highest wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This 2021 printing includes the Aberrations &amp; Undead expansion.&#10;&#10;",

In September 1946 the National Air Races were back, now under the leadership of the Cleveland Air Foundation. The Thompson Trophy races, however, were changed from those of the pre-war era. Gone were the racers built by private aircraft corporations or made by designer pilot craftsmen. In their places were war surplus fighter planes stripped of their armaments and modified for even more horsepower. The modified Corsairs, Air Cobras, Mustangs and Lightnings were flown almost exclusively by a younger generation of pilots groomed by wartime training and experience. With no limits and few rules, the post war Thompson Trophy races portended for those who sat in a brand new purpose-built grandstand even greater thrilling aerial spectacles than those witnessed seven years before.&#10;&#10;Each copy of September&rsquo;s Corsairs is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    17x pilot cards&#10;&bull;    14x plane cards&#10;&bull;    14x die cut aircraft units&#10;&bull;    1x die cut 1946-1949 &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; unit&#10;&bull;    6x course balloon markers&#10;&bull;    One 8 page rules and scenario booklet&#10;&#10;Please note that September' Eagles is required to play September's Corsairs.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#228;&#191;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#176;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#232;&#178;&#168; (The Faith Of Currencies) is a game from Japan, where players are currency traders trying to maximise their wealth. But the value of the currency depends on how much faith each trader has in the religions. Players are trying to promote the worship of one deity, whilst also preparing to switch allegiances if the deity falls from favour.&#10;&#10;The game has a market board to show the relative exchange rates, and a track board to show how the faith is fluctuating, using small cubes for each religion (the rulebook is called Prayer's Guide).&#10;&#10;There is a deck of cards which is used to calculate the player's score at the end of the game. At the start of the game, two cards are dealt up to move two prices. Then the deck is shuffled and players are dealt three cards. Four more cards are dealt up to form a draft.&#10;&#10;The game has a huge stack of crisp bank notes, beautifully illustrated in the style of real banknotes, to represent each religion. The Esoteric Order Of Dagon is the US dollar, and the Euro (Zeus), Yen (Amariti) and Yuan (Communism) are also used, along with a Flying Spaghetti Monster coin (banknote). The backs of the notes are blanked, so players cannot know what anybody is holding. Players are dealt two notes of each of the five types at the start.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds, one more than the number of players. In a round, a player may trade currencies with the bank, or change their faith, or adjust the market prices.&#10;&#10;When a player trades currencies, they sell what they want from their supply and buy from the bank at the current rates. The number of banknotes exchanged then alters the faith in each currency.&#10;&#10;For example, a player might sell 2 Communism at 12 each, and buy 3 Amariti at 8 each. This moves the Communism cube along the faith track two places, and the Amariti cube moves three places. The Communism cube is now on a +1 space, so the price rises to 13. The Amariti cube is now on a +/-2 space, so the player can move the price up or down two places, for example up to 10.&#10;&#10;Moving these cubes triggers the round ending. When a faith cube has lapped and reached its starting point, the day's trading ends and a new round starts.&#10;&#10;A player can change their faith by discarding and drawing cards from the open supply or the top of the deck. Each religious card shows an effect on the value, dependent on the number of cards held (1,2 or 3). The value of the religion is based upon different factors, such as how much the price is, or how much total currency is held, or for the FSM, how many sets of notes you can form.&#10;&#10;The final action a player can take is simply to move a faith cube, and adjust the market price accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players continue to take turns carrying out these actions, until the round ends, and after the final round ends, players calculate their scores. A player's score depends on how many of which faith card they hold, and the relative prices, and how many banknotes they hold. Once calculated, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;By the open trading of banknotes and open adjusting of prices, other player's might deduce what hidden faith cards a player holds. But a player could be bluffing and trying to manipulate the market whilst holding different faiths in their hand. As the market develops, a player will want to switch their faith to maximise their final score.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Against the backdrop of this civil war between coalitions led by the Hosokawa and Yamana clan, the game also features peasant revolts led by the Jizamurai and religious unrest involving the Ikk&#197;&#141;-ikki, the militant wing of the emerging J&#197;&#141;do Shinsh&#197;&#171; (or True Pure Land) Buddhist sect.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But his goal of ascension wasn&rsquo;t what people thought it would be. His hostility against the commoners of the land has eerily ceased. New, terrible horrors have arrived in the land of Krasvetelia, seeking to tear it asunder. Did he summon them? Or was he preparing for this eventuality all along? Noctis may be the only one strong enough to stand against these horrors. But did he gather enough power, or will he succumb to these titanic forces from another plane of existence? Only your heroes can help shape Krasvetelia&rsquo;s destiny.&#10;&#10;The Horrors have arrived.&#10;Tragedy. Calamity. Disaster. Cataclysm. Forge an entirely new journey in the darkening land of Krasvetelia and gather power as quickly as you can to stop the four terrible horrors that have appeared in the world. You&rsquo;ll face each, in a different order each time you play. Your only ally is Noctis himself, but can you keep your sanity, or will you succumb to madness?&#10;&#10;What does this Expansion add?&#10;&#10;3 new epic Roles and 11 powerful Races to add to your collection (perfect for solo and small group play!)&#10;&#10;4 variable level Horrors - face them in a different order and experience contrasting effects each time you play&#10;&#10;Madness - Your heroes will accumulate Madness, but can you keep your sanity long enough?&#10;&#10;Epic Power Ups, Encounters, Investigations, Events, Treasures, and more for each of your Core box card decks&#10;&#10;Mythic Legendary Items and Allies&#10;&#10;New Keepsakes to keep your heroes going after death&#10;&#10;A new punchboard for your map that interacts uniquely with the four Horrors&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The best runners have been called. It is now the time to make your coach a rich man and to catapult him to golem&rsquo;s glory.&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;The game is played by a referee and multiple racers.  Players create individual golems, primarily by random roll.  Play then proceeds in turns, each turn spans four distinct phases.  During Phase 1, players determine initiative (who will go first that turn.  During Phase 2, players move their pieces in initiative order.  During Phase 3, players check for mechanical problems.  During Phase 4, the referee adjusts the board as needed.  The game ends when the first player - the winner - crosses the finish line.&#10;&#10;The game is provided as a PDF rules document with suggestions on common items that can be used as game components.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What kind of game is it?&#10;&#10;The game is played by moving the pieces on the board in the manner of Shogi or Chess. 7 different secret orders are dealt face down, and the player who moves his pieces the fastest to fulfill his secret order wins the game. The secret orders can be as simple as occupying three red squares (which can be occupied by moving pieces and entering red squares), or as complex as having the hero piece, which is one's alter ego, defeated first among all players (usually, the player loses when the hero piece is defeated).&#10;&#10;Therefore, for example, if you forcibly aim at a red square that is not necessary, other players may find out about your secret order and interfere with it, and if you unnaturally leave the pieces that protect the heroic pieces empty, they will also find out and it will be difficult to achieve your secret order. The key to the game is how to approach the secret mission secretly and inconspicuously.&#10;&#10;The board may be unfavorable, but...&#10;&#10;There are two special squares on the board: the red square is a recruiting base and the yellow square is a treasure base. When you occupy a recruiting base, you can add your own pieces to it every turn. When you occupy a treasure base, you can draw strategy cards that allow you to perform special moves such as double moves.&#10;&#10;These recruiting bases and treasure bases are the conditions for many secret orders, so you have to guess whether other players are simply occupying them to gain an advantage in the game, or whether they are actually close to achieving their secret orders. Of course, you can use your own pieces and strategy cards to interfere with other players, but it is also very effective to make use of the fact that the secret orders are undisclosed to encourage other players to interfere without getting your hands dirty.&#10;&#10;In addition, since all players want to have a useful base of troops and treasure, alliances will be formed early in the game, either by using pieces and strategy cards to fight for the base, or by spontaneously forming alliances to share the base. There are no penalties for betraying alliances, so don't hesitate to betray an alliance if you think you can fulfill a secret order and get closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Repeatable and fun!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, in addition to the secret mission card, seven different hero cards are dealt to the player in public, and each of the seven heroes has various characteristics: some are good at power play by sending out many pieces, some are good at trick play by making use of strategy cards, and some are good at slowly accumulating strength in a safe area. Since seven types of secret mission cards are combined with these unique heroes, the fighting style changes every time, so you can enjoy the game for a long time without getting bored.&#10;&#10;Also, the initial placement of the hero pieces is determined by the hero cards. It is quite advantageous if the initial placement is close to the base which is the victory condition. However, if other players think that the victory condition is too early, you will be attacked from many directions or receive a concentrated fire of strategy cards, and it is not easy to win. Try to avoid letting your opponent know your victory condition.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, you will be at a disadvantage if the base that is the victory condition is far from your initial placement. Use all possible means to achieve a victory on thin ice, such as boldly attacking and destroying the opponent's heroic pieces, making alliances with other players using the opponent with an advantage on the board as a common virtual enemy, or forcing them to fight each other.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and a friend are visiting Europe, and have different ideas about how to explore Paris&rsquo; many tourist attractions in the single day you have. It may sound easy, but Paris is a major city, bustling with tourists and traffic. Your normal means of traversing the connections between attractions is the hop-on-hop-off bus, but if you want to travel faster you can take an expensive taxi from time to time. At each attraction you&rsquo;ll enjoy spending time exploring, sometimes for a short period and sometimes a longer stay. You&rsquo;ll be distracted by delicious French pastries, however, and all day long you won&rsquo;t be able to ignore any patisserie you see. Sip an espresso with your treats, but don&rsquo;t forget that your goal is to have a better sightseeing experience than your opponent &ndash; and both quantity and quality will count toward victory!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, he/she may take one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Play one or more cards to travel along the connection lines on the board, from one attraction to another.&#10;&bull; Play one card to explore an attraction.&#10;&bull; Discard one card.&#10;&#10;There are three types of connections between attractions: short, medium and long. To move along a connection, a player plays one or more cards from his hand and uses its time symbols to meet the connection&rsquo;s requirements. Once at an attraction, a player can explore it via melding a matching card from his hand. A few special actions and &quot;long waits&quot; at some attractions add randomness and flavor.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&bull;  1 Game Board&#10;&bull; 54 Action Cards&#10;&bull; 20 Wooden Cubes&#10;&bull;  1 Set of Chits&#10;&bull;  2 Player Tokens&#10;&bull;  1 Rules booklet&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Dragon CEOs run pharmaceutical companies while flame demons prowl the back alleys and kobold zealots trade shots with an elf hacker.&#10;&#10;CHA features a full campaign game where your punks gain experience, find new cool gear and hopefully don't end up face down in a rainy alley when a security guard finally frags them.&#10;&#10;Random events, extensive lists of gear and abilities and a huge array of creatures are present in the book, allowing for you to really immerse yourself in the world of cyber fantasy.&#10;&#10;The combat system is based on Squad Hammer and Chrome Hammer allowing fast, colorful combat without being bogged down by complex rules, letting you focus on the scenario you are playing and the enemies you are facing down.&#10;&#10;Intended from the ground up as a solo game, all you need is a handful of miniatures to get started doing battle on the blood-slick streets, in VR space or the astral plane! Each campaign sees you fighting the mega-corps leading to an epic showdown against their monster CEO.&#10;&#10;All of this is supported by included random tables to add flavor to the game experience.&#10;&#10;This is a fantastic opportunity to use some figures you have not had a chance to use yet, plan some wild new paint jobs or conversions or bring some beloved old favorites back.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The core mechanics use a 2D6, pick highest roll to determine how many characters can activate each turn with characters being able to perform an array of actions.&#10;     Ranged combat is resolved with a 2D6 roll trying to exceed a target number, with enemies in close range being permitted to return fire.&#10;     Physical injury, squad casualties and morale is all merged into a single damage score, which can be reduced through the use of certain actions. This allows a fast-playing but tactical feeling experience.&#10;     Mechanics are included for stealth missions, spells and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The rules are intended for solo play and are stand-alone. You do not need a copy of Chrome Hammer or Squad Hammer to play.  &#10;     The intended play space is roughly 3 x 3 feet though smaller tables are manageable. &#10;     Game scale is agnostic but will play fine in both 15mm and 28mm+. &#10;     Record sheets are included. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players score points for correctly guessing words from limited steps.&#10;&#10;The game was revised as Code 6+, with more components added, including hint cards. These allow the game to be more subtle and harder to crack. The guessing players can ask for hints, using six specific hint cards. These hints apply to parts of the secret word, or the whole meaning. The word deck was revised to remove dice symbols from the letter cards. Crib sheets of suitable words were included with the game to assist players.&#10;&#10;The game relies upon a good knowledge of Hiragana words and would be difficult for non-speakers of Japanese.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Event Horizon expansion provides a new way to play Catacombs Conquest. The Sword and Skull team card decks from the base game are replaced with the decks from this expansion. Each card has two shot sequences: a primary shot sequence that can be played immediately and a secondary shot sequence that must be activated by matching a &quot;star sign&quot; symbol. Each player has a set of five Leader cards that start the game face-up in front of them. Players then build their deck by choosing two sets of cards to play with from their team (fighters, spell casters, hunters, creatures, or explorers). Players must play a card from their hand (or flip over one of their Leader cards) to perform the card's primary sequence and may choose to play another card to activate the primary card's secondary shot sequence (a Leader card can also be used for this purpose). Anytime a player cannot draw a card, their discarded cards are reshuffled. The expansion adds the leech shot and new rules for the fireball, missile, and wave ranged shots. It also introduces the new &quot;Dot&quot; connector which enables *both* Character discs to perform a shot. The game features some new characters including the Dwarven Warrior, Siren, Oozing Maw, Stone Sentinel and Battle Robot.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This hand-crafted artisanal gaming set combines four new games with four ancient games.  The new games include a devious abstract strategy game (Oasis), a crazy version of Senet in which you move both forward and backward on every turn, and can move not only the pawns but also the spaces on the board itself (Sand), an ultra fast and exciting push-your-luck game that plays in under 5 minutes (Caravan), and a 4-player multi-species strategy game (Ostriches and Alligators).  The ancient games include the Royal Game of Ur, the Advanced Game of Ur, Senet, and Aseb.&#10;&#10;All games are played on a modular wooden gameboard into which different tiles are inserted in a different pattern for each game.  Some games make use of a modular &quot;board extension&quot; that consists of an extra two spaces for tiles.  Most of the games make use of throwing sticks as randomizers, though one game, Oasis, involves no luck at all.  Playing pieces include hand-painted wooden discs as well as pawns cast in resin from clay sculptures and then hand painted.&#10;&#10;The Ur Variations is the third and final entry in game designer Zach Horton's &quot;Ancient Games trilogy,&quot; following re-creations of Mehen and Men.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players can start simple and add new components and rules over time. The expandable gameplay experience allows players to start easy and build up to a full-on strategy game. The evolving gameplay makes the game ideal for all players, from casual gamers and families to the more strategic and experienced board gamer.&#10;&#10;After setting up the desired level of difficulty through the addition or subtraction of Islands, each player will draw three Single-Element Monsters that correspond to their selected player board. On a turn, players will place a Monster from their hand onto an available slot on an Island. Each Island has a different action which is triggered when a Monster is played on it. In addition to the Island's effect, players will breed a new Monster to add to their hand and receive Element tokens matching the Monster they've just played that. These Element tokens are placed on a Music card, that once filled, is scored to advance a player's position on the score track. The end of the game is triggered when a player enters the final row of the score tracker, denoted in green. All players will have one final turn before final scores are tallied and a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During this period it generated great international interest and many people ventured through the central highlands of Brazil, then remote and uninhabited, to get to know the city under construction. This game tries to capture that trend.&#10;&#10;Players draw a card that will determine the place of departure and the initial means of transportation (plane, train or car). From that point they move their pawns to other cities that are connected by the same means of transport (for example, if you travel by plane, you can only move to another city with an airport, only if you take 3 or 6 on the die).&#10;&#10;Some cities allow the player to change the mode of transport, in some others players will only arrive with the exact number in the data and in others they will receive a card with penalties or rewards.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive in Brasilia is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The Antipode can't capture, can't be owned and doesn't count toward any victory conditions, but it can be the most pivotal piece in the game.&#10;&#10;It seems simple, until you start playing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from Marc White, the designer&#10;&#10;",
