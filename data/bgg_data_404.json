    "Description": "[Translated from French, so might not be completely accurate...]&#10;&#10;Calypso is at the same time a game of memory and deduction. In the center of the table, 6 tiles show fish of different colors, with another colored fish on the reverse. There are 4 colors in total. When the die roll shows a blue fish, you must turn over a plate to reveal a blue fish. It is thus useful to remember the movements of the fish. But when your memory fails, your powers of deduction can take over.&#10;&#10;Imagine that you must turn over a red fish and that the situation on the table is as follows:&#10;&#10;Purple fish, Yellow fish, Yellow fish, Blue fish, Blue fish, Blue fish&#10;&#10;You can deduce that a red fish is under purple fish. Indeed, the three blue fish are blue/red, blue/yellow and blue/purple. The two yellow fish are thus yellow/red and yellow/purple. The last fish is thus purple/red, the only missing combination.&#10;&#10;This combination of reasoning and memory allows kids and adults to play each other. Whilst the adults can play the reasoning game, kids are generally much better at memory games!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Azacru has one objective: to have as many squares of your color on the board at the end of the game. There two very different dynamics at work in the game. Since you cannot land on a square of another player's color, part of the game focuses on blocking opposition pieces and avoiding being blocked. However the game features a &quot;connection change&quot; move which involves pre-planning so that you can move one of your pieces several squares across to another square already of your color. Potentially this could be right across the board, which is a 9 by 9 grid.&#10;&#10;Each time a piece moves the square it lands on becomes its own color, and the number of colored squares it has in one of the nine 3x3 borderlands on the game board determines the power of movement the piece has.&#10;&#10;If the connection change involves changing a square of opposition color then your piece leaves the game, but this can also be to your advantage since the game ends shortly after the first person playing is in a position where they cannot move any pieces. So players strive to get ahead on squares and then cause any early end to the game ... or wait so that they can make a dramatic connection change on the last turn that follows the first person being unable to move.&#10;&#10;Azacru is one of the games featured in the Pacru Series 302 game box of 2005 (the games all use the same board, pieces/chevrons and markers). Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of Shacru is to acquire as many squares of your color on the board as possible before the game is over.  The board is a 9 by 9 grid divided into 9 borderlands of 3 by 3 squares (could now be mistaken for Sudoku!), and at the start of the game all of the squares are neutral (not colored).&#10;&#10;With 2 players there are four pieces (aka chevrons) each, with 3 or 4 players three pieces each.&#10;&#10;Each time you move a piece the square you move onto becomes your color.  You can move onto neutral squares, or squares of your own color, but not onto squares of a different color.  So the game focuses on blocking the pieces of other players, and avoiding your pieces becoming blocked.&#10;&#10;Pieces move only forwards (forwards directly or forwards to left or right).  When a piece crosses a border the player can twist the piece 45 degrees to the left or right.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no player can gain any more squares of their color (either because none of their pieces can move, or because they can only move around onto squares that are already their colour).&#10;&#10;Shacru was first published as part of the Pacru 101 game, and again with the Pacru 302 game.  It can also be played with crayons and paper with the addition of some colored chevron/arrow shaped pieces to move around the paper.  Free software exists at http://www.pacru.com/shacru.html.&#10;&#10;The game is suitable for anyone aged five years or over.&#10;&#10;Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;checkers&quot; feel to be made of high-quality material, and feel cool and smooth to the touch, reminiscent of 'Go' stones, but much larger (and flat). They have star outline, star-filled, and star-filled in a circle designed etched into them: 1 set blue etchings, 1 set red etchings. The board is standard hard cardboard. The board art is gray background with white lines, with blue and red stars, triangles, and square delineated colored zones.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 1 'pawn' (checker) and 1 &quot;King' (checker with a star in a circle design} on their designated opposed short-sides of the 9 x 10 square board. Two dice (each numbered only 1-3) are rolled to determine movement.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pawns&quot; (checkers) move forward or sideways and can only jump other &quot;pawns&quot;.&#10;&#10;&quot;Knights' (checkers with a star design) are created by jumping a &quot;pawn&quot; with its own &quot;King&quot;, They can jump &quot;pawns&quot; or &quot;knights&quot;, and may not be jumped by &quot;pawns&quot;. When a &quot;pawn&quot; is knighted, the checker is flipped over to it's star-design side.&#10;&#10;&quot;Kings&quot; (checker with a star in a circle design) move forward, backward, or sideways. They can jump any piece, but must stay out of the opponent's &quot;holding zone&quot; (a 3 x 3 square area in the middle of the opponent's side).&#10;&#10;A piece may enter the board on a player's holding zone when a 2 is rolled on a die, and is moved the number on the other die.&#10;&#10;A piece may leave the board when it is in a &quot;destination square&quot; (located on the last rank of the opponents side of the board) on any roll.&#10;&#10;Captures are only made by a King. When a king jumps an opposing piece, that piece is placed back in the opponent's 'holding zone' (effectively starting over it's journey).&#10;&#10;There is a scoring system in place for end-of game (Pawns with 1, Knights 2, Kings 4), and the doubling-cube is used to issue challenges during play.&#10;&#10;The rule-sheet has a small section on strategies, and &quot;Championship tournament&quot; guidelines.

Train pieces must match together, but can be started from the middle of the carriage or engine.  New locomotives or carriages can be started against a completed one, to form a longer train.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has completed a locomotive and one or more carriages, and also has one of the conductor cards in their hand.  Points are then awarded for completed locomotives and carriages, and conductors in the hand.  Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Gamers have the choice of competing in a single race or the entire F1 championships playing on the different race tracks similar to the actual F1 Championship.&#10;&#10;Each player (driver) has an identical deck of movement cards, which also represents their fuel, so if at any time during the game they run out of cards, they are out of the game!&#10;&#10;Before the race, players are given 12 construction points to customize their cars according to how they think it will race best on the track selected (the basic game comes with 2 tracks - Malaysia &amp; Japan). Players can choose from better:&#10;- Acceleration (1 point).&#10;- Braking (1 point).&#10;- Cornering (2 points).&#10;- Special features (3 points).&#10;&#10;The race is over 3 laps, and players begin with 5 cards from their deck, and 3 &quot;Event&quot; cards (which introduce elements such as rain, safety car, etc).&#10;&#10;Each round, players starting with the race leader:&#10;1) Decide if he/she wishes to play an &quot;Event&quot; card. The effects take place immediately.&#10;2) Must play 1 &quot;Movement&quot; card and MAY play 1 other card (Acceleration, Braking, Cornering or Special).&#10;3) Players then move their cars according to the modified score of their cards.&#10;&#10;As in real life, players have to really plan how to negotiate the corners, where penalty points in the form of tire wear is imposed if players pass the corners. Essentially, players who land on the corners receive no penalty.&#10;&#10;Players also have to plan tactically when to make their pit stops, and whether they take a short one (just top up petrol), or a longer one (where they also change tires).&#10;&#10;In the end, players who manage their resources well, take risks at the right time and plan their pit stops well will emerge the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Each turn a player turns over one card from his or her dealt pile.  A card showing a nickel or five pennies is &quot;banked&quot;.  Other cards are placed in the center of the table in the &quot;till&quot;.  When a player draws a card that will match a card in the &quot;till&quot; to make five cents, those two cards are &quot;banked&quot;.  Cards can only be &quot;banked&quot; in two (or one) card combinations.  The Silver Pig card is worth 10 cents -- two tricks.  The player with the most money wins the game and becomes the next dealer.&#10;&#10;2. DIME BANK: Plays like &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; except that players &quot;bank&quot; 10 cents instead of 5 cents, and the Silver Pig is worth 20 cents.  (It is unclear how to avoid the two-card limit in this version.)&#10;&#10;3. CONCENTRATION: This version is similar to the game card game Memory.  It is for any number of players.  Players &quot;bank&quot; pairs to add up to either 10 cents or 5 cents.  A player's turn ends upon turning up the Silver Pig card.  The game ends when there are two cards left, and a player uncovers a five-cent card and then the Silver Pig; this combination is worth two tricks.&#10;&#10;",

However, the suits are red hearts, yellow sunbursts, blue five-pointed stars, and white daisy flowers.  There are also four Donald Duck cards of a &quot;wild&quot; shamrock suit.  The #1 cards are Mickey Mouse, the #2 cards are Minnie Mouse, the #3 cards are Pluto, the #4 cards are Thumper, the #5 cards are Goofy, the #6 cards are Dumbo, the #7 cards are Clarabelle, the #8 cards are Flower, the #9 cards are Daisy Duck, and the #10 cards are Chip 'n' Dale.  The last card is an instruction card.&#10;&#10;Game 1:  The four #1 cards are placed face-up on the table.  The remaining cards are shuffled and dealt to each player.  The player to the left of the dealer begins by playing a #2 card on a #1 card of the same color; this player can discard a second card by playing a #3 card of the same suit or any other #2 card.  A player can only discard up to two cards per turn. A Donald Duck card is to be played as an #11 card to complete a pile.  The first player to discard all his or her cards gains 10 points.  A player must gain 50 points to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game 2:  The second game is similar to a version of Crazy Eights or Uno.  Each player is dealt five cards.  The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack with one card turn upright.  Players discard cards by matching either the suit or number or by playing a wild Donald Duck card.  When a wild Donald Duck card is discarded, it is played sideways so that the next player will have to match the card underneath by suit or number or with another wild Donald Duck card.  The winner is the first player to discard all of his cards.&#10;&#10;",

I played many wargames and although some were close to what my vision is of a perfect game there was always something to bother about.&#10;&#10;'I played many many wargames, and many of them disappointing me. In my opinion a game should have a fine mix of these elements:&#10;&#10;* fast pacing, simple and only relevant statics&#10;    * depth, a good mix of planning, bluffing, fast thinking and random elements&#10;    * flexible, can you implement scenarios, new elements, characters and objects?&#10;    * rich, a fantasy world provides a rich world, there are almost no limits&#10;    * epic, can you remember the games you played a year ago?&#10;    * cheap, well you can actually download Warbands for free from this site. In return I ask you to enter the forums and join the discussions.&#10;&#10;'These key-elements I kept in mind developing Warbands, I show no hesitation using elements from existing games to develop Warbands. Its really fun, fast-paced and has a lot of tactical depth.'&#10;&#10;In the game Warbands you are represented by a hero-mage figure controlling a party of a few or maybe a dozen characters on a battlefield. This complete party is called a warband. Each character in the wardband has an unique name. With you controlling this warband you can play the provided scenarios or the ones you created yourself but the game is also designed to battle versus an enemy warband. In an arena or in the open, battle it out till the enemy character is destroyed.&#10;&#10;http://www.warbands.info/&#10;&#10;",

In the set-up, players build a bell tower five levels high using the plastic colored support posts and floors provided, as dictated by the color dots on the floor levels.  Supports are not placed on the top floor; a heavy plastic-enclosed bell structure is placed in the centre of this level, which sounds when the tower becomes unstable.  Then comes the deconstruction.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of spinning the spinner and removing a pillar of the color spun from any floor of the tower. The floor levels have channels cut in them that makes the movement and removal of the support posts a challenge.  Players may manipulate the tower as necessary to remove the pillar, but all pillars removed on a turn that are not the spun color must be replaced before removing the objective support post.  Play continues until the tower falls; the player causing this to occur receives no points for the round whilst all other players receive points based on the color and number of supports taken on their turns.&#10;&#10;Players play a number of rounds equal to the number of players playing.  The player who accumulates the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The drawing was very suggestive, but had no rules.&#10;&#10;Whilst freebies continued to be used by various companies in an effort to get noticed, they often took the shape of fashionable and pointless pins that people could stick on their clothes, or, after a more inspired moment by Jumbo, were god's gift to gamers on Essen: jumbo-sized carrier bags - with appropriate logo of course.&#10;&#10;It took until 1995 before the next noteworthy Essen promo-expansion appeared: Goldsieber's 13th constellation for &quot;Sternenhimmel&quot; (although this was not free). Kosmos followed in 1998 with a &quot;robber-gang-figure&quot; for &quot;Die Siedler von Catan&quot;, probably embarrassed by the success of the game and in a genuine effort to thank the fans. But it wasn't until Hans im Gl&uuml;ck released a player's expansion for its &quot;El Grande&quot; that the promo floodgates truly opened. &#10;The game itself, off course, hardly got noticed and was easily forgotten. What do you expect from a sheet with a large plane and a game-of-goose type track of fluffy clouds that have different shapes but lack any explanation?&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, now the &quot;Essen Freebie Game (Expansion)&quot; has became a bit of an institution, it might be time to pay tribute to the very first one: Hexagames, we salute you with a BGG entry for what must have been a great laugh.&#10;&#10;",

Species hatred flares as humans have employed these new lifeforms where humans deem fit. Life has been hard for the Hybrids and the Risen, often worked to their deaths in colonial construction.&#10;&#10;As well, many humans are fearful that they may be placed the loser in species conflict. Older folk are afraid of the frog, rat, and feline folk that now live next door.&#10;&#10;All the while the Corporate Lords take their due as new leaders of the 21st century.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Pacifica, your role is as a thief and a soldier. Leaders of Buka Units such as yourself will do battle, live as a rogue, and all the while laugh at those who do not know honor and freedom. Southeast off the shore of Japan, is where you are needed as the the 1,000,000 souls of the Pacifica Ocean Settlements are at odds with seeming rebels. These insurgents may be backed by powerful forces, so beware.&#10;&#10;Pacifica makes its pay from oil drilling, tourism, research programs, and especially, the Titan Naga Platform that taps and collects geothermal energy from the earths core.&#10;&#10;Of course, the internet now exists as both the wire of mother earth, and as playground. Webcrawlers with HUD net access fly as Deva across the shadowy illusion that is the Cybernet. Pays to keep a few of those people around.&#10;&#10;Some, like yourself, will make their pay by covert operations. Welcome Buka rogue,&#10;&#10;Enjoy your stay.&#10;&#10;The game is a build-it-yourself PDF download.  It includes a modular board, units (infantry, vehicles, and weapons) a rulebook, and 44 cards used to represent background &quot;cyber-combat,&quot; or the opponents' wrestling for control of the computer system of the building they are in.  Physical combat is decided by a more conventional roll-to-hit system.  Rules are included to simulate combat in flooded and fully submerged locations.&#10;&#10;This game is out of print.&#10;&#10;",

The four-player game can be played with a set of two partners.  The game begins with each player being dealt 4 cards.  Three cards are placed face up in the middle of a table, although the 3-player game requires five cards to be placed face up in the middle of the table instead of three.&#10;&#10;Players can claim cards in three ways.&#10;&#10;1. By matching: A player can claim a card that matches on in his or her hand.&#10;2. By combining: If there is a Mickey Mouse &quot;Lucky One&quot; on the table, a player can form a +1 addition equation to place this card on another card already on the table and pick it up with a next highest number card in the player's hand.&#10;3. By building: A player can attempt to form an addition equation to pick up a set of cards.  For example: If there is a &quot;3&quot; on the table, a player can place a &quot;4&quot; on a &quot;3&quot; to build a &quot;7&quot;.  If player can use a &quot;7&quot; card next round to pick up the &quot;4&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.  However, this player could lose this &quot;4 + 3&quot; in two ways.  Another player could take this &quot;4 + 3&quot; before next turn by playing a &quot;7&quot;, or another player could attempt to build a higher number equation by placing another card on the &quot;4 + 3&quot; stack.  However, a player cannot build unless he or she has a card to pick up the stack.&#10;&#10;A player that cannot match, combine, or build must place one card on the table.  The player making the last play takes any cards left on the table.  A player gets 3 points for having the most cards, 2 points for a Lucky 2, 2 points for a Lucky 10, and 1 point for a Lucky 1.  The player or team that is the first to get 25 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In this version, the pawns move forward diagonally and capture forward vertically and forward horizontally, but they can never move more than one square at a time and thus there is no &quot;en passant&quot; capture technique in this game.  Castling does not exist in Forchess.  It is suggested that kings should be captured like other pieces, although opponents should still say &quot;check&quot; when putting a king in jeopardy.  Furthermore, a player cannot place a teammate in check.  If a player cannot move any of his pieces, he must remove one piece from the board per turn until he can move a piece.  If a player captures a king, he may then use all of the removed player's pieces!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is best played in a largish area with the competitors sitting in a circle on the floor.  A plastic basket containing a coiled 'snake' is placed in the center of the players.  The 'snake' consists of a large, material-covered spring with a plastic head on one end.  The basket has a number of holes, one of which will activate the latch on the basket and release the snake.&#10;&#10;Players select a colored Swami &amp; place it in position at the base of the basket closest to them.  During the game, players are not permitted to move their hands away from their Swami unless it is their turn or their name is called during play.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with 5 snake tokens each.  A turn consists of paying a token into the 'snake pit', calling out an opponent's name and pressing a hole in the basket.&#10;&#10;If nothing happens, the player can elect to continue their turn for as long as they want, rotating the basket, pressing successive holes &amp; calling out an opponent's name each time, paying a snake token into the snake pit before each press.  Whenever a player manages to get rid of all their snake tokens, they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.  A player may end their turn at any time without having released the snake.&#10;&#10;If the snake is released, the relevant opponent must catch the snake or they are penalized - they must return one ruby to the treasure trove or take 5 snake tokens from the snake pit if they have no rubies.&#10;&#10;If the snake is successfully caught, the caller must give the opponent one of their own rubies.  If no ruby is owned, the opponent gives the caller all the snake tokens they currently hold and - since they now have no more snake tokens - they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.&#10;&#10;Any player who erroneously attempts to catch the snake or otherwise removes their hands from their Swami at an unauthorized time during play is penalized.  They receive a snake token from each of their opponents.&#10;&#10;The first player with 5 rubies is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game based on the table snooker ball game.  Each player starts with seven card(ball)s.  The top cardball from the deck is turned over and becomes the 'option cardball'.  A player then takes either the option cardball or the top card from the deck and then places a card on top of the option cardball.  A player may then make a break.  A minimum break consists of a white cardball, a red cardball and a colored card ball (following the rules of snooker).  As the red cards are played they are placed in the pockets in the snookard box.  Later the colored balls will also be played into these pockets.  A player replenishes back to seven cards.  A scoreboard is also provided.  The winner of the frame is the player with the highest number of points when the final black is potted.  There are also special cards: miscue, snooker, foul, safety shot and free ball.&#10;&#10;",

He states in the acknowledgment that he developed the game in 1977 for personal home play and that after 5 years of private play he was urged to get a copyright and publish the game.&#10;&#10;The object it to become a Billionaire. Each player starts with 300 million dollars and the game continues until only one player is left with money or one player accumulates 1 billion dollars in assets.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 300 chips, 16 casino tiles, 6 tokens, 5 dice, 4 betting strips, a gameboard, a slots deck, a regular deck a spinner and the rule book.&#10;&#10;Players roll either 1 or 2 dice (their choice) and then move around the board and either play the gambling game of the casino that they land on for small profits against the bank or buy the casino (casinos are grouped, sort of like Monopoly squares, by the same color) and then own and become the bank for that particular casino making the payoffs for others who gamble in that particular casino. The games of chance in the game are SLOTS, WHEEL, DICE, BLACKJACK, ACEY-DUCEY and various forms of POKER. (There is an explanation on how to play any of the games included in the rule book..&#10;&#10;Acquiring a set of the same colored casinos allows one to get a bonus by selling them back to the bank for double the buying price.&#10;&#10;Sometimes the wording of the rules shows perhaps a lack of proper English and so are not as clear as they could be.&#10;&#10;",

Moving takes place simultaneously with each player preforming the action on the space they land on.&#10;Certain spaces lead to Crisis cards, which can be countered with collected Rescue cards. Others allow players to attempt to win a Driver's License by picking three numbers and attempting to roll one of them on a die. Still other spaces just allow you to &quot;hang out&quot; or go get a snack.&#10;If a player makes it around the whole board with at least one key and a Driver's License they choose one of six Car Cards and try to match the color of one of their keys.
