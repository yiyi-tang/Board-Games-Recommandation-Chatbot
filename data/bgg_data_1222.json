    "Description": "The kickstarter edition included exclusive content packaged inside the base game box - 5th player expansion and Dream Companions.&#10;&#10;The dream companions are a few bonus tiles with rare animals on them for Dingo's Dreams. When playing with this variant, each player starts with one of these extra tiles in hand. To win the game, a player's dream companion tile must be in the center space of the dreamscape, in addition to all other normal goal requirements. This makes for a fun extra challenge!&#10;&#10;About the base game:&#10;&#10;Dingo and his friends have gotten lost on Walkabout! Visit their dreams to lead them home!&#10;&#10;Dingo's Dreams is a delightful and clever family game for 2-4 players. Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game). After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side. The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal. The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.&#10;&#10;",

You must collect evidence in order to make arrests, whether you intend to capture the leader or another suspect.&#10;&#10;To set up &#218;&#152;&#216;&#167;&#217;&#134;&#216;&#175;&#216;&#167;&#216;&#177;&#217;&#133;&#216;&#177;&#219;&#140; (Gendarmery), create a &quot;wall&quot; of suspect cards in a 3x3 grid that leaves the center empty. Each suspect card features an illustration as well as that individual's characteristics. Underneath each suspect card is a face-down interrogation card that features an arrow pointing in one of the eight compass points or (near the bottom of the deck) a medal. Place one interrogation card face up in the center of the grid; the arrow on this card identifies the main suspect. Additionally, you lay out two face-up decks of evidence cards and a face-down &quot;door&quot; deck of action cards; the &quot;janitor&quot;, for example, lets you take a card from a player's hand and put it in someone else's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take one of four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take an evidence card from the top of a deck and add it to your hand.&#10;    Archive 1-2 cards from your hand, removing them from play.&#10;    Reveal the top door card from the deck and carry out its action to hinder someone else or help yourself.&#10;    Report evidence to capture a suspect.&#10;&#10;&#10;To report, you reveal all of the evidence card in your hand. If the combination of symbols that you reveal are present on exactly one suspect card on the wall, you catalog those evidence cards and that suspect. (If your symbols match two or more suspects, you've wasted the Chief's time and your turn ends.) If that suspect was not the main suspect, place that suspect's interrogation card under the central card, then place a new face-down interrogation card and a new suspect card in the empty space.&#10;&#10;If that suspect was the main suspect, then you collect that suspect card and all of the interrogation cards in the center of the grid; you then reveal the interrogation card that was under that suspect. If the card is a medal or an arrow that points to an empty space in the grid, the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In World Crisis Simulator, between 3-6 players take on the role of major world powers combating a global issue. You'll take turns hosting summits and contributing (or not!) to helping solve the Earth's problems, all while trying to figure out what your purported allies' end goals are. The fate of the planet is at stake; will you rise to the occasion, or fall to petty infighting?&#10;&#10;Taking inspiration from the crisis mechanics of beloved board games Battlestar Galactica and Dead of Winter, World Crisis Simulator sees everyone at the table contributing to that round's summit, with each player having a chance to take the reigns and be the Summit Host. The host gets to decide if the summit is successful, bringing the Earth back to stability, or fails, making everyone's status ever more dire. While everyone in the game probably wants to get through this thing with humanity intact, players' secret objectives will inevitably interfere with them acting in the best interests of everyone else. Act too selfishly though, and other players will use their action cards to cripple your strategy, or even remove you from the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These can be replenished at the Keep. The board is made up of hex tiles and the game starts at the Keep tile which is surrounded by 6 randomly chosen land tiles. Each land tile has the name of a location on it and players are looking for the ones that match their quest cards.&#10;&#10;In the basic rules, on each player's turn they can move from one tile to an adjacent tile and draw a land tile if none exists in the direction they wish to move. Then they draw a wild encounter card and resolve it. Defeated wild encounters can be traded at the Keep for treasure or character improvements.&#10;&#10;A player that moves on to a land card with a name that matches a quest card can reveal the card to draw from the Quest encounter deck instead of the wild encounter deck. If they defeat the encounter they have completed the quest, collect the treasure, and place the quest card face up in their play area so everyone can see how many quests they have completed. However, if they fail or flee the quest a red marker is placed on the location and the quest is now considered and open quest for anyone.&#10;&#10;Only treasure that is safely deposited at the keep counts towards victory so you have to get it back to the keep safely. Once someone has completed three quests a 6 round endgame counter is started. At the end of the 6th round each player's banked treasure at the Keep is counted and the player with the most treasure wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Kickstarter version of Margraves of Valeria 4 bonus packs inside the game's box. These are Kickstarter Limited Exclusives and will not be available at retail. They may be available on the publisher's website, conventions, or the BGG Store.&#10;&#10;Dragons Pack - 4 card pack adds 1 dragon per lair. Also includes a punchboard with 10 bounty tiles and rules card.&#10;&#10;Citizen Pack - 8 card pack adds 2 copies of  4 new citizens with unique powers.&#10;&#10;Reeve Pack - 5 card pack adds 1 new starter citizen card for each player.&#10;&#10;Monster Pack - 4 card pack adds 1 new monster with unique rewards per lair.&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;Margraves of Valeria is a hand-building worker-placement game set in the fantasy world of Valeria. It's the fifth stand-alone game in the series and brings the familiar feel of the previous games (with icons, characters, and easy turns) while building on familiar mechanics you'd expect (off-turn bonuses, multi-use cards, and resource-management).&#10;&#10;You are a Margrave, a military commander tasked with defending the land of Valeria and building magical Ward Towers at cities.  Knights in Valeria can be commanded by you or your fellow Margraves to slay monsters or activate locations in an effort to gain influence over the 4 Guilds: Worker, Soldier, Shadow, and Holy. As you gain influence, you'll cross thresholds that will earn you privilege tiles which give you bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you'll earn victory points based on how much influence you have over a Guild and how many icons you've gained of that Guild. The Margrave with the most victory points at the end of the game will be named a Duke or Duchess and given their own province to protect and grow!&#10;&#10;Turns are deceptively simple as you only get to play 1 Citizen card from your hand. Each card can be played for action icons in the pennant (top-left), power text (at the bottom), or played face-down to perform one of the two actions on your player board (Recall your cards or Build a Ward Tower).&#10;&#10;Key features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hand Building - Much like deck-building, you are drafting cards into your hand increasing your powers, victory points, and options.  &#10;    Multi-use Cards - Each card can be used in one of four ways, leaving you a lot of decision-making room to execute your strategy.&#10;    Worker-Placement - Each time you move your Margrave or a Knight into a location, you activate the power of that location much like a worker placement game. &#10;    Shared Workers - The Knights on the game board do not belong to a single player (anyone can use them) so be careful not to setup your opponents with powerful turns.&#10;    Resource Management - You have limited storage spots on your player board and using them effectively (without wasting tokens) is key to winning the game. &#10;    Hero Tombs - As you send Knights into battle, they die glorious deaths and are sent to tombs where you can collect bonuses in a well-integrated mini-game.&#10;    Influence Track - Gain influence over the 4 Guilds by moving your markers across the tracks which will earn you more victory points at the end of the game for icons you collect.&#10;    Fantastic Art - As with previous Valeria games, the Mico has really outdone himself by creating a rich and dynamic world full of color and life.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Basic method is built barrier to stop another player and roll the dice to decide how many step you can move. Once you decide your moving code, another player will help you to move your chess and let you know if your chess is moving to the position you expect or stop by some unknown barriers. The first player who get into finish line wins the game.&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate game play method is add the instruction dice into the game. This dice gives you three extra variable. Loops, Function call and Boolean value. Combine Loops and digital dice together for example, it will give the player a chance to double one of their movement, let the player go two steps further or block by barrier.&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most interesting part is the Function call and Boolean value. Function call gives players a chance to choose a function blow the instruction board, take a unexpected step and win the game. Boolean value is a hypothesis programming language. Using &ldquo;IF THEN or ELSE&rdquo;&nbsp;to detecting other player&rsquo;s barriers, bypass the barriers and take a move. But if there is no any barrier, it will do the ELSE step.&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting for kids to training their logical analyze ability, programming thinking, perseverance and pre-judgement ability.&#10;&#10;",

All lies must be complete lies, and all truths complete truths. However, there is one exception: The Hybrid. If you receive this card, you must tell a true story that occurred in a fictional universe and try to pass it off as your own.&#10;&#10;Once all the Responders have checked out their card, the Prompter provides a prompt, whether using the included Prompt cards as inspiration or reading a question directly off one. Each Responder now responds. As a Responder, if you do not feel comfortable answering a question, you may tap the X card in the middle of the table. This signifies to the table you are out this round. Keep your card face down.&#10;&#10;After each Responder responds, the Promoter can ask two Responders one follow-up question, after which the Prompter must now locate the liars and the hybrid.&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios are for medium and large battles.&#10;&#10;What is a miniature wargame scenario? &#10;At least a map, orders of battle, initial deployments and a schedule of reinforcements. So any scenario should be usable with any American Civil War game system for which the orders of battle and map scale make sense.&#10;&#10;Why fictional scenarios, battles that could have happened but didn&rsquo;t? Historical scenarios give knowledgeable players way too much information about their opponent and take away many command decisions. And you&rsquo;ve probably already played scenarios based on most major historical battles of the American Civil War anyway. So how about trying some brand new situations that test your skills, situations that let YOU make the decisions?&#10;&#10;Why fog-of-war rules? Do you want to keep your enemies guessing as to what you&rsquo;re up to and distract them with fake maneuvers? Do you want to disguise your attack plans, mass your forces where they&rsquo;re least expected, and then launch blistering attacks? Are you bold enough to plan and execute attacks like Jackson&rsquo;s at Chancellorsville? If so, then you need fog-of-war rules!&#10;&#10;You get:&#10;&#10;     Nine fictional scenarios for use with any American Civil War game system that has divisions/brigades as its basic units. All scenarios and rules are adaptable for game systems that are based on brigades/regiments&hellip;.&#10;     Orders of battle for Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom and another popular game. The orders of battle can be used as templates to create orders of battle for other rule systems&hellip;.&#10;     Maps and initial situation write-ups for all scenarios with initial deployments and arrival times for reinforcements&hellip;.&#10;     Unique, general purpose fog-of-war rules that allow hidden movement and deployment for use in all of the scenarios and in scenarios designed for other game systems&hellip;.&#10;     Night and sleep rules for multi-day battles&hellip;.&#10;     Color-coded troop tags for all orders of battle&hellip;.&#10;     Hidden deployment and movement cards for use with the fog-of-war rules&hellip;.&#10;     Terrain markers (Light/Medium/Heavy) for hiding the nature of terrain until units actually enter it&hellip;.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Their success resulted in the destruction of the elite German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the disintegration of Germany's Allied Armies and the unhinging of the entire Axis position in the Ukraine. The Axis, for the first time, were thrown on the strategic defensive and the road to Kursk. The Germans, for their part, unleashed 'Winter Storm' and the famous Manstein 'backhand blow' which did much to restore the situation. Within the scope of the EUROPA series of simulations from GDW, Uranus/Saturn attempts to allow gamers to explore the military possibilities open to both sides using components largely available.

Eight turns cover the entire conflict, with some scenarios being shorter duration.  Counters generally represent divisions or brigades for land units, generic air points for air assets, and 1-2 named capital ships (and their escorts) for naval vessels.  Cards are included as an optional variant that reflect many of the historical events (e.g. Stillwell's Chinese forces, Japanese night naval proficiency, etc.) that add additional flavor to the game with little additional overhead.&#10;&#10;",

All effects are resolved immediately.&#10;The game takes place in turns and each player can take each of the actions listed above on its turn.&#10;There are 3 colors of tiles, from the lightest and superficial, with less dangers and less riches, to the darkest and deepest, with more dangers and riches and also where is the only diamond tile.

The Government arrested most of the leaders and tried to ensure the mail service ran on time!&#10;&#10;So, is there a game in this? &#10;Well of course there is, perhaps not as evenly matched or equipped forces but as a good example of asymmetrical warfare where a regularly trained army faces a peasant mass. Likewise, the incoherent nature of the United Irishmen is best portrayed via dice rolls rather than player decisions and that all players should be British Lord-Lieutenants defending their County, gaining prestige and gaining the support of the central government at Dublin Castle.&#10;&#10;Included in the game is a novel mini-campaign system for four fictitious Irish counties struggling to destroy risings in their counties. &#10;There is also a neat system of creating one-off battles with context.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is played on a board representing a tennis court with numbers along the service court lines and letters along the base and side lines.&#10;&#10;To serve a player places their piece on a lettered space and a ball token on a number on the opposite service court line. They also place a letter disc along the net. A number and a letter die are rolled to determine the result of the shot, but generally the receiver will play a second letter disc. This procedure is repeated although starting with the third shot players must draw a card which may change how it is played.&#10;&#10;The general object is to force your opponent to complete a word of at least four letters. If your opponent does this you win a game, and the first player to win six games wins the set, which corresponds to winning the overall game.&#10;&#10;",

As you travel around the synchrotron you will have to make the most of your experiments, as well as working with your fellow players, in order to be remembered as the most famous scientist!&#10;&#10;Players move around the synchrotron, stopping at different beamlines that let them make progress in specific scientific disciplines. Once at a beamline, players perform an experiment, drawing cards that represent either successes or failure. They can draw as many cards as they want, but beware! If you draw 2 failure cards you must stop, and lose half of your successes. Once the experiment is finished, players can assign their successes to ongoing projects matching the discipline - once all requirements are met on a project it is completed, and will earn you fame. Once a set number of projects are completed, the game ends, and the scientist with the highest amount of fame wins!&#10;&#10;Dr Mark Basham and Dr Claire Murray from Diamond Light Source and Dr Matthew Dunstan from the University of Cambridge created the game to showcase both the research performed at this world-leading facility, but also to give you first-hand experience of the different aspects of actually working in scientific research. Whether it is the variety of science that exists, the timely value of a vital collaboration, the disappointment of a failed experiment, or gratitude for the help from a friendly staff scientist, the game puts you directly in the action so you can make your own choices about what type of scientist you want to be.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It outclassed everything it met but there was only one (think of the SF classic, Ogre, but on the waters this time).&#10;&#10;Paul Stuhlfaut with Under Ten Flags starts early in 1939 when the German merchant raider Atlantis made its way into the South Atlantic to sink and capture Allied cargo vessels. Its crew used their skill in disguising the appearance of the vessel to aid its encounters or avoid enemy warships. The journey of the raider Atlantis lasted for over 600 days and traveled over 100,000 miles.&#10;&#10;Steven Cunliffe with XXI, a solitaire game set in 1943 that challenges the player (acting as both Speer and D&ouml;nitz) to organize and complete construction of a fleet (or at least &ldquo;enough&rdquo;) of the new German Type XXI submarine. However this new sub is far larger, more complex and more expensive, and requires much more manpower and scarce resources than previous submarines. Just a few of these new Type XXIs will do nothing. Only a radical transformation in shipbuilding techniques to mass produce the design - and not giving in to setbacks - will enable this &ldquo;wonder weapon&rdquo; to arrive in time....&#10;&#10;Paul Rohrbaugh with First Strike looks at, well, the &quot;first strike&quot; by British airplanes. On Christmas Day, 1914, float planes were brought near land by the earliest &quot;seaplane tenders&quot; and turned loose on an &quot;air reconnaissance&quot; by planes which just happened to be carrying bombs and looking for Zeppelin sheds.
