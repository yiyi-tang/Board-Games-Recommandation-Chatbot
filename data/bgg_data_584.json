One player or team will be up at bat, controlling a switch to move players via vibrations from an electric motor.  The other player will be pitching and fielding.&#10;&#10;Pitching is done via a spring loaded accessory.  Using the accessory you fling a magnet onto a pitching board.  The board has labels for strikes, fouls, ball, balks, wild pitches and a batter.  The batter then hits the board trying to accurately guess where the magnet landed.  They use a spring loaded paddle to try to propel the magnet onto the main board or on the outfield board.  Once the ball is hit the motor is turned on and plastic playing pieces then wiggle their way to the next base.  Simultaneously, the pitcher tries to use the fielding device to throw the magnet to the correct base.&#10;&#10;The rules indicate you can play with teams up to 9 per side (just like real baseball), but head to head would likely provide the best games.&#10;&#10;A very neat game which is part of the Tru-Action line which included football, sports car racing, baseball, basketball and horse racing.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in real time using a timer or stopwatch.&#10;&#10;Once the game has begun players may not touch the ball with their hands, except to return balls which go out of bounds. Scoring is the same as in basketball.&#10;&#10;The board is a piece of sheet metal with 19 indented holes.  A plastic basketball is used as well.&#10;&#10;The ball is placed in the center hole and players then use spring controlled flippers to lift a metal tab which propels the ball into the air.  The ball will then roll around on the board until it stops on an indent.  The corresponding player will then use the flipper to try to score goals.&#10;&#10;The board also includes wire boards which are elevated above the magnetic board.&#10;&#10;This game is a wonderful and unique design.&#10;&#10;On a side note, Lew Alcindor changed his name (after converting to Islam) to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  He is widely regarded as one of the best players in professional basketball and won numerous awards during his lifetime.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Book's Introduction:&#10;&#10;The Lost and the Damned and its companion volume Slaves to Darkness describe the fantastic and otherwordly Realm of Chaos. This book is concerned with the two great Chaos Powers Tzeentch and Nurgle, their Daemons, and their mortal Champions. The other two major Chaos Powers, Khorne and Slaanesh, have already been described in Slaves to Darkness, volume one of Realm of Chaos.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can use this book to create their own Champions of Chaos - mortal heroes whose mighty deeds have won them the deserving patronage of the Chaos Powers. As a Champion of Chaos, your hero will earn special rewards from his patron, including super-human abilities, magical gifts, and daemonic followers. In return for his Patron's favour, your Champion must undertake to fight rival Champions and further the divine aims of his Chaos Power in the mortal world.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can also use this book to create Daemonic Armies of the Chaos Powers Nurgle and Tzeentch. Daemonic Armies are so tremendously powerful and highly magical that they are only suitable for fighting each other. This they do more or less continuously as their masters pitch them against each other to test their relative strengths. Champions of Chaos who have grown sufficiently powerful may be summoned to the daemonic battlefield to fight on behalf of their patron.&#10;&#10;Warhammer 40,000 players can also create their own Champions to fight each other or any of the other forces of the Imperium. Players can also use this book to design armies of Chaos Renegades and Traitor Marines which confront the Imperium for control of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay players can use this book either to create an unusual character type in the Chaos Champion, or to generate endless adversaries for more conventional characters. The narrative generators can also be used as the basis for adventures against or on behalf of the Chaos Powers, and also provide many ideas which you can develop into game plots yourself.&#10;&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;The second part of Realm of Chaos detailing the gods of chaos in Games Workshop's various universes. Weighed in at 300 pages.&#10;&#10;Originally written for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Games Workshop had lost some of the IP rights to that world and so promptly quit officially supporting it.&#10;&#10;Officially listed as only a supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40,000, the background material was only useful for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Also, there were Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay stats provided for all the creature included herein.&#10;&#10;Focused on the gods Nurgle and Tzeentch, The Lost and the Damned included extensive rules on &quot;narrative campaigns&quot;.&#10;&#10;However, the one bad thing about this book was the binding was exceedingly brittle, and the pages very easily separated from it with just minimal use of the book. Plus, unlike Slaves to Darkness, it was never reprinted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a new member of the Dominoes family. The game consists of 73 dice and 18 Variomino tiles. These are square plastic tiles which have two different sides. On one side, four dice can be placed on top of the tile, on the other side, one or two dice can be placed - this side of the tile also has a number on each edge (1-4).&#10;&#10;Various games can be played with these materials; from classic muggins variants where points are scored when the ends of the line can be divided by five (counting the sum of the dice plus the numbers on the edge) to solitaire games resembling Sudoku. There are many ways to count the points: Adding dice numbers on top to numbers on the edges, counting the numbers on the side of the dice, etc. The tiles can even be stacked.&#10;&#10;The game was published as a test edition by Edition Perlhuhn in 2009. The rule sheets expressly invite players to invent new games with the materials, much as was done with &quot;Spiel&quot; for which dozens of game ideas were eventually published.&#10;&#10;",

One of the basic components of this game is the &quot;Pedigree Card&quot; shown in a diagram below.  It will be noticed that in each case the parents are to the right of their children. The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.  This could go on indefinitely, and in spite of the infeasibility of putting 10 or 15 generations of ancestors on one chart, one can easily relate to a certain ancestor 13 generations back on one of his surname lines by the pedigree number of that ancestor.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Enjoy and be entertained.&quot;&#10;&#10;As from the blurb this is a game of politics set in Australia with players attempting to win the election by securing a majority in the House.&#10;&#10;The Board is a large circle with a series of concentric circles within representing different city &amp; county constituencies. At the center is a grid representing the House, with a Hereditary Seat space at the center of this.&#10;&#10;Players roll die to gain a number of move points used to move vote blocks around the board in an attempt to gain control of seats.&#10;&#10;Players can also pick up &quot;Contingency &amp; Complication&quot; cards to add some variety to the game.&#10;&#10;",

The players simultaneously slide their missiles across the floor or table, trying to knock down the other player's units. The first one to knock down all 4 opposing units wins.&#10;&#10;In the Advanced game, the sequence of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Each player may convert one unit between Robot and Vehicle mode. Only units in Vehicle mode can move.&#10;2  Each player rolls his special die, which he first secretly sets to Robot or Vehicle mode.  If he has no units in a mode, he can't use it. The die results allow movement, extra shots, protection from enemy shots, or repair of a previously hit unit.&#10;3. The players slide their missiles, trying to knock over enemy units. They must slide from behind their closest unit to the other side.  Based on the die results, a player may shoot once, twice, or not at all.&#10;4. First one to knock over all the enemy units at once wins.&#10;&#10;",
