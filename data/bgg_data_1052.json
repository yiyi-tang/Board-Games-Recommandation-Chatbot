    "Description": "One part matching game, one part dominoes, plus loads and loads of fun, this game is both a clever challenge to hone memory skills and a make-your-own visual adventure of colorful play pieces. With the tour-de-force inventiveness which fuels his already-classics Press Here, Mix It Up!, and Let's Play!, Herv&eacute; Tullet's open-ended game stimulates creative thinking and fosters imagination.&#10;&#10;This open-ended game fosters creative thinking and imagination with lots of different ways to play. Here are a few to get you started.&#10;&#10;MATCHING GAME: A clever memory challenge for 2 or more players&#10;Spread the cards out color-side down in 4 rows of 11 cards each. The youngest player goes first and turns over 2 cards. If the pictures match, the player gets to keep the cards and take another turn. If the pictures don&rsquo;t match, the player turns the cards back over, and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn. Players take turns flipping the cards over and looking for matches. The game ends when all the cards have been matched. The player with the most matches wins. Note: For younger children, the game can be played with fewer cards; try 24 or 32 cards. For a more difficult game, spread the cards out not in rows but in a random pattern!&#10;&#10;ROADBUILDER: Matching up lines for 2 to 4 players&#10;Locate 1 of the black-and-white crossroads cards and place it in the center of the table. Each player picks 1 of the 4 sides of the card to build from. Place the remaining cards in the deck color-side down. Players take turns drawing a card from the deck and placing them on the table color-side up, matching up the lines to make as long a &ldquo;road&rdquo; as possible from their side. If a player reaches a dead end, he or she sits out the rest of the round. When no player can continue their &ldquo;road,&rdquo; all players collect the cards they&rsquo;ve played and set them aside. Repeat, building new &ldquo;roads&rdquo; until all the cards are exhausted. The player with the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;PATTERNGROWER: A collaborative visual adventure for 1 or more players.&#10;This game should be played on the floor or another large surface, because the designs can get very big! Using both sides of the cards, players work together to make the largest possible design while still matching up all the lines. Try playing with all cards color-side up. Or try placing each fourth card black-side up.&#10;&#10;See if you can come up with some variations of these games on your own!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Micro Brick Battle is a fast-paced table top strategy game using 1:120 scale models built with LEGO bricks. It is a turn-based game for two players (or teams) which continues until one side has completely destroyed the forces of the other (or otherwise completed an objective as set out in a given scenario). This book is intended to provide the basic rules for land-based armored combat. It also provides building instructions and game stats for many of the most commonly used armored vehicles of WWII.&#10;&#10;Future expansions of the Micro Brick Battle system will include aerial combat, additional armored vehicles, and Campaign Modules for specific historic battles. We also plan to host Micro Brick Battle tournaments at events around the country starting in mid-2017. This will coincide with the release of our companion card game Bricks of War, now in development process.&#10;&#10;Aside from the basic game rules, the bulk of this book is devoted to building instructions for the basic game piece models. This includes a short section with tips for acquiring the necessary LEGO pieces and building tips to help you complete your models. The composition of your Micro Brick Battle armies are completely up to you; whether you want to recreate historic battles or build an armored juggernaut of your own design. Brickmania will be releasing various game piece mini kits which will be compatible with the Micro Brick Battle system. These will have the added bonus of including the corresponding Bricks of War card, which will be necessary for use in the official tournament play.&#10;&#10;This book includes instructions to build game piece models for 44 different armored vehicle from WWII.&#10;&#10;This book includes instructions for building the following armored vehicles:&#10;&#10;France:&#10;Renault Ft-17&#10;Renault R35&#10;Char B1 Bis&#10;Sumoa S35&#10;Sumoa S40 (SPG)&#10;&#10;Japan:&#10;Type 95&#10;Type 97&#10;Type 4 Ho-Ro (SPG)&#10;&#10;Germany:&#10;Panzer II&#10;Panzer II Luchs&#10;Panzer III&#10;Panzer IV&#10;Panzer 38(t)&#10;Tiger I&#10;Panther&#10;StuG III&#10;Wespe (SPG)&#10;&#10;Great Britain:&#10;M3 Grant&#10;Churchill&#10;Firefly&#10;Matilda II&#10;Valentine&#10;Cromwell&#10;Archer&#10;Sexton (SPG)&#10;&#10;Italy:&#10;Carro Armato L3/35&#10;Carro Armato P40&#10;Semovente da 90/53 (SPG)&#10;Semovente da 75/18 (SPG)&#10;Semovente da 105/25 (SPG)&#10;&#10;Soviet Union&#10;BT-7&#10;T-34/76&#10;KV-1&#10;Su-76 (SPG)&#10;Su-152 (SPG)&#10;Kv-2 (SPG)&#10;&#10;United States&#10;M3 Stuart&#10;M5 Stuart&#10;M3 Lee&#10;M4 Sherman&#10;M26 Pershing&#10;M10 Wolverine&#10;M18 Hellcat&#10;M7 Priest&#10;&#10;",

Then, each player makes two piles of 8 cards face down (4x2 grids). These are their two hives.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they will choose any card (except for their first turn where each player must choose their queen) and replace a face down card with the chosen card face up. The player will look at the card they chose and put it in the corresponding numbered location in the hive.&#10;&#10;Players will continue to replace face down cards with each new card in their hand until you can no longer play any more cards.&#10;&#10;If the overturned card is a queen, move it over to the other hive and start working on both hives at the same time. Once a queen is placed into a hive, she cannot be moved out. However, the queen is a wild card and can be moved around within the hive&#10;&#10;When a player draws a card they can&rsquo;t play, they discard it into the discard pile and then their turn is over.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to complete two hives. Each hive must have a queen and the rest of the numbers in order and all turned face up&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "WWII: Full Global Conflict is a territorial strategy game covering the second world war. A variant of the Axis &amp; Allies board game system, and a flagship game in the Empires of History game series, it offers an easy to play D10 based combat system and territories with resource values for production. More than 7 years in the making, it stands as king atop the Empires of History line of historical strategy games.&#10;&#10;Two full color game maps present Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific in detail. Movement between the maps is clearly defined and a comprehensive series of off map boxes contain North America, South America, the Atlantic central and lower Africa and more. One game: the entire war. With Manpower Limits, detailed technology development rules, and accurate historical detailing, Empires of History: WWII provides all of the game play quality and historical detail that gamers have come to expect from the Empires of History board game series.&#10;&#10;With over 1700 counters, 11 nation sheets and 3 political options booklets, players assume the mantle of command of the Axis &amp; Allied forces with an option for the US player to play with their own agenda. The game comes with a standard 1939 start for the war, but with the available political options, the game can either follow the path of the war or diverge from it fairly substantially. Limited resources like Oil Resources, Manpower Limits and difficult to defend naval sea trade resources, neither side has it easy and both should experience the desperate need for very limited resources.&#10;&#10;A game for 2-8 players.&#10;&#10;",

The name &quot;Vertellis&quot; is derived from two Dutch words &quot;Vertel Eens&quot;. These two words, loosely translated, mean &quot;Tell Us More&quot; - which is what Vertellis revolves around! Not only by answering the questions in this deck, but also by engaging and ask each other to tell more. This will result in a deeper connection with with your partner!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Relive Rick's first moments in The Walking Dead as he braves his way to his home then gears up at the police station in order to face the walkers head-on. The scenario supports 1-4 players!&#10;&#10;In the solo version, the player takes control of Rick, with another Survivor of his or her choice being controlled as an Ally. With 2 players, the second player takes the place of the Ally, playing as the Survivor of his or her choice to aid Rick.&#10;&#10;Rick does not start with his normal 15-card Survivor deck. Instead, he uses the 10-card Wounded Rick deck.&#10;&#10;The controlling player must use these cards efficiently to ensure Rick survives long enough to make the trip from the hospital to the nearby Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Once there, Rick will be able to recuperate and arm himself, at which point the player controlling Rick will switch out the Wounded deck for Rick&rsquo;s normal Survivor deck.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, his fellow Survivor starts the Scenario on the other side of the map&mdash;with a handful of Walkers in the way!&mdash;meaning it&rsquo;ll be hard for this Survivor to offer Rick much support at first. If this Survivor moves quickly, he or she can provide Rick with some valuable cover as he makes his way towards his gear.&#10;&#10;Getting Rick fully armed is quite an achievement, but it won&rsquo;t be enough to get him completely acclimated to the frightening new world around him. The Survivors will need to spend some time raising their Morale, which, unlike most Scenarios, starts completely depleted in &ldquo;Days Gone Bye.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Getting equipped gives the Survivor&rsquo;s a hefty Morale boost to start with, but they will still need to build their confidence by successfully evading Walkers and scavenging for Resources. If the Survivor&rsquo;s manage to get their spirits up, Rick will be ready to head out on his own, earning a victory for the Survivor team.&#10;&#10;Includes Hospital Gown Rick Figure, his 10-card &ldquo;Wounded&rdquo; Survivor Deck, 4 double-sided Map Tiles, 10 Event Cards, and a thrilling Scenario that takes you back to the very first episode of the TV series.&#10;&#10;",

In the show, she doesn't hesitate to put others before herself. Accordingly, in The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary Lori plays best as a support player, with her selfless attitude reflected in her Survivor Cards and the frequency with which she doles out Ability Tokens. Her character ability &quot;Voice of Reason&quot; allows a player with one of her ability tokens to spend it to reveal a card in their hand to the rest of the group during the Approach Planning phase. This allows for greater group coordination and can result in the Leader making a better approach choice for the group.&#10;&#10;Lori's ability tokens can prevent situations in which the leader role keeps getting passed after each turn due to defiant card choices by the rest of the group. Lori makes an excellent addition to any group and can be a clutch player when avoiding stress becomes critical during a scenario&#10;&#10;",

You were abducted to be exhibited in a traveling alien circus, but now that the ship is about to become uninhabitable, your kidnappers have simply opened the cells and fled.&#10;&#10;Kenophobia is a game of exploration and survival of 2 to 4 players with a duration of 40 minutes.&#10;Each player will lead a group of five abductees through the corridors and compartments of the ship. The objective is to drive them to some of the exit locks before they lose all air or are self-destructing. The abductees must explore the environment to find the most direct route to the center of the ship, where the vacuum suits that allow them to leave it. Along the way, they can investigate, looking in the compartments for equipment that will help them achieve their goal.&#10;They will soon discover that they are not alone. Other victims accompany them in their race for salvation. But they can not expect any help from them. Their appearance is mutually repulsive and there is also fear. The fear of the vacuum of space.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: to draw the maximum number of units equipped with a vacuum suit through one of the four locks of the ship before the air runs out (when no more exploration tiles are left) or before the ship is self-destructed (when the countdown reaches the last turn).&#10;&#10;A player can perform a maximum of two actions during his turn.&#10;Each of the 5 abductees that manages can only be activated once per turn. That is, each unit can only perform one action per turn. The units can act together or alone.&#10;An abductee activated by the player can perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     Explore box in white&#10;     Move on ship and explored shippacks&#10;     Investigate ship sticker&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Royal Conquest is largely based on an old Korean card game called Go-Stop. Match cards from you hand to those on the table and form winning combinations to score points. Call STOP once you've earned the minimum points and win the hand. Or call GO if you think you can make at least one more point before another player can make a call.&#10;&#10;Stay alert because another player may have an Action card that could stop you from winning the game. The addition of Action cards gives this game its unique gameplay.&#10;&#10;If you win a hand, you receive Gems based on number of players and how many times a &quot;GO&quot; was called. Once all the Gems are gone from the Gem pot, the player with the most Gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends because someone has passed a particular point threshold. When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;X nimmt! starts with the same premise as 6 nimmt!, but changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.&#10;&#10;All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.&#10;&#10;A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game, Do Not Die, is a tile game that focuses on managing player vitals and resources while simply trying to stay alive and find rescue.&#10;&#10;Players can build shelters, loot cabins, hunt and fish for food, even cozy up to a nice campfire. But make no mistake, the goal here is survival. Players must stay alive and find their way out, even if that means player vs. player combat.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do Not Die&quot; is fast paced and exciting with deep complexity and many available strategies. It makes all players compete against each other but also has the game itself as the primary challenger.&#10;&#10;The mechanics involved push the players forward and if they lose sight of their primary objective, survival becomes impossible. It can also be played cooperatively, eventually joining player tiles. The game even has a vast and engaging solitary mode for single player action. (Game length = 60 minutes / Players = 1-5 / Ages = 10+)&#10;&#10;This turn-based game uses Player Boards where each player manages four individual vitals; Temperature, Hunger, Thirst, &amp; Fatigue. At the end of their turn, each player adds up the HP damage associated with each vital and subtracts it from their health meter. The Health Meter starts at thirty and once the player reaches zero, they lose.&#10;&#10;The game also has a Main Game Board. The Main Game Board has Player Cards that sets the environment for each player and Weather Cards that control the weather for the day. Distributed in the Weather Deck, there are six Exposure Cards that increase the Exposure Level. This Exposure Level lowers each players vitals at the beginning of each player turn. The player must perform six actions each turn to try to counteract this effect and manage their vitals to avoid dying.&#10;&#10;There are sixty-four tiles in this game that the player uncovers by using actions to explore their surroundings. They consist of the following:&#10;&#10;Frozen Ground Tile - Used for hunting Varment for food +1&#10;Frozen Lake Tile - Used for Fishing for food +1&#10;Forest Tile - Used for hunting Small Game for food +4&#10;Mountain Tile - Used for hunting Large Game for food +6&#10;Cabin Tile - Used for looting Tools and Items&#10;Fire Tower Tile - Used for Rescue&#10;&#10;In order to gain helpful resources in the game, the player can craft things like campfires, shelters, water, and some simple tools using player actions. Other Items and Tools can be found in the game by revealing a Cabin Tile and looting it. Each player can only loot a revealed cabin once. When a cabin is looted, the player rolls one black die (for an Item Card) and two white dice (for Tool Cards). If they roll an even number, then they select the corresponding Tool or Item Cards from the decks. The goal always remains, Do Not Die.&#10;&#10;",

Designed for four players, but can be played with three players using a 'dead hand' or with five players if the dealer 'sits out'.&#10;&#10;Using a standard 52-card deck, each player is given eight cards and each turn a player must first draw a card from either the deck or the discard pile. A maximum of four cards may be laid on the table, either as a new set or connected to any existing set. At the end of the turn a player must discard a card from hand. Thus each player can make no more then two sets each game.&#10;&#10;When a player has no more cards or when the deck is depleted, the game ends and players receive penalty points for all cards in hand. These are equal to the number of spots on each card, hence the name of the game. To clarify: Ace=1, 2=2, 3=3..., jack/queen/king=10 penalty points.&#10;&#10;Additional rules: The ace is always low, so cannot go behind a king of the same suit. A player may play a double, which is extremely rare. These are exactly eight connecting cards of the same suit. The discard pile may not be spread out but the deck may be in order to know how many turns may be left.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining cards represent significant places, people, events, and social conditions during the civil war.

They take turns placing cards in increasing sequential order onto 4 central piles (one for each suit) and try to achieve their victory condition without the state collapsing (completing the black pile) or reaching peace through compromise (completing the blue pile). Special event cards can also cause the top card of a pile to be discarded, temporarily stalling progress.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Beautiful Game: TCG (Trading Card Game) is a tabletop board game incorporating an optional trading card system to introduce more player cards and tactical 'Event Cards'. It is a 2 player game that can be played for any duration, but it is recommended that players play 60 or 90 minutes, broken down into two halves.&#10;&#10;The game starts with players choosing their teams. In the Kick Off Edition, players will draft their teams face-up from the pool of players. The player cards are then assigned to a number which corresponds to a player piece on the pitch. The game is then played using the stats on the player cards and rolls of the D20 against these stats when necessary to perform certain actions such as shooting or tackling. The game is quick and fluid to play and involves no measuring of distances other than counting spaces on the pitch.&#10;&#10;Extra tactics and gameplay elements are introduced to the game via 'Event Cards' &ndash; a 50 card (minimum) deck of cards that can help you or hinder your opponent. The Kick Off Edition features pre-constructed Event Card decks.&#10;&#10;When playing the game, the player in possession of the ball (the attacking player) leads play but the defending player is still heavily involved in influencing how the attacker can play. The defending player chooses to try mark attackers and can play Event cards to hinder their chances in order to try win back possession.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who has scored the most goals at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you be the Archmage&rsquo;s favourite by conjuring the most powerful mythical creatures? Use their unique abilities to bolster your magical powers or hinder your enemies in this game of luck, strategy, magic, and creatures of legend.&#10;&#10;Trick or Treat sees 30 brand new cards that focus on &quot;take that&quot; mechanics and the addition of Gloom creatures. It also contains all the reworked and play tested Halloween expansion cards, which were requested the fans!&#10;&#10;The Gloom cards are a deck of cards which are shuffled and three are dealt to the table. Anyone can Conjure these cards and use them to their advantage. Each one has powerful endgame changing effects - some modify the VP of Burned creatures while others have wholly more malevolent powers designed to allow you to put those Archmage cards to good use! But be warned, the power of Gloom is powerful and unpredictable and it can easily be a double-edged sword. Gloom magic is recommended for advanced Ember players.&#10;&#10;The creatures you collect will allow you to mitigate the &ldquo;luck of the draw&rdquo; and to further your chances of conjuring more powerful creatures (by drawing more cards that you need or stripping your enemies of their creatures' powers). Trick or Treat capitalizes on that giving you even more chances to attack your enemies, to weaken their creatures and to strengthen your hold over the game. It's all out war in the Halloween expansion!&#10;&#10;&#10;     It's got a slew of new art by a fabulous all-female art team.&#10;     It's all about the endgame. Now you can really shake things up with a single Archmage card.&#10;     It makes the final score that bit more uncertain. Now you can manipulate the final VPs of Burned creatures. If that wasn't enough, some of the new creatures are reactionary: when a player does something - you get to do something. It means you can wield absolute power in each game, BUT you might pay a high price for such blatant use of magic. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vanquisher is a game of abstract territorial control, engine building, and city building. Players take on the role of kings competing to fill newly discovered land with their own buildings, while trying to block others from doing the same. Each player will use resources, bribe officials, and send armies in order to create the dominant kingdom and claim the land as their own.&#10;&#10;In Vanquisher, players will take turns performing actions and constructing buildings in a limited map area. The area consists of a grid, where players will place their newly constructed buildings. But careful planning is essential, since buildings can only be constructed without them touching, a specification that can be used to a player&rsquo;s advantage. Each constructed building will also give a special benefit to the player which they can use throughout the game to assist them in collecting resources, using army tokens to block other players, and allow them to use additional actions during their turns. A player can additionally use actions to bribe officials, which take form of cards that will assist them in creating a more efficient engine to claim the most land.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 12 rounds, and players get points from territorial control, and bonus points for achievements, money, and certain buildings.&#10;&#10;This game was made available as a free Print and Play by Ngb Designs.&#10;&#10;From the Game:&#10;In a realm much like our own, Kings search for undiscovered territory to expand their kingdom. News has spread of new land found far across the mountains, and Kings now rush to claim it as their own and vanquish others along the way.&#10;Vanquisher is a strategic kingdom building game. Players take turns constructing buildings, growing their armies, and bribing officials in order to spread their influence on the unclaimed territory. It is up to the players to manage their resources to help grow their kingdom, and stop others from growing theirs.&#10;&#10;",

Their tokens go into a bag that is drawn and played from on each Player Turn. Then, players select a Guild to represent, and take turns drafting their Agents, Items, Scrolls and anything else useful for the Game. This creates their personal inventory to create their dice pool as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will increase their Agents and Inventory's power and influence in the game. Each die bought makes your Guilds ability to resolve threats, respond to morale loss and fight the horrors of the dark! Players dice are bought from the cards they drafted at the beginning of the game as well as a few public Agents players can recruit from.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a player's turn, they pull a token from the Threat Bag and add it to the city space furthest from Wayword. As each city space fills up, threats begin flooding closer and closer to the city of Wayword. Along the way, Civilians may be injured, cities and locations may be destroyed but the real threat comes from foes reaching Wayword. If Wayword collapses, all the players lose. The Threat Bag also includes the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, who may get so fed up with his Troop's ineffectiveness, that they show up to cause their own brand of trouble! On top of all of that, the variable Scenarios in game may affect any aspect of play, from doubling Threat Bag draws to letting threats and foes move further towards Wayword but faster.&#10;&#10;As Guilds build up their Agents and Inventory, they will defeat these baddies, stop these threats and rescue these Villagers. All of these things are worth Popularity Points (Victory Points) from the people of Wayword. If players confront and defeat the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, the game comes to an end and Wayword can rest easier!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For decades our planet has been monitored by alien species. Worried by recent events, enormous alien spaceships are sent towards earth. Announcing they come to save us from our self-inflicted fate, people rush to get on-board the spaceships. But the aliens will only let the smart people on-board, leaving the less gifted behind. Most of the leaders get in, but some didn&rsquo;t make the cut, for more or less obvious reasons.&#10;&#10;In World Dumbination you play as these five leaders that didn't make it on-board. You can choose to play as the leader of USA, Venezuela, Turkey, and Russia &ndash; or, of course, North Korea! It&rsquo;s never been easier to conquer the world. Will you make it to world domination, will you all destroy the planet in a nuclear super-shower, or will you collectively achieve world peace!&#10;&#10;World Dumbination is a fun asymmetric strategy game for 2 to 5 players. The game was inspired by world leaders arguing like small children sitting in a sandpit, and that is the idea for the cover art.&#10;&#10;Even if there are a lot of military leaders remaining, you need to build your military forces from scratch. Reaching your first goal makes you able to draw stronger cards. Each nation has two first goals option and the goals are different for each nation.&#10;&#10;Find the best strategy to move your forces and build military bases (that decide the strength of your units). The players choose and place cards to reveal them all at the same time. Play action cards to attack your opponents to gain victory points, or play project cards to get some advantages as well as victory points.&#10;&#10;You also have to constantly watch your ego and popularity levels that you can control with card actions. With too little self-esteem you don&rsquo;t dare to do any action. Too much ego makes you crazy and focused on only one target (you have to almost be crazy to use the nuclear bomb). If you get to unpopular, you as a leader can be overthrow by your own government. Getting very popular increases you income since your people work harder for you.&#10;&#10;There are geniuses (those who wouldn&rsquo;t get on the spaceships) still hiding on Earth. Finding one or two of them would also help you in your quest for world domination. You can also find things that the aliens left behind.&#10;&#10;In case the players get too clever, there are Dumbness cards in the mix to make sure some kind of stupidity will take place. Will anyone win the Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe some briefcases with secret codes got mix up during the last world meeting, or will the bombs fly uncontrollable around since none of the leaders have any knowledge of geography!&#10;&#10;You win by having the most victory points in the end. The game ends when a player has reached 15 victory points, or when 4 nuclear bombs has been disarmed and removed from the game. Yes, this is a war game you can win by making world peace! You will also find a party alien, fake news, reality shows, abandoned spaceships and cute kittens threatening to start a nuclear war in this game!&#10;&#10;There are some interesting new mechanics in the game, but the main thing in this game is the fun factor! This game is designed for a lot of interaction between players and the surprisingly events that shows up add a great deal to the silliness. And the more players, the more fun!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kartoffelkrieg is a light-weight family-friendly &quot;potato war-game&quot; using real potatoes equipped with plastic miniature parts and weapons. The game can be played virtually anywhere, including non-flat surfaces.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players take turns drawing and choosing part boards with which to equip their potatoes, resulting in asymmetric character setup. Parts include treads, legs, shields, power supplies, guns, cannons, and other weapons with various abilities.&#10;&#10;After choosing their parts, players then insert the corresponding miniature pieces into physical potatoes, and place them on the table as specified according to the number of players. Players set up their control boards, assign each part board strategically to the control board, and set all parts and potatoes to maximum power and zero damage.&#10;&#10;During a game, players take turns using the power their potatoes produce to perform various actions with their parts. For example, a potato could use power to use their treads and move or ram another player. Alternatively, they could fire off one of their weapons, and attempt to damage another player.&#10;&#10;Each part is different, has different power requirements, ranges, abilities, accuracy, and damage that it can give or take. Some parts require dice rolling to determine the hit location and damage amount. Players can continue using their parts for various actions, until their power reaches zero. At that point, their turn is over. Their power will reset on the subsequent turn.&#10;&#10;When a part reaches maximum damage, the attacking player who caused that damage, removes the part from the potato, and keeps it as a victory point. The defending player removes the part board from their control board. That section of the control board is now unprotected, meaning that future damage to that location can now directly hurt the potato/control board.&#10;&#10;When any one person reaches maximum damage on their player board, the game ends immediately. The winner is the person who destroyed the most parts and has the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Players may draw random chits from a Control Pool, which gives them a chance to assume secret control of a unit (Civilian, Paramilitary or Military), or deliberately choose from a selection of Action Chits which allow them to investigate, infiltrate, neutralize or block what other players are doing.&#10;&#10;The second, Coup phase, begins once one player declares a coup d'etat. Each turn represents one to several hours, as gameplay changes from secret plotting to open, active warfare. Players choose sides and maneuver and fight for control of vital points on an area-movement map of Santiago, capital of a Chile in chaos.&#10;&#10;The true winner of the game is not obvious until its very end, when players reveal their hidden agendas and score according to the plans they had all along!&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;105 counters including 44 units, chits to Control them, and Action Chits to play&#10;A 18&Prime; x 12&Prime; area movement map of downtown Santiago as it appeared in 1973&#10;Rulebook and storage bag&#10;&#10;Players: Two to four or more (maximum limited only by number of players available)&#10;Duration: 45 to 90 Minutes&#10;Complexity: Medium-Low&#10;&#10;",

Once a chicken is cooped it is safe and cannot be stolen by a raging chicken or rooster. Most of the time you will only be able to coop chickens of the same color but using the dog card once per game, a player can ignore the same color rule. This comes in handy when you want to save a fat chicken. The game will continue until the deck is gone and all cards are out of player's hands. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to a great game of match fishing for those times when you can't get to the waterside. It's very simple to play, with any number of people, and everyone has the chance to be a match winner.&#10;&#10;In Match Fishing Dice, each player begins by rolling the &quot;Peg&quot; die to determine if their final score will be doubled, halved, or left as is. Then players take turns rolling the other colored dice in a set sequence to determine the daily fishing conditions, whether their cast was successful or not, which species of fish was caught (if successful), and how many pounds (victory points) were reeled in. Each set of 6 unique fish a player catches will earn a bonus of 10 pounds. After a minimum of 15 rounds, players tally their total pounds caught, adding any set bonuses, and then doubling or halving their score if necessary based on their initial Peg roll. The winner is the player with the highest score.&#10;&#10;",

After Binh Gia the enemy realized that they would lose to us.&rdquo; ---Le Duan, Communist Party Secretary in Hanoi about the significance of the battle of Binh Gia.&#10;&#10;Following the disastrous 1963 battle of Ap Bac, more military equipment and advisors were sent by the United States to the Republic of South Vietnam in the hopes that better armaments and training could defeat the obviously growing strength of the Communist forces in that embattled country. The Battle of Binh Gia was the first major test of the effects of the escalating US presence in South Vietnam, and its outcome had a telling effect on the US role in the conflict.
