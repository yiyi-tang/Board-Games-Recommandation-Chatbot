With such a dynamic board, you may only be able to move a few tiles on one turn, while on another turn you might be able to cross the entire board!&#10;&#10;Win by collecting points scattered around the board and getting the highest score before making your way back to home base. Each roll of the die creates strategic opportunities to make a path to victory or impede your opponents. For example, you may be able to rotate one or two tiles and open a path to more points or break up the path of your opponent, add a blocking piece anywhere on the board to prevent your opponent from reaching his destination, or trade places with another player to get out of a bind and race to your goal.&#10;&#10;Tile Twist: it's a strategic game for family and friends...with a twist!&#10;&#10;",

The President keeps all the Key Cards and then shuffles and deals out the remaining cards. Step 3 in the rules for this game has a printing error; it says 6 countries are distributed to the players when it is meant to say '6 counters'. In a turn, a player may ask each player in turn, for a card from a certain country. If someone offers an incorrect card, that player has to add a counter to the Pool. If a correct card is offered, that player takes a counter from the Pool. When all the sets have been collected, the winner is the one with the most counters.&#10;&#10;",

The player who has the House Card in his hand starts. If he has a number one card of any set, he lays it on the table. The next player must play a number two card of that set. The next player number 3, and so on. If you cannot play the required card then you have to pass. When all nine cards of that group have been played, a new set is started, and so on. The first player to play all of their cards, wins.&#10;Each card has the name of an object in French and English, plus the name where you might find the object, again in two languages.&#10;&#10;",

White plays with the white stones and makes the first move, Black plays with the black stones. On his turn, a player may choose either a) to place a stone on the board without contact to other stones of his color in order to start a new group, or b) to grow all possible groups by one stone. Stones touching two groups count as growing both groups. However, if two groups are grown by one stone each and only the two newly grown stones touch, then the move is legal.&#10;&#10;For balancing, there is an extra rule: Black is allowed to grow all his groups and place a single stone as long as neither player has not yet grown any groups.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is filled in. The score is determined by the number of stones each player has on the board minus 'P' times the number of groups he has, where 'P' is en even number of 4 or higher. With an even penalty and an odd boardsize, draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;Symple is played on a square board, normally the 19x19 goban.

Hence, it does not focus on individual bouts (even though hundreds of fights are simulated during the game), but on the whole of a rikishi's (sumo wrestler) career.&#10;&#10;There are 12 rikishi in the game, but only a small number of those are player-controled; the others are 'automated', i.e. controled by the game. The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.&#10;&#10;After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice. Rikishi can try to influence the match tactic such that it matches their strongest skills (or the opponent's weaknesses).&#10;&#10;After the basho the banzuke (ranking) is adjusted, rikishi age one year, and some retire (forcibly or voluntarily).&#10;&#10;Playing one game year takes about 45 to 60 minutes, most of which is taken up by the tournament. Consequently, simulating a 10-year sumo career will take up to 10 hours. It is, however, easy to store away the game in between years, and thus to play the game in many different sessions spread out over a longer period of time.&#10;&#10;",

The four services are The Royal Navy, The Army, The Royal Air Force, and The Women's Auxiliary Territorial Services.&#10;Deal out all the cards after shuffling. Each player does not look at their cards but makes a face-down pile in front of him. At the start players turn over their top card as fast as they can. Any number 1 card is placed in the middle of the table. From then on, you can earn 'Promotion' by playing a number 2 card of the same suit, then a number 3 card, and so on. The cards in the middle must be the right service to gain 'promotion', but you can also discard a card on any other player's face-up pack, obeying the promotion rule of the next highest card, but as it is not promoting a card in the middle of the table, any promotion card, regardless of suit can be played.&#10;Play should be fast, because there are many penalty card laws and the rules say &quot;The fun of the game relies on penalties being enforced&quot;.&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards is the winner.&#10;The cards feature the insignia of rank in each of the four services. There is also a number in the corner of the cards so if you do not know the ranking, you can just remember to play the next higher card in that service. &#10;The box exhorts players &quot;Learn to spot the ranks&quot;.&#10;This is a patriotic game in that players, especially children, were very interested in all things military. I would date the game as 1918 because the RAF (Royal Air Force) didn't exist before April that year. Previously it was the RFC (Royal Flying Corps)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Card game with 48 cards in four suits of 12. Cards are played with the aim to acheive a total divisible by 4.&#10;The suits are;&#10;S = Subtraction&#10;A = Addition&#10;M = Multiplication&#10;SAM = any of the above&#10;The last card played is all that affects the current card being played. For example; The first card played (which cannot score points) is a 3. The next player could play an A5 (A for Addition) he adds 5 to 3 to make 8. This is two 'Fours' made, score two points. The next player could play S4. 4 from 8 = 4, so one 'Four' created, scores 1 point. Next player plays a SAM 8. He scores 3 points for Additions (8 + 4 = 12, so 3 Fours made) but as it is a Sam card he can also score for Multiplication (4 x 8 = 32, so 8 points scored). In this example, Subtraction would score nothing. You can see that SAM cards are very valuable.&#10;The first player to score 100 points, wins.&#10;The rules refer to the cards as 'Blocks' and the intention was to make a more substantial version with the cards being replaced as tiles (called Blocks) but this never happened, possibly because The Great War started and materials were limited because of the war effort in industry.&#10;&#10;",

Players can influence neutral countries, launch nuclear missile strikes, fly air combat missions, and attack with ground units to take control of the other side's countries and resources to force the enemy into surrender. Combat system works best with D12, but optional rules are included for a D6 system. The game is over when the victory conditions are met.

Players sit opposite each other&#10;2. Remove coins from bottom of box (undernearth plastic tray).  Place coins at random, (in full view of both players) one under each of 10 &quot;money bags&quot; (2 bags will remain empty).&#10;3. Dealer shuffles the small Coin Selection Cards (those depicting the actual coins used in the game) and deals five to himself and five to his opponent, alternating and FACE UP. During the subsequent play of the game, each player will try to obtain as many of the coins shown on his small cards as possible. Obviously, this combination of coins will change with each game.&#10;4. Dealer shuffles the Playing Cards and deals five cards to himself and five cards to his opponent, alternating, and FACE DOWN.  The remaining cards are placed faced down in the DRAW tray.&#10;5. Players pick up the five playing cards. The dealer draws a card and must then play a card from his hand either in front of him to count toward his score, or into the discard tray. At no time after playing a card may a player have more than five cards remaining in his hand.&#10;6. If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then &quot;search&quot; for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the &quot;money bags&quot; and declaring, for example &quot;the Turkish kurus is in this bag.&quot; He then lifts the &quot;bag&quot; and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the &quot;bag&quot;, he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the &quot;money bag&quot;.  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.&#10;7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.&#10;8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.&#10;9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.&#10;10. If the &quot;Draw&quot; tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the &quot;discard&quot; tray and continue play.&#10;&#10;WHO WINS:&#10;The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards. Actual coins from COIN CARDS count $20,000 each.  The COIN CARDS count $2,000 or $5,000 according to their face value.&#10;&#10;",

The game may take a simpler or more demanding form depending on whether the cards are played face-up or face-down, or whether all the cards or only part of them are used.&#10;&#10;The tasks and answer cards are used to calculate across the multiplication table. Players must match pairs where one tile of the pair has the multiplication equation and the second tile the result. Since several task cards can often fit one solution, there are many possible combinations. Whoever has the most pairs at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;120 cards (60 tasks - 60 solutions)&#10;One strip with letters A-K&#10;One strip with numbers 1-10&#10;How to play instructions&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SIX D SIX is a set of six strategic board games playable with dice. All six games were designed to rely on luck as little as possible in their outcomes. In most cases, the &quot;randomness&quot; of the die-rolling is used to set-up the game, but does not influence who will win.&#10;&#10;All that is needed to play are 36 six-sided dice in six different (non-black) colors, and an additional 36 six-sided black dice (for most of the games). One also requires a chessboard, and some require keeping score with pen and paper.&#10;&#10;SIX D &quot;ONE&quot;: A tactical game that allows each player to get creative and &quot;make&quot; a gameboard to stump the other players. Play consists of claiming a spot on the gameboard each turn, scoring for pip count and connections with other claimed spots.&#10;SIX D &quot;TWO&quot;: Roll a big pile of dice and take turns removing two dice of the same color. When all the dice have been removed, or there are no more matches left, whoever has the most pips showing on all the dice they've removed is the winner! &#10;SIX D &quot;THREE&quot;: Relying the most on luck of any of these games, the gameboard consists of a 6x6 grid of randomly rolled black dice. Players draw a &quot;hand&quot; of three dice (which they roll), and can play them on the gameboard in any space matching the pip count shown. Points are scored for matching adjacent die in color or pip count.&#10;SIX D &quot;FOUR&quot;: A &quot;pure&quot; abstract strategy game, played on a chess board, where you'll need to capture your own pieces in order to capture the black pieces that ensure victory.&#10;SIX D &quot;FIVE&quot;: A simple but strategic dice stacking game for 3 to 6 players. Place your dice matching the dice already in play. You'll need to think in three dimensions for this one! &#10;SIX D &quot;SIX&quot;: A game that involves identifying rows and columns on the gameboard consisting of &quot;same color, different pip count&quot;, or &quot;different color, same pip count&quot;. Players will place the pieces they identify into a personal play area, scoring points as they do.&#10;&#10;The complete rules for each game are available in this PDF: http://chesstris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6D6.pdf&#10;&#10;",

An all-out panic among the archivists is necessary to get their records current! This task is not easy to perform in a hurry because the system of classification mixes different types of numbering!&#10;&#10;Players play the role of archivists struggling to clean up their offices and file all of their patent documents (cards) in the Central Archives before the impending General Inspection. Play happens simultaneously and as fast as possible, where players must move, with one hand, cards one at a time from their hand or from the top of a small number of piles in front of them, to the Central Archive, a common play area among all players.&#10;&#10;In order to properly file away patents in the Central Archives, a &quot;1&quot; patent may be played on the table, but any other patent must be played atop an existing pile whose patent number is one rank lower than the card being played (a &quot;2&quot; must be played on a &quot;1&quot;, a &quot;3&quot; must be played on a &quot;2&quot; and so on). The trick is that a patent may have an Arabic numeral, a Roman numeral, or a written-out number (e.g. &quot;6&quot;, &quot;VI&quot;, or &quot;Six&quot;), which are all treated interchangeably.&#10;&#10;Once any &quot;10&quot; is filed in the Central Archive, play pauses and an Event card is resolved.&#10;&#10;The game is over when a player has filed all his patents or when no player can file any more patents.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has their own secret hand of cards and tickets, in addition to some cards and tickets being placed in a shared cardholder that either player on the team can access.&#10;&#10;When a player draws cards, they must place one card in the cardholder and the other in their hand (unless they takes a face-up locomotive, in which case it must be shared); when a player draws tickets, the first ticket kept must be placed in the cardholder and any additional tickets kept added to their hand. A player can spend their turn to add two tickets from their hand to the cardholder. A team's points are tracked collectively, and the team with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&bull; Legendary Asia from Fran&ccedil;ois Valentyne &ndash; The main change in this set-up is that some of the routes through Asia are labeled mountain routes, with one or more spaces on the route bearing an X. Whenever a player claims one of these routes, their must place a train from their reserve in the Mountain Crossing area of the game board, earning two points for each such train but losing access to them for the rest of the game. The player who connects to the most cities in a single network earns a ten point &quot;Asian Explorer&quot; bonus.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe is required to use the maps in this expansion. Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;",

Moon's Ticket to Ride, with each expansion including a double-sided game board and destination tickets and rules for those locations.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride Map Collection 2: India &amp; Switzerland presents players with two scenarios:&#10;&#10;&bull; India from Ian Vincent &ndash; On this game board for 2-4 players, in addition to scoring points for claiming routes and completing tickets, a player can also score points in two other ways. First, the player with the longest continuous path of trains receives a ten point bonus. Second, each player scores bonus points for connecting the cities on one or more tickets with two distinct routes. The first two such tickets earn five additional points each, and the next three earn ten points each for a maximum bonus of 40 points.&#10;&#10;&bull; Switzerland from Alan R. Moon &ndash; This is a reprint of Ticket to Ride: Switzerland, first published in 2007. This game board is for 2-3 players only. Instead of connecting only cities, some destination tickets connect a city to a country or one country to any of those surrounding Switzerland; a player who completes such a ticket scores the highest point value for which they qualify. Unlike most other TtR games, discarded tickets are removed from the game instead of being returned to the ticket deck. Also, Locomotives can be used only to build tunnels.&#10;&#10;Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;",

You begin in an ancient Castle, which represents the 9 steps of brewing your Transmogrification Potion. While you race through the halls to complete your concoction, the bewitched game board works against you by counting down precious hours. Each revolution (as it passes the 24 hour mark), your grades are collectively lowered one level, and continue to spiral downwards towards &ldquo;Failure&rdquo; the longer you take. You must split your actions between moving through the 9 steps of your potion (the further you get, the faster time counts), casting basic spells (powerful, but they can harm you), rewinding time (strategically use this to gain grades back) and fighting Cryptids (a selfish action testing the strength of your Potion and thus raising your individual grade). Roll the dice, move your markers, and choose an action. Work together to complete this dastardly exam, but only one student will prevail, leaving with the knowledge that could save you all. Will it be you?&#10;&#10;x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x&#10;&#10;Finally, there is a bonus educational element to the game.

The game offers 15 different Imps with various abilities that will trigger at different points of the round.  Each of these Imps come in 6 different colors to support the different teams and there is often a pregame draft to pick which Imps are included in the game.  The crate deck is also customized with a mixture of points and traps.&#10;&#10;Each round has 5 phases which will determine when Imp abilities will trigger and how the round is resolved.&#10;Phase 1- Send Imps: Each player sends an Imp of their choice from their hand to the battle.  If the card is sent face it, this means their ability will trigger.  Sent face down, their identity is unknown so their strength can be bluffed.&#10;Phase 2- Reveal Imps:  Imps that were sent facedown are revealed and any Imps that are matching in strength are sent home immediately.&#10;Phase 3- Ability Phase:  Several Imps have abilities that will trigger right before the center crate is smashed.&#10;Phase 4- Smash Crate:  The top crate card is revealed and resolved.  If the card is a puppy, players put this card in their score pile.  If the card is a bomb, the Imp who smashed the crate is killed.  There are a number of other traps that could trigger as well, including Ninja Kittens and Mega Bombs.&#10;Phase 5- Cleanup Phase: Players pull any Imps in the Infirmary into their hands and the Imps used that round enter the infirmary.&#10;&#10;This continues until the Last Round Puppy is revealed and players count the number of points in their score piles.  Ties are broken by the person who smashed the most puppies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "200 Steps to Freedom is an educational trivia game based on the American Revolution.  The game was published by American Way Games and &quot;copyright&quot; in 1776 (but published in 1977).&#10;&#10;The gameboard has two different paths, either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  At the start of the game, the players decide if they would like to play either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  All player tokens are then placed at the start of this path.  Each player in turn will roll the die and move the number of spaces on the die.    The 100 Days path has 100 different dates on the spaces, while the 100 people has 100 different people listed on the path.  The player then must state one or more facts about the person or the date that they landed on, and if they are correct then they would get a point.  For example, if they land on December 14, 1782, the player would get a point if they state that The British pulled out of Charleston South Carolina.  Once all players finish the selected path then all of the player pawns are then placed back at the start for phase two, the Question phase.  The players then move around the track again, only this time when they land on a space they get to answer a multiple choice question from the book that corresponds to their space that they landed on.   Every correct answer gets one point.   Once all players cross the finish line of the question phase then the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The German Army, over-committed and under-equipped, was soundly defeated; thousands of its troops, in addition to much of their equipment, were captured in the Falaise pocket. In short, the offensive worked, but that doesn't do justice to the blood spilled and courage shown during the six-week battle. As with any battle, the whole is made up of an uncountable number of skirmishes, clashes and firefights. Fourteen such events make up the scenarios of White Star Rising: Operation Cobra.&#10;&#10;White Star Rising: Operation Cobra is an expansion for the game White Star Rising in the Nations at War series. This expansion focuses on the events surrounding the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead in July-August 1944. Operation Cobra adds the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish to the Nations at War series in addition to new units for the Americans, the British, and the Germans.&#10;&#10;White Star Rising: Operation Cobra comes with nine stand-alone scenarios, focusing on events near Falaise, as the Germans tried to escape the converging allied armies. Among the topics are the Polish stand on Mont Ormel Ridge and Canadian efforts to capture the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives. Operation Cobra also contains a five scenario linked campaign following the breakout of American armored units during Operation Cobra near the end of July 1944.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;126 Counters&#10;Nine Scenarios&#10;One Campaign&#10;&#10;White Star Rising: Operation Cobra is not a stand-alone game, you will need White Star Rising first or second edition to play it.&#10;&#10;Expands Nations at War: White Star Rising&#10;&#10;Other Games in Series:&#10;&#10;    Nations at War: Desert Heat&#10;    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Airborne&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Operation Cobra&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The experimental shroom collectors evaluate useful shrooms by tasting them. However, tasting the wrong shrooms could lead you to hospital at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game play is mostly memory driven but very challenging. During the game, players exchange the location of known shrooms with other players for their info on known shrooms while trying to memorize the current locations of the shrooms they are tracking. As soon as a player thinks he knows where to find a good set of shrooms, he starts to collect and taste them. Successful tasting makes the collector feel better (positive points), but tasting unknown shroom causes damage (negative points). If the player has less than zero points at the end of the game, he is considered to be sick.&#10;&#10;",

But beware, as there is a black hole that will mysteriously spiral your work into the vortex, and Space Hubs that will intercept your journey...for better or for worse!&#10;&#10;In Pulsar, outer space is the limit. Playability is endless as 24 Galaxy cards (including Stars, Planets, and Space Hubs) are randomly laid out in 5 x 5 grid to create the board around the central Black Hole. Sample/Concentrate cards are stacked on their respective Planets, and Hub cards are divided and placed on the Space Hubs, triggered when a scientist must stop at one. Rockets soar around space in movement patterns designated by a Vector Die roll, building warp speed, and by manipulation if in another rocket&rsquo;s path. The goal is to land on the Planets, initiating the serum-development process. Each scientist also has his/her own special forte, determined by the random dealing of Character cards at the start of each game.&#10;&#10;Space can be an awfully big place! A team-play variant allows scientists to work together, combining their character powers and using the bump-and-go rocket system to propel each other around the galaxy.&#10;&#10;",

In order to pass, they have to find the correct island and then grab a pirate ship as quickly as possible. If you correctly add up the numbers on the die and are the first to find the matching number of treasure holes on the islands, you win the most precious jewels and become master pirate.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;All players try to pass the pirate exam simultaneously. The hunt for jewels starts as soon as the two dice have been thrown. The sum of the numbers on the dice tells the players which island they have to find. Each island (cardboard square) consists of two halves. Each island half has 0 to 6 &quot;treasure holes&quot; on the underside which can be felt by touch. All players try to find and put together an island with the same number of holes as the sum of the numbers on the dice. They are not allowed to look at the holes - they have to count by touch only. As soon as a player thinks they have the correct island, they grab a pirate ship. There is always one ship fewer than there are players, and the ships are in different colors. The first player who thinks they have an island with the correct number of holes grabs the red ship, the second one the blue ship, and the third one the green ship. When the last ship has been claimed, the round ends and the number of holes on the islands are counted. If the number is correct, the player earns a jewel in the color of the ship. If not, the ship is passed on to the next player. The jewels are worth a different number of points (red = worth most), and the player with the most precious jewels (= player with the most points) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest and emerged at Sedan. Alarmed at the prospect of a German breakout here, and the collapsing defense at Sedan, the French ordered an immediate counter-attack. General Heinz Guderian, however, had already ordered the bulk of the German panzer formations to breakout from the Sedan bridgehead, and ordered the Gross Deutchland Regiment, with a supporting Kampfgruppe formed from the 8th Panzer Division to take and hold the high ground at Stonne, to guard the German's bridgehead over the Meuse River and expanding flank. For the first, and only, time during the 1940 campaign, Guderian's Panzers ran into the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, as the French counter attacked to reduce the Sedan bridgehead.  Over three days, the town of Stonne changed hands 17 times as German and French armored forces dueled for the strategic high-ground overlooking Sedan.&#10;&#10;This is the fifth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series, covering the battle at an operational scale. The game is designed for 2 players, taking on the roles of the French and German commanders, but is suitable for solitaire play as well.&#10;&#10;The High Flying Dice Games edition features all new graphics by Bruce Yearian.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&#10;Hex: 1/2 miles / 0.8 kilometer&#10;Units: Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 11x17&quot; full color map &#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (180 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&#10;One 6-page rulebook&#10;Two Player Aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&#10;&#10;",

This too uses written orders, submitted to a moderator who creates the game map (a sample is provided) and adjudicates. Players can build factories and conduct research to improve their technology in various areas. Optional rules allow for players to create their own ship designs.&#10;&#10;",
