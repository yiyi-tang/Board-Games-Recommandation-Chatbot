    "Description": "The Game of the Snake is an adaptation of the Game of the Goose Game of Goose. It is a simple roll and move game played with two dice, with spaces that cause you to move back, lose a turn, etc. If one reads the rules which are printed on the game board, there is also an element of gambling as well as elements of an early party or drinking game.&#10;&#10;The game starts by the players agreeing on &quot;what to play for,&quot; &quot;which is to be lay'd down and then you must throw who shall play first.&quot; Some spaces require the player to put up an additional wager: &quot;He that throws upon 38 must feast with Cupid paying his share, that is, as much as he stak'd down first, and must remain there till his Companions have play'd once about.&quot; If you land on space 30 you have to wash yourself in the fountain &quot;until dispac'd by some other.&quot; If you land on 59, the bottle space, the player is &quot;to drink a Glass and pay a stake till his turn comes to throw again.&quot;&#10;&#10;The earliest known version was published in Antwerp, ca. 1620, by Pieter de Jode as &quot;El Juego Real de Cupido&quot;.  A copy of this version, published for the Spanish market, can be seen in the British Library (ref: Maps * 999(1) See also: https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-of-cupid-a-17th-century-board-game). A French translation was published in Paris, ca. 1640, by the widow of Charles Petit as &quot;Jeu Royal de Cupidon&quot; (private collection http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240 ) and a version was published in Amsterdam, ca. 1625&ndash;1640, by Claes Jansz. Visscher. This version, &quot;Het Nieuw slange Spel anders Genaemt Koninclycke Tytkorting van Cupido&quot; (&quot;The New Snake Game, otherwise known as the Royal Pastime of Cupid&quot;), introduced the peasant dance as the central motif, which was reproduced in some later English editions. A copy can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369).&#10;&#10;The earliest known British edition was published ca. 1690&ndash;1700 by John Garrett at his shop &quot;next the stayres of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill&quot;, London, with the peasant dance motif. A copy of the Garrett edition is included in the George Clarke print collection, Worcester College, Oxford (http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html).&#10;&#10;William Dicey published an edition ca. 1736&ndash;40 from his press in Bow Churchyard, London, using the same design. An example of the Dicey edition can be found in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library [where it is incorrectly dated &quot;1794&quot;]: (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-4276-a090-cc2b2851ffba).&#10;&#10;A different design was employed in the edition published by Laurie &amp; Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, London, in 1794. The central motif shows cupid sharpening his arrow. A copy of the Laurie &amp; Whittle edition is included in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0a-9055-f3418ff9dd94). This edition was published in a later state by R. H. Laurie (Laurie's son) ca. 1850. An example can be found in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A E.1747-1754 http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-of-cupid-board-game-r-h-laurie/). James Lumsden &amp; Son of Glasgow also used this design in an edition published ca. 1810&ndash;1830. A copy of the Lumsden edition is also included in the John Johnson ephemera collection (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a0-93e4-631277631bef).&#10;&#10;A third design was used by the Bowles family. The first Bowles edition was published by Carington Bowles, St Paul's Churchyard, London. The game is included in Carington Bowles's &quot;New &amp; Enlarged Catalogue&quot; published in 1784, so we can estimate a similar publication date for the game (it is not included in the earlier Bowles catalogue, published by John Bowles &amp; Son, in 1753). A later state of this edition was issued Carington Bowles's son, Henry Carington Bowles, who traded from the St Paul's Churchyard address as Bowles &amp; Carver between 1793 and 1830.&#10;&#10;While the coiled serpent design is reminiscent of the ancient Egytptian game  Mehen, there is no evidence of any relation between the two other than the spiral track.  The same can be said of the relation between this game, as well as of Mehen and the Game of Goose being related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game. We are sure, however, that &quot;The Royal Pastime of Cupid, or Entertaining Game of the Snake&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

So you and up to three of your friends take to the fields in search of treasures. What will you find? Trash or Treasure??&#10;&#10;In this free to print and play board game for two to four players, you grab your Beginner's Detector and a Small Shovel and search a field for hidden treasures like coins, rings and artefacts. But beware, there is not only treasure to be unearthed, but also useless trash. For each treasure you add to your collection, you score one Victory Point. You may sell off Treasure from your Collection to buy new equipment, like better detectors and shovels. For every two pieces of Trash in your Garbage Bin, your VP Score is reduced by one. Whoever reaches 10 Victory Points first is the winner (in a 2 players game - if there are 3 players, you need 7 VPs to win, if there are 4 players, you need only 5 VPs).

The basic game mechanics are simple and easy to learn with the aim of being able to play large games within a reasonable time frame.&#10;&#10;The mechanics use a fairly standard D6 system for table top games with both sides taking their actions in phases - either alternate for movement or simultaneous for firing, morale and melee.  Units can represent anything from battalions to brigades and are made up of a number of stands.  As losses are taken stands of figures are removed and the unit is forced to take morale tests, multiple failures remove the entire unit.&#10;&#10;The rules are broken down into basic and optional rules - at the most basic level the game is fast and simple, the optional rules add more detail and realism but also add more time to the game play.&#10;&#10;",

The players set a mark at some distance from the pins where they will stand when rolling the ball. Each player bowls both balls, tallies the the score, replaces the pins and passes the balls to the next player in turn. Players continue to knock down pins until someone wins by scoring 31 points. If a player goes over 31 points, that player must continue to take turns until he or she knocks down all the ninepins in one turn, to win the game.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Ninepins is a solid wood game with pins standing 5&quot; in height and balls 2&quot; in diameter.

Each player selects a group of like-colored pieces and gathers his pieces to his position.&#10;&#10;2. The group picks a Starter who begins the hand by placing one of his pieces near the center of a table or a flat playing area.  After the first hand, the winner of each hand may be the Starter for the next hand. Action then continues around the playing area to the Starter's left, with each player placing one of his pieces on the playing area.&#10;&#10;3. EACH PIECE THAT IS PLACED ON THE TABLE OR PLAYING AREA MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE COMPLETE SIDE TOUCHING ONE COMPLETE SIDE OF AT LEAST ONE OTHER PIECE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYED!&#10;&#10;4. A player may place a piece next to any other piece, thus blocking the other players' attempts to win.&#10;&#10;5. Players may warn each other that someone is about to win, but the game is especially exciting if the players agree not to warn each other.&#10;&#10;6. The first person to win 5 hands wins the game.  If the group wishes, a time limit may be set, and the player who wins the most hands in that time wins the game.&#10;&#10;7. If all the pieces are played, but no one has won, the winner is the one who has the most groups of 4 pieces, or the hand may be replayed.&#10;&#10;",

This is not one of those one-at-a-time, chip-away-at your opponent games. If removing 9 (of your opponent's 30 total) tokens with 1 card is not enough to satisfy your need to dominate, adapt! There are adapters you can attach to a line to make it act in unique and more devastating ways. But you will need to take care, as any actions you take may affect your own tokens.&#10;&#10;In addition to eliminating your opponent, you will need to earn enough points to solidify your victory. Earning points is as easy as placing your tokens in risky locations. Can you manage to outmaneuver and outscore your opponent? Will you pull off a victory even after all of your tokens are removed? Are you worthy of the title Grid Lion?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subway is one of several &quot;LP games&quot; released some time in the 80s, where the &quot;box&quot; is the shape and size of a record sleeve and folds out to reveal the board.&#10;&#10;This game is a tafl derivative (see Hnefatafl) where one player controls 1 mother submarine and 8 mini subs, while the other controls 16 destroyers. The goal for the sub player is to escape the board with the mother sub, while the other player tries to eliminate it.&#10;&#10;There are a few differences from the usual tafl beside the obvious elongated playing field. By default, pieces can only move one step at a time; rook movement is an optional rule. Some tiles allow the submarine player to photograph &quot;defense installations&quot;, which forces the other player to remove a destroyer from the board. At some points around the edges of the board it's possible (rather arbitrarily) to move diagonally.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the 17th century, good Puritans labored hard six days a week, carving a life from the savage wildernessof the New World to forge a community in which they could freely worship and maintain their religious beliefs without fear of persecution.  They spent the entire seventh day worshipping at the town meeting house, the highlight being a feiry sermon lasting up to six hours.  On that one day of rest, it's no wonder some people's minds wander, their conciousness fades, and they nod off to catch a few precious winks of sleep before another week of grueling work.&#10;&#10;In Puritan churches, the &quot;bobber&quot; was an unfortunate soul charged with slowly patrolling the congregation, poking anyone who had obviously dozed off with a long pole with a cloth-padded end. Sometimes the offender switched places with the bobber, redeeming himself by shuffling endlessly around the meeting house in search of other lax Puritans.&#10;&#10;",

Even though they don't have any influence, anyone can't know the time whem their pent-up dissatisfaction will be burst at anywhere. If you can't manage them, they will be exposed to your rival's conspiracy and you will face threat of serious revolt finally.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;object: winning the most Prestige Points after 5 rounds of play&#10;There are 3 phases: the Settlement Phase, the Consul Phase and Round Scoring.&#10;In the Settlement Phase you deploy Clientes markers on 'Hills' or 'Forum Romanum'&#10;In the Consul Phase is a consul chosen.&#10;Then you'll get scores from the different hills if you are in control of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A collection of rules, game boards and numerous bits for playing twelve different educational games, all with a focus on early childhood mathematics. While designed for home use by parents, many of the games in the kit are also suitable for classroom use with larger groups. The rules booklet and each game includes an introductory section about the purpose of the collection and each game. The games included in the kit are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Coin Exchange (Money Cube Game 1) -- A two player game using play money and two special dice, each marked with 2 pennies, 2 nickles and 2 dimes. Players simply roll the dice and collect money from the bank. The winner is the player with the most money when the bank runs out of dimes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Concentration with Number Cards and Dominoes -- A two player game using a special deck of numbered cards (0 through 9) and 10 dominoes from a standard set that have a total of 0 to 9 pips. The cards and dominoes are shuffled and arranged in a face-down tableau, and the players take turns flipping over one card and one tile, collecting matching sets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Disappearing Train -- A two to four player board game a special board, 16 counters for each player and a special die with sides -1, -2, -3 and +3, with two other blank sides. Players make trains out of 12 of their counters and remove counters from the train according to the die roll, but the player has to roll a positive number to begin and an exact number to end. The game ends when a player collects 12 counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Double-Digit Dice Game -- A game using two special dice, one marked 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the other marked 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. Players roll both dice in turn and try to make the largest two digit base ten number. A suggested variation is to go for the smallest number. It could also be played as a press-your-luck game. It's suggested for two to four players, but any number can play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     High Roller -- A simple dice game suggested for two to four players, but any number can play. In turn, players roll two regular six-sided dice, then re-roll the lower, keeping track of their score. This is for the youngest players who are just learning how to count pips. The highest score after two rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Matching Coin Game -- A game about matching coins rolled on a special die showing pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and placing them into the correct segments of a money tray. It's suggested for four or five players, but any number could play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Monster Squeeze Game -- A two player guessing / deduction game using a special board and monster figures to keep track of high and low guesses on a number line. Each player in turn thinks of a number from 0 to 10 and the other makes guesses, moving the monsters until the number is guessed correctly. Fewest guesses to get the number wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     One-Dollar Game -- A two player game where the object is to be able to collect enough change to be able to exactly exchange for a dollar. Players collect coins according to a special die with coins on the faces, making change for larger coins along the way. A special board helps players keep track of things.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Paper Money Exchange Game (Money Cube Game 2) -- A two player game where the object is to be the first to collect $100 by collecting bills shown on a special die, making change for larger bills along the way. A board helps players keep track of things, and variations are given for collecting $1000 and adding another special die.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Plus or Minus Game -- A territorial game played on a checkers board (included in the kit). Players roll a special die with faces -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3, placing or subtracting counters from the board. Suggested for 2 players, it could be played by up to four.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Spin a Number (1-10) -- A simple spin and move race game played with a single counter for each player on a track board. Suggested for 2 to 5 players, but any number could play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Top-It -- A two player card game similar to &quot;War&quot; played with a special numbered deck. The object is to either get the most or fewest cards after one trip through the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The gameboard depicts the North Sea, with six harbours and six offshore platforms. At the start of the game, eighteen ships are placed at sea.&#10;&#10;A Weather Card is drawn, which shows the weather in different areas, and two ships which are in jeopardy. The players attempt to reach these ships and tug them to a harbour. If a player succeeds in doing so, he collects a number of coins as reward. At the end of the game, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by rolling two dice. In fair weather, the a tug-boat moves a number of squares equal to the sum of the two dice, in unstable weather only the number shown on the highest of the two dice and in a storm only the number shown on the lowest of the two dice&#10;&#10;Rolling doubles results in a special event. On a double 5 or 6, the weather shifts and new ships are placed in jeopardy. On any other double, the player draws a Log Card, which will often have some one-time effect or give him a special assignment with which he can gain coins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game, each player is an inhabitant of one of the continents. At the start of the game, each player will receive an assignment, which will involve visiting some location on another continent. When a player reaches his destination, he gets another assignment. The first player to complete all four assignments related to his continent wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players travel across the board by throwing one or two dice and moving the exact amount shown. Players cannot pass each other, except on the airport spaces. If a player lands exactly on top of another player, that other player is returned to his home town. In addition, on some squares a player must draw a Route Card or an Action Card that will trigger some special effect.&#10;&#10;The assignments represent certain questions that the player is supposed to find an answer to, such as Does apartheid exist in Latin-America? When a player completes his assignment, he receives a card which contains the answer to that question.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, General Problems are added, which concern problems that aren&rsquo;t linked to one of the continents. Each player receives two cards describing such a problem. Cards describing the solutions are distributed among the players. In addition to completing their assignments, the players also need to find the solution to their General Problems. Certain locations on the game board offer the option to ask another player for the solution card, as do certain Action Cards. (One of these locations is New York, as headquarters of the United Nations.)&#10;&#10;The expert version of the game adds the United Nations Securtiy Council to the game. Players visiting New York can now call for a meeting of the Security Council. During such a meeting, the players vote on the positioning of UN Armies. These armies block player movement. No player can pass them (but by landing on top of them, they can be removed).&#10;&#10;",

Get a group of friends (or even strangers) together and see how good you really are.&#10;&#10;Tell Me No Lies is a party game where success is based on your ability to pick when someone is lying (or telling the truth) through their body language.&#10;&#10;The general course of play involves answering questions depending on what your Answer card says. If it says 'Truth', answer the question truthfully, and lie if it says 'Lie' (obviously). The other players have to figure out whether you are lying or telling the truth.&#10;&#10;Note: All files for the game are in the files section in a single zip. However, if you can't be bothered printing out the Truth/Lie cards, you can just use a standard deck of cards instead.&#10;&#10;",
