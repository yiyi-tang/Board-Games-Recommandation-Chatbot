Squares closer to the basket are marked with odds for both a guarded and an open shot.  There is a movement track that runs through the outside squares.  Each player has two &ldquo;court decks&rdquo; and one &ldquo;shoot deck.&rdquo;  Most individual plays are resolved by drawing from these decks of cards.&#10;&#10;In normal play, the offense begins with the ball along the outside track.  Both players draw from their court deck.  If the offense has the higher number, the ball can moved (usually closer to the basket) up to the difference between the two numbers.  If the defense has the higher number the ball is moved the difference of the two numbers along the outside track.  If the numbers are equal, special actions such as fouls and turnovers occur.&#10;&#10;When a player shoots, a card is drawn from the &ldquo;shoot deck&rdquo; and the shot resolved according to the odds printed on the square where the shot occurs.  The color of the court deck card used to arrive at that square determines whether it is an open or guarded shot.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for rebounds, fast breaks, 3-pt. shots, 24 sec. clock, &amp; fouls.&#10;&#10;",

(A gap is an area of the interior line for which a defensive lineman or linebacker is responsible.) The coach deals seven of the position cards to each of the players. The coach exposes the play card, waits five seconds, then exposes the gap card. If a player holds the card of the position that is responsible for that gap, he may put that card face down on the table. The players have five seconds to put their cards down after the gap card is exposed. On the command of the coach, any player who puts down a card must turn it over. If the player is correct, he gets a point. If wrong, he loses a point. If a player has no points and is wrong, his score becomes a negative number. Players who put cards down may get a new card from the position deck. The cards that are put down will be collected by the coach. If necessary, the coach will check the results against the play sheets.&#10;&#10;The first player to get ten points wins the round and gets to be coach for the next round. The previous coach then becomes a player; however, he will need 12 points to win the round after being the coach. Rounds may continue as time permits.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;64 cards&#10;&#10;",

There are many different paths toward achieving this goal, so look carefully at all of your options.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to obtain as many assets as you can and wipe out all the other gangs in town. The assets that are available to you are hitmen, dealers, muscle, and businesses. Be ruthless on your way to the top.&#10;&#10;HITMEN are used to take out the other assets in the game, as well as enemy bosses. Their fees can be steep, but this is the mark of an expert assassin. Used wisely, hitmen will quickly take the title of your most useful asset.&#10;&#10;DEALERS are an easy way to make money in this city. Everyone needs something, and these shady assets are there to supply it to them for a nominal fee. Owning dealers will make you money each turn.&#10;&#10;MUSCLE are your strong men, used in a variety of situations. They are your personal bodyguards and can be sent out to any assets you deem in need of some protection. They can also hassle businesses into giving up protection fees, making them invaluable.&#10;&#10;BUSINESSES are the most legitimate, and therefore least cost efficient, way of making money. Businesses are in general the most expensive assets in the game, but they are especially helpful because they cannot be targeted by hitmen.&#10;&#10;These are the resources at your disposal. If you can use them correctly nothing will stand in your way. But always be on your guard; you're not the only one willing to do what it takes.&#10;&#10;Get some friends together and become enemies. Or get some enemies together and become friends. This is a party game full of deceit, betrayel, and the most nefarious of schemes. Fight over territory and businesses, buy out your enemy's assets, and dishonor truces at that pivotal turning point to take all the glory in that final stretch. Let nothing stand between you and total rule.&#10;&#10;",

Players now have to enter the Rainforest board and follow one of several paths to the pools in order to gain its benefits.  Now players have to think about the time it takes to do the quest versus staying closer to the Crown of Command.&#10;     &#10;   Talisman Quests includes:&#10;&#10;Rule book in PDF format, Two playing board images, One full sized jpeg for large format printing, 9 Letter sized jpegs for home printers, 60 Quest cards to challenger adventurers, 30 Curses cards for those who offend the gods, 2 New Characters and Character Cards (The Conquistador &amp; Cannibal Warrior), 24 New Purchase Cards, 4 Special Cards (Two Large Legend Cards, One Retreat Card, One Gibbering Horror).&#10;&#10;Talisman Quests is designed by Scott &quot;Fenris&quot; Davenport and is self-published under Wolf Creek Games.

Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the table. There are 44 cards in the deck; 11 sets of 4 explorers. The object of the game is to collect the most &quot;Explorer's Logs&quot; consisting of a set of 4 cards for each explorer.&#10;2. The player at the dealer's left begins by calling on another player. That player is asked for a specific card that will help the caller complete an &quot;Explorer's Log.&quot; The cards are designed so that there is one fact at the top that's marked with an open diamond, and three facts at the bottom marked by closed circles. The fact at the top is &quot;your&quot; card, and the facts at the bottom are the cards you can ask for from the other players.&#10;3. If the player who has been called on has the card that was asked for, it must be given to the caller, and the caller continues asking for more cards. This continues until the caller asks someone for a card that they do not have. In this case, the player draws the top card frorn the deck and the turn passes to the next person on the left. If however, the caller draws the exact card that he asked for, his turn continues, and he keeps asking for cards.&#10;4. When a player gets all 4 cards from one of the explorers, he or she has a complete log, and the cards should be placed face down in a pile in front of the player. Play continues until all of the cards have been gathered into logs. The player with the most completed logs at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;44 cards&#10;&#10;",

Many of the students are unfamiliar with fractions or have had little practice using them.&#10;&#10;Fractions are frequently used in the automotive trade. A mechanic must know which wrenches or bolts are larger than others and must be able to state which fraction is larger when making a comparison.&#10;&#10;There are at least four suits based on the denominator of the fractions. The common fractions used in the industry from 1/2 to 1/64 can be used to form suits. The purpose is to use all the available cards by arranging them into suits in descending or ascending order. The suits can be color coded. For every substitution in the sequence, extra points will be given (for instance, 1/8 - 2/8 (1/4 ) - 3/8 - 4/8 (1/2) or 8/16 or 16/32).&#10;&#10;If a player fails to use the lowest denominator, then a point will be subtracted. There will be enough cards in each suit to cover up to one inch. There will be extra cards that will be used to cover the points of intersection between suits; for instance, 1/4 - 1/2 -3/4, etc.&#10;&#10;These extra cards will allow all suits to be completed in more than one way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;In 1861 France tried to make Mexico a part of her empire . . The battle best remembered by the French occurred in 1863. A small detachment of the French Foreign Legion (FFL) was sent to escort a supply train. The force was intercepted by a large force of Mexican cavalry and infantry. The FFL retreated to a walled farm near the village of Camerone. They were surrounded, low on ammunition, and outnumbered 50 - 1 . . . The incredible courage of the Legion at Camerone is remembered every April 30 when the FFL celebrates Camerone Day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Devils Don't Surrender is a miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with up to a dozen students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played with 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&#10;&#10;The game requires 45 FFL figures and 90 Mexican figures.

    "Description": "&quot;In 1836 Texas was still a part of Mexico. But the Texans revolted against the autocratic rule of President Santa Anna.

Davy Crockett reportedly said that the Mexicans would 'eat snakes' before they got into the Alamo.&quot;&#10;&#10;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

For the most part the changes I have made are to simplify the game so that they will work well with my students aged 10-13. The battle can be completed in less than two hours. The Mexicans will suffer a much higher casualty rate than they did historically, but the game moves quickly and is fun.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Instead, each player is competing against his teammates. The Indians are competing to see which war band can win the most honors; the cavalry are competing to see who can last the longest. Indian bands can earn honor points for defeating an enemy in melee, capturing a guidon, or for a chief counting coup. The band that earns the most points is the Indian winner. The Cavalry company that keeps its guidon the longest is the Cavalry winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the three games split off from the earlier Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles project from APL, this game covers five different smaller battles from the Austro-Prussian War.  These battles are... Trautenau, Soor, Nachod, Skalitz, and Gitschin.&#10;&#10;This game uses the same system as War of the States: Gettysburg, 1863 and War of the States: Chickamauga & Chattanooga which is similar to the Rome at War and Eagles Of The Empire series as well. In this game, the units are Prussian, Austrian, and Saxon infantry brigades artillery batteries, and cavalry regiments.  The pieces are moved around topographic maps of the various battlegrounds.   Combat is resolved using by rolling a number of dice equal to the total combat strength of units involved in combat, with hits scored on a result of 6.&#10;&#10;",

The cards must first be shuffled and seven cards should be dealt to each player. The deck should then be placed face down with one card placed face up as a discard pile. The play goes in a clockwise direction and begins with the player to the left of the dealear. At each players turn, the player has the option to pick the face up card or one from the deck. The player must then discard one card in the discard (face up) pile. Play continues until someone gets 'Gin'. When a player gets 'Gin', he or she must show the cards to the other players and explain what the two groupings of the cards are. The groupings may be of similar triangles, same area, or same perimeter.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;48 cards&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, being somewhat shy of means (i.e., broke), you are unable to afford the more reputable establishments. Acting on Kaka&rsquo;s dubious suggestion, you&#10;head out to the edge of town to a place your mother told you never to go: the old, abandoned tower built by that nutcase, K&rsquo;Dak. K&rsquo;Dak was a washout from pyramid building school. He just could never get the pyramid concept straight. Big on the bottom and small on top. How is this hard? Anyway, his attempt at building a small summer&#10;pyramid for the pharaoh ended up as a six-story, straight up and down tower. The pharaoh was not amused and K&rsquo;Dak was banished from the community in disgrace. That should have been the end of it, but K&rsquo;Dak had in mind one last futile gesture before he left. He returned to the tower, hid small amounts of gold throughout the structure and then set up a booby trap for anyone who tried to retrieve the gold. However, before he could spread a story of a fabulous treasure residing in his tower, he was run out of town by the authorities and never seen again. The pharaoh intended to condemn the place for demolition, but got distracted with a border war and K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s tower was largely&#10;forgotten. And now, you and Kaka are heading to this questionable monument on the outside chance that there is something inside that you can barter for a camel makeover.&#10;&#10;K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s Tower of Confusion and Camel Wash is a game of exploration. You and your opponent climb through an abandoned tower hoping to collect enough treasure in order to pay for a bath for Phredd. Things go just fine until one of you reaches the top layer, at which time the tower starts shaking itself apart. You then have to get out before the whole structure collapses on you while still finding enough treasure to make the expedition worthwhile.&#10;&#10;",

One of the players, Captain John Konig protects the valuable energy packages while the others trying to get those from him.

These obstacles form concentric circles, the attacking players start on the outside, and their goal is to get to the center, get the energy packets, and take one of them to the starting zone. The quickest one wins the game. Each of the attacking players as well as Captain John Konig are controlling four spaceships.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You would think being a real-estate developer in this city would be easy, since there are only three building codes in the city. But nooo, you have to deal with the other real-estate developers trying to take over your buildings, an Arsonist that would love to see one of your buildings burn to the ground and that pesky Building Inspector that just seems to either waste your time or make you redo the work you have already done. But despite all that, it is worth it once you get that nice tall building overlooking the park completed. Blocks City is a three dimensional game. Players use their blocks to build the city, your goal is to score the most prestige points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It has no well-defined end-game conditions: simply play for a set period of time and then total up your assets (cash, businesses and equipment), with the win going to the player with the highest total value.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Between the 1930's and late 80's was the heyday of the Gypo Logger. This was an era when a man, with very little or no formal education could get very rich in a short time, with a lot of backbreaking work, some good luck and with a highball crew working for him. Many more Gypo loggers also went broke in their ventures due to poor planning, unforeseen expenses, plain old 'bad luck' and a multitude of pitfalls which this game only touches the surface of. The term 'Gypo' refers to &quot;haywire&quot; or make do methods that are not necessarily proper--in other words lots of duct tape and haywire is holding everything together and you&rsquo;re probably not using the right machine or tool anyway but somehow you're still getting the wood out.&#10;&#10;",
