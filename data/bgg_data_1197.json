Who needs zombies, when you got bugs.&#10;&#10;The game board is made up of two 8.5x11 squared game sheets, each of which has a grid of offset squares on them.  These squares regulate movement and attacks by insects on other insects.  The game mats can be placed side by side, end to end, or can have a series of &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; that allows them to represent restricted spots that the insects are limited in crossing at.&#10;&#10;HOW TO START THE GAME:&#10;1. Both players roll one die, the highest goes first.&#10;&#10;2. The first player places his hive anywhere on the game board marked in his own color.(Typically the closer the hive is placed toward the enemy player game board, the shorter the game will be).&#10;&#10;3. The second player then places his hive, and all of his starting game pieces.&#10;&#10;4. The first player then places his game pieces and the game begins with the first player making his moves.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF A TURN:&#10;1. First a player moves one or more of his colors game pieces&#10;&#10;2. Then he attacks with a single game piece, however this does not have to be a game piece that was moved, it can be any pieces of his color/side. Continue to make attacks, one at a time,with as many of the attacker game pieces that are allowed to attack.  Each game piece can attack only once per turn. The attacking player can make the attacks in any order. A defender game piece that survives an attack can immediately counterattack against the attacker game piece, or another that is within range of being attacked. This must be done before the next attack is made by the attacking side. The attacking side must give the defender time to make the defenders counterattack.&#10;&#10;3. The player then adds a game piece (reinforcement) to the hive entrance (if appropriate) for every food piece returned to the hive during the movement phase.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one of the following occurs.&#10;1. A hive is destroyed. This happens when an enemy WORKER is next to the hive, and rolls a 6 on an attack. The hive is then destroyed.&#10;2. All enemy game pieces are destroyed&#10;3. One side gives up and concedes the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storm Over Asia is both a companion game to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War: Second World War in Europe and the Pacific and Gathering Storm, and is a game in its own right, with its own victory conditions. Starting in 1935, Japan, China, Britain, and Russia prepare for war without being sure of just what is coming. Japan must balance its expansion in China, an impending confrontation with the United States and Russia, and the impact of the Pacific theater in a global war. China, Britain, and Russia must try to resist immediate Japanese expansion, while at the same time laying the groundwork for the successful prosecution of war in the Pacific. These short-term and long-term goals will often be in conflict, and misjudgments in either direction may have dire consequences.&#10;&#10;Storm Over Asia allows players to explore what might have happened if: &#10;&#10;     Japan had prioritized naval expansion, even though it antagonized the United States. &#10;     Japanese admirals had focused on submarine warfare in the impending war with the Allies. &#10;     The Japanese had taken the American submarine warfare threat more seriously. &#10;     Japan had committed to jets, advanced submarines or rockets. &#10;     Synthetic oil technology had been developed by Japan. &#10;     Japan had developed a strategic bomber for to use against China &hellip; or Russia. &#10;     Japan had prepared for a direct attack on the Soviet Union, rather than first trying to eliminate the Chinese threat to is flank. &#10;     Nationalist China had defeated the Communists before Japan invaded. &#10;     Communist China had expanded its territorial base and armed forces. &#10;     The United Front had formed early, allowing China to confront Japanese aggression more effectively. &#10;     Australia and India had been better prepared for war, including by building Australian aircraft carriers or an Indian air force. &#10;     YOU had been in command.&#10;&#10;&#10;Storm Over Asia may be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, and may be played alone or in tandem with Gathering Storm, GMT&rsquo;s pre-war game in Europe. Storm Over Asia resembles Gathering Storm in many ways, and both games have a structure consistent with A World at War, allowing for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into. There are many similarities between Storm Over Asia and Gathering Storm, and Gathering Storm players will have no difficulty in playing Storm Over Asia. There are also differences between the two games, such as the mechanics for combat in China, and coordinating Japanese and European Axis strategies is perhaps even more challenging before the outbreak of war than it is during A World at War (especially in turns where China draws a random event invoking &quot;German advisors&quot; as the reason for increased Chinese combat abilities). Storm Over Asia includes the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Four random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value. &#10;     Four Japanese Random Event Category Cards, which determine the type of random event that Japan will have each turn. &#10;     Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork. &#10;     Flexible Japanese mobilization rules, allowing Japan to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other. &#10;     Unit construction which allows Japan to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options, and allows China, Britain and Russia to build military counters, if they feel they can afford to maintain them. &#10;     Variable Japanese, Chinese and British research, which can focus on air, naval, military, economic or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains. &#10;     A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not. &#10;     Japanese shipbuilding that allows a varied fleet, including the possibility of Japanese 4-factor super carriers. &#10;     Ahistorical A World at War counters, including improved Japanese armor, stronger Chinese infantry units, Chinese and Indian air units, Australian battlecruisers and light carriers, and Australian naval air units. &#10;     A dynamic combat system, which covers both the Japanese invasion of China and Russo-Japanese clashes in Manchuria and Siberia. &#10;     No dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Get a piece of paper to keep score on, spread out the game, and you&rsquo;re ready to start.&#10;&#10;&#10;Then:&#10;&#10;     The object of the game is to score points by-&#10;         picking up a score one point card&#10;         landing on a score one point square&#10;         landing on the Straight Theatre (which scores one point)&#10;         playing at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore Auditorium. When you get there room the die again and add the number to your score.&#10;    &#10;      You must hand in a joint to play at the Avalon and the Fillmore. You get joints by landing on the squares marked score one joint. Keep score of joints.&#10;     You move around the board by rolling a single dice.&#10;     You start the game by rolling the dice, putting the Fish you&rsquo;ve picked on Joe&rsquo;s name in the circle, counting that as one, and counting around from there. You may move in either direction, but you have to pick up every member of the band before you start off for the Avalon and the Fillmore.&#10;     You may move in any direction on the board.&#10;     You must play at the Avalon and the Fillmore-in any order- handing in one joint before playing each place, and rolling the dice to see how many extra points you get. When you&rsquo;ve played one of them go back to the circle, pick up the rest of the Fish and start again.&#10;     When you&rsquo;re busted you lose your turn, one point, and all of the joints in your possession. If you&rsquo;re not holding joints you just go to &ldquo;visiting jail&rdquo;.&#10;     If you land on a square marked &ldquo;pick a card&rdquo; take the top card off the deck, do what it says, then put it face down at the bottom of the deck.&#10;     The game is never over. You can stop any time.&#10;     You can make up your own rules. You may have to.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Historical Battlelines is a complete regimental and battalion level rules system covering all horse and shot wars. This includes conflicts between 1600 thru late 1800's. To include major wars like the Napoleonic, American Civil War, English Civil War, and 7 Year War.&#10;&#10;Historical Battlelines mechanics are based on those developed for the American Battlelines rule system. There have been few minor changes to improve playability from the original rules, however the mechanics are the same. In Historical Battlelines  a unit&rsquo;s effectiveness is based upon three criteria. These include Morale, Disorder and Ammunition Levels. And with nothing more than a few counters, this simple and exciting system mirrors the unpredictability that was found on the actual field of battle. Historical Battlelines also includes representative examples of troop and weapon statistics for several periods of conflicts.&#10;&#10;Based around the innovative Drop-In Game System, Historical Battlelines is built on a solid and easily learned core set of rules. This player-friendly approach provides the perfect balance between historical accuracy and playability while at the same time allowing players to grow into the game at their own pace. Utilizing the same terms and game mechanics, the addition of the new Drop-Ins is accomplished without the need to learn a whole new set of rules. Within you will find Drop-Ins for command and control, morale, artillery (including counter battery), structures and fortifications, cavalry, skirmishing, unusual weapons and more!&#10;&#10;Designed to work with miniatures sizes 6mm and up, there is nothing else required to play in literally any figure scale. And, with a very flexible basing system, there is no need to re-base figures from existing collections.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When Love has matured and, through a dissolution of the self into light, become a radiance, then shall the Lover be liberated from dependence upon the Beloved, and the Beloved also be made perfect by being liberated from the Lover.&quot; &#226;&#128;&#149; Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld (second UN Secretary-General, 1953-1961), Markings&#10;&#10;United Nations: a world-oneness-family is cooperative game about love and service, a game with a voting, worker placement and crisis management, where players will take on the role of high UN officials and UN affiliated agencies in a quest for world peace and harmony. The goal of the game is to present historical events while at the same time giving the players an active role in avoiding crisis and promoting peace in all its manifestations.&#10;&#10;At every moment the game's four natures of world tension, military, economic, social and diplomatic, is increasing. Every United Nations Secretary-General's mandate is interspersed with challenges such as the Cold War, Suez Canal, Ebola outbreaks and dictatorships. But great events also lighten and brighten the welkin of the world's hopes and promises - Gorbachev and the Fall of the Berlin Wall, smallpox is eradicated, UN-supervised elections install a president elected by the people.&#10;&#10;Every mandate (round) players will inspire nations to vote and adopt resolutions in both the General Assembly and the Security Council. Each adopted resolution, in turn, will make available powers for UN agents and local governments to address their tensions of greater concern at the time. Tensions not addressed (by lack of time, manpower, resources or positive intention in the voting sessions) might erupt into crisis with the flow of the regional tension deck. A crisis will affect not only the originating region, but its neighbours as well.&#10;&#10;Play continues for one round for each of the eight UNSG mandates. Players lose if 10 crisis happen but, as in life, the real goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score by working together for progress, and not just to avoid crisis. The UN stands for the high ideals and hopes of the world's people, so players have to strive to reach the UN agendas for the continuous progress of the world as a oneness-family. Players win if they do not lose for having ten crisis, establish at least seven of the eight possible UN regional offices. Then they score points for each resolution adopted, for each UN regional office they can establish, and lose points for every crisis that happens. On your next game, try to serve better and get a higher score!&#10;&#10;&quot;I feel that there shall come a time in the near future when the entire world will be inundated with peace and this world of ours will become a oneness-world-family-home.&quot; -Sri Chinmoy, Lifting up the world with a oneness-heart, Agni Press, 1988&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Borbarads Fluch is a solo adventure for Aventuria - The Adventure Card Game.&#10;&#10;Assemble the Archmage's cursed Mage Tower from a total of 30 tower cards and send your hero to its deadly floors. Your goal is to find out what Borbarad's curse is all about and save all of South Aventuria from a devastating catastrophe. Between you and your goal stands the mysterious tower and its guards and traps, and a single hero can only find certain death here. Fortunately, death in this wretched place, steeped in ancient magic, is only the beginning!&#10;&#10;It allows you to learn from the mistakes of the past as you delve deeper and deeper into the tower to unlock its disturbing secrets. This adventure was deliberately designed for a single hero and contains numerous game mechanics to make the solo game entertaining and diversionary, but can also be mastered by entire groups of heroes with great fun. A large-format tower plan with four deadly floors, study cards, rules for hunger and thirst and many other game elements ensure that every new advance into the Mage Tower is exciting and challenging and you never know exactly what you will be up against next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

They also maintain the arrogance and showmanship that defines the greatest gladiators, favouring bloody eviscerations and decapitations over a simpler, more efficient kill. The sight of such a gruesome death can steal the nerve from even a veteran fighter.&#10;&#10;Prove your might in the battlefields of Warcry with the Spire Tyrants!

    "Description": "Despite their technological supremacy and widespread prosperity, the kingdom of Wakanda finds itself embroiled in a struggle as old as time itself: a battle for the throne. Erik Killmonger&rsquo;s oath of vengeance against the Wakandan king&rsquo;s bloodline has fallen on T&rsquo;Challa, the current Black Panther. Not content to simply eliminate the Black Panther and his allies, Killmonger wishes to seize Wakanda for himself. To that end, he seeks to radicalize the population against their king, smuggling weapons and mercenaries into the country in preparation for a vast uprising that would place Killmonger on the throne.&#10;&#10;But the Black Panther has allies in the form of Princess Shuri and the Winter Soldier. Shuri&rsquo;s weapons and gadgets can turn the tide in any battle, and no one knows more about fighting a subversive campaign than the Winter Soldier. Yet, even this formidable trio will be hard-pressed to prevent Killmonger&rsquo;s master plan.&#10;&#10;As the war for the heart of Wakanda unfolds, only the most skilled and most daring will rise in defense of the throne!&#10;&#10;",

But, by and large, their good deeds outshine the bad, and Ronan the Accuser has had enough! The Guardians have interfered with Ronan&rsquo;s people, the Kree, in their self-proclaimed righteous wars for the last time!&#10;&#10;Ronan ranks among the most formidable villains the Guardians have ever faced, and his master plan is as simple as can be: put an end to the Guardians permanently. In personal combat, even the trio of Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot have little chance against The Accuser wielding his godlike Universal Weapon. They must scramble their way from star to star, helping where they can, and thwarting Ronan&rsquo;s minions wherever possible.&#10;&#10;No place is safe for the Guardians so long as Ronan hounds their tracks. Their only hope is to gather enough strength to finally defeat Ronan, or frustrate his plans long enough to give up the hunt. Either way, the Guardians of the Galaxy are in a race against time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher''&#10;&#10;",

For every roll of 1 0r 6 tic the box accordingly and roll again, later subtracting or adding based on results. A 6 represents a great fight move, a 1 represents getting hit. You're given 6 rerolls due to your bar fighting experience, tic them off as you use them. In the end, calculate your total number. Will you come out unscathed? Or bruised with a broken limb? Or will you get knocked out? A negative result means you got knocked out, a zero means you barely made it, any positive number means you defended yourself well and did some damage, the higher the number the better!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;It is humiliating to remain with our hands folded while others write history. It matters little who wins. To make a people great it is necessary to send them to battle even if you have to kick them in the pants. That is what I shall do&rdquo;.&mdash;Benito Mussolini.&#10;&#10;Following the successful stand by the Republicans at Madrid, Nationalist Generalissimo, Francisco Franco issued an urgent call for reinforcements to his Fascist German and Italian supporters. Dictator Benito Mussolini responded by sending tens of thousands of &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; made up into the &ldquo;Corpo di Truppe Volontarie&rdquo; (CTV). Many of the divisions of the CTV were composed of &quot;Camicie Nere&quot; (Black Shirts), fascist party thugs who saw their participation in the military as a fast track path to privilege and advancement back at home. Mussolini asked Franco for his CTV to lead the &ldquo;final&rdquo; assault to take Madrid. The Italian commanders suggested the attack take place as soon as possible in March when the worst of the winter storms should be over, and before the Republican&rsquo;s reinforcements that were pouring into their ports and across the border from France, could be deployed. The focus of the attack was the key crossroads town of Guadalajara north and east of Madrid; its capture would compel a Republican withdrawal that would severely weaken their hold on the capital. The largest battle of the Spanish Civil War to-date was about to be waged.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

People were looking for a fast, enjoyable space game that would let them field real fleets. Not just a dozen ships, but scores or hundreds of ships.&#10;&#10;That's what Battleshift is....&#10;&#10;&quot;Battleshift&quot; refers to ships shifting into and out of battle through hyperspace. It allows units of ships to disappear from the table, and then re-enter the battlespace a few turns later making maneuver important, as fleet commanders can't just focus on what's on the table.&#10;&#10;Battleshift also features a suppression system, which causes squadrons to lose accuracy as they take fire. Suppression has traditionally been critical in battle.  In naval gun engagements, near misses on enemy ships were still useful as they made crews flinch, rocked the ship to spoil aim and obscured targeting. Few starship miniature games have even looked at suppression's effect on a battlefield.&#10;&#10;Battleshift does...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Uber Soldat&#10;&#10;A fast and furious skirmish tabletop game based on Frontline Command&rsquo;s game mechanics, which uses an array of accurate weapon charts.&#10;&#10;Take control of an American squad sent against the odds on near suicidal missions to directly oppose the Uber Soldats (Super Soldiers) and genetically tampered SS Guard of Colonel Von Kleist. Can you out-power the twisted creations of Von Kleist and survive the mission given to you and your squad to better understand this frightening new curve of German technological/genetic advancements?&#10;&#10;Or command the Uber Soldats and enhanced SS Guard of Colonel Von Kleist on assignments that will turn the war and secure Germany's future. You have no equal. Your units are unlike any others in the world, ones that do not know defeat and vow to bring Germany back from the ashes!&#10;&#10;Uber Soldat is set in the late years of World War II; however, the allies have uncovered a secret program the Germans have been developing for years called the UBER SOLDAT or translated &ndash; SUPER SOLDIER! You can play either the German forces which include the SS guard of the elusive Doctor Colonel Von Kliest and his MKI Uber Soldats who are on missions for the German high command or the under-equipped but resourceful and stubborn Americans trying to stop them from extending the war even longer.&#10;&#10;Uber Soldat is a fast and furious game and plays in about an hour. There are 3 scenarios included and can be played in succession to see if the Allies are successful in their missions to stop the Germans &ndash; for now. &#10;The box set also includes a copy of Frontline Command Skirmish, which has all the basic rules for game play such as close combat, firing weapons and a whole lot more!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
