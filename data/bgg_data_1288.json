    "Description": "Two Toned Tussle is a medieval offshoot of Rock, Paper, Scissors. While the main goal of beating your opponent with the better of the three options, (Sword, Staff, or Shield in this case)&#10;&#10;&#10;The over-arching goal of Two Toned Tussle is to be the player with the highest treasure score at the end of the game. To gain treasure, you must win bouts and earn White cards. While these White cards offer powerful effects to help you retain the upper hand, they can serve you much better by being traded 3 at a time for a Treasure card! Beware though, your opponent isn't exactly defenseless! Each time a player loses a bout, they get to draw a Black card with two of the three weapons on it; allowing even larger weaknesses to be exploited in a comeback maneuver!&#10;&#10;A typical game of Two Toned Tussle is about 10-15 minutes long and consists of 3 bouts at a time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Monkey Spank! game, one card is placed face up in the center of the table and players are dealt the remaining cards face down. Players simultaneously reveal the top card from their decks and try to find the symbol in common with their card and the center card. Which ever player is first to yell out their matching symbol (for example, &quot;ball gag!&quot;) places their card as the new center card. That player then reveals the next card in their deck and all players repeat the process. The first player that runs out of cards in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore new worlds, conquer discovered territories, trade resources and create a kingdom that you rule. Achieve this by tactically building your deck and choosing your actions wisely in the board game, Kings of Serbia.&#10;&#10;Basic Information:&#10;&#10;This game comes with a rulebook, over 200 cards, resource tokens, and exploring markers. Each player begins with a Personal deck of cards, that represents their people (workers, explorers, soldiers) and a set of Action cards. Each round players place all the cards from their hand onto their Action cards to discover new territories, conquer discovered territories, produce resources, and later sell them at a higher price.&#10;Gold is used for adding cards to your deck, by buying new characters from the market and bringing them to your kingdom.&#10;Character cards have symbols that signify the character's abilities. Each character can be placed on any Action card, but if the character's symbol and action card match, bonus points are granted.&#10;Important aspect of the game is exploring and conquering territories which bring you needed resources and great abilities. What is also interesting about the game is the law of supply and demand of resources because the resource that is offered by more players has a lower price.&#10;The game ends with the round during which a certain number of Territory piles is used up, which depends on the number of players. Then the players count their points from their Personal deck and conquered territories. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This game has unique mechanics: the cards which you buy and with which you build your deck are also the workers you put on your action cards to activate them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the exciting world of Vojvodina!. In this game, you are in the role of a farmer who produces crops and supplies town markets by making lucrative contracts.&#10;Find the right balance between careful and thought-out tile placement and obtaining the best-paying markets.&#10;The goal of the game is to have more money than the other players at the end.&#10;&#10;Prove that you're the best and wealthiest farmer in the most fertile region of Serbia!&#10;&#10;In the board game &quot;Vojvodina&quot;, for players two to four, ages 9 and up, players acquire and place tiles on the map with smart card-drafting.&#10;The game is very fun, because the outcome is always uncertain, and at the same time it is educational because the players can learn a lot about Vojvodina itself as well as the basic principles of the economy.&#10;The board game also promotes Vojvodina as a region of Serbia that is a must-visit if you have not already done so. And if you have, you will surely find some new beautiful place that you missed.&#10;The game is fantastically designed with art inspired by oil paintings of the Vojvodina pain with numerous photographs of Vojvodina's towns from the beginning of the 20th century, which gives the game a unique visual identity thanks to Andrea Schwartz, the game's graphic designer.&#10;The designer of the game, psychologist Boris &#196;&#144;urovi&#196;&#135;, a passionate board game enthusiast, wanted to encourage people to spend more time together in the company of their loved ones, sharing beautiful moments, learning, and having fun, away from mobile and computer screens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;.&#10;&#10;Brief description of Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game lasts a certain number of rounds depending on the number of players. At the start of a round 6 cards are dealt with each player.&#10;&#10;Round is divided into 6 turns:&nbsp;&#10;&nbsp;On each turn, starting with the first player, the players use one card from their hand. The card can be used in two ways:&#10;&#10;1. Discard the card&#10;- The player discards the card face down on top of the deck and draws one of his field tiles from the common pile and places it in front of him.&#10;2. Keep the card&#10;- The player keeps the card face down and places one of his field tiles on the map.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, all players pass the rest of the cards from their hand to the player on their left and the new turn begins with a new starting player.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played, players receive grain depending on how many fields they covered on the map. Then everyone uncovers the cards they saved and for each town, they managed to supply (value of the grain on the blue bag symbol), they get coins shown on the cards, and for the towns, they didn't supply they lose that number of coins from their treasury.&#10;&#10;At the end of the last round, the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It adds a real level of tension and excitement to the battles. Everything matters.&#10;&#10;The battles are a series of one-on-one fights to the death. You either kill the monster earning coins and XP or your character dies and you must chug your drink! The cards act as the GM (So everyone can drink) and the heroes go through four themed quests in each game - each getting progressively difficult and more likely to drink. However as this is a light RPG and a light Drinking Game there is a one chug per quest maximum which prevents Drinking Quest from being a &quot;Pass out in 10 minutes&quot; kind of drinking game. Over the course of 2 or 3 hours, a typical game averages 2 or 3 chugs.&#10;&#10;Whoever gets the most XP wins! Whoever loses had to chug the most so it's sort of like everybody wins.&#10;&#10;",

A winner is selected by the other players, the Jury of Peers.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to win 5 points and become the master debater. The full box consist of 500 cards with 160 Topic cards, 320 Reason cards, and 20 Debater and Peer cards.&#10;&#10;Each round the Debater and Peer cards are handed out to randomly identify who is debater 1 and who is debater 2. All other players will become the Jury of Peers and select the argument that feel is best. Both debaters will receive the same Topic such as &quot;Hot Dogs Are A Sandwich&quot;. Each debater will then receive a Reason such as &quot;Penguins&quot;. The debater will have 90 seconds to explain why the Topic, &quot;Hot Dogs Are A Sandwich&quot; because of, such as, or like the Reason, &quot;Penguins&quot;. After each debater goes the Jury of Peers will award a single point to the player's argument they felt was best. After which the next round will begin and new Jury of Peers, Debaters, Topic, and Reasons will be selected.&#10;&#10;Example: &#10;    Debater 1&#10;    Topic - Hot Dogs Are A Sandwich&#10;    Reason - Penguins &#10;Is a Penguin a bird? Yes, because it meets the common definition of what is considered a bird. It has feathers, a beak, and lays eggs. Though they can not fly, which is a common trait of a bird, penguins are still birds. The common definition of a sandwich is an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread, in this case a bun, with meat, the hotdog, cheese or other filling between them. Therefore, if a penguin is still a bird, a hotdog is a sandwich if it meets the definition even if it doesn&rsquo;t appear to.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Chinese over Nanking, the Yugoslavs over Belgrade, and the Bulgarian defense of Sofia all appear. The last gasp of the Regia Aeronatica over Sicily and Calabria are captured in a series of exciting scenarios. There are new scenarios for China and France. Old favorites, including the Pacific and Eastern Front, also feature, matching Italians against Soviets or recreating the famous Battle of the Bismarck Sea.&#10; New Aircraft range from the obscure Yugoslav IK-3 interceptor to the American P-26 &lsquo;Peashooter.&rsquo; Italian types including the G.55 fighter and the Z.1007 bomber also appear.&#10; Players will need copies of all previous Wing Leader products to fully enjoy this expansion.&#10;&#10;In addition to new aircraft and scenarios, Wing Leader: Legends features a whole campaign system, replicating the experience of the desperate air battles over Kursk in the summer of 1943.&#10; Contents:&#10;1 x Campaign rules and scenario book&#10;1 x What ADC Do I Use? booklet&#10;1 x countersheet&#10;1 x sheet of Aircraft Data Cards&#10;1 x combined sheet of Aircraft Data Cards and counters&#10;1 x Campaign map&#10;2 x Campaign order of battle cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Life in the Yukon is simple, so long as hiking up mountains, canoeing down rivers, fishing from frozen lakes, mining gold, hunting bears, moose and deer is simple; which never seems to be the case for the average frontiersman or frontierswoman. Use your survival skills to do all of these things while maintaining the strength and stamina necessary to keep going. With enough perseverance and instinct, the frontiersman or frontierswoman can eventually build a homestead to live the simple life.&#10;&#10;The Great Outdoors is a 2 to 6 player euro/strategy game that places you in the heart of the Yukon as a highly capable Frontiersman/Frontierswoman that specializes in their own trade or profession. You will venture out into the unforgiving wilderness to perform actions such as gold mining, cutting down lumber, hunting, fishing, trapping, trading, building, and above all, resting. Actions that involve collecting resources, such as gold mining, trapping, hunting, fishing, and logging, use dice to determine the size of the gold nugget you panned for, or the animal that got caught in your trap, or the one you shot, or the size of the fish you caught, or the amount of quality timber you cut down. Your dice rolls can be improved by purchasing or building tools, boats, and weapons. Use the fruits of your labor (resources) to build up your homestead with various amenities like sheds, wells, windmills, water wheels, and much, much more. Your victory points are determined by the value of your homestead and the crafts you collected throughout the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It was time to rebel!&#10;&#10;Written by Andy Hobday, these rules enable narrative-driven tabletop games set in an England gripped by civil war played out against the backdrop of the Magna Carta and the invasion by the Crown Prince of France.&#10;&#10;The historically themed gameplay is fast-paced and tactical. With warriors of this period being pretty similar, it is easy to base your medieval skirmish games using these rules in any setting.&#10;&#10;This softback rulebook contains 138 pages (with original wraparound cover art by Peter Dennis) which include the rules (of course), retinue lists, a quick reference sheet (with page numbers), a glossary and an index!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion does NOT simply add extra materials to play with more people, but it adds 3 new game mechanics, required to play with 5-6 friends, but they can also be used in standard games with less players on the table!!&#10;&#10;All these new mechanics have been studied as separate modules, so you will be free to choose which one you will want to add in each of your games.&#10;&#10;The first module involves interactive cards, they allow you to carry out special actions, such as reopen an already filled Showcase to replace its content or expand it (for example a strategy could be to put a Precious in a Showcase to immediately earn &pound; 5 and then replace it with a Wonder of higher value), or it will simply guarantee you the option of adding missing books to a collection already placed in a Display Cabinet.&#10;&#10;Other cards serve to embellish your Showcase, providing more Fame points, some other let you hinder your opponents by sabotaging their Display Cabinets.&#10;&#10;The second module involves ships for foreign exhibitions! These ships are randomly drawn at the beginning of the game. Each ship board guarantee 3 additional Showcases for each player, with a special score calculated on the number of spaces filled regardless of the content. But each board assigns an additional bonus to a single space based on a specific content, so you will need to decide carefully how to use your ship!.&#10;&#10;The last module involves freight wagons! These wagons have 3 Showcases each, they are placed between the players. Each player can interact with the wagon to his right and left, by filling them with Wonders as he sees fit.&#10;&#10;Each wagon is shared between the two adjacent players and, at the end of the game, it will give Fame points to both, so you will need to decide carefully if it's the case to use those spaces and which one to use!&#10;&#10;Last but not least, the expansion contains 6 meeples, to provide enough agents for each player. As we all love beautiful meeples, we decided to add 2 new characters to have more variety, we will include these new characters also within the core game box! Extra coin and banknotes token will be included as well.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

While searching pyramids, temples, and ruins for riches, the expedition teams must watch out for traps, such as snakes, arrows, and giant boulders. Archaeologists must also beware of native tribes, cultists, fascist soldiers, and even each other. Survive the traps, take the riches (from other archaeologists if necessary), and get out alive to gain your fortune and glory!&#10;&#10;The Adventures of Tennessee James is a board game for 1-4 players 8 years and up and can be played in 30 to 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with an Archaeologist of their choice and 3 Team Members. Players can spend up to 5 Actions per turn, and can either move 1 space or draw 1 card per Action. Players can repeat Actions during their turn and may also discard cards for extra Movement Actions.&#10;&#10;Each temple contains an entrance and 24 spaces. Each space contains a face-down tile which could either be a treasure or a trap. If a player finds treasure, they keep it as a reward. If a player finds a trap, they must play cards to defeat it. If the trap is not defeated, the player loses a Team Member, which reduces how many Actions they can perform per turn. Make sure that you have enough cards to defeat traps because other players can play cards that make traps more difficult to defeat. If you run out of Team Members, and you can&rsquo;t defeat a trap, you lose the game. Find the most treasure and escape the temple to win the game, but don't stay too long or the temple will become your tomb.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If they're not able to score a KO, they can take two of the three rounds to win the bout.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in a nutshell: Players secretly choose their actions for the turn, reveal them, and they resolve simultaneously. This is called an &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;. There are six exchanges per round.&#10;&#10;Players can modify their exchanges with Bursts (which give more actions in one exchange) and Reacts (which allow players to choose which one of their cards will be played first after seeing the opponent's card).&#10;&#10;Currently, Square Ring is available publicly on TTS!&#10;&#10;We have 8 Characters (below) and 6 coaches, giving the game a tremendous amount of replayability.&#10;&#10;Characters:&#10;&#10;     Brawler: A pedal-to-the-metal puncher that gets tired as the bout goes on&#10;     Out-fighter: A low-risk and consistently poking scientist&#10;     In-fighter: He moves forward, pressures, and punishes with hooks and uppercuts&#10;     Show Boat: She warms up by taunting her opponent, but once she does, she is a force to be reckoned with. &#10;     Counter Fighter: The more often the opponent attacks, the more openings they leave to be exploited. &#10;     Pugilist: An old-timey, handle-bar moustachioed prizefighter. His movement is rather stiff, but he has some interesting attacks and evasion. &#10;     Round-Stealer: call her a procrastinator, but this fighter realizes her full potential in the second half of each round&#10;     Balanced: The middle-of-the-road, beginner-friendly character whose powerful &quot;Mj&ouml;lnir&quot; becomes more powerful  in each successive round. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

This... is... Bodyslam!&#10;&#10;Bodyslam is a wrestling-themed dexterity game, where players compete by attempting to knock wrestling figures out of a ring. At the start of the game, each of the four countries&mdash;France, Japan, Mexico, and the USA&mdash;receives a special scoring card to determine how points are awarded for their wrestlers at the end of the game. Each country's team has four of a uniquely-shaped wrestling mask, representing that country's wrestlers&mdash;these are all kept together in a bag. Set up the game by flipping over the box, placing the wrestling mat on top, and placing three random wrestling figures onto the mat.&#10;&#10;To play, players choose one wrestler at random out of the bag and throw, drop, toss, fling, or launch it at the other wrestlers already in the ring. Knock off other wrestlers to add them to your pile, but be careful&mdash;if the piece you throw falls off as well, everything that fell returns to the bag. Signature Move cards restrict the way players can throw; successfully pull off a signature move to get another turn right away.&#10;&#10;Once a player has thrown and collected any wrestlers that fell out of the ring, they make sure there are at least 3 wrestlers in the ring; if not, they draw more from the bag to place however they want into the ring. Then the next player goes, and the round continues until there are no more wrestlers in a bag. Each wrestler a player has in their pile is worth one point, with extra points awarded based on how their wrestlers relate to each country's score card. The winner of a round earns a belt; earn two belts to win!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft.&#10;&#10;Solo as this game is designed to be played alone, just you trying to make your warband survive another day. Although it could be played with two or even three players in cooperative mode, that is, fighting together against the forces of darkness.&#10;&#10;This is not an usual wargame (competitive mode / player vs player) with some solo rules designed ad hoc, this is a solo game.&#10;&#10;Horror as the supernatural and the mystery will be the common thread of our scenarios.&#10;&#10;Our characters will have to face haunted houses, gangsters, supernatural beings drawn from the worst nightmares, groups of cultists who want to awake forgotten gods, mysterious murders, ancient curses, and dusty books that predict the end of the world as we know it.&#10;&#10;Skirmish since the games will be played with just a few miniatures on a table with some scenery, although this game is not attached to any specific brand of miniatures and you can use any that you like. Forget about huge armies and lots and lots of miniatures on the table.&#10;&#10;Another strong point of this game relies in its narrative aspect. The focus is on the story since the plot in each scenario will have a great narrative weight, not just fighting without any reason or random encounters of wandering monsters. The scenarios will have a story that conects everything, all the events that happen will have a reason, and even may never be known by the player until the scenario is over.&#10;&#10;The background of this wargame is set in the worlds of madness created by H,P, Lovecraft, where a strange universe of gods and monsters underlies our reality, twisting our world upside down and throwing ourselves into a bottomless pit of madness.&#10;&#10;In this game you will play a group of characters during 1920-40 fighting supernatural beings and their acolytes who unconsciously try to wake up the long dormant evil, exploring ancient ruins, hiding from shadows that could devour you, and struggling to live another day.&#10;&#10;This is not going to be easy, but it&acute;s going to be fun... that&acute;s for sure.&#10;&#10;The ruleset is a 130 pages book that includes rules, 4 scenarios, cards, tokens and everything necessary to play.&#10;&#10;Apart from that two free scenarios have been added (making it 6 scenarios and more than 180 pages), and they are not going to be the last free scenarios...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The First Interstellar Empires is a game of space exploration, colonization, and conflict. It is set in the first decades of humanity reaching out to the stars. The game board is an accurate map of the space around our own solar system, a cube 25 light years on each side with our Sun at the center.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the roll of a nation on Earth (or Mars or the asteroid belt) that will be active in exploring the stars. In his turn a player takes actions such as: Explore a star system, that is, determine if it has useful planets and how difficult they will be to colonize. Build a colony. Invest in a colony, that is, increase its production. Form an alliance with an independent colony, or try to break up an alliance between another player and an independent colony. Research to improve your technology. And of course, invade another player's colony and attempt to conquer it.&#10;&#10;Each nation has a &quot;competence&quot; in each of four areas: military, economy, diplomacy, and science. These determine your efficiency in each area. For example, if your science is poor, you may devote huge resources to research and still not get anywhere.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player draws an &quot;event&quot; card. These can be good, bad, or depend on circumstances. Events include things like leaders who improve your competence and corruption that reduces it, economic problems, attrition in colonies with harsh environments, rebellions and civil wars. But you don't have to play a card right away. You can hold on to good cards to use them at just the right moment -- like play a &quot;great military leader&quot; just when another player attacks you and turn the tables on him. You can hold on to a bad card in the hopes of preparing to cope with it ... or at least, kicking the can down the road.&#10;&#10;Players can advance their technology in four areas: Starships, which increases the range at which you can operate; Colonization, which determines how difficult it is to establish colonies, build new &quot;starbases&quot;, and such; Terraforming, which lets you make harsh planets more suitable for human life; and Weapons, which increase your capabilities in war.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player who has the greatest production at the end of the game. This can be achieved by building many colonies, by growing your economy and making your colonies rich, or by conquering other players. Or by destroying other players' colonies: you might still be poor but they'll be poorer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One player is in charge of the PRC army and the other player is in charge of the Republic of China (Taiwan) army.&#10;&#10;In historical fact, although the PRC army, which had gained momentum in the previous victories, landed, the lack of preparation and training for the landing operation was remarkable, and only about 9,000 people were able to actually land on Kinmen Island. On the other hand, the Taiwanese army expected the PRC army to land on Kinmen Island, and was waiting for the PRC army with 40,000 troops, including reinforcements from the 18th Army (however, most of the 18th Army arrived after the battle was over). Also, for the PRC army, which had no anti-tank equipment, the M5A1 light tanks of the Taiwanese army were a threat.&#10;&#10;In this way, looking back on history, it was an inevitable landing operation, but it is not without the element of &quot;what-if&quot;. If the PRC army had more boats ready for landing, if command and control were good, if they chose a different coast for the second landing... In this game, by introducing such &quot;what-if&quot; into the game, the PRC army is also given the possibility of winning.&#10;&#10;Issue game of &quot;Banzai Magazine EX&quot; #3.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On November 19, 1942, while the main force of the German Army Group B was concentrated in Stalingrad, three Soviet armies launched an offensive against the Romanian units that were defending both flanks. This was the launch of Operation Uranus, aimed at encircling and destroying the German 6th Army. In response, the next day Hitler sent Erich von Manstein of the 11th Army, which was preparing to attack Leningrad, south to lead the rescue of Stalingrad. On the 21st Paulus of the 6th Army was ordered to defend Stalingrad &mdash; because Goering had assured that the Luftwaffe would provide the necessary supplies, and he waited for Manstein to come to the rescue.&#10;&#10;The rescue operation, dubbed the &quot;Unternehmen Wintergewitter&quot;, began on December 12. Although the advance was brisk immediately after the start of the offensive, the speed of the advance slowed down due to the reinforcements from the Soviet forces that kept coming. The Soviet forces diverted the troops that were to be used in Operation Saturn in an attempt to prevent Manstein from breaking the siege. Still in the lead, the 6th Armored Division came within 50 km of friendly forces in Stalingrad on the 19th.&#10;&#10;If the 6th Army had broken through the siege at that time, it might have been able to escape the siege by attacking from outside and inside. However, Hitler did not allow the 6th Army to conduct Operation &quot;Thunderclap&quot;. In the end, Manstein's relief force, which had reached the limit of its strength, was repulsed by the Soviet forces, and it was routed to the starting line of the offensive by the end of December.&#10;&#10;On to Stalingrad: Unternehmen Wintergewitter is a two-player wargame based on Operation Winter Thunderclap. One player is in charge of the Axis armies (German and Romanian) and the other player is in charge of the Soviet army.&#10;&#10;&#10;Issue game of Banzai Magazine EX #5.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From 1904 to 1905, Japan fought a war with the great power Russia. This was over 100 years ago.&#10;&#10;&quot;Russo-Japanese Campaign&quot; is a game based on the Russo-Japanese War. The player becomes the commander of the Japanese or Russian army and fights to lead the player's army to victory.&#10;&#10;The most important point in this game is &quot;supply&quot;.&#10;&#10;The troops need supplies to fight and to recover from damage. However, the Japanese army is restricted to using ships to get supplies, so they have to fight and win against the Russian Navy. The Russians, on the other hand, relied on the single Siberian railroad, so their supplies were not plentiful.&#10;&#10;Thus, the two armies will have to worry about how to use their limited supplies.&#10;While the land battle part is simple, with repeated movement and combat, the aforementioned supply constraints force you to make decisions about where to focus your efforts. In addition, the Japanese forces must decide whether to aim for the early capture of Liaoyang and Mukden, or to prioritize the fall of Lushun.&#10;&#10;The naval battle part is directly related to the acquisition of supplies by the Japanese forces, and the response of the Japanese forces will also change depending on the operational policy of the Russian Navy. However, in any case, if the Russian Fleet in Lushun is not destroyed before the Baltic Fleet arrives, Japan will be in a tight spot.&#10;&#10;There are also tactical cards that add variety to the game. Tactical cards give you additional supplies, or give you an advantage in battle. Depending on how you use these tactical cards, the battlefield can change dramatically.&#10;&#10;Victory or defeat in the game is determined by the victory points (VP) earned by the Japanese army. You can earn victory points by capturing strategically important points such as Liaoyang and Mukden, but you will be penalized if your troops are damaged or if you fail to capture important points.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to lead your country to victory!?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fighting Class! Battle of Aircraft Carriers is a war game that reproduces &quot;Aircraft Carrier Battles&quot; by fleets centered on aircraft carriers that occurred in the Pacific War.&#10;&#10;Each unit is one warship or one aircraft squadron (nine aircrafts), however, the damage is in units of one aircraft. Bombs and torpedoes are also handled in units of one shot. 4 hours per turn (aircraft operation unit is 1 hour). In addition to the &quot;Operation Maps&quot; (90 nautical miles per hex) used for fleet movement and search, there is also the &quot;Tactical Map&quot; that is rare in Japanese aircraft carrier battle board wargames.&#10;&#10;Operation Maps are prepared for each of the Japanese and Allied forces, and it is divided by &quot;partition&quot; so that the opponent's fleet is not known where it is (this is called &quot;double blind system&quot;). In order to search for this invisible enemy fleet, each aircraft squadron unit is flown from the aircraft carrier or base to search for enemies.&#10;&#10;At this time, there was a problem in the conventional aircraft carrier wargames that &quot;if you tell the opponent where you are looking for, your whereabouts will be revealed&quot;. Therefore, in order to avoid this problem, the &quot;fan-shaped search&quot; that was carried out in the actual carrier battle could not be done, and the players had to carry out a search pattern different from the actual one. However, in &quot;Fighting Class! Battle of Aircraft Carriers&quot;, you can search for enemies without exposing your whereabouts by using cards together. As a result, it has become possible to carry out search enemies based on the same thoughts as in actual aircraft carrier battles, such as &quot;fan-shaped search&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, a system that reproduces the &quot;resources invested (in the case of aircraft carrier battles, the number of aircraft for searching and the time spent on searching) and the amount and accuracy of information that can be detected are proportional&quot; as shown in the &quot;search theory&quot; has also been introduced into the search rules. Players are also required to have the skill to guess &quot;which is the main force including the aircraft carrier&quot; by combining the fragmentary information that can be obtained gradually.&#10;&#10;On the Tactical Map, aircraft squadron units move hexes to attack warship units. At this time, the possibility of success depends on the direction in which the warship unit is attacked (whether it is from the front, the rear, the diagonal front, or the diagonal rear). Therefore, the attacking team will charge the tactical map toward the warship unit aiming at the &quot;deadly shooting point (attacking direction)&quot;.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the warship unit not only shoots down attacking aircraft with anti-aircraft fire, but also incorporates &quot;turning&quot; (a movement that changes the course of the ship), which has not been taken up in previous aircraft carrier battle games, into the rules. This allows the warship unit to turn around from the &quot;deadly firing point&quot; that the attacking team is aiming for and avoid the attack. In this way, the Allied Forces shoot down the attacking team with &quot;powerful anti-aircraft fire&quot;, while the Imperial Japanese Navy dodges the enemy's attacks by turning with &quot;skillful ship maneuvering&quot;. It is now possible to reproduce different ways of fighting, similar to the actual aircraft carrier battles.&#10;&#10;",

And new dark forces rise on the furthest borders of the lands. Take on the role of a Warden leader from one of the three races, set forth from the capital, and uncover the lands facing all obstacles before you.&#10;&#10;Warden Chronicles is an open-world exploration adventure, which can be played in a series of one-shot stand-alone chronicles or a chronicle campaign, which will see your character grow, becoming more powerful as skills and abilities carry over from one chronicle to the next. Players will discover new locations, deal with character and world-shaping events, defend trade destroy or rebuild settlements, gain renown, recruit powerful heroes to join the adventure, and engage in combat versus hostile forces.&#10;&#10;Rough Game Flow&#10;Players will start in the main citadel location, placing their standee/mini in this space; players will then branch out either individually or group together to explore the world. As players explore the world more tiles will be uncovered, new locations will be unlocked for interaction, and enemies will make themselves known. After a player or party has finished taking their actions, they will be required to draw and resolve an event card, which will impact the player or group and how they develop their characters.&#10;&#10;Wardens&#10;The Wardens are the leader characters that players will take charge of through the course of a Chronicle or a Chronicle Campaign. Each Warden starts with their own asymmetric leader card, abilities deck, and board that will provide players with unique play. Through the course of the game, players will decide how they wish to build their Warden out as they gain experience, complete personal quests, and overcome events. You decide will you build out your player board with specialised abilities? Expand your player ability deck and look to increase your hand size? Recruit a larger honour guard of heroes to aid you?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
