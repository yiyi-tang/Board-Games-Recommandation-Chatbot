    "Description": "In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are occupied by workers.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is best played in small groups of 2-4 people, ideally a family setting that spans generations. Fearless Creatures is a print-on-demand card game.&#10;&#10;A dice battle game between fearless creatures. Use action cards to play creatures from your hand, battle with any creatures that are in play, and draw cards. Each creature's ability are described on the card. Roll battle dice. Collect victory tokens when you send creatures to the discard pile. The player with the most victory tokens wins.&#10;&#10;All creatures have unique descriptions and capabilities. Lots of creatures have the ability to band together (as herds, swarms, pods, flocks, etc.) and when they are banded together they battle as a group. Damage to creatures that band together is still determined by a creature's individual strength. It is possible possible for a large group of creatures to cause a lot of damage, but also to take a lot of damage that is applied to more than one creature in the group.&#10;&#10;",

But you have to compete with other producers in the cut-throat entertainment business.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to build a tableau of several films, each consisting of a series of production cards. There are Genre, Script, Director, Actor, Staff, Prop, and Location cards. You need a Genre or Script card, a Director, one or more Actors, and one or more Staff to complete a film, which you can then release by closing it off with a special Release card.&#10;&#10;The players have their own decks of cards. On your turn, after taking one card from your deck, you may buy 1 or 2 additional cards from any deck or discard pile and then, if you want, play 1 or 2 cards from your hand. At the end of each turn, you then receive box office money earned by your released films and pay the ongoing costs of your open productions. In case of need, you may borrow money that you will have to return with interest at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of adding cards to your productions, you can discard them to get instant cash or to interfere with other players&rsquo; productions. The game ends when a player releases a pre-determined number of films. After a final scoring and the distribution of awards to the best producers, the player with most money wins.&#10;&#10;The current version of Jollywood includes four genres: Science Fiction, Thriller, Historical, and War.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Characters earn their living by taking bounties from different guilds and not all guilds are cut from an honorable cloth.

Some characters may see comparing bills at the end of a hunt as a friendly competition among peers but there are certainly others that see competition as a thing to be eliminated.&#10;&#10;There is strength in numbers, and players will need every advantage they can muster against the other-worldly threats to this realm.

    "Description": "Red Winter: Expanded 2nd Edition&#10;&#10;This 2nd edition game is more than just a reprint of the 2012 CSR Award winner for best WW2 boardgame. It features an all-new battle, complete with its own map and countersheet.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Kelja (December 25-27, 1939) now compliments the original Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. Kelja presents a challenge that is unique to the game system but certainly not the Winter War: a large-scale river crossing. The length of the new map is bisected by a wide, frozen river that functions as a frozen lake.&#10;&#10;Kelja is a logical fit for the game system in terms of length and scale. At three days, it provides a shorter play experience than the five-day Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. The unit density is only moderately higher than that of the previous battle but still limited to a single countersheet, and the featured river crossing offers a unique game situation, providing both players with plenty of decisions and challenges.&#10;&#10;Lest the battle become a &ldquo;one trick pony,&rdquo; plenty of options are available to both players, including variable unit setups, multiple victory conditions, variable reinforcement units, and smaller scenarios including some hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;Mechanics&#10;&#10;Central to play is the Action Phase, wherein each unit may choose only one from several possible actions: move/assault, attempt recovery, dig in, or take replacement steps. This makes for some very tense decisions for both players. It also conveniently moves the game along at a brisk pace.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast and well integrated. Units may voluntarily perform combats against adjacent enemies (two-way firefights, which utilize a CRT), conduct assaults as part of movement, or make ranged attacks at a distance of two or more hexes. The &ldquo;grand tactical&rdquo; scale of 425 yards per hex yields ranges of 2 hexes for light machineguns, 3 hexes for heavy machineguns and T-26 tanks, 6 hexes for medium mortars, and 12 hexes for heavy mortars. Artillery is somewhat abstracted, being handled as off-map batteries which can strike any hex on the map. Players allocate barrages as they see fit, while keeping an eye on their ammunition.&#10;&#10;The rules for night turns provide several layers of strategic depth by means of individually simple mechanics. During each night turn, which simulates a 12 hour period, units have double their normal movement allowances. This means combat units can exploit gaps in the enemy&rsquo;s frontline, cross lakes, or execute wide flanking maneuvers. However, such ambitious units are susceptible to &ldquo;Sub-Zero&rdquo; step losses, simulating frostbite, desertion, and poor morale from the extreme weather conditions. Whether or not each stack (note: stack, not individual unit) receives a step loss is determined by a simple 50-50 die roll. The interaction of these night rules means that ambitious players may be encouraged to push their luck and gain the upper hand during night turns, all while the system simultaneously encourages players to &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; and even huddle their units together into stacks during night turns to reduce total step losses. The end result is that the system nicely mirrors the night actions of the actual battle.&#10;&#10;The implications of the night rules don&rsquo;t stop there. Skilled players will plan ahead for a night turn by positioning their units favorably during the preceding dusk turn, so they won&rsquo;t need to relocate and possibly take step losses. This nuance can (and should be) exploited by the Finns, who move second in the turn sequence. The Soviet player has the option to build bonfires to avoid sub-zero attrition losses, but in doing so his units become very inviting targets for Finnish assaults. All this gives both players a lot of choices, without burdening them with cumbersome rules or tables.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Drop Zone: Southern France is a fast-playing (about 2 hours), company-level game of the Allied airborne assault (code-named Operation RUGBY) that spearheaded Operation DRAGOON, the Invasion of Southern France&mdash;the Second D-Day, August 15th, 1944. The game can be played face-to-face, by 2, 3, or 4 players or solitaire (as the Allies). Early on the morning of D-Day, the allied First Airborne Task Force (1st ABTF) parachuted a dozen miles behind the Riviera landing beaches to seize key towns and road junctions, to prevent the German occupation forces from counter-attacking the amphibious landing, and to facilitate the advance of Allied forces. The 4:00 AM parachute drop was badly scattered due to an unexpected dense fog bank that blanketed the battlefield. Drop Zone: Southern France covers the first two days of this airborne operation in six tense turns, when the American and British paratroopers and glider-men fought surrounded and alone, supported only by French resistance bands.&#10;&#10;The game board is a hex map of the Argens and Naturby River valleys and surrounding areas in Provence, Southern France, covering the area of operations. Each hex measures about 500 meters across. The key towns, villages, roads, rivers, and bridges that were fought over are indicated. The counters portray companies and company-sized units of allied paratroopers and glidermen, French resistance bands, German Infantry, and a few small armor units on both sides. Assets depict fire support units (artillery, heavy mortars, and anti-tank guns) as well as key capabilities (such as reconnaissance and seizing initiative).&#10;&#10;Drop Zone: Southern France shines in its depiction of the fog of war (both literal and figurative)--unit type and strength is concealed until revealed in combat. On the first day, Allied parachute companies begin scattered across the board with minimal strength. German reinforcements arrive in a random fashion, often surprising and disrupting the plans of the opponent as well as the controlling player. The correlation of forces ebbs and flows as the Allies gradually build up their parachute companies and gliders deliver reinforcements and heavy weapons. Meanwhile, German reinforcements steadily increase in quantity and quality. The chit pull activation system adds another level of uncertainty. By D+1, the second day, both sides have gained in strength and acquire more powerful assets, leading to larger, bloodier battles as time runs out to achieve victory. It often comes down to the final roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You win if you have the highest number of victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are three types of tiles: path tiles that let you move your meeple across the board, point tiles that let you earn victory points, and end tiles. At set-up, the players place their markers at the edge of the board and identify their destinations at the other end the board with the end tiles. The point tiles are placed at random on 12 defined cells of the board.&#10;&#10;On your turn,  you place path tiles on the board towards your destination and then use them as stepping stones for your marker. While you move your marker, you may also take advantage of paths laid by other players and, when that happens, you may replace already laid tiles with path tiles that have a higher level of connectivity.&#10;&#10;When your marker steps onto a point tile, you pick it up and keep it till the end of the game. The game ends when a player reaches her destination after collecting a pre-defined number of point tiles.&#10;&#10;CrissCross Hex includes several features that make it more interesting without significantly increasing its randomness:&#10;1. Three pairs of &ldquo;teleportation&rdquo; cells let you jump across the board.&#10;2. Secret bonus card make some point tiles more valuable.&#10;3. Action cards let you break some of the rules.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Designed to replace the monster sized KV tank series, the IS-2 was just as big and heavy but was even nastier. Equipped with a massive 122mm gun, its intention was to be a breakthrough tank, demolishing fortifications and clearing enemy positions.&#10;&#10;Two brutal armoured platoons come from this starter set, both with the potential to break entire armies. Forming the main battle line would be the IS-2s, with tough armour, a gargantuan 122mm gun and 3 machine guns, you can send this platoon to clear the path for the follow-up task force. Which would be the T-34 Squadron, who have plenty of armour and firepower to sweep away whatever remains.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Whether you&rsquo;re Democrat, Republican or somewhere in the middle, Deplorables The Game is a bipartisan election game we can all play together. To win, players will have to buy Democrat, Republican and Bipartisan political cards to accumulate 270 electoral votes. But beware, this game is fraught with dangers like Drain The Swamp and FBI Investigations!&#10;&#10;Here's how the game works:&#10;&#10;&bull;Players start the game choosing either a Democrat or Republican candidate with a matching Endorsement Card and $1,200 to fund their campaign.&#10;&#10;&bull;The first political twist comes in the player&rsquo;s choice to purchase Obamacare or not, which affects game play down the road, because players that opt out can be penalized. Players must then roll dice, land on a space, and buy the matching political card worth 20 electoral votes. The bipartisan spaces, like the CIA or Women&rsquo;s March space, are worth more electoral votes &ndash; so try to buy those first!&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;The spinner allows players to move the voter token around the wheel in the center of the board for extra goodies. Players can get cash, bonus points or are empowered to &ldquo;Drain The Swamp,&rdquo; stealing two political cards from an opponent.&#10;&#10;&bull;Players can also receive Kremlin Cash to help fund their campaign, but might find themselves the subject of an FBI investigation down the road, losing $500 and two political cards.&#10;&#10;&bull;The October Surprise Win: The final stage of the game is the October Surprise. This occurs when all the political spaces are owned, and there is nothing left to buy. Whenever a &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; is triggered on the board, the two players with the least number of electoral votes are forced to roll off against each. The player with the lowest roll is eliminated from in the game. This continues until one player has enough votes to win or is the last player standing.&#10;&#10;",

All cards are placed face down on the table and shuffled together.&#10;     All cards are then dealt face up on the place holder cards which are lettered A-F (for up to 6 players).&#10;     Once all ridiculous cards have been read out it is then time for all other players to choose a letter card and bet some chips on which card you think the initial clue was about.&#10;     Once all players have placed their bets with the somewhat strange betting chips the original card is revealed by placing the bottle opener on it.&#10;     All players can now reveal which card they thought it was by turning over their letter card.

This is the powerking (Kraftk&ouml;nig). Then the players set alternately pieces of their color on the 8 spaces surrounding the powerking (satellites). Then the game spreads to the outer area. Each player may place a piece adjacent to an enemy piece, thereby enclosing a number of enemy pieces between two own pieces. The enclosed pieces (including, should the situation arise, the powerking and his satellites) are turned over to change their color. The game ends when all spaces are occupied.&#10;&#10;The players are awarded points for any pieces of their color: 1 point for each piece in the outer area, 9 points for the powerking and 3 points for each of his satellites.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is a variant of &quot;Reversi&quot; and was released in booklet format in &quot;Bunkerspiele Heft 2 - Spiele unter Kameraden&quot; with the game board and cut-out game pieces in the back of the booklet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The Overlord is responsible for settling any disputes and breaking ties. The winning Lord takes the Thing Token at the top of their opponent&rsquo;s stack, adding it to their point line. The winning Lord then rolls their dice, and play continues.&#10;&#10;The end-game battle for bonus points is triggered when any player reaches 15 points, and players grab for the bonus stars in the center of the table.

    "Description": "DNGN is a solitaire print and play euro-inspired dungeon crawler with a minimalist style and a branching campaign.&#10;&#10;The player assigns cubes to Action Slots on Skill and Equipment cards each turn, determining the Actions they want to take. Each card has three Action Slots, but they must be filled from left to right on each card. Some Action Slots are Exhausting, and will make the cube assigned to them unavailable next turn, and others can only be activated by special Mana Cubes which must first be gained with another Action. Once cubes have been assigned, a Behaviour card is drawn, describing what Monsters will do turn. Only once this is revealed does the Player take her Actions, which may not now be the most efficient choices.&#10;&#10;After the Player has performed her Actions, Monsters resolve their Behaviours according to fixed rules, with four different AI types for different types of Monsters, and unique monster behaviours leading to them behaving in very varied ways.&#10;&#10;Monsters are represented on the map by tokens with minimalist shapes, and a Mission Card shows which shape represents which Monster. The details of each Monster are on a Monster Card, which shows their attributes and special behaviours.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, a timer ticks down, and when it hits zero it resets, but the Player must lose one Stamina cube for the rest of the Mission, a constant fatigue effect that pushes you on and makes Missions harder as they go on.&#10;&#10;At the end of each Mission, the reverse of the Mission card will branch the story depending on whether you succeeded or failed, and sometimes a decision you have to make. There are 18 Mission Cards, but in any one campaign you'll play about 10, so there is high replay value. Every time you succeed in a Mission you'll get a chance to upgrade your Character in a way of your choice, allowing you to customise as you improve.&#10;&#10;DNGN was first released in the BGG 2020 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players board a submarine that goes to the bottom of the sea to find an old sunken city. Equipped with the information board and a sonar device, they make their way to the ocean floor. We can only win together.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the clue cards (that show coordinates relative to the start tile) are shuffled and each player receives one and places it face down in front of them.  One of the remaining clue cards is placed face up in the middle. This face up card indicates where the entrance to the lost city is. The player who was last at the sea begins. This player receives the sonar map, the start card and four red markers.&#10;&#10;When all players have first reached the spot on their clue cards and then the spot with the entrance to the lost city all players have won. If there are fewer than two sea tiles left in the pile, if the submarine was dealt more than six points of damage or if the submarine cannot move the players lose.&#10;&#10;A player takes the following three actions during a turn:&#10;&#10;1) Repair the submarine:&#10;If the sub has a point or more damage, it can  be repaired. To do this, the player takes the topmost sea tile from one pile and take it out of the game. All the damage is repaired.&#10;&#10;2) Move the submarine:&#10;The submarine can move onto an adjacent tile that has already been placed.&#10;&#10;And finally 3) Use the sonar device, which is the main mechanism of the game:&#10;The player chooses one of the top sea tiles and announces where they would like to place it. The turn player closes their eyes and the other players prepare the box according to the instructions on the sea tile. With the help of wooden clips the lid is placed on top so that the player cannot look inside. The turn player opens their eyes and pull the bell at any speed and marks it on the sonar map with the red stones, which places are vacant in each row and are therefore safe for submarine passage. This action can be repeated using the hourglass scale. However, if this is zero, the player has to rely on the first time. The cover is removed and the sonar card is checked. For wrong markers the submarine receives points of damage. After the sonar task is completed the player can place the tile and it is the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;",

In Ragnar&ouml;k, the nine worlds of Yggdrasil collide and people of Midgard, giants of Jotunheim, Dwarves of Svartelfheim, Elves of Alfheim, Odin's riders of War and warriors of Asgard clash in the battle.&#10;&#10;Warriors of Asgard is a 40-card deck and an enormous, detailed miniature of Heimdall. The deck adds a brand new type of units, that possess magical powers, shared by &AElig;sir gods with their people. The new type of warriors is supporting other warriors by making it easier to activate them. There are different types of Asgardian warriors, each wielding one kind of weapon. But each of them, when activated, affect other warriors who require the same type of weapons. Some warriors make it easier to activate others, and some just automatically activate a specific type of weapon. So you can imagine the combo possibilities with that expansion. If you build up a team that works well together, you can easily activate much more cards than usual. We've playtested that expansion and we love the way it affects the decision-making in the game!&#10;&#10;And the other thing the expansion brings is a Heimdall miniature. There is a rule change, where the losing player gets the Heimdall after the battle. Heimdall protects a player's team for one round, and also may give him/her special powers if he decides to attack. The expansion has special cards in the deck, that affect Heimdalls movement as well as his powers. One expansion brings new, big things that add a lot to the game experience and expand the replayability even more!&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you manage to activate a second Rider of War in the same battle, you get 2 Rider's dice more, roll them and add to the pool.&#10;&#10;Those special dice allow you to arm your warriors since they have regular weapon symbols.&#10;&#10;But if you roll the special symbol, it can activate a Rider's ability.

Tourists are gratified through tastings, cheese, photos of the beautiful vistas, along with wine pairings and purchases.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;Naramata is a medium-complexity board game involving point-to-point movement, set collection, time tracks, and variable player powers.&#10;&#10;Players will move across a game board representing an exaggerated depiction of the Naramata region, stopping at wineries to complete various actions to satisfy the tourists attached to their vehicle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You&rsquo;ve come to visit Maple Valley at a very special time - the Night Sky Party is approaching! Play as a bunny furiously trying to decorate for the party and have the honor of hosting.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s the catch - two players win this game! So helping out your neighbor can be very beneficial.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players will draw 2 cards (3 on the first turn) and a trade token. Then, each player tidies a card by discarding it, or giving it to another player at the cost of a trade token. Each player then drafts a villager to help them decorate the for the party for that turn (villagers may help get you more cards, trade tokens, or other benefits). After each player has a villager visit them, it's time to play cards. Item cards are played in front of players and events have have a one time effect and are then discarded. Each player plays cards one at a time until no one has any cards left in their hand, which means you'll have to play your cards even if they aren't so great (like an ugly family heirloom!) After all cards have been played, two players may trade items in front of them if each of them spends a trade token to do so. Two types of items, moon and star decorations, are very important items because they are the victory condition, so be careful how you trade them.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, if a player has at least 5 moon or 5 star decorations, and has the most, the party starts and that player wins! If no player has 5, or if the players with the most are tied, the game continues another turn. However, when the party starts, two players win! If a player starts the party with stars, the player to their left also wins. And if a player wins with moons, the player to their right also wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
