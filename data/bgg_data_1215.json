    "Description": "There is a saying that people are the world&rsquo;s real monsters. Anybody believing that obviously hasn&rsquo;t been to Anno Domini 1666&rsquo;s Vienna. This poor city has been invaded by two creatures so vile that even Klaus, the evil alchemist, wouldn&rsquo;t have them as pets.&#10;&#10;The Basilisk dwells in the city sewers. Once it climbs up to the surface, it flies across the night sky terrorizing citizens with its deadly gaze.&#10;&#10;The Lindwurm is a snake-like scavenger feasting on fresh graves. Its scales make the beast nearly invincible, while the poisonous bite keeps would-be monster hunters at bay.&#10;&#10;This set contains two highly detailed, ready to play miniatures, along with all the character and item cards necessary to use them in the game, plus two game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&bull;&nbsp;2 Highly detailed plastic miniatures&#10;&bull;&nbsp;6 Character cards&#10;&bull;&nbsp;5 Item cards&#10;&bull;&nbsp;1 Rulesheet (two new scenarios included)&#10;&#10;",

People with their guardian Angels travel through the time of their life (days of the week on the game board), getting ether into a Wisdom square, or into a Battle square, depending on the number rolled on the dice. When they land on a square, they draw a Wisdom or a Battle card and play them out according to the rules.&#10;&#10;The main resource in the game is Grace, which is represented by the colored rubber bands. People are awarded Grace when they draw from the sources of Wisdom and build the Church. They use up Grace when fighting Passions in Battles.&#10;&#10;Wisdom cards contain short stories from the Bible (or other sources), that players are asked to re-tell with their own words. The players are rewarded with Grace, depending on the completeness of the story. After the story telling, they go into building the Church from the puzzle pieces.&#10;&#10;Battle cards describe the life situations the People get into and what the Angles and the Passions advising them to do in these circumstances. Depending on the difficulty of the situation, there are from one to four Passions attacking the Person. Your goal is to help the angles to knock them down by shooting them with the Grace you&rsquo;ve accumulated so far. If you can&rsquo;t shoot down all the Passions, the Person goes into the Sinful Circle &ndash; an inner circle on the game board, where all the squares are Battle squares.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll be building the church out of puzzle pieces on every Wisdom turn and on every successful Battle turn. If a Battle is lost, you don&rsquo;t get to build the Church.&#10;&#10;The game is over, when the Church is built. Everyone wins, but those with the most Grace bands left deserve the biggest praise.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Whether you take the role of the punks trying to reclaim the streets or the mega-corps fighting for optimized profit portfolios, there's gun play, sneaking about and homicidal security bots to be wary of.&#10;&#10;Based on the Squad Hammer game system, players coming from Squad Hammer or any of its historical derivatives like Trench Hammer or Hammer of Democracy should have no trouble adjusting.&#10;&#10;To new players, this is a simple game system featuring straight-forward combat with a lot more depth than you might suspect at first glance. Players can pick up the core mechanics in a matter of minutes.&#10;&#10;The rules are lavishly illustrated and feature 8 detailed and varied scenarios from Virus Upload to Gridlock as well as a way to link a chain of scenarios together to play a quick campaign.&#10;&#10;Mechanics are included for stealth jobs as well as customizing your tough street rats or corporate merc squad.&#10;&#10;The future is here. Are you wired?&#10;&#10;Chrome Hammer is a stand alone game. While Squad Hammer is useful for options and ideas, it is not needed to play.&#10;&#10;Any scale of miniatures can be used, provided they are based individually.&#10;&#10;A typical game features about 5 figures for the punks, while the corporates typically have 10-25 figures. If you have existing scifi armies, you almost certainly have suitable models in your collection ready to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Knyghte Pyke and Sworde is a set of miniatures gaming rules for &quot;mass skirmish&quot; games ranging from 4-5 figures on each side up to battles with 30-40 figures each.&#10;&#10;As the name suggests, the rules are intended for dark age through medieval battles though I have included provisions for early firearms as well.&#10;&#10;The game play is simple and straight-forward, allowing you to focus on the drama unfolding instead of digging through the rulebook every 17 seconds. &#10;The rules are strictly 1 figure equals 1 combatant, meaning the game is about raids, skirmishes and patrols. The stuff where we get to know each soldier and naming our heroes matter.&#10;&#10;Core game mechanics include:&#10;&#10;     Alternating turn sequence.&#10;     Opposed rolls between individual figures for hand to hand combat and a straight roll vs target number for missile combat.&#10;     Injury rolls and morale checks are both taken by rolling 2 dice and seeing how many dice roll over a target number (meaning instead of troops always being okay or dead/routed, we have a third option as well)&#10;     As exhausted troops are vulnerable to close combat, counter-attacking can help turn the tide after an enemy charge.&#10;     Each troop type receives a straight forward mechanic allowing them to be differentiated on the table. Chargers are powerful on the attack while Polearm troops can engage horsemen more effectively. 7 base troop types are included.&#10;     3 types of individual figure is included: Scouts that can be used for delaying in the turn sequence, fighters are mighty with a sword while captains can inspire your soldiers to enhanced actions.&#10;&#10;&#10;Of course no Nordic Weasel game would be complete without some extra goodies including:&#10;&#10;     Advice and mechanics for playing on a big map.&#10;     Campaign rules with simple experience and casualty mechanics.&#10;     Tables to award your leaders with rewards and to grant advantages and drawbacks to future battles.&#10;     A weather table.&#10;     Points values to build your own troops.&#10;     A scenario system to set up a battle with multiple ways to play.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game can be played with any individually mounted figures. You can get started with as little as 4 miniatures each, with a typical game being about 20-40. If you have existing armies, odds are you can dive right in. If you don't, you won't need to buy very much.&#10;&#10;The game was written with figures from 15-28mm in mind. 6mm and 10mm skirmish is gaining in popularity. Players should simply take all measurements and read them as centimeters instead (so 5&quot; becomes 5 cm).&#10;&#10;Solo mechanics are not specifically included, though the game is fairly easy to solo.&#10;&#10;As the mechanics are very simple, this is also a good choice for resolving battles in your RPG campaign.&#10;&#10;Fantasy rules are not specifically included at this time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Avoid bankruptcy, hopelessness, or over-pollution by playing real world solutions in the face of familiar climate events.&#10;&#10;Green House is a turn-based cooperative card game where each player starts by drawing and revealing a climate event card (like hurricanes, disease outbreaks, wildfires, etc.) Then playing a climate solution (called an action card) from their hand. Both event cards and action cards affect a communal pool of resources including greenhouse gas tokens, money tokens, and hope tokens.&#10;&#10;Players lose together if they collect too many greenhouse gas tokens, of if they run out of money, hope, or event cards. They win together if they eliminate all the greenhouse gas tokens in the game. Some action cards have a momentum icon, indicating that players can chain them together to increase positive game effects.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different variants including zero and single player versions for solo play, and a semi-cooperative role-playing version where players can play as different roles (family, corporation, government, non-profit) with different starting money allocations, action card draw piles, and special abilities that modify game play. In the semi-cooperative role-play version, players can run out of money independently, eliminating them from the game while others play on. This version invites negotiation and the strategic use of variable player powers.&#10;&#10;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They do not understand either Arabic or Greek. However, they strongly want Brave Knights and Fair Maidens to travel with them to the stars.&#10;&#10;Players are divided into medieval humans and aliens, who came with a friendly visit. Now they have to find a common language and decide which alien ships will go to the stars with humans onboard.&#10;&#10;Players take turns: first one of humans, then one of the aliens, then again one of the earthlings, etc.&#10;Humans use cards with medieval objects that are on the table or with already played cards from their hands and try to identify which symbols can aliens use to name objects. &#10;Then one of the Aliens invites humans on the ship he has chosen for departure in this round by using symbolic description. The rest of Aliens are betting - where else can humans go by mistake.&#10;&#10;The game continues until humans send all their representatives into space. The winner among Aliens is the one who have collected the highest amount of humans on their ships. The winner among humans is the one who sent more people into space and revealed most of the words from alien language, which are defined by his card of secret goal.&#10;&#10;We tried to pay attention to all questions and suggestions from players in First Contact original game. So this time we made gameplay more diverse and deep, managed to solve the problem of active involvement of all players in each round, and in the end our game is more competitive now.&#10;&#10;First contact: The Second Coming is compatible with the original game and you can still play this version with original rules.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "New content and play mode for Rise of Tribes: SOLO MODE&#10;&#10;A strange tribe, the Vul'Keth, has invaded the land and is intent on being its only inhabitant. The player's tribe opposes the invaders advancing their tribe to win (scoring 15 points) before the Invaders summon all five of their warlords - their win.&#10;&#10;The Vul&rsquo;Keth Invasion (solo mode) is designed to give a challenge to experienced players and capture the same feel as a multi-player game. The invaders take minimal and fast but impactful turns, giving the player tons of great decisions as they work to deny the invaders achieving goals.&#10;&#10;If players thought it was enough for your tribe to master the lakes, forests and mountains they were sadly mistaken. Another mysterious tribe has appeared and these invaders - with their aggressive warlords - intend to drive the tribe players have choosen to be from this land. Players need to establish their tribe's dominance before it's too late!&#10;&#10;The Vul&rsquo;Keth Invasion (solo mode) presents players with the challenge of racing to victory while holding back an invading tribe lead by warlords with unique powers that will disrupt and devastate your progress. Players will take their turns in the usual way using a unique board set up for two tribes. Don't expect the Vul'Keth invaders to be a usual opponent.&#10;&#10;Each turn the invaders will determine their actions by drawing a card from one of three action decks. These cards also supply them with a goal. Players must stop the Vul'Keth from achieving their goals or the invaders will be rewarded with resources. Not worried about a few resources? At the end of their turn the invaders summon a warlord for every six resources they have, and if all five of the warlords are summoned to your land then the battle is over and your tribe must flee in defeat at the hand of the Vul'Keth!&#10;&#10;The Vul'Keth Invasion is compatable with the Bronze expansion (see: Rise of Tribes: Beasts &amp; Bronze). When added in, the player may complete 3 Bronze Age Technologies for the win, or win by scoring 15 points, if traditional Stone Age resistance to the invasion is working the best.&#10;&#10;Bonus: NEW 9th Tribe!&#10;The Vul&rsquo;Keth foe inspired us to create the 9th unique playable tribe in multiplayer games. Players gain either Seize or Pillage when they play with Leader powers!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Constellars are key counsels to many generals of the Elemental Kings. These prized advisors are sourced for their flair to visualize a cosmic alignment - a strategic placement of worlds that collectively enables massive generation of magical energy crucial in sustaining a significant army.&#10;&#10;TKG ARENA: Cosmic Alignments is a game set up for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Components required for this game:&#10;    &#10;WORLD TILES:    48&#10;OINKS:    13 from each element (Default)&#10;LIFE TOKENS:    33 for each player (Default)&#10;&#10;Winning Condition&#10;&#10;The first player to achieve a Cosmic Alignment &ndash; which is 3 adjacent occupied world tiles bearing the player&rsquo;s chosen Oinks placed across the playing grid linearly in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal manner wins.&#10;&#10;If there are no Cosmic Alignments achieved when the game ends, the player with the most victory points wins. Each player will first total up the number of each type of the elemental insignias on all the world tiles he/she has captured at game end. When the elemental insignia matches the elemental type of the player&rsquo;s Oink, it scores 2 victory points, otherwise each elemental insignia scores 1 victory point for the player. If there is a tie, the player with more occupied world tiles, followed by the number of LIFE tokens in play (on the grid) wins. If there is a further tie, the players may rejoice in their joint victory.&#10;&#10;Ending Condition&#10;&#10;The game will end immediately when one of the following happens:&#10;&#10;1.    A Cosmic Alignment is achieved.&#10;2.    All world tiles in the playing grid are fully occupied (with LIFE tokens and/or Oinks).&#10;3.    A player has captured 5 world tiles.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;Players are randomly assigned one of the four elements before taking turns to draw 3 world tiles at one time from a stack of shuffled world tiles to place one of them down towards forming a 4 x 4 layout of 16 tiles with the grid sides facing up. The leftover world tiles not placed are reshuffled to form a new world tile stack ready for the game. The schematic below labels each world tile from A to P to facilitate the explanation. Each player takes 13 Oinks and 33 LIFE tokens representing his/her assigned element as his/her personal supply.&#10;&#10;A    B    C    D&#10;E    F    G    H&#10;I    J    K    L&#10;M    N    O    P&#10;&#10;Within each World Tile (Grid Side)&#10;&#10;Within each world tile, we will see that the space is further divided into positions in a 4 X 4 grid and they are labeled from 1 to 16 as seen by the schematic below:&#10;&#10;1    2    3    4&#10;5    6    7    8&#10;9    10    11    12&#10;13    14    15    16&#10;&#10;Game Flow&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts first in clockwise order. The first player may place one of his/her LIFE tokens from his/her personal supply in any of the 16 spaces from any of the 16 world tiles.&#10;&#10;Let us assume that it is placed on the world tile A, position 12. The next player can then only place his/her LIFE token in a world tile which is macroscopically aligned to the position of this last placement in the bigger grid. In this case, it will be world tile L.&#10;&#10;This player decides to place it at position 2 in world tile L, which means the following player will have to place his/her LIFE token in world tile B (which is aligned macroscopically to position 2 in any world tile.).&#10;&#10;A player must put down one of his/her LIFE tokens if there is space in the world tile directed by the previous player. If he/she is directed to an unoccupied world but all the spaces within are taken up, he/she may put her LIFE token on any unoccupied space in any world tile.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of LIFE tokens to be put down on a directed world tile, he/she must take one of his/her own played LIFE tokens from the rest of the world tiles to carry out this action. LIFE tokens already placed on the directed world tile cannot be chosen for this purpose.&#10;&#10;Whenever an alignment of 3 LIFE tokens of any player is linearly placed across the grid within a world tile in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal manner; or all spaces in a world tile are occupied with LIFE tokens and a player holds the majority (in the event of a tie in majority, the player that forms the majority later wins), that player must return all LIFE tokens on it to all players and chooses one of these 2 actions:&#10;&#10;1.    Flips the world tile over and places one of his/her Oinks on it to occupy it. This world tile is considered occupied. In a subsequent move, if any player is directed to occupied tiles like this one, he/she may choose to place his/her LIFE token on any world tile.&#10;&#10;2.    Takes the world tile into his/her personal supply for victory point purposes and replaces this world tile with another from the world tile stack with the grid side facing up. This world tile is considered captured.&#10;&#10;If a player decides that the state of a world tile is occupied rather than captured, it will remain so till the end of the game and vice versa. These two states are not inter-changeable once decided during the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues with the last placement directing the next player to the next world tile till the ending condition is met.&#10;&#10;",

Players defend three cities against these incoming warheads by placing Targeting Markers at aiming points for antimissile weapons. You lose if any of your cities are hit by an incoming warhead.&#10;&#10;Games usually last 15-20 minutes.

The presence of the Nazi flag and of Berlin as a short-cut space, together with the absence of a Soviet Union flag, suggests that it was published shortly after the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact.&#10;&#10;The board has a circular track made up mostly of national flags. There also are two straight tracks the cross the board at right angles. These are possible shortcuts.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice and move one of their three planes forward by the number shown. If a plane lands on Mount Fuji, it can take the shortcut across to Mount Everest, which takes only 8 spaces instead of 22. If a plane on the shortcut lands on the North Pole, the central space, it can turn toward Berlin and reach the finish line in only five spaces. A second shortcut is possible by landing on the Airship space, directly across from the finish line. This allows the plane to skip the second half of the circle. The first player to get all three players to the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;While the theme is about pleasure travel, competition is cutthroat. Any plane landing on the same space as another one &quot;shoots down&quot; the first plane, sending it back to start.&#10;&#10;The rules are printed on the back of the board and appear in Japanese, English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A product card is drawn, not being shown to the buyer. A star coin is flipped to determine if it's a 1-star or 5-star review. The Reviewers then has 2 minutes to write a review. After the time is up, everyone reads their review, doing their best impersonation of the Persona Card. The Buyer tries to guess what the product is. If correct, the Buyer Scores a star point. The Buyer then chooses the &quot;Most Helpful Review&quot; and gives a star point to their favorite written review and chooses the &quot;Best Impersonation&quot; and gives a star point to the best impersonation of the Persona Card. The game ends after everyone's had a chance to be the Buyer once. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;What if there's a tie? In the case of the tie, the players in a tie have a SUDDEN DEATH round, where they battle directly against each other. The players in a tie each take a unique product card, careful not to show anyone else. They flip over a Persona Card for everyone to see. They then write and act the review out. All other players play as a Buyers, and will use their own star points to reward the overall performance of who they think did the best.&#10;&#10;",

It is now time to undertake a journey to retrieve them. Will you be able to do it before anyone else?&#10;&#10;RULE BOOK&#10;&#10;Components&#10;- 1 Ancient Egypt board game&#10;- 150 coloured pyramids (30 each in Red, Blue, Yellow,&#10;Green, Black)&#10;- 186 Illustrated cards:&#10;              - 110 movement cards (24 for each symbol: Light, Dark,&#10;                 Nature and Water + 14 &quot;Eye of Horus&quot;)&#10;              - 36 Gods Cards&#10;              - 40 Event cards&#10;- 1 bag for hieroglyphics&#10;- 300 hieroglyphs&#10;- 75 beetle tokens (15 for each player)&#10;- 5 Player scrolls&#10;- 5 hieroglyphics holders (1 for each player)&#10;- 5 pawns (1 for each player)&#10;- 5 scorekeepers (1 for each player)&#10;- 1 rule book.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION OF THE GAME&#10;Place the board in the middle of the table.&#10;Each player chooses a color. Each player is given 30 Pyramids, 1 pawn, 1 scorekeepers of the chosen colour, 1 player scroll, 15 scarab tokens and 1 hieroglyphic holder.&#10;Each player places his marker token on the Start square of the marker, and places his pawn on the Pyramid of Hours square; it will be the starting square for all players. &#10;Before you start the game, distribute it to each player: &#10;- 4 movement cards&#10;- 3 Gods cards&#10;- 10 hieroglyphs &#10;Now place the Movement card deck, the Gods card deck, the Event card deck and the hieroglyphics bag next to the board. &#10;You are now ready to begin.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME&#10;The aim of the game is to get the highest number of points. You earn points when you reach on the board the pyramid corresponding to the God card in your hand and you have previously formed the name of the corresponding God with hieroglyphics. (Example: the God Card HORUS is formed by the hieroglyphics corresponding to the letters H , O, R, U, and S. If you reach the &quot;Pyramid of Horus&quot; box on the board and you have the necessary hieroglyphics [see the conversion of letters into hieroglyphics on your player's scroll], you will have conquered the HORUS Card and you will be able to advance on the scoreboards with the value of the Card: in this case Horus is formed by 6 letters and therefore worth 6 points. &#10;&#10;&#10;TURN OF GAME &#10;The older player starts first. The game then proceeds clockwise. Each player in his turn can make 1 of these moves (only one):&#10;&#10;- draw 2 movement cards;&#10;&#10;- move on the map - The player can move on the board using the movement cards. Each movement card corresponds to the 4 colors on the map and the player must use the exact color and quantity indicated on the boxes to move on the board. (Example: the pyramid of Horus and Anubis are connected by 4 blue &quot;water&quot; squares + 2 yellow &quot;light&quot; squares; then the player must play 4 water movement cards + 2 light movement cards, for a total of 6 cards).&#10;           - If the player reaches the pyramid of the God card in his possession and has previously formed his name with hieroglyphics, he can put his coloured pyramid on top of the pyramid square. He then moves the scorekeepers along the number-marker corresponding to the value of the card, places a scarab token on his player's scroll. Finally, he discards the newly conquered God Card and can draw a new one. The hieroglyphs he used to form the name must be discarded, and the player may draw the hieroglyphs from the bag of the same number as the newly discarded ones. &#10;          - If the player reaches any pyramid on the map without having the right to        conquer it, nothing happens and his turn ends.&#10;         - If the player reaches the Event square, draw 1 Event card.&#10;&#10;- Draw 1 hieroglyph from the bag, but first he must pay by placing an uncovered hieroglyph in front of the bag. (or the player can choose 1 hieroglyph from those already uncovered, always paying with his own hieroglyph).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;When the Gods card deck is finished and one of the players wins his last God card, the final round begins for all players (except for the same player who has already finished the game).&#10;After the final round, the game ends and the players move on to calculating their final score.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;Players should have already marked on the scoreboard the points earned by winning each God card. Each player must then add 5 points for each scarab token they have previously deposited on their personal scroll. &#10;In addition, the player who has conquered more than 2 or more &quot;sons of Horus&quot; has bonus points:&#10;2 sons of Horus: 5 bonus points&#10;3 sons of Horus: 8 bonus points&#10;All 4 sons of Horus: 10 bonus points&#10;The player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players have the same number of points, the player who has won the most sons of Horus wins the game. In the unlikely event that they are still in a draw, the player who has won the &quot;Amon-Ra&quot; card wins.&#10;&#10;1-PLAYER-VARIANT: &#10;In the 1-player variant, the Gods Cards, the hieroglyphics, the scarab tokens, the player scroll and the movement cards are required. &#10;The player at the beginning of the game has 3 Gods cards and must form his name with hieroglyphics in order to win the card. To buy a hieroglyph you must use an element card without distinction (in the normal version they are called movement cards).&#10;Once the name is formed, the corresponding God card will be discarded and another card can be drawn. For each God card won  you need to apply a scarab token to your Player scroll.  &#10;The game ends when the Gods card deck ends (you can decide at the beginning of the game if you prefer to play with fewer Gods cards).&#10;Calculation of points and winnings: After you have formed the name of the last God of the deck, proceed with the calculation of the score (5 points for each scarab token + the specific points of each God card).&#10;If the totalized score is higher than the number of the element cards paid, you win the game, otherwise you lose.&#10;You can also play this variant with more players!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Sleep with your moccasins on. Them Red Devils are going to fight before day.&rdquo; &ndash;Comment by a member of the Indiana Militia on the evening of November 6, 1811 at the Tippecanoe Bend of Burnett&rsquo;s Creek, near Prophetstown.&#10;&#10;By early 1811, tensions in the western portion of Ohio and the remaining Northwest Territory were increasing almost daily. Conflict with Great Britain loomed, and the Native American inhabitants were also alarmed regarding increasing US settler encroachments on their lands in violation of the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskatawa (who many Americans nicknamed &ldquo;Prophet&rdquo;), traveled amongst the various tribes and nations seeking to unite the diverse native inhabitants into a force that could counter the growing US threat. Many of the followers of the brothers&rsquo; messages flocked to Prophetstown, where Tenskatawa took up residence, in the Indiana Territory. US General William Henry Harrison, alarmed at the growing force of Native American warriors, assembled an army and began moving towards Prophetstown.&#10;&#10;Tecumseh counseled that war had to be avoided until the British initiated hostilities with the US, which he believed would occur in 1812. However, Tenskatawa claimed in his visions that an earlier battle with Harrison&rsquo;s army would be successful. When Tecumseh set out in late October 1811 to travel one more time to meet with the Native American leaders that were not at Prophetstown, the Prophet took the opportunity to order a daring night time attack on the American army encamped nearby. One of the most epic battles fought between the US and the Native Americans was about to take place. Can you do as well, or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of A Dark and Dastardly Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 inch map with Turn Record Track.&#10;&bull;    90 double-sided counters.&#10;&bull;    This set of rules with Game Turn/Record Track.&#10;&#10;Players will also need a standard deck of playing cards (a custom card set for this and all of the other games in the Battles of Old Northwest series is available from the publisher) and a six sided die are needed to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Benghazi Handicap scenarios take the action from March 1941 - April 1941, right up to and including Rommel's defeat at Tobruk during Easter 1941. &#10;Each scenario includes its own detailed historical summary.&#10;&#10;These 8 small scenarios are adapted from the ATS system to ASL.&#10;&#10;SEBCHA EL SEGHIRA, LIBYA, 31 March 1941: Shortly after Rommel arrived in Tripoli, offensive action was on his mind&mdash;contrary to his standing orders to eschew any offensive action for the time being. The Desert Fox began his first offensive in North Africa with a &lsquo;reconnaissance probe&rsquo; on 31 March, targeting the British advanced positions by Maaten Biscer. At 0600 hours a flying column consisting of medium tanks, armored cars, and a single 88mm gun towed by a prime-mover left their assembly area nine kilometers to the west of El Agheila. The scratch-force promptly advanced along the Via Balbia until, at about 0800 hours, contact was made with the enemy. Two troops of British cruiser tanks were encountered near Kilometer 3 on the Via Balbia. The Germans immediately moved into combat formations, the &lsquo;88&rsquo; was un-limbered and went into action, dispersing the enemy tank formation without hitting any tanks. A running fight then took place for some six kilometers, concluding after the British made another attack, only to be driven off by the column....&#10;&#10;ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS&mdash;BENGHAZI HANDICAP is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa. It's about time the desert warfare goodness that was spawned by Hal Hock's seminal work TOBRUK back in 1975... was brought to the gaming tables of ASLers. And now it is, in a big way.&#10;&#10;ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS&mdash;BENGHAZI HANDICAP continues the series with Rommel's push to re-take Cyrenaica in 1941, going against Hitler's orders and confounding Italian Comando Supremo. We know YOU won't be confounded, and are ready, willing and able to go along for a wild ride past Mersa el Brega, Derna, hello Mechili, we're back...and beyond to the gates of the jewel...Tobruk!&#10;&#10;You receive a set of 8 scenarios, all depicting actions from the exciting offensive, rife with combined-arms actions. And yes, these are aimed at playability. Slap them down, bang them out, do it again. And again. Please do a little hooting and hollering while you're at it... at least when you roll 'snakeyes' (or the other guy rolls 'boxcars').&#10;&#10;ASL Comp Afrikakorps: Benghazi Handicap contains:&#10;8 action-packed scenarios depicting actions from Rommel's drive into Cyrenaica&#10;Color cover sheet&#10;Descriptive back sheet&#10;Ziploc style storage bag&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 20XX, Dr. Mad Dicenykov&rsquo;s robot &ldquo;Godra,&rdquo; the strongest robot in the universe, was completed. The person who wins this robot -- ten times stronger than Helltoken -- will be the king of the universe! However, ten secret stone orbs scattered across the cosmos are needed to start Godra. Two evil organizations, the Magic Society Fumblers and the Revolutionary Army Sun Seater, race to collect the orbs. Dr. Dicenykov has promised ownership of Godra to the first organization to find them all. Now we see evil against evil dropped into the middle of the Cologascal Islands in Nankai&rsquo;s secret area! Fight! Two dice will roll!&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Players control evil organizations. Victory is won when 10 stone orbs are recovered before the other team.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds consisting of two parts:&#10;Fleet battles&#10;Landing operations&#10;&#10;During fleet battles, players sink the opponent's ships with a die cannon (random type remote weapon).&#10;&#10;In the second half, landing operations, the soldiers remaining from the fleet battle are divided to conquer &ldquo;Island Cards&rdquo; arranged in the center of the table. If players land the required amount of soldiers on the island, that player will earn the stone orb hidden on the island. However, it is important to be careful because the soldiers who land on the same island will eliminate each other. During the round, players receive support from the merchant, Gafnorick, from Dr. Dicenykov&rsquo;s support organization. Players can build up their base with a variety of items like robot brigades that can be used as mercenaries, or a secret weapon that empowers the function of the die gun.&#10;&#10;",

Goal of the game is to defend each dungeon from each hero with the corresponding monster type. Players also receive 10 dungeon cores, which function like victory points in the game.&#10;In a turn a player plays one card in front of them and then gives 1 card face down to a player of their choice. That player may accept or reject the card. It could be a monster card which can be put in the dungeon or a special card which effect has to be carried out immediately.&#10;Then, the player draws back up to 4 cards and it is the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile is empty players enter the scoring phase and check if the combined power of their monsters is higher than the hero's power. If the hero's power is higher it deducts that number from the dungeon cores. Whoever has the most dungeon cores is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Utilizing scares, wards, and powerful abilities, guard The Scare Factory and keep those secrets safe.&#10;&#10;The Scare Factory is a 1-4 player cooperative game that combines tower defense and maze building concepts into a 90-to-120 minute romp split into two phases.&#10;&#10;Each game will begin with the random pulling of rule cards that define an almost infinite set of scenarios for the enemy invasion. During the first phase, players will build a maze and set traps with resources that the rule card&rsquo;s defined. It&rsquo;s integral that players work together to build scare chains that drive away roaming mercenaries and occultists, as each fleeing foe will deplete the bosses vast resources and HP. However, with each turn, the summoning of the boss moves closer and once it arrives, their resources, which during phase one are inactive, become active, and the challenge to keep the Underworld secrets safe becomes much more daunting.&#10;&#10;To give any hope of success, players must empower their Underworld characters cooperatively with ability cards that double as their HP, and a leveling system built on scaring. Only by working together and creating powerful character builds and combinations, will the player defend the Scare Factory and keep the secrets safe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This king was anointed as prophet, priest, and ruler by the gods themselves, and charged with maintaining Ma&rsquo;at, cosmic balance and order, over the land of Egypt and its people. The right of law, the right of rule, the right of war, and of judgment were granted to the Pharaoh, and in his wisdom and with the gods&rsquo; guidance, Egypt prospered.&#10;&#10;When the war of the gods began, each deity sought the Pharaoh&rsquo;s support. Who better to champion their cause than the very mortal they had endowed with such powers? Yet, such a decision would upend Ma&rsquo;at and throw the cosmic order into chaos. With the very sagacity granted to him by the gods, the Pharaoh declared that one man alone, however exalted, could not decide the war by fiat alone. The Pharaoh would watch, protect the people against the war&rsquo;s worst depredations, and maintain Ma&rsquo;at through the transition to monotheism while honoring all gods equally.&#10;&#10;Thus, the Pharaoh balances the needs of the gods with the political and social needs of mortalkind. The battle in heaven shall not overflow into a civil war on earth, not so long as the Pharaoh still draws breath.&#10;&#10;The Pharaoh expansion introduces a whole new dimension to Ankh: Gods of Egypt. This expansion brings the divine struggle closer to the world of men, and one man in particular: the Pharaoh of all Egypt! The gods will do well to send their priests into the royal palace in order to influence the affairs of the kingdom, manipulating the different offices in order to gain political advantage and steer the Pharaoh towards recognizing the ultimate divinity of the one true god. Your struggle may be divine, but if you fail to enforce your dominance over the human sphere of affairs, all that awaits you is oblivion.&#10;&#10;The Pharaoh expansion comes with:&#10;&#10;31 figures:&#10;- 1 Golden Pharaoh figure&#10;- 3 Ra Priest figures&#10;- 3 Isis Priest figures&#10;- 3 Amun Priest figures&#10;- 3 Osiris Priest figures&#10;- 3 Anubis Priest figures&#10;- 3 Horus Priest figures&#10;- 3 Hathor Priest figures&#10;- 3 Set Priest figures&#10;- 3 Thoth Priest figures&#10;- 3 Bastet Priest figures&#10;1 Palace dashboard&#10;5 Sphinx tokens&#10;4 Sphinx cards&#10;40 Political cards&#10;1 Rules Booklet&#10;Additionally, Kickstarter backers also get 5 Kickstarter Exclusive 3D sculpted plastic Sphinx pieces, as well as a Kickstarter Exclusive deluxe Palace Board printed on thick cardboard.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To begin players, choose which of the Lodge Officers they wish to play as, Inner Guard, Junior Warden, Senior Warden or Director of Ceremonies? All Officers are equal and enter the Lodge, at The Tyler&rsquo;s Step, in the 1st degree. Linear Progress around the lodge is achieved by dice roll (D12), Using the &quot;On The Square&quot; step Officers may choose to enter the checker Board and take a more direct route. To aid progress through the lodge, Officers collect Gavels (An important Freemasonry device). These can be used to change the result of a dice roll by 1 step each - 1 more or 1 less, up to 3 Gavels can be used each turn, but Officers must have 3 Gavels at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Officers also collect the Tools of each degree, 3 in each degree. Completing a Toolset allows Officers to progress to higher or lower degrees throughout the game. Officers also need to sit in each of the Principal Officers seats, in turn: Inner Guard, Junior Deacon, Senior Deacon, Junior Warden, Senior Warden &amp; Worshipful Master. Achieving each seat also creates more opportunities to move between degrees. Landing on the Worshipful Master at any time also allows for movement between the 3 degrees. Throughout the Officers journey around the Lodge, there are several steps which provide additional help, or sometimes hindrances to progress. The Secretaries, Charity Stewards and Treasures issue summonses, by way of card selection. All of which must be obeyed. Grand Lodge also offers advice by card selection which must be obeyed.&#10;&#10;Special moves: During gameplay, landing on the Junior or Senior Deacons steps allows officers to swap corners, from one step to the other. Landing on the Immediate Past Master step (IPM) Officers, not on the step are able to double their collections of Gavels or Tools while the IPM step is occupied. As a thank, you for the IPM's help, the officer on this step can forgo their dice roll and choose any step to Progress to instead. Land on either of the Visitors steps and officers can get further instruction by rolling the Visitors dice (D20) and referring to the Visitors book for the corresponding instruction. When landing &quot;on the Square&quot; Officers can elect (Before rolling the dice) to enter the checkerboard and move directly towards any step they wish. There is also an opportunity to aid a Candidate throughout their journey if an Officer lands on the Candidate step, you collect your Candidate and each of your dice rolls can be repeated with your Candidates steps. You lose your Candidate when passing the Tyler step. Combining &quot;On The Square&quot; with a Candidate allows you to potentially keep your Candidate much longer.&#10;&#10;When an Officer has progressed through each degree, collected all 9 tools and has sat in each Officer's seat, collecting all 6 along with having a minimum of 3 gavels, that Officer can win the game by being the first to sit in their own seat. They can then win the game and claim to be Master of their Lodge.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends immediately if a player takes the opposing flagship.&#10;&#10;The game may also end in a truce: either because neither player has enough forces left to capture the opposing flagship or because one is offered by one player. If the opposing player refuses the truce offer, he must win within 14 moves or the truce becomes automatic. The winner of a game ending in a truce is determined by the point values of opposing ships captured, between 1 and 5 each.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Europe&rsquo;s marine navigation technology was developing. The East Indian route was still outside reach, nevermind the route through the Gibralter Straight in the direction of England-France.&#10;&#10;The pioneering development of this route came by the fleet of Genoa, a rapidly evolving city. The merchant vessels that sailed from the Republic did not head west immediately, but rather swung left from the Straight of Messina, striking the Aegean Sea, the Black Sea, and the Eastern Mediterranean. They buy spices and dying agents from Islamic merchants, and then bring them to the Flanders to make a profit: beautiful Flemish textiles.&#10;&#10;There are no dazzling golden sheep and no exciting battles with monsters, but in search of &ldquo;the wealth that is right there,&rdquo; the traders pursued their dream of adventure through  grueling voyages.&#10;&#10;You are responsible for either the prestigious Spinola family or the Doria family, and aim for economic development of the family through maritime trade. There are 10 harbors beyond Naples, Antioch and Barcelona. Keep your fleet intact, rich in cargo to gain rights of trade at ports of call.&#10;&#10;The opponent is not only the enemy. Local merchants are also rivals. Align your ship&rsquo;s progress with the shifting importance of the regions and deliver trade goods and victory to Bruges.&#10;&#10;Using a regular deck of cards, some cubes, and a couple simple boards, players will use hand management and fortunate draws to outpace their opponent's trade.&#10;&#10;",

Who knows what strange, abyssal trinkets you might find, among the skeletons of fish and rotting seaweed?&#10;&#10;The Innsmouth Conspiracy, the sixth deluxe expansion for Arkham Horror: The Card Game, invites you to take your first steps in a twisting, time-jumping tale, starting with the campaign&rsquo;s first two scenarios included in this expansion. From the heart of Innsmouth itself to the torturous coastline and beyond, these scenarios tee up an adventure that will continue to unfold across the subsequent six Mythos Packs. Far from including just two new scenarios, however, The Innsmouth Conspiracy brings five new investigators to the table with an undersea trove of player cards to support new types of decks&mdash;along with new mechanics for players to sink their teeth into, including keys, flood tokens, bless tokens, and curse tokens!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
