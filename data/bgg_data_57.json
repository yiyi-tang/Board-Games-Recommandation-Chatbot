    "Description": "Basilica, a game for 2 players, presents the duel of two medieval master masons who are ordered to build a medieval cathedral together. Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.&#10;&#10;The temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.&#10;&#10;The players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.&#10;&#10;Every tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.&#10;&#10;Some tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring. The more areas the player controls, and the bigger these are, the greater the reward for the player. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has claimed more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the year of Vespasian and Titus - the sixth such ordinary consulship that Titus shared with his Imperial father. The civil war of a decade ago is but a memory, and the Flavians have restored peace and order to all corners of the empire, save one. The people of Britannia remain fiercely resistant to the will of their Roman masters, and the emperor has charged YOU with the seemingly impossible task of bringing them to heel.&#10;&#10;Agricola, Master of Britain is a solitaire game of governance and conquest. To master the delicate political situation, you will need the right blend of military force, administration, bribery, and diplomacy. Every action you take matters, changing how the native populace feels about you and your rule. But you'll never know exactly who's with you or against you, because the game tracks this &quot;under the hood&quot;, or, more precisely, &quot;in the cup&quot;.&#10;&#10;Three chit-pull cups (Friendly, Unfriendly, and Hostile) represent the allegiances of the units contained within those cups. After each action you take, one or more of these units are blindly moved from one cup to another. You'll have a general idea of &quot;I'm really cheesing them off&quot; or &quot;I should have a lot of friendlies available for recruitment&quot;, but until you pull a chit, you won't know who your friends really are, or where the next rebellion will spring up. This isn't totally random: certain tribes naturally skew more in one direction or the other, and taking actions to stabilize a region after it's been pacified will diminish the chances of revolt there.&#10;&#10;Building the right armies, and taking the right actions at the right time is key to your success. But the Flavians - and particularly the hated Domitian - expect greater and greater results with each campaign season. You'll need to meet and exceed them if you want to duplicate Agricola's achievement.&#10;&#10;",

Who am I?&quot; She did not remember anything. In the space pod's computer was a black box with records of all the planets it had visited. Bewildered but resolute, she set out to revisit all the planets in reverse order in the hope of retrieving all her lost memories.&#10;&#10;Deja Vu: Fragments of Memory is about memory, but it is NOT a memory game; instead the game focuses on tableau-building and set-collecting, and to win the game, you must perform well both tactically and strategically. In the tactical part, players collect wooden tokens on the map with various combinations of color and shape, and both the color and shape are essential to success! The process of collecting is a pleasantly perplexing mind puzzle.&#10;&#10;In the strategic part, players use the wooden tokens they gained to add cards to their tableau, building up their &quot;card engine&quot;, which serves to generate victory points, reinforce their resource-collecting ability, and improve the engine itself. Should you increase your selection of cards first? Or create more space to save up resources? Maybe you should plant more cosmic flowers? Balanced and efficient long-term planning is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;The central cosmic map, aside from being a place to hold resources, is also a battlefield to contest precious memory fragments which, when paired with the right cards, can earn enormous amount of ictory points for you!&#10;&#10;",

Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of Daimyria?&#10;&#10;Players use cards to influence different sides of the ongoing war.

Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory.

The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling. ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.  Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!&#10;&#10;ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:&#10;&#10;1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.&#10;2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.&#10;3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.&#10;4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.&#10;5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.&#10;6.    Flee Movement: units fleeing continue their movement if Morale checks fail.&#10;&#10;",

The modular map is scalable and customizable, allowing larger or smaller maps to be played for either longer or shorter games.&#10;&#10;During the game, players explore the map by moving units and building towns and cities.  When they encounter other players, fighting begins.  Combat is fought through dice rolling based upon the number of different types of units engaged in battle, the terrain being fought upon, and the presence of a town or city.&#10;&#10;The fighting units are maintained by towns and cities through a unique support system, and gained or lost as their supporting towns and cities are built or captured.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is an area majorities game, where players move their druids on the board, building stone circles and marking them with their dolmens. Once a circle is complete, the dolmens are scored. Each dolmen has a value of 1&ndash;4, unknown to other players, and the value of each dolmen is multiplied, depending on how high it is in the stack &mdash; the higher the better.&#10;&#10;Placing of dolmens requires players to interact. When a druid leaves a space, he leaves a stone behind. Once a player has a majority of stones around a dolmen space (at least two stones, with another player having one stone), she gets to place a dolmen. If another player adds a stone so the amount of stones is tied (2-2, for example), he gets to place a dolmen beneath the stack. When somebody again gets the majority (3-2, for example), he or she places a dolmen on top of the stack. Making sure your 4-point dolmen gets on the top of the stack in a large, valuable area is something of a challenge.&#10;&#10;The game ends when somebody runs out of dolmens or stones. Unfinished areas are scored in the end (finished areas are scored as soon as they're done) and the player with the highest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The description from the publisher's website describes what the theme is about:&#10;&#10;Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is a luck-free majorities game. Move through dark and mystical Ireland, create the valuable stone circles and mark them with your dolmen, without your fellow players knowing their worth. Only at the end is it clear who has created the most valuable dolmen.&#10;&#10;Approximately 240 stone circles of Celtic origin have been found so far in Ireland. These stone circles, which originate in ancient times and were built by druids, often served as ritual places or enclosed burial areas. In their center were frequently dolmen, which rank among the oldest megaliths and whose meaning is still not perfectly clear.&#10;&#10;The artistic representation of gods on the dolmen - Dolmeng&ouml;tter - led to the assumption that the dolmen served the druids as meditation areas, in which their reincarnation-based cult was practiced.&#10;&#10;",

The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Red Storm&quot; is the second sequel to the Charles S. Roberts Award-winning game Downtown. Red Storm is a standalone game that utilizes the Downtown game system to depict a hypothetical air war in May/June 1987 over the central portion of the NATO/Warsaw Pact front in central Germany.  Like Downtown and Elusive Victory before it, Red Storm is an &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level air warfare game where players manage large strike packages and numerous combat air patrols in an effort to strike enemy targets, protect their own ground troops, and secure control of the air over the land battle raging below.  Both sides have highly advanced all-weather aircraft, long-range missiles, precision bombs, sophisticated electronic warfare assets, and dense air defense networks of surface-to-air missiles and radar-guided AAA.  The game features aircraft from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Soviet Union, and East Germany.&#10;&#10;As the NATO player, you fight outnumbered in the air, but with a qualitative edge in technology and better-trained pilots.  NATO faces the daunting task of contesting the air in the face of the initial onslaught from the WP air forces while also getting bombs onto targets on the ground both on the frontline and rear echelon forces of the Soviet and East German armies.  As the Warsaw Pact player,  you must push your numerous but less flexible forces to the absolute limit in an effort to overwhelm NATO forces in the air and destroy them on the ground, all while supporting advancing ground forces.  Both players also have to manage their air defense networks consisting of overlapping layers of SAM and AAA.&#10;&#10;Units&#10;Like earlier games in the series, units in Red Storm are flights of 1 to 4 aircraft, each tasked with different roles such as bombing, combat air patrol, close escort, or jamming support.  Red Storm features more than 50 types of aircraft, including both older &ldquo;3rd Generation&rdquo; workhorses like the F-4E Phantom II and MiG-23 Flogger as well as advanced &ldquo;4th Generation&rdquo; fighters including the US F-15 Eagle, the UK/West German Tornado, and the Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum. Aircraft from the air forces of Belgium, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are provided.  Ground units depict various types of troop concentrations, SAMs, and AAA assets.  The SAM network on both sides is both more numerous and more dangerous than ever, with low-altitude SAMs like the UK Rapier, US Chaparral, and Soviet SA-13 Gopher joining a daunting array of medium/high altitude SAMs like the US Patriot and Soviet SA-12.&#10;&#10;Maps and Terrain&#10;Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets depict the rough terrain in the central portion of the NATO front line, reaching from the Rhine river in the west to the Thuringia region of southwest East Germany.  The map uses the same scale of approximately 2.5 nautical miles per hex used in earlier games in the series.  This densely populated region of Europe features numerous rivers, cities, and airfields dot the map.  Unlike earlier games in the series, Red Storm features a frontline that moves steadily west as the Warsaw Pact armies advance.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;Like the earlier games in the series, Red Storm requires both players to do planning for both their air and ground forces prior to a scenario.  Raid forces must be generated, targets and routes planned, and aircraft loadouts determined.  SAM, AAA, and radar units must be placed to take advantage of the rough terrain and frequently poor weather of central Germany.&#10;&#10;During a scenario, players go through a sequence of phases each turn where they conduct electronic warfare, use various means to detect and track enemy flights, and move and fight with their flights while potentially being attacked from the ground.  The heart of game is the movement phase where players use a chit-draw system that allows players to alternate moving one to five flights at a time.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;The war depicted in Red Storm is a short one, with just six weeks between the start of the air war and a fateful initiation of nuclear warfare by both sides.  More than 20 scenarios feature a mix of day and night operational missions for both sides, including missions to directly support frontline ground troops as well as many missions that &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; behind enemy lines to strike enemy airfields, logistics, and air defense networks.  These range in size from smaller, partial-map ones that can be played in an afternoon to very large, full-map scenarios that might take a couple of days to complete.  There are also scenarios depicting reconnaissance missions, airborne drops, helicopter assaults, special forces insertions, cruise missile strikes, and delivery of nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps&#10;1,260 die cut counters&#10;One Rules Booklet&#10;One Scenario Booklet&#10;One Appendices Booklet&#10;Five Full-Color Player Aid Cards&#10;Three Full-Color Aircraft Data Cards&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;NATO and Warsaw Pact log sheets&#10;&#10;",

Those of us who want something better... we'll find it somewhere else.&#10;&#10;The Exodus Fleet features resource management and tableau building mechanisms along with a highly interactive system of role selection and bidding in which players compete to hire miners, spaceship builders, and other groups to piece together their own fleet to escape a dying Earth. Just building ships and filling them with refugees will score you points, but making sure your ships work together may give you the advantage you need.&#10;&#10;Players must decide whether to prioritize building ships within one faction (to score bonus points) or whether it might be better to build ships with synergy for powering their actions. Is it better to spend your resources on more ships or rescuing more survivors off of Earth? Should you gamble on explorers or just take a turn to gather more resources? And exactly how much money does my opponent still have? Can they outbid me for the action I really need to perform? A variety of strategic and tactical dilemmas awaits.&#10;&#10;",

It is a game you can take anywhere and play time and time again to discover all the different nooks and crannies of the seven maps included.&#10;&#10;It is a completely unique concept that promises to equally surprise and create headaches in equal measure. In this original game from Devir, you will unfold a map on the table, where you will start at the compass rose with the pointer you will find in the box, moving it along the labyrinth paths marked in white without ever lifting it from the map. You will have to open and close different parts of the map in search of the Impossible Triangle that will allow you to escape the maze. You can go under bridges, climb up ladders and run around in circles in the maze and in your own head until the exit finally leads you to&hellip; the next map!&#10;&#10;In Mazescape: Lab&yacute;rinthos you will go through three well defined territories: the docks, the graveyard, and the mountain. The first of the maps will help you to understand the most essential concepts of the game. Then. from there, they will become progressively more complicated until reaching the final challenge. They also have a bunch of secondary objectives that you can explore to get the very most out of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players are then dealt a hand of animal cards to choose from and must select one single animal to represent them across all three events, competing against the animals selected by the other players. These events are then played out by way of animated discussion and players then vote according to their opinion on the likely rankings (excluding their own animal when voting). Votes score points for the appropriate players and the player with the most points after three events wins.&#10;&#10;The Champion of the Wild combines the fun and laughter of a conversation-driven social game with the challenge of strategic thinking required for animal selection and event tactics.&#10;&#10;Who will be your champion?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cover Your Kingdom is an absurdly ruthless set-collection party game for 2-8 players ages 9+. The game's cutthroat mechanics which make the game a highly-addictive riot-inducer are blunted by the punderfully-whimsical theme.&#10;&#10;The pace of play is fast, with very little downtime, as interactions may occur involving any player at any moment keeping all players on the edge of their seats and prompting loads of impish banter, gloating, and murderous glares. due to its competitive nature, it might not be the best choice of game if you've got a table-flipper in your group.&#10;&#10;However, as long as everyone has a good (or evil) sense of humor, the game will take you on a boisterous ride you'll want to repeat. Cover Your Kingdom is an excellent game for building relationships... or ending them. (Perfect for family reunions!)&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;In Cover Your Kingdom, you and your rivals will each become Rulers of your own fantasy Kingdom. Regrettably, the Kingdoms are creatureless and vacant, and no creatures means no magic. To remedy this problem, you'll contend with the other rulers as you try to convince lengenderpy Creatures (such as Pigxies, Hentaurs, Uniquehorns, and Sighclops) to join your Kingdom.&#10;&#10;You can add them to your Kingdom by forming clans of two matching creatures (or one paired with a Wild Creature), or by recruiting (ahem- stealing) Clans from other Ruler's Kingdoms. Each Creature is worth a certain amount of Magic. The Ruler with the most Magic in their Kingdom at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Kingdoms are divided in two different regions, the Mountains, and the Valley and most creatures will only live in one region or the other.&#10;&#10;As Clans are acquired, they are stacked one atop the other offset by 90 degrees. Each Ruler's Kingdom mat indicates where each kind of Creature may be placed. Only the top Clan in each stack is vulnerable to being recruited by rival Rulers and each new clan you add is an added layer of defense to those beneath it (yes, Clans are layered, like ogres).&#10;&#10;To attempt to recruit another Ruler's Clan, you may show a matching Creature, or a Wild Creature from your hand. Your rival may counter with a Creature of their own, to which you can respond again. This continues until one Ruler cannot, or chooses not to respond.&#10;&#10;The winner takes (or keeps) the Clan adding ALL Creatures used to recruit or defend it. This increases the Clan's value (sometime's drastically) and its allure to other Rulers and if they have the opportunity the will try to swipe it for themselves.&#10;&#10;Rulers take either 1-2 actions per turn, forming Clans, attempting to recruit Clans, adding Creatures to existing Clans, replacing unwanted Creatures by discarding and drawing. and employing the services of Free Creatures.&#10;&#10;Free Creatures do not join Kingdoms, but instead perform an action. Things like forcing another ruler to swap a top Clan from their Kingdom with one of yours, or move a Clan from the top to the bottom of its stack, or remove a Clan from the game entirely.&#10;&#10;The hook of the game lies in its ability to conceive a roller-coaster of emotions, with bursts of elation and despair occurring repeatedly for each player throughout the game. The actions you take, and the order in which you take them, on your turn can have a tremendous impact on your success or failure.&#10;&#10;The end-game is also super intense, as the outcome of the entire game can often be decided in the last few turns, or even with the final card played. It'll keep you all on the edge of your thrones and also make it difficult to put away without &quot;just one more round&quot;.&#10;&#10;Cover Your Kingdom is as fun (and violent) as the people you play it with.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The demand for window glass increased so much that William Stephens, a British businessman, saw the opportunity to expand his business in Portugal by investing in the glass industry.&#10;&#10;In Stephens, players compete amongst one another in the role of master glassmakers working at the famous &quot;Stephens&quot; Factory to become the most prestigious figure in town...after Stephens, of course. Through clever and cunning planning, all players will develop their works, invest in new businesses, and promote the creation of jobs. Through a unique action-selection mechanism, on their turn players choose from a variety of options, either by activating the Stephens factory or by activating one of their personal investments.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the Napoleonic forces arrive in town, at which time the player with the most prestige wins.&#10;&#10;",

Finely-detailed wall and tower pieces link together to form courtyards, and the player who finishes a courtyard claims it with a Keep, scoring points for that courtyard equal to the number of tower pieces surrounding it.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts the game with two decks of cards: a wall deck and a tower deck. Each card allows a player to play the components shown on it, with the wall deck cards always depicting at least one wall (and some combination of walls/towers) and the tower deck cards always depicting at least one tower (and again some combination of walls/towers). On a turn, a player can play as many cards as she wants, but she draws only one card at the end of her turn. The goal is to create courtyards &ndash; and subdivide existing courtyards &ndash; while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Players have the same cards in their decks, so the challenge is all about what to use when. The game ends when all the castle pieces are used up, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Two different pairs of Keep colors are available in the two versions of Castellan, so with two copies of the game &ndash; and the right combination of bits &ndash; up to four players can play.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, thirteen dice are rolled in a pool. A player then drafts two dice: one for their movement around the city, which will place influence, and one for an action. After both players have drafted three times, a non-player character &mdash; one of five in the box &mdash; will use the leftover die for its own movement, affecting the game in its own way. The player who attracted the least attention, that is, who has lowest sum of action dice, takes a special scheming action, then majorities will be scored for each district.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A traditional two-player Japanese card game played with the beautiful Hanafuda (literally 'Flower card') deck.&#10;&#10;Setup: the cards are all shuffled, and one card is randomly revealed: the player whom the birthday month is closer to the revealed card month is the first player and thus the dealer. The cards are shuffled again and handed out, two by two, to both players, as for the face-up talon in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Turn: Then each player proceeds as so: firstly, he discards a card face up on the table from his hand. If that card matches another card on the table (matching months), the player then wins both cards which he puts in his face-up collection, in front of him. The collection is always displayed in 4 columns, as so: Flowers, Ribbons, Animals and Specials. If it doesn't match anything, the discarded card stays on the table. Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.&#10;&#10;Turn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.&#10;&#10;End: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.&#10;&#10;Each Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:&#10;&#10;Basic Yakus&#10;&#10;10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)&#10;5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)&#10;3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points&#10;3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points&#10;5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)&#10;Doe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch&ocirc; : 5 Points&#10;3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank&ocirc; : 5 Points&#10;4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik&ocirc; : 6 points&#10;4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik&ocirc; : 8 Points&#10;5 Specials : Gok&ocirc; : 10 points&#10;&#10;Special Yakus&#10;&#10;The Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)&#10;The Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)&#10;The Iris Flower is a &quot;Joker&quot; card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).&#10;The 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points&#10;No Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player reaches 50 points. In some variants, at the end of a month, the points scored by a player are subtracted from his opponent's score. In some variants, the player with the most points at the end of the year (December) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hoplite, the 15th volume in the Great Battles of History series of games, allows players to recreate classic battles from the pre-Alexandrian Persian-Hellenistic Age, the heyday of the Hoplite (heavy infantry fighting in packed formation). This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.&#10;&#10;Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.&#10;&#10;Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!&#10;  &#10;And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.&#10; The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.&#10;&#10;Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare. And it lets you see how we stack up with the latest (June 2013) book on the subject:&#10;&#10;Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece, Donald Kagan (Editor), Gregory F.

To set up, each player draws ten books from the bag, then places them in a row in front of themselves in the order drawn. Shuffle the six master cards, then lay them out in a row, e.g., red, light blue, gray, brown, yellow, dark blue. Shuffle the deck of action cards, with each player getting a hand of five cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either discard a card from your hand (ignoring its effect) or play a card from your hand. Cards will:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Swap the position of two books in your display, with the number of spaces between these books being specified.&#10;    Move a book in your display a specified number of spaces either left or right, but never past the end of your display.&#10;    Move a book to either end of your display.&#10;    Swap the books on the ends of your display.&#10;    Swap a book of your choice with the book in the opponent's display directly opposite.&#10;    Move a book in the master display 1 or 2 spaces to the left or right.&#10;&#10;&#10;Draw a replacement card to end your turn. As soon as the ten books in your display match the order of the books in the master display &mdash; regardless of whether all the colors are present &mdash; you win.&#10;&#10;Ada's Library differs from Phoenix in two ways. First, it includes only four books of each color whereas Phoenix had five pawns of each color. Second, in Phoenix, a complete game lasted three rounds, and players scored points at the end of each round based on whether they went out, had a pawn of each color, and had 3-5 pawns of a color in a row on their display. Whoever had the most points after three rounds won.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 58 BC, Gaius Julius Caesar was appointed by the Roman Senate as proconsul for Gaul, for which he was given four legions. The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people.&#10;From a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.&#10;&#10;Bibracte 58BC     &#10;Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.&#10;&#10;The Rhine 58BC     &#10;Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.&#10;&#10;The Sabis 57BC     &#10;Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.&#10;&#10;Bay of Biscay 56BC     &#10;The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.&#10;&#10;Britannia 55BC     &#10;Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.&#10;&#10;Lutetia 52BC     &#10;There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.&#10;&#10;Game Features:&#10;&#10;        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.&#10;        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.&#10;        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.&#10;        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.&#10;        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.&#10;        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.&#10;        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.&#10;        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expansion Modules:&#10;&#10;     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia&#10;     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE&#10;     Battles of the Warrior Queen: Covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero.

    "Description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;Last Chance for Victory is the next entry in The Gamers&rsquo; Line of Battle series (LoB) which simulates the Battle of Gettysburg. It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.&#10;&#10;The story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.&#10;&#10;As is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.&#10;&#10;Many things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:&#10;&#10;1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.&#10;&#10;2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?&#10;&#10;3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?&#10;&#10;4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).&#10;&#10;5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?&#10;&#10;6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?&#10;&#10;7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?&#10;&#10;Last Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.&#10;&#10;Aside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.&#10;&#10;As with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.&#10;&#10;Enhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.&#10;&#10;Scenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.&#10;&#10;It replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "South Pacific (SPac) is an Empire of the Sun (EotS) C3i Scenario Variant by RBM Studio that uses the full scope of its parent design. While South Pacific is a complete stand alone game, all of the tactics that work in EotS work in SPac. What is unique about SPac is the smaller map region (see C3i 30 back cover image) focuses and significantly simplifies the strategic options available to the two sides.&#10;&#10;Each side has a 24 card deck that are like the EotS cards except they have been renumbered. The counter mix is also identical, except we have aligned the set up and reinforcement markings to the four-turn scenario. In designing this new C3i Scenario Variant, I wanted to put you in the shoes of MacArthur and Ghormley/Halsey prosecuting the US counterattack, while still being impacted by interservice rivalry, China, and competition for resources in Europe. All of the relevant tracks have been redesigned by Mark Simonitch to fit on the tailored C3i Mapsheet surface that shines a spotlight on the turning point in the Pacific War.&#10;&#10;Since this is a subset of the broader war each player is playing with a four rather than a seven card hand, and you will never reshuffle the deck allowing for high replayability. The practical result of this smaller hand of cards is South Pacific typically clocks in at less than two hours, so easily a one-session game.&#10;&#10;If you learn to how to play South Pacific you will also know how to play its parent game Empire of the Sun.&#10;&#10;(from the designer)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Earth has dried out and civilization with it. Some of the survivors have managed to eke out a living on the Saltlands: plains left behind by a once great ocean. Adapting to their environment they use land sails with wheels on these flats. But the Apocalypse is not done with the Saltlands, from the west a storm of raiders, a terrifying Horde on gas guzzling machines approaches in search of their lost God. Only those among the first to escape have a chance!&#10;&#10;In Saltlands, the first group of players to find and reach an exit point wins, leaving the rest to the Horde. There are no fixed teams, players can decide to co-operate or backstab each other as they see fit. Each player starts the game with a single captain but may increase his crew as the game progresses. Each crew member represents an extra life and an action each turn. Players move with their land sails according to the wind direction: being able to criss-cross slowly upwind or speed in the fastest direction, sailing on a broad reach. Each player can choose which group of raiders to move at the end of their turn until all raiders have moved. This allows players to help each other or force confrontation with the raiders. Players can fight the raiders and take their vehicles as an alternate mode of transport.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sweden Fights On is a tactical battle game featuring four battles from the later half of the Thirty Years War. It is the second volume in the Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&uuml;tzen in 1632.&#10;&#10;The Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.&#10;&#10;Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The four battles in Sweden Fights On are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634 &#10;&#10;&#10;Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Wittstock 1636&#10;&#10;&#10;The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.&#10;&#10;&#10;    2nd Breitenfeld 1642 &#10;&#10;&#10;Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Jankau 1645 &#10;&#10;&#10;Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign aginst the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emporer himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS  772 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;MAP  Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets&#10;&#10;OTHER:  &#10;&#10;    One 10-sided dice &#10;    24-page Series Rulebook &#10;    40-page Playbook (including Lion of the North conversion rules) &#10;    1 11x17 Player Aid card&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A spin off from Martin Wallace's design God's Playground features updated artwork and a new rule set for four players.&#10;&#10;The title is borrowed from book by Norman Davies.&#10;&#10;The game itself is set in Poland.  It covers the period from about 1400 to 1790, which is covered by volume 1 of the two books.&#10;&#10;From BGN:&#10;&#10;In GP, players represent families of Polish nobles who are trying to increase their wealth and influence while fending off enemy nations that constantly threaten Poland.&#10;&#10;The four families are:&#10;Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130; family (white) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82_family  &#10;Sapieha family (red) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapieha_family &#10;Potocki family (blue) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potocki_family &#10;Leszczy&#197;&#132;ski family (yellow) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszczy%C5%84ski_family&#10;&#10;In each of the four turns of GP, players place markers in five different Polish regions, and in a box representing the Polish national army.  Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.&#10;&#10;&#10;Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nierz&#196;&#133;dem Polska stoi&quot; -  nie&#197;&#186;le kto&#197;&#155; powiedzia&#197;&#130;;&#10;Lecz drugi odpowiedzia&#197;&#130;, &#197;&#188;e nierz&#196;&#133;dem zginie.&#10;Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak b&#197;&#130;azn&oacute;w.

Will you be able to grab more than all the other partygoers?&#10;&#10;Auch schon clever (German for &quot;Also Pretty Clever&quot;) features gameplay similar to Ganz sch&ouml;n clever, with one player rolling dice on their turn, then choosing what they want while everyone else gets something from what's left behind.&#10;&#10;On your turn, roll the five dice. The faces of these dice show a joker symbol or an icon on one of four colored backgrounds. Choose all the dice of one background color, taking any jokers at the same time, then use the symbols on these die faces to mark off items in this colored area of your score sheet:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Balloons are in the yellow area, for example, and you must mark them off left to right: red, blue, green, lilac, blue, etc.&#10;    For the train of candles in the orange area, you must have as many candles as are on the next train car in order to mark it out.&#10;    Gifts in the green area can be marked off in any order.&#10;    Sweets in the blue area are depicted in pairs in rows &mdash; doughnuts, cake, cupcakes &mdash; and you mark spaces in a row left to right as long as you have a pair of matching sweets on the dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you can't use a die that you took, e.g., you took red, blue and lilac balloons and could mark off only the first two, then you must return the unused dice to any others left behind. Each other player then chooses dice of a single background color &mdash; and players can choose the same or different colors &mdash; and marks off what they can.&#10;&#10;If you mark off a circled item or a row of gifts next to a circle, you can immediately cross off an item in the section of the same color as that circle. Crossing off this item might give you another bonus!&#10;&#10;When a player marks off all items in one area, the game ends at the conclusion of that turn. Various items or rows that you complete have rainbow stars connected to them, and whoever collects the most rainbow stars wins!&#10;&#10;",

You need to summon and empower your master faster than your rivals. So do your best as now is no time to sleep: Recruit followers, perform dark rituals, bribe officials, or inspire an uprising of the angry mob.&#10;&#10;In Cult: Choose Your God Wisely, you need to send your trusted priests to the most important locations of the Eternal City. They will fight for influence, cult followers, and other benefits to bring your God victory over the minds and souls of the whole world.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players send their priests to chosen locations that are currently accessible to them. As the game progresses, more locations become available. For each location, a winner is determined based on the strength of the priest, but miracles and intrigue cards can dramatically change the outcome of each conflict. The priest who wins the location can use the unique benefit, with other priests getting money instead.&#10;&#10;You can win the game in different ways: by building five chapels, by leading the city's mob uprising, or by performing a dark ritual to summon your cult's master &mdash; one of eight dark gods.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Four Humours, you are a doctor in medieval times, and everyone knows that your personality is determined by an imbalance of your bodily fluids, a.k.a., the four humours:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Choleric (Yellow bile) - Goal-oriented, decisive, ambitious.&#10;     Sanguine (Red blood) - Talkative, enthusiastic, social.&#10;     Melancholic (Black bile) - Analytical, detail-oriented, reserved.&#10;     Phlegmatic (White phlegm) - Relaxed, peaceful, easy-going.&#10;&#10;&#10;The kingdom &mdash; composed of six map tiles with various locations &mdash; is filled with all types of personalities, from choleric sorcerers to phlegmatic peasants. &#226;&#128;&#139;Prove you're the best medieval doctor by visiting citizens throughout the kingdom so they can live out their life's ambitions...or lack thereof.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you play a personality potion from your hand onto a citizen on a scene card to determining that citizen's personality. Each citizen can have one of two potion types played onto it, and you play each token face down so you know the personality of the citizen, but none of the other players do. Once all citizens on two of the scene cards are covered with potions, all potions are resolved in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A lone choleric wins, whereas two or more are discarded, after which...&#10;     Two or more sanguines win, whereas a single one is discarded, after which...&#10;     Exactly two melancholics win, whereas more than two are discarded and a single one sneaks away, after which...&#10;     Any number of phlegmatics win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Place winning potions on the corresponding scene in the kingdom.. If a melancholic token sneaks away, place the potion on an adjacent scene connected by a path or bridge. After all potions have been placed, see whether you've completed any of the four randomized goals on display, such as having a potion on each of the six map tiles or occupying two pairs of locations that are connected by bridges. Then reveal four new scene cards and begin another round.&#10;&#10;When a player completes an objective, the first party tile is resolved.  Party tiles are similar to scenes with citizens, but they are available to play onto on your turn at any point in the game.  Once the players at the table have completed six total objectives, the last party tile is resolved and the game ends.  The player with the most objectives completed wins!&#10;&#10;Alternatively, instead of using a shared kingdom board, you can play in &quot;Fiefdom Mode&quot;, with each player having their own fiefdom board. After resolving scene cards, players place their winning personality potion covering a matching character in your fiefdom.  The objectives now encourage you to cover all characters of certain types or to create a specific pattern within your Fiefdom.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine, February 1943 chronicles the first real ground operations by the US Army in the ETO in WW2. Every wargamer knows this battle was a severe Allied setback. What is not obvious, however, is that Allied troops on the ground gave a good account of themselves against the remnants of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps, despite the ineffective and confused leadership that existed at Corps level.&#10;&#10;In the end, while GIs and Tommies fought their guts out to make up for the mistakes of their leadership, the advantages achieved by initial Axis successes were allowed to blow away in the wind by an equally detached and confused Axis High Command. In its case, how to best exploit the results of their initial attack depended on an argument raging within the Italian Commando Supremo and the persuasive abilities of Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel. After much discussion and the loss of several crucial days, the Axis decided on the less ambitious plan, which was itself no longer even possible.&#10;&#10;Baptism By Fire is the second game in the Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which took players by storm with its block buster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge. The game is designed as a more accessible entry to the system for those who want something smaller and faster than the earlier monster game. Here the wide open desert, limited number of Formations, and short scenario length provide players with a rapid and fun introduction to the series, the chance to develop their play skills to become a more effective BCS player overall, and to take a good look at this poorly understood battle.&#10;&#10;Once again, the masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with more fine detail than ever before. As a result, the common misconceptions of hapless GIs and Afrika Korps supermen is put to rest.&#10;&#10;To give players a better feel for the pulse of the battle, the Germans run rampant for a few turns but then must idle back for several more while their commanders figure out what the overall objective will be. The player selects this objective randomly in the middle of the game, and it determines his Victory Conditions. This precludes the Axis player from overusing his limited combat power beforehand (since he might be going down the wrong road, literally) and keeps the Allies off balance as they must protect against both possibilities.&#10;&#10;With a campaign game of only 10 turns, multiple plays are readily possible and various strategies for both sides can be explored.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Kasserine Campaign, 2 maps, 10 Turns&#10;    Operation Spring Wind, 1 map, 4 Turns&#10;    Mid-Campaign Start, 2 maps, 5 Turns&#10;    Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 1 map, 5 Turns&#10;    End Campaign Start, 2 maps, 3 Turns&#10;    High Water Mark, 1 map, 3 Turns&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    BCS rulebook (version 1.1, in full color)&#10;    Two BCS Charts and Tables&#10;    BCS Crib Notes Booklet&#10;    BBF Game Specific rulebook&#10;    Two 22&rdquo; x34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps&#10;    560 Counters (one sheet of units and one BCS marker sheet)&#10;    6 scenarios total, 3 one-map scenarios&#10;    Box and Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Turn: 1 day&#10;    Hex: 1 mile&#10;    Units: Battalion (w/a few Companies)&#10;&#10;&#10;(description from MMP website and user)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Under a vile curse, the forest is slowly dying. A few druids, last guardians of this green and endangered kingdom, answer the call of the helpless animals. Save the forest and become its protector!&#10;&nbsp;&#10;In Nemeton, you have ten&nbsp;moons&nbsp;(ten turns) to explore&nbsp;the forest, create new potions, and summon the spirit of animals to earn as many reputation points as possible.&#10;&#10;A player's turn has four phases &mdash; night, dawn, day, and dusk &mdash; then the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;At night, the druid summons the power of the moon to grow sacred plant essences in the forest. The player adds a &ldquo;Forest&rdquo; tile to the existing forest on the &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; side. Once the tile is placed, the player checks if he can link it in a straight line with another &ldquo;Forest&rdquo; tile of the same type (river, clearing, rock or earth),&nbsp;in any direction. The player then places the resources of a certain type on the activated tiles.&#10;&#10;At dawn, the player turns over the &quot;Forest&quot; tile he just placed on the &quot;Day&quot; side. He can now discover a path leading to a sacred place: an Oak, a spring, or a Nemeton. If it&rsquo;s the case, the player picks the corresponding &quot;Sacred place&quot;&nbsp;tile in the reserve and adds it to the forest by connecting it to the tile he just added.&#10;&#10;By day, the player will move the druid to take the proper course of action depending on the &quot;Forest&quot; tiles on which he is walking: gathering all the resources on a simple tile, creating potions with those resources near a Nemeton, or earning the trust of animals.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;Exploring the forest isn&rsquo;t easy. When moving forward, a druid can use a power to take winding paths and change directions or enjoy a boost in movements that go in a straight line. However, the player will have to choose between resting and getting back the power to move forward or getting a triskel to earn more points.&#10;&#10;If he wishes, the druid can use a sacred plant, the archangel plant, to turn into a crow and to fly to any &quot;Oak&quot; tile on the board. He can summon the spirit of an animal to obtain its special powers and then use them during a special move (swap a resource, find a shortcut, etc.)&#10;&#10;At dusk, if the druid helped to heal the forest by successfully doing virtuous deeds, he puts his token on the accomplished goal, giving him one more resource as well as bonus points at the end of the game if he is the first of the players to do so.&#10;&#10;Once his turn is over, it&lsquo;s the turn of the next player until all players have laid down their 10 &quot;Forest&quot; tiles.&#10;&#10;Then the players must count their reputation points:&#10;Each potion gives the points indicated on the card.&#10;The goals show the number of points given.&#10;The animals give points depending on the different streaks.&#10;Each triskel gives two points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most reputation points wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mega Empires: The East is a strategy board game for 3-9 players that covers the development of civilizations through history, from the Stone Age to the Late Iron Age, on a map board that stretches from Northeast Africa to Southwest Asia. In this colossal game, players lead their historic civilization as they gain victory points by expanding their population, building cities, trading and developing their knowledge and culture. Notwithstanding its large scope, the game's core mechanics are straightforward and easy to learn. A key element in the game is player interaction as they position themselves on the map board and search for valuable commodities during interactive trading sessions.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player starts their civilization in the Stone Age with a single population token on the board. As the game progresses, the population will expand, spread over the board, fight some border conflicts and build cities. Cities bring resources and wealth, expressed in trade cards. The more cities players manage to build on the board, the more trade cards they receive. Trade cards are mainly valuable commodities, but sometimes turn out to be disastrous calamities.&#10;&#10;Trade&#10;Trading is the heart of the game, a social experience where all players interact with each other to optimize the value of their sets of commodities. In addition to the desired commodities, calamities are secretly traded as well, adding an additional layer to the trading dynamics. Once the trading phase has ended, players that end up with a calamity in their hand will suffer its effects.&#10;&#10;Develop Civilization Advances&#10;When the smoke of trading and resolving calamities has settled, players can decide how to spend the wealth gathered through trading. The game includes 51 different advances that can be developed, each of which provides benefits in the game to its holder. For example, Metal Working provides an advantage when fighting conflicts, Architecture facilitates city construction and Enlightenment reduces the impact of (civil) calamities.&#10;&#10;The 51 Civilization advances are divided into the categories Arts, Crafts, Science, Civics and Religion, each of which has specific powers. Each advance acquired by a player provides discounts to other advances that can be purchased later in the game, thereby creating a path of strategic decisions. The ultimate advance in the game, Wonder of the World, is only in reach for players who manage both their trading and purchasing strategy very well.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;The players who have best developed their position on the board whilst avoiding making enemies, and defended their civilization against natural or civic calamities and stand the test of time, will eventually gather the most victory points and compete for winning the game. After up to 12 hours of playing, that is.&#10;&#10;Combining with Mega Empires: The West'&#10;Mega Empires: The East can be combined with Mega Empires: The West (2019) to scale up the game to as many as 18 players! Where The East has a strong focus on movement by land, The West concentrates on the Mediterranean Sea, which stimulates movement by ship. Both games were designed as equally balanced counterparts, albeit with unique characteristics. Since many phases in the game are played simultaneously, larger player numbers do not materially increase the total playing time.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;Mega Empires: The Special Buildings (2024) is an expansion set that provides additional flavor to the game through 18 miniatures of ancient buildings historically associated with each of the civilizations in the game. These buildings can be built on the map board and provide additional benefits in play and victory points to their controller.&#10;&#10;Accessories&#10;The Mega Empires: The East &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) is a neoprene game mat at 125% scale of the original cardboard map that offers an enlarged playing area and high-quality design for easier and more immersive gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Identifier Cards Bonus Pack (2024) is a set with 18 large player identifier cards, one for each of the Civilizations included in Mega Empires. These can be used for distributing the civilizations among the players during setup, to identify which stack of Civilization Advances belongs to which player, or to divide acquired cards from not yet acquired ones during the game.&#10;&#10;Wrap-up&#10;Mega Empires: The East is a long strategic board game about development, trade, culture, politics and showing resilience when dealing with calamities. The game is a perfect fit for larger groups of strategic board game enthusiasts, which, due to its scalability, can also be played in smaller groups. It is not just a game, it is an experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com&#10;&#10;Waterloo &ndash; a two-player game for early 2009 with the French and British fighting once again. The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.&#10;&#10;Damage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.&#10;&#10;Control of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched. The French win if they take Mont St. Jean, the British if they take Rosonne; if neither occurs before the end of 8pm (ie the last turn), then the British and Allies win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Northern Italy - and especially Milan - at the end of the 15th century was the brutal focal point for power and control between France and the Imperialist empires of Venice and Spain. And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.&#10;&#10;At the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.&#10;&#10;&quot;Arquebus&quot; shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia. Pavia was a crushing defeat wherein France lost over 50% of its army and almost all of its nobility of command, including her king, Francis I, who was captured. But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.&#10;&#10;Arquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe. Yes, Landsknecht uniforms literally set the fashion trend at the time for the entire western world.&#10;&#10;",

But beware of the threat of the Mongols who hang near the border. . .&#10;&#10;In this game of clever placement, players take turns adding pieces to the Great Wall. On one side of the wall lay the Chinese provinces, each with its own point value. On the other side are the provinces of the Mongol invaders, each with a randomly-assigned negative point value. Since provinces on either side do not directly correspond to each other, the goal is to place your pieces so that you can attain a majority on the Chinese side (for positive points) while avoiding having a majority on the Mongolian side (for negative points). Players also have a set of cards (tiles actually) that give them a few special privileges to help themselves or interfere with other players.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with optional cards that may be used to provide other methods of scoring points.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the player who can connect most stations to each other, and to the mine.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds shares. Players are required to buy shares in any particular line in order to score for it, but choosing the right moment to do so gives flexibility to track placement.&#10;&#10;Designed for the 2016 One Page PNP Contest&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A few magically talented individuals, their devoted followers in tow, have been drawn from their villages across the twisted wilderness to the Ruined City.&#10;&#10;At the very heart of the city, the cursed Tower of Magic rises into the broiling clouds. From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.&#10;&#10;The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.&#10;&#10;The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...&#10;&#10;Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.&#10;&#10;When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.&#10;&#10;Each turn is formed of two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents. &#10;     Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. &#10;         Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.&#10;         Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.&#10;         Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).&#10;         Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. &#10;         Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;&quot;White Star Rising introduces Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing&rsquo;s Nations at War (NAW) game system. Based on the popular World at War, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. Here you&rsquo;ll find everything you're looking for in a platoon-level game -- armor, artillery, infantry that serves as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, amphibious landings, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat, all in eight pages of rules. That&rsquo;s two less than the World at War system.&#10;&#10;&quot;Units represent platoons of vehicles, such as M-10 Wolverines, M4A3E8 Easy Eight Shermans, and German Panthers, Tigers, and Mark IVs. Of course White Star Rising isn&rsquo;t all about tanks. There&rsquo;s plenty of infantry; paratroopers, line doggies, Fallschirmjaeger, and Volksgrenadiers. In the same vein as the World at War system, the infantry are capable of moving fast and hitting hard. White Star Rising also includes support weapons, such as heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that infantry platoons can use to lethal effect.&#10;&#10;&quot;The system throws typical turn-based gaming out the window. The platoons are grouped into formations (usually battalions and kampfgruppen) and led by a headquarters. Each unit of the formation must be within range of the HQ to activate with its formation. Although individual units might activate, and recon units can double their range from the HQ, you&rsquo;ll want to keep those formations together. The formations are activated by chit draw, and better-trained, better-led units can activate more than once in a turn, moving, shooting, and fighting in each activation. On the flip side, there is no guarantee that a formation will activate even once. The cup into which the formation chits are placed is seeded with end turn chits. When the second end turn chit is drawn the turn ends. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if a single formations has activated; the turn is over. It keeps you on your toes.&#10;&#10;&quot;When attacking, each platoon rolls a number of dice equal to its firepower. Every die that equals or exceeds the &ldquo;to hit&rdquo; number (right superscript) hits the target. The target then rolls a number of dice equal to its armor factor plus terrain advantages. Each die that equals or exceeds its armor factor negates a hit. The first hit disrupts a unit, second reduces it, the third eliminates it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Units may also close assault, entering the opponent&rsquo;s hex to either deal a death blow or force him (or her) out of valuable terrain. Same procedure, but both units use their close assault value. The side that takes the most hits must retreat from the hex. Infantry is VERY good at this, especially against armor without its own infantry support.&#10;&#10;&quot;Game includes rules for thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons (actual counters that represent heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that add to an infantry platoon&rsquo;s capabilities), air support, bunkers, wire, artillery, mines, overruns opportunity fire, line-of-sight rules that have been streamlined since their inception in World at War, transporting infantry--and all in eight pages of rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;Other Games in Series:&#10;&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising&#10;    Nations at War: Desert Heat&#10;    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Airborne&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Operation Cobra&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    World at War: Eisenbach Gap&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nertz, also known widely as Pounce, is a fast paced card game where every player has their own standard deck of cards and engage in a form of multi-player solitaire.  Decks with different backs are a must.  Players all deal 13 cards into a draw pile and four cards out in front of themselves.  When play commences, players simultaneously try to empty their draw pile by building on the four cards in front of them (red sevens on black eights, black sixes on red sevens etc.) and try to put cards into set piles in the middle of the table starting with the Ace of a given suit and then the two and three and so on. Players build on each others' set piles so this can lead to some very energetic competitions.  The remaining cards that a player has are kept in a deck and counted out and turned over three at a time, placed face up, and then the top facing card can be added to the set piles or to the four working piles in front of the player.  When a player has emptied the draw pile and yells out &quot;Nertz&quot; play stops and points are counted up - one point for each card in the middle of the table in the set piles, and -2 points for every card left in the draw pile.  First player to an agreed upon score is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game has been packaged and released as Solitaire Frenzy.&#10;&#10;",

Now YOU are trying to find it, but you'll need to share some information with your fellow pirates to make sure you find it before the Spanish catch you!&#10;&#10;In the challenging deduction board game Loot of Lima, the Island of Cocos has 24 locations: 8 on the shore, 8 in the forest, and 8 in the mountains; the treasure is hidden in two of these locations. The game has a token for each of these locations, and at the start of the game, two tokens as placed back in the box (with these tokens indicating where the treasure is hidden). The rest of the tokens are then passed out evenly to the players; these represent places you have already searched and know where the treasure is not hidden.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players roll three 12-sided dice to determine which questions they can ask their opponents. For example, how many locations have you searched between the southeast and the northwest? Or, how many locations in the forest have you searched between the west and the south? Players use the answers to these questions to build overlapping clues, figure out all the locations that have already been searched, and eventually discover which locations haven't been searched (and thus where the treasure is hidden).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Will you solve the mystery of the disappeared?&quot; (from the back cover of the game)&#10;&#10;In each Q case, you try to solve a mystery case with 32 clues, with players revealing one clue at a time until all cards have been revealed or discarded. During your turn, each player must perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;A) Reveal information:&#10;Choose a card from your hand and place it on the table, so all players can read or see the entire information.&#10;We recomend you read out loud all shared info when you place it on the table. If you play a clue that happens to be irrelevant&#10;to the case, you lose points at the end of the game, but be careful! Some clues are vital to resolve the case.&#10;&#10;You can share and expose your theories at any moment and talk about the cards you have in your hand but you cannot show them to the other players and you may only read out loud the words written in bold or the text framed inside an image:&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, when all clue cards have been revealed or discarded, you must check carefully all the available information and prepare a theory of what happened, working all together. Then, open the questionnaire and answer all questions. During this phase of the game, you can speak freely about your discarded cards, or the information you remember of them. Each right answer will add two points.&#10;&#10;",

It launches out then to body lost in a secret project to the worrying name: the Hybrid Code. Alas, Shamir, the Alchemical capital is attacked by mysterious warriors; Dirz disappears before to have been able to enjoy the fruits of its dark intentions. The laboratories of the Hybrid Code, private of resources, die out in their turn and sink in the lapse of memory.&#10;&#10;The Age of Darkness. &#10;The incommensurable energy released by the ritual of the Paddle, in the heart of Second Shamir, flows through the continent of Aarklash and reactivates the disastrous sanctuaries of the Hybrid Code...&#10;&#10;Nowadays, in Akkylannie. &#10;The population of the village of Glasinhar must face a terrible threat to which it is not prepared: monsters emerge from the entrails of the ground and are devoted to a massacre.&#10;Only a handle of warriors interposes between the impious creatures and the remainder of the continent: valorous Templiers of the Cabin of Hod.&#10; Hybrid Game Box&#10;&#10;Before disappearing, Dirz the Heresiarch, founder of the Empire of the Scorpion, nourished a shadowy project: Code Hybrid. Many decades later, Dirz's forgotten laboratories mysteriously reactivated themselves... Today, monsters spring from the innards of the earth! Only has handful of warriors stand&#10; between these impious creatures and the rest of the world: the Griffins of the Lodge of Hod. &#10;Come and join has blood-filled battle in the gloomy underground laboratories!&#10;&#10;The Hybrid&copy; game box includes 13 figurines, 1 Hybrid&copy; rule book, 110 cards, 9 playing boards and 2 dice. &#10;(in French on the site; badly translated here)&#10;&#10;Take part in a bloody battle in the corridors of lugubrious laboratories! &#10;Presented in preview at the time of the last show of the Monde de Jeu, HYBRID is the new game of the Rackham range. &#10;Although the action proceeds in the universe of Aarklash, the principles of play are very different from those of Confrontation and Rag' Narok : the game of Hybrid proceeds on richly detailed, square modular game tiles.&#10;&#10;You can achieve the ten perilous missions suggested in the basic booklet or to invent your own laboratories! &#10;The mechanisms are also innovative: Hybrid is played with dice with d10&rsquo;s. The capacities of each combatant are described in four characteristics to which many special Aptitudes are added, as the ability to emit an aura of battle or to become stronger after each death inflicted upon the enemy. The tables of Capacities, as for them, describe the prowesses that your warrior can carry out at the critical times in the battle!&#10;&#10;The basic box contains two factions: the Griffons of Akkylannie, represented by Templars of Hod , and the impious creatures of the Alchemists of Dirz . These figurines is delivered with the reference cards which also make it possible to play them Confrontation and Rag' Narok. All are compatible: the majority of the references for Confrontation and Rag' Narok will be able, in the long term, to be used within the framework of the Hybrid game. &#10;Templars of Hod include Worthy Ambrosius , wise equipped with mysterious capacities, like three R&eacute;purgateurs and their Seneshal , of frightening warriors trained with the special operations. &#10;Against the combatants of the Light, the children of the H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque are short handed: not less than four Plagues of Flesh the corridors in the search of victims. Three Hybrids represent the prototype of the warrior of excellence imagined formerly by Dirz itself. The Alchemical perfection carries a name and a horrible face: Aberration . Nothing seems to be able to stop this living nightmare which has the power of a machine of war and the speed of an unforeseeable storm...&#10;&#10;Note finally that the amateurs of conversion were not forgotten: the arms of R&eacute;purgateurs and Hybrid are interchangeable and make it possible to create several models starting from the same base. &#10;Will you be able to take up the challenge of H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque?&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Hybrid Expansion 1 - Nemesis&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Samurai covers all the major battles of the Sengoku Jidai (the Age of Warring Daimyos). Japan was truly a country at war. Because of the nature of 16th century Japanese warfare, it is also the easiest game in the series to play. The revamped command system simulates the clan-oriented levels of leadership, plus simplified shock and fire mechanics. Also included are individual samurai used to challenge opponents and collect the important severed heads. Ignore the challenge and lose face, or even be forced to commit seppuku on the spot.&#10;&#10;Battles include the most unusual Okehazama, complete with burning castles, thunderstorms, and a historically victorious army out-numbered six to one; Anegawa; Kawanakajima; Mikata-ga-Hara; Nagashino, with the famous Takeda cavalry corps charging Oda's volley-firing musketeers; and the most famous battle to take place in Japan, Sekigahara. All the great leaders are there: Obu Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, and of course, Tokugawa Ieyasu.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Anegawa 1570 - Nobunaga takes the offensive against his treacherous brother-in-law, Nagamasa. His objective is Nagamasa's castle of Odani.     &#10;    Sekigahara 1600 - The most decisive battle in the history of Japan. The rivals were I. Mitsunari and T. Ieyasu ... one would be Shogun.     &#10;    Kawanakajima 1561 - Uesugi Kenshin was determined to destroy Shingen once and for all. His objective was Shingen's Kaizu Castle.&#10;    Okehazama 1560 - One of Oda Nobunaga's finest victories, won by a small force against one much larger, at odds of about six to one!     &#10;    Nagashino 1575 - The culmination of Oda Nobunaga's brilliant military career and a milestone in Japanese history.     &#10;    Mikata-ga-hara 1572 - Takeda Shingen is pitted against the young Tokugawa Ieyasu in a furious battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     100 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     100 men per strength point; individual leaders and samurai&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg&#10;ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

We can transform our ship into a frightening man-o-war and loot boarded ships or into the fastest sailboat ever imagined. We will be able to trade in the market to get doubloons, grow our crew, improve our weapons and load capacity, enrol on a mission and get a reward, explore the ocean to search for treasures, fight against or with others, and above all acquire wealth.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, we will make contact with other ships commanded by our friends (although we know in a board game is better not to rely on friendships). While exploring the map, we will start catching sight of other ships belonging to the different nations in the game. These are Spain, Holland, France, England, and pirates and corsairs. During the game, you will be able to decide if you want to side with any of these nations which will give you a variety of perks. However, nothing in this life comes for free and your acts might take you to make enemies of some other nations which will make their ships come after yours and try to sink you into the ocean.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Going back to the age of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, you control the destiny of your empire--building armies, annexing neutral provinces, trading across the Mediterranean, and fighting battles. The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. The player with the largest army will also lose the most victory points, so he had better use his forces well. If warfare is not to your taste then you can trade your way to victory, by having the largest trading empire.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One weekend, you find yourself cleaning the family attic. During your cleaning, you stumble upon an old turntable and a small collection of vinyl records. You blow the dust off and bring the find downstairs to the den. After setting it up, you place the needle down on an album you vaguely remember hearing when you were very young. As the album spins under the needle, you sit back and look at the album cover and insert. Warm sounds begin to fill the room as you are instantly transported to another world. You listen to the wonderful notes playing while following along with the lyrics. After the needle reaches the center, you shoot up out of your chair and hop on the computer &mdash; you want more! You locate the nearest record store &mdash; Record Town. You hop in the car not really know what to expect. After arriving and parking the car, you pull back on the door into a musical paradise. Welcome to Vinyl!&#10;&#10;Vinyl is a game where players are aspiring vinyl collectors. They have some knowledge of what they would like to collect, but immediately get immersed in the experience. Players will acquire morsels of information after visiting the &ldquo;Mag Rack&rdquo;. That information will lead them to the bins where they select albums to add and expand their collection. Albums can be played at the listening booth to increase the value of a player&rsquo;s collection and their ability to collect even more albums. Unfortunately, the inventory is limited and other customers may be targeting the same vinyl gems. After the final round is concluded, players will tally their collection&rsquo;s value and determine who is the Elite Collector of Vinyl!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 45 BC. Julius Caesar brings all the leaders of the provinces of Hispania Ulterior together for a meeting in Corduba, where he thanks them for the support received during the recent civil war. The fight between Caesar and Pompey had ended with a clear victor, but not all Roman citizens were completely behind Caesar.&#10;&#10;One year later, the cruel governor and Caesar&rsquo;s right hand man is nearly assassinated as he makes his way to the Basilica. This act turned out to be the precursor to what would happen just two years later. Cneo and Sexto, sons of Caesar&rsquo;s enemies, taking advantage of the influence that Pompey&rsquo;s name still carried and capitalizing off the rich resources of the Roman province, took control of all of Hispania, including the colonies of Italica and Corduba. These two traitors had somehow pieced together an army of no less than 13 legions, made up of veterans loyal to Pompey and the remnants of his defeated armies in Africa, along with citizens of Hispania.&#10;&#10;Caesar promptly travelled to the capital of Hispania with the intention of crushing the rebellion while it was still in its infancy. After losing a battle to Cneo for control of the bridge, Caesar was forced to winter in Ategua and, as it was necessary to feed his forces, he subsequently pillaged the surrounding area. Many were those who joined the rebellion led by Pompey&rsquo;s sons, but in the end there weren&rsquo;t enough of them. Forced to take refuge in the city after the battle of Munda, Caesar besieges Cneo and Sexto. He later takes control of the city after a daring assault on the walls. Sexto manages to escape Caesar&rsquo;s wrath, but his brother Cneo dies along with another 22,000 citizens of Corduba. As punishment for supporting the rebellion and giving refuge to its instigators, the city is left a smoldering ruin. But from the ashes a new city will arise&hellip;&#10;&#10;The year is now 27 BC, nearly two decades later, and Augustus, the first emperor, sends representatives of the most influential Roman families to Corduba in order to raise it to its former glory. To achieve this, it will be necessary to rebuild the city and cater to its inhabitants. All of this, of course, under the watchful eye of Rome.&#10;Players, who represent the heirs of different patrician families sent from Rome, will compete for the honor of becoming the next Governor, but must first win the vote of the people, and of Rome.&#10;&#10;The game is played out over three eras, each one representing a decade. During a round, players will take actions in turns until all decide to pass. Players use actions to produce or harvest resources, construct buildings and monuments, train legions, and tend to the religious needs of the people. To do this, players will have access to a certain number of specialists and workers that will increase as the city&rsquo;s population rises.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Corduba is not a tile-laying game, but rather one of building actions that includes familiar worker placement and resource management mechanics.&#10;&#10;Actions available at the beginning of the game are scarce and mostly limited to harvesting basic resources in order to construct buildings and train troops. However, as players construct new buildings, the amount of actions available increases, since each building constructed provides a new action. Players will certainly appreciate the sheer number of possible strategies and combinations that arise during the course of a game.&#10;&#10;Another of Corduba&rsquo;s strengths is how a particular game evolves. A total of nine rounds are played, grouped into three decades. At the end of each round, the buildings release their workers and therefore become available for the next round. What this means is that all these buildings, which have been constructed one by one over previous rounds, are now free to all players regardless of who built them. Also, since there is an ever-increasing amount of actions available, strategic possibilities multiply. In addition to this, every action is just as important as the next, which leaves you with the constant feeling that another player has anticipated your move and occupied a building you wanted to activate or built what you wanted to build. Even though the rules do not change from one round to the next, players will quickly realize that the game does, since their strategies and perceptions during the first few rounds will be very different from later ones.&#10;There are no Victory Points in Corduba. In order to win, you will have to garner the favor of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants and of Rome itself. Constructing buildings in the different districts will improve your reputation there. Providing the largest armies for the Roman Cohorts or giving the largest offering to the gods will also help you win favor in the Senate, as well as, of course, helping the city meet the demands of Rome. At the end of each decade, players will have the opportunity to add to the Senate.&#10;&#10;But not all that glitters is gold, and, on occasion, the citizens will rebel. Players will have to deal with these uprisings, but this does not mean they will have to cooperate. However, if this aspect is neglected, the entire city could fall, resulting in a very undesirable outcome &ndash; all players lose!&#10;Corduba is a bona fide example of a game with near-infinite strategic possibilities. Each game will play out differently depending on the buildings and monuments constructed, the combinations from families and inheritances that players choose, the demands of Rome, the fluctuation of the resource market, the Res gestae (milestones) available, etc. Even if you try to play in a similar way as you did the last, you will not have the same experience. Truly, no one game of Corduba will be the same &ndash; you will uncover different strategies and combinations each time you play.&#10;Corduba is a game of medium to high difficulty with simple rules that anyone can understand, but will profoundly challenge players of even the highest skill levels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
