    "Description": "4th Dimension is a very spacey-looking game with a small circular board divided into sectors each track of which has twice as many spaces as the one closer to the center. Each player get 6 warriors, 3 rangers, 2 guardians, and one time lord. Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also &quot;warp&quot; by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker. This game has an inconveniently small gameboard and plastic pieces that look like little futuristic chairs.&#10;&#10;The game was first published in Games &amp; Puzzles magazine. The designers produced it as a standalone game later the same year, and it was later licensed by TSR.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bilbo Baggins lives in the quaint village of Hobbiton, but today his comfort has been shattered by the arrival of 13 Dwarves. They have convinced Bilbo to embark on a most unexpected journey &ndash; but first Gandalf, along with the Dwarves Dwalin, Kili and Fili, must find the other ten Dwarves who are lost in the Hobbit holes of Hobbiton.&#10;&#10;In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the players first build the game out of LEGO bricks, then they take turns rolling a special six-sided die. If a player rolls 1-3, he moves his figure the number of spaces rolled and uses a torch to lift a piece out of the Hobbit hole on which he landed. Hopefully the bottom of the piece shows a Dwarf. If so, the player keeps the Dwarf and play passes to the left. If a player finds a Hobbit instead, he lifts a piece out of any other Hobbit hole on the board in an attempt to locate another Hobbit; if the player finds a match, he keeps the pair of Hobbits and is rewarded with the opportunity to peek at the bottom of a piece from any other Hobbit hole.&#10;&#10;Instead of a Hobbit or Dwarf, some pieces feature a picture of breakfast. Matching two breakfasts allows a player to take a Dwarf piece already obtained by an opponent and return it to the Hobbit hole of his choice. The last possibility when revealing a piece is to find a picture of a rune. Matching two runes allows a player to select another Hobbit hole of his choice; if he finds a Dwarf in this location, he keeps it and play passes to the left. The custom die also features a picture of a map on one side. Rolling the map allows a player to move to any Hobbit hole on the board.&#10;&#10;After all ten Dwarves have been found, the player with the most Dwarves wins. The game comes with variant rules, including one that shifts the location of Hobbit holes by swinging portions of the board into different configurations. Another variant requires players to find Thorin, the leader of the Dwarves, last. Another places Bilbo in one of the Hobbit holes.&#10;&#10;",

Now the time has come for you to gain the immortal glory of the Arena. Fight for your honor, for fame, and for your life!&#10;&#10;Gladiatori is a card-driven game in which each player assumes the role of a gladiator in the Ancient Roman Empire. Action selection drives figure movement on the board. Combat cards give energy to the character actions and are used as hit points. Characters are customizable, and each player has to choose his deck composition, character skills, and participate in the auctions for Arena items. At the end, the winner will be determined by victory points &ndash; or simply by being the only one left alive!&#10;&#10;This is not the usual fast, face-to-face combat game in which you attack opponents with a roll of dice. It contains many strategic and tactical aspects, and no luck factors (other than in the solo game). Customization of characters makes the combat always different: Your gladiator may be strong against some opponents and weak against others. Let's start finding your way to win!&#10;&#10;Gladiatori Deluxe is a limited edition version of the game that includes eight metal miniatures &mdash; four gladiators and four animals (dog, wolf, bear, lion) &mdash; and a revised 2.0 English-language rulebook with the other languages being available online.&#10;&#10;",

If you make any big movements, even just for a moment, you'll quickly be caught. You must cautiously, carefully, and quietly carry out the scrolls...! But don't take too long! Your rivals are also trying to complete this mission. It's a race to get most scrolls! You attach a smart phone to your arm in this new type of action game. The accelerometer will detect your movement.&#10;&#10;In Ninja Catfoot and the Covert Action each player put his smartphone on his arm with the furnished tools. They will all compete at the same time to take the more pawn possible, the quickest they can. They should go to the URL catfoot.ninja with their phone where they will access the app necessary to play the game. The movement sensor on their phone will provide them not to go too fast or they will need to stop taking pawns for some time.&#10;&#10;The player who takes the more scrolls wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Night of the Ill-Tempered Squirrel is a non-collectible card game for 3-6 players.  Each player takes the part of a bad director attempting to make the worst B monster movie possible.  Movies are filmed by playing cards representing the seven main elements of a motion picture: Movie Title, Actor, Plot, Monster, Special Effects, Set Location, and Finale.  Each movie element card is rated in the industry standard &quot;star&quot; system where 1 star is very, very bad and 5 stars is Oscar quality.  Cards can be played either on yourself or your opponents, but there is one major hitch: every movie element is played face down and you can't look at any of them after they are in play, including the cards that you yourself played! Additional special cards add hilarity to hijinks.  Making a bad movie has never been so hard!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player has two choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard 0-5 cards from your hand, then draw that many cards plus one from the deck. You can't have more than ten cards in hand.&#10;     Play five cards from hand, record your points on the score sheet, then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;In more detail, to score, you lay down five cards and score for one of the combinations on the score sheet: number of 1s, 2s, etc.; three- or four-of-a-kind; full house; small or large straight; Kniffel; etc. Write the score in the left-hand box of the appropriate line. You also lose 2 points for each other card in your hand, so note these penalty points in the right-hand box.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player scores in all of the lines on his score sheet, players complete the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then they tally their scores and subtract their penalties. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

But for this, he requires Moes services...&#10;&#10;The trilogy has captivated children all over the world, and a major movie was released in March 2008.&#10;So hopefully will we soon see an English language edition of this game.&#10;&#10;This is a game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.&#10;&#10;",

What began as an extension of the Russian Civil War in 1919 became a full scale conflict between two modem nations. Poland, free once again, defends its independence by striking deep into the heart of its old nemesis, Russia. The Red Army, still deeply involved in its Civil War, drives to reconquer the Tsar's old possessions and push the Red Banner of Communism into Western Europe. The tactics and weapons of this war formed a strange blend of old and new. For the last time, a great European battle could end with the sound of trumpets and a charge of horsemen. Yet the tank, the airplane, the machinegun and the railroad all played their role as well.&#10;&#10;The Russo-Polish war provided both a final glimpse of the 19th century and an early look at the strategies of World War Two. This game simulates the Russo-Polish war of 1920 at the operational/strategic level. It uses simple rules, with numerous options for greater realism and/or play balance.&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy and Tactics magazine issue #156&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game first appeared in the The Dragon magazine issue #44 and was also released as part of the The Best of Dragon Magazine Games boxed set. Food Fight is a quite detailed, &quot;wargame representation&quot; of a school cafeteria food fight.&#10;&#10;The players control a student each with an action point allowance and an appearance rating which determine how much food he can absorb before being out. Characters that are better at attacking generally also have a lower threshold for absorbing damage. There are also 6 staff members who try to apprehend the students.&#10;&#10;The game also has details for multiple types of foods with various ratings for each projectile's: range, slipperiness (used when they land on the floor), to-hit values and damage numbers. All results are determined with a simple d6 roll and you can even send an entire tray flying with or without food and cafeteria tables may be flipped over for even more mayhem.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds a lot to the game. The combat chart lists 30 food types each with 3 different attack modes and 7 ratings for each. There is an accuracy modification chart included. The &quot;last man&quot; standing wins.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, choose a card to play according to your position on the court and the level of risk you want to take. If you take a risky move, throwing a dice will be required to validate your stroke ! Like in real tennis, you win the point if you make a winner or if your opponent hits the ball out.&#10;&#10;Only a wise management of your hand will lead you to victory!&#10;&#10;Features : 2 difficulty levels, adaptable duration (minimum 15'), a solo mode and 4 different surfaces with their specific gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(If it's a joker, put it back in the stock and take another one.)&#10;Select a player who begins the game (youngest....oldest).&#10;The rest is playing clockwise.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;On his turn the player tries to fit one of his Triominos to the ones already on the table. A Triominos fits if it is placed so at least one side is completely in contact with another, and all sides that stick together must match in color and figure.&#10;If you succeed in this, you will be rewarded with a counter. If you can not, then you must pay a reward count and draw another Triominos.&#10;Your turn is then over, and it passes on to the next player.&#10;&#10;Game end:&#10;When a player places his last Triominos or the stock is emptied. The player with the most counters win.&#10;&#10;Joker:&#10;(Using the joker is not advisable for the first playthroughs.)&#10;The joker counts as any figure or color and can be used anywhere a normal correct Triominos could be placed.&#10;You can replace a joker on the table, with another Triominos that fits the position. If you do so, you can add the joker to your rack, but will not earn a rewardtoken.&#10;&#10;2nd level of play (aged 6 and upwards), to become more familiar with counting points:&#10;In this version of the rules, you play without the reward counters.&#10;&#10;The only differences to the above rules are, that drawing Triominos does not cost you points, and points are counted as the total value of the figures on the Triominos you have placed. The score is then tracked throughout the game. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;References:&#10;The only place I have been able to find a digital copy of the game was here: https://www.gebruikershandleiding.com/Goliath-triominos-my-first-junior/preview-handleiding-496755.html?page=0002 - here you can also see graphics of legal placements of your Trimonos.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most stacks claims a 12-point bonus card, then players tally their points.

The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes.

Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points. The approximate playing time is a guess; it will depend on the chosen scenario.&#10;&#10;This is Space Capsule #4, the fourth in SPI's series of science fiction microgames.&#10;&#10;",

One at a time, players take turns revealing a card from their deck and adding it to a face-up pile. Whenever a harvest card appears &ndash; which will show either apples, pears or grubs &ndash; players race to grab numbered tokens in the center of the table. Each player with a token then says how many of the depicted item are shown on the cards in the central pile. Whoever is correct (or closest) wins the harvest card. The stack is cleared, then the game continues. Whoever collects the most harvest cards wins.&#10;&#10;In the second game, each player has two harvest cards face-up before him and a deck of windfall cards. Now players are trying to slap the deck when any of the three items appears at least 11 times in the pile. If the slapper is correct, he wins a harvest card; if not, he loses one of those in front of him. Again, the player with the most harvest cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players are divided into teams, and then each team will take turns: one player has one minute to explain as many words as possible while the other team members try to guess them quickly to gain more points. Words will be worth more or less points depending on their difficulty, as they could be anything from ordinary objects to entire phrases.&#10;&#10;In addition, the team can use special cards that can change the entire course of the game. These &quot;U-cards&quot; can be played before the player begins explaining words, and include abilities such as:&#10;- &quot;First letter&quot;: You are allowed to say the first letter of the word;&#10;- &quot;Additional minute&quot;: You are given one additional minute to explain;&#10;- &quot;Replace a player&quot;: You can change the player who is going to explain the words - this lets competing teams gain an advantage by preventing good players from participating. &#10;- &quot;With closed eyes&quot;  - Have you ever tried to explain something without seeing others?&#10;- &quot;Robbery&quot;: You can guess the word of another team and steal their points&#10;&#10;The game contains 200 cards with words.

The land mines (pegs that move up and down through the base) are activated by pulling a lanyard that runs under the base and behind your command bunker.  Shells numbered 1 through 10 are hidden in your command bunker with higher numbered shells having more firepower.  Players simultaneously select one of their ten shells then both players lower the bunker to reveal the value of the fired shell.  The player with the higher value shell totals the value of both shells and moves the slide that number of spaces towards his opponent.  If the shells are of the same value, both are discarded and the tanks are not moved.  If the opponents tanks are moved back over the land mines, the player that had the higher total can pull on the lanyard.  If the opponents tank is moved, it is destroyed and is out of the game.  Both of the fired shells are then removed from the game.  The game is played in two rounds but tanks destroyed in the first round are not replaced for the second round.  The winner is the player with the most tanks on the battlefield after two rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Can you navigate safely through enemy caves? Can your cavemen outwit their stronger opponents or overpower their weaker ones? Can you be the first to put out an opponent's fire?&#10;&#10;Cavemen Playing With Fire is a strategic two-player card game. The goal is to be the first player to put out one of her opponent's three fires, which in game terms means taking one of the opponent's three fire cards.&#10;&#10;To play the game, each player receives an identical deck of 25 cave, fire, and caveman cards. Players use the cave cards to create a playing field on the table with three fire cards for each player at each end. In turns, players place cards and take action. They walk and fight among their own caves and those of the enemy to try to reach one of the enemy's fire cards. The cavemen cards are ranked, and some have special abilities. Lost cards can return to the drawing deck, but to do so a player must lose certain cards first. Losing these is tricky, though.&#10;&#10;",

After discussion and debating, the contestants vote for their answers and scoring chips are awarded.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Anyone with the right answer to the question gets a chip. If both contestants choose the correct answer, they and everyone else with the right answer get an extra bonus chip. If both contestants choose wrong, they get no chips, but any audience member who chose the same wrong answer as both contestants gets a chip for successfully influencing them. The bobblehead is passed to the left and the new reader asks the next question. Play proceeds until someone wins the required number of chips (10-16, depending on the number of players).&#10;&#10;",

Or a winter evening &ndash; cold outside, warm inside, a burning lamp, tea is ready &ndash; all that's left to choose is cherry or peach? Gooseberry or currant? Why not open a few jars and taste some of each. Of and it would be lovely to bake some pies with jam...&#10;&#10;Now you can not only eat jam, you can play The Jam. In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad &ndash; the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.&#10;&#10;How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (&quot;Raspberry jam&quot; from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.&#10;&#10;The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card &ndash; take the top card from the deck.&#10;     Trade &ndash; players can trade Recipes they made with other players.&#10;     Play a card &ndash; you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.&#10;     Discard &ndash; you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game has a few special cards with special features:&#10;&#10;&#10;     &quot;The Bear&quot; goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points &ndash; but eats one of the pies.&#10;     &quot;Karlsman&quot; goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.&#10;     &quot;Cone jam&quot; can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make &quot;Winter jam&quot; or bake &quot;Pies for granny&quot;, while others collect &quot;Favorite fruit&quot;. At the end of the game it becomes clear who made the correct choices that led to sweet victory!&#10;&#10;",

This is complicated by a capturing mechanic that keeps the board in constant flux.  The game ends when the board has been completely filled.  As with most Mark Steere games, draws and ties are not possible.&#10;&#10;",

It begins with Argentina in control of the Falkland Islands and UK forces approaching to try to retake them.&#10;&#10;Aircraft counters represent four aircraft of one particular type. Ground-unit counters represent infantry battalions (500 to 600 men), artillery battalions (12 to 18 guns with crews), armored reconnaissance squadrons (eight to 12 vehicles and their crews), a heavy machinegun company (120 men with heavy machineguns), and special forces teams (25 to 50 men). Ship and submarine counters each represent one vessel.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents between one to three days, depending on the current operational tempo. Each inch on the Tactical Area Map equals five miles. Each inch on the Strategic Sea Area Map equals 100 miles. The game uses an adaptation of the system originally created for our Red Dragon Rising game.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: Operation Black Buck, decisive leadership, Exocet missiles, stealth aircraft, reinforcements, off-map areas, naval transport, airbase limits, submarine operations, strategic airlift, rebasing, ship repair, special forces raids, the Total Exclusion Zone, aerial interception, cross-decking, naval surface actions, ground assault, heliborne movement, the Argentine mainland, protected targets, entrenchments, mountain combat, severe weather, and much more.

But as they make their way through the sewers and along the city streets, they encounter SHREDDER'S henchmen trying to stop them. A ride on the subway can help the Turtles get closer to their goal. A side trip to Baxter Stockman's lab will slow them down. Which Turtle will make it past their enemies and defeat THE SHREDDER? Will it be you?&quot;&#10;&#10;There are two sets of rules for the game.
