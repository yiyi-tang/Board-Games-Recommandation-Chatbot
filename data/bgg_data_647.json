    "Description": "Zombie A-Go-Go is unique in the miniature games market, as it is based on the concept of co-operative play that is more common to boardgames. That means that each player brings their own Hero, and a handful of Zombies that offset their value in skills and equipment. Our game is designed to fill in the gap between all of the wonderful Zombie Boardgames, and more traditional Miniature Skirmish or Tactical games, that already exist.&#10;&#10;Our game is setup to give the feel of &quot;Traditional Zombies&quot; in modern times. It can also be easily modified if you prefer &quot;Voodoo&quot; or &quot;Chemically Altered&quot; Zombies, or to play in another &quot;Era&quot; like antiquity or the near future. These rules include a vast collection of information that makes this an &quot;all in one game&quot; that should accommodate most &quot;Eras&quot;. These rules are designed for individually mounted 25 to 28mm figures. They can be readily adapted to 20mm or 15mm if that better suits your club.&#10;&#10;This game was designed for Wargamers, by Wargamers, so it &quot;fluff light&quot; and packed with what you actually need to play on the tabletop. Future supplments will be offered to expand the game, but are not required to enjoy this genre. In addition to increase the value of the book for you we have also provided:&#10;&#10;1) Complete Character Generation with over 50 Pre-generated characters&#10;2) Over 15 Ranged Weapons and more than 30 Close Combat Weapons&#10;3) Basic Vehicle Rules with over 30 Pre-generated vehicles for land, air, and sea&#10;4) a Scenario Generator to help quickly make pickup games&#10;5) 8x Basic scenarios, 2x advanced scenarios, and a 4x mission mini-campaign. Several of these also include additional &quot;options&quot; to readily modify the scenario conditions, or to use them for competitive play with or without a moderator.&#10;6) Optional Rules (Fog, Night, etc.)&#10;7) Basic rules for Buildings and Barricades&#10;&#10;And don&rsquo;t forget&#10;&#10;Zombies you can outrun - the mistakes of your fellow Heroes you cannot.&#10;&#10;",

For example, if the game is being played to 5 VP and both Arch-Mage Treasure rooms are visible, the game is now played to 7 VP.&#10;&#10;&#10;Giant Grinders:&#10;&#10;     The Giant Grinders work exactly like rifts. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A flying character (Wizard, Ghost, Specter, etc...) can fly over a Giant Grinder during his movement, but cannot stop there. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Characters who can move over pit traps, like the Thief or Elf Scout, cannot more over a Giant Grinder square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A character carrying a rope can move over a Giant Grinder or stop there as long as there are two valid attachment points available. However, his movement must be from one valid square to another valid square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Giant Grinders are obstacles.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pipes:&#10;&#10;     Pipes are not normal floor squares.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pipes do not block line of sight.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pipes are obstacles for characters with a combat value of 3 or more (only the unmodified combat value on the character counts). &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Characters of combat value 0,1,or 2 (only the unmodified combat value on the character counts) can use Pipes like normal ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Characters of combat value 0,1, or 2 can stop on Pipes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Characters of combat value 3 can move over Pipes like normal ground. Characters of combat value 3 cannot stop on Pipes. If they do stop on the Pipes, the Pipes break (place a broken marker) and the character falls into the giant grinders, which causes immediate death.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Characters of combat value 4 or more can use Pipes, but as soon as they step on them, the Pipes break and the character is killed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     When Pipes break, only the square where the character was standing is broken (not all of the Pipes). That can lead to a strange situation (but legal) where a piece of Pipes is all alone because the Pipes on each side were broken.&#10;&#10;&#10;Arch-Mage Treasure:&#10;&#10;     A character standing on an Arch-Mage Treasure square can pick up the treasure for 1 AP.

    "Description": "Like many of the great interstellar conflict games of our time, the story centers around a war where one empire emerges victorious. The game of Commonwealth, however, immerses players into a universe where that war has already happened. In a galaxy not so far away from our own, the victor of this old war has endured for centuries after the last of their adversaries were completely extinguished. After some time though, the very heart of their species began to rot with the knowledge of their forefathers and the annihilation they had wreaked upon their galaxy. In penance, the children of the last race searched the stars endlessly for some form of redemption and reprieve from their ageless guilt. And the day soon came when they found it. In the form of a small galaxy outside their own, they discovered several infant races untouched by hyperspace travel, and untouched by war. The Ancients came to our galaxy and swore they would protect its inhabitants from the same fate that befell their own. And so they introduced peace and order to the Milky Way, for only the Commonwealth could unite all the galaxy's races and prevent them from descending into the endless abyss of battle. If you remember, this is not a story about a great war. This is a story determining how the next age of our galaxy will unfold. Will you protect the Commonwealth and quell all rebellion, or will you dissent and usher in the next age of empire dominance?&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Commonwealth universe where three to six players clash economically, politically, militarily, and even covertly in an epic conflict that rides upon the ground-breaking game mechanic of simultaneous turns. By choosing one of twelve unique alien races, you will create customizable fleets, explore the galaxy coordinate by coordinate, acquire powerful technologies, and launch secret covert attacks that even your enemies (or friends) can't originate. For the more politically inclined players, the in-game government provides a dynamic experience that will test your mettle as you try orchestrate a series of legislative masterstrokes to cripple or empower the Commonwealth.&#10;&#10;All this to provide a real-time simulation of interstellar civilization and warfare at its finest.&#10;&#10;",

Of the Zyntrac Galaxy, the four closest galactic sectors contain the most energy and power of any galactic sectors in the universe.  The very essence of this untapped power is reason inough for all Interstellar War Lords to battle for possession of them.  Players become Interstellar War Lords in Star Siege and use the forces of the Black Hole to gain strategic power over their oppenents, thus limiting their movements and eventually eliminating them from the game.  Enter the Star Siege and let yourself be cast into a galaxy where space and time do collide.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME is to conquer the universe by strategically occupying planets in such a manner as to limit your opponent's movements and eliminate them from the game.&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT includes a game board, one die, 16 men and 144 planetary chips.&#10;&#10;The Star Siege game board is separated into four galactic sectors:  Sector 1 is the closest sector to the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.  Sectors 2 and 3 are the second and third closest to the Black Hole and contain 12 planets each.  Sector 4 is the farthest from the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 4 men of one colour and can use 1 to 4 men per game.  All players must use the same number of men.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 36 planetary chips of one colour.  These are used to designate ownership of planets.  When players come to rest on a planet they place one of their planetary chips in the space provided and place their men on top.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:  Roll of die determines order of play.  First player places one of him men and planetary chips on any unoccupied planet of his choice.  Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player doing the same until all planets are occupied.  Die is now re-rolled to determine who moves first.&#10;&#10;When a players man comes to rest upon an opponents unprotected planet, he invades that planet and replaces the man and chip with his own.&#10;&#10;Players try to enter the Black Hole by moving up along their own planets.  Upon entering the Black Hole the player can move his man to any unprotected planet on the board.&#10;&#10;A player's man can only be eliminated from the game when it is &quot;stranded&quot;.  A player is said to be stranded when one of his men is surrounded by his opponent's planets.&#10;&#10;A player is out of the game when all of his men have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;Game comes with instructions for basic, intermediate, advanced and expert level play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From the website)&#10;&#10;The first major battle of the Civil war, Bull Run (also known as First Manassas) was a contest of tactical opportunities lost. Featuring a brilliant flanking march by Union forces under General Irvin McDowell that caught the Confederate General Beauregard by surprise on his weak east flank, the Union army failed to roll up the Confederate line due, in great measure, to the famous stand by General Thomas Jackson's Virginia brgade, which was said to have stood &quot;like a stone wall&quot;. On the other side of the tactical ledger, General Beauregard's plan to drive across Bull Run on the west side to Centerville, thus cutting the Union army off from its supplies and communications, failed due to poorly communicated orders. Battle at Bull Run is a simulation of historical events of July 21, 1861 intended to give a feeling for the historical decisions required by the two army commanders in a fast play format.&#10;&#10;* Two-Person or Solitaire Play&#10;    * Color Five-Page Game Rules Manual&#10;    * Upgraded Game Map In Full Color&#10;    * Larger Game Map Now 15 x 11 Hexes&#10;    * 25 Upgraded 3/4&quot; Counters&#10;    * Two Union Units Added To Order of Battle&#10;    * Solitaire Play Rules&#10;    * Available in PDF Format&#10;&#10;",

The three cards are the flag, the coat of arms, and the capital.&#10;&#10;There are two phases of play, the &quot;road&quot; and the &quot;boardwalk&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Road:&#10;Players roll the dice and move their peg along the road traveling through 85 countries that existed during the mid 1980's.  When players land on a country, they must choose which card they think they can correctly guess.  When the player guesses correctly, the player obtains said card.&#10;&#10;The Boardwalk:&#10;A person can only move to the boardwalk when they have the necessary number of cards.  For instance, if the players agreed upon 3 countries to complete, the player must obtain 3 cards of the coat of arms, 3 of the flags, and 3 of the capitals (it doesn't matter if they are of the same country or not). During the boardwalk the players have chances to take away cards from other players and to correctly guess the remaining types of cards of the countries the player has already obtained cards for.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;Capitals - Flags - Coat of Arms in Flags The Game&#10;&#10;For the teen who has to learn geography!&#10;For the adult who wants to know more!&#10;A fun game for everyone no matter what is your knowledge about geography.&#10;You can play easily and with fun, because, Flags The Game makes a brain without strain.&#10;&#10;Publisher:&#10;RDN Games division of Publibec Limited&#10;Sorel, Quebec, Canada J3P 6K5&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "October, 1929: The Republic is crumbling. With the death of Gustav Stresemann on October 3, 1929 and the crash of the American Stock Exchange, Germany's recovery from the devastating Great War now is in doubt. Communist, Fascist and Republican forces clash over ideology and erupt into a war of words and violence. Unemployment begins to spiral out of control while the German people grow restless. Rallies are held by charismatic leaders as lawmakers struggle to find answers. Amongst the chaos, a new figure will head the German nation.&#10;&#10;Weimar: German Politics 1929-1933 is a two-player political game that tries to simulate the chaos of Germany prior to Hitler's appointment to chancellor. Will you take the role of the Social Democratic leadership, staving off the extreme ideologies of Communism and Fascism? Using your political influence and paramilitary forces, will you try to gain control of the Reichstag, or send Germany to the brink of anarchy? Can you change history, or is Germany doomed to repeat it?&#10;&#10;Weimar is a block/CDG in which one side plays the SPD and the other plays the NSDAP. A third Communist force is played by both players. Players hold rallies, street fights, build alliances, and try to win the hearts and minds of the German people.&#10;&#10;Victory can be achieved in multiple ways, with both parties being able to gain influence in each electoral area and score them in each election phase. Influence is gained by holding rallies and bringing political and paramilitary forces to both &quot;encourage&quot; and intimidate the German people. Alternatively for the Nazis, they can use events to increase chaos and unrest in order to bring down the weak parliamentary government. For the SPD, they can use special actions to stop the Nazi political machine, including the elimination of its leadership.&#10;&#10;",

But now a freak accident has occurred at the Cogtower, scattering cogs all over town and sending the clockwork winders into chaos. The Cogmen must repair the Cogtower before it is too late.&#10;&#10;Each player directs a handful of resourceful Cogmen to gather cogs and repair the Cogtower. Each turn, a Winding card will be drawn from the deck, and any Cogmen standing adjacent to a Winder will be wound up by that amount, gaining Energy. Once all the Winding cards have been used, a Rainy Day card is added and the deck is reshuffled. If a Rainy Day card is drawn, any Cogmen who don&rsquo;t find shelter will get wet and rust (a terrible fate!)&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving all of their Cogmen, who must spend Energy to move. At the end of the turn, any Cogmen dangerously low on Energy (and not near a Winder) may make a Desperation move, one last push towards a Winder before becoming unwound. A Cogman that becomes unwound is inoperable until he is wound up by an ally.&#10;&#10;Cogmen gather the cogs that are scattered about Cogsburg, returning them to the Cogtower to gain victory points, or he may choose to repair a broken/rusted Cogman instead. A Cogman can only carry a single cog at a time (They&rsquo;re very heavy!)&#10;&#10;Once the Cogtower has been rebuilt, final scores are tallied. Each player recieves one Victory Point for every cog they supplied to the Cogtower, plus an additional point for each operable Cogman.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. Rules for three players and four-player team play are included. Official rules for entirely cooperative play are forthcoming.&#10;&#10;",

Tarot games have been played in that city for over 500 years, and the game of Ottocento as currently played preserves distinct characteristics (both of the games and of the pack of cards) which go back at least to the 16th century. The special 62-card pack that is used and the game itself are often known as Tarocchino (pronounced tarokino), the diminutive form of Tarocco referring to the reduction of the pack from 78 to 62 cards.&#10;&#10;Ottocento is a point-trick game, with trumps. The cards have point values individually (as in other Tarot games) but also score in combinations. There is no bidding, but players can score by declaring card combinations held in their hands at the start of play, as well as for combinations taken in tricks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary:&#10;&#10;Gameplay: A shogi variant that adds dice-driven combat, modified by using effect cards (only one card--selected at the beginning of the game). Figures are pewter. Collect figures (power levels from 1 to 5) to construct your 5-combatant team (using two of six colors). More powerful characters can only be summoned if a certain number of colors are on the table.&#10;&#10;Theme: Uses characters from Dragon Ball Kai, pitting one team of combatants against another. The same character can be found across multiple colors, roughly corresponding to allegiances found in the manga (comics). For example, Goku is found in both a low power level and a high power level (super), but even characters without supers are represented.&#10;&#10;Goal: There are two variants, basic and advanced. In the basic, simply having characters breakthrough (reach the opponent's starting line) completes the game. In the advanced, there are three win conditions, including having the majority of your characters occupying the Dragon Ball area in the middle of the playing field.&#10;&#10;Components: There are preconstructed starters (currently 3 available), and booster singles (currently 2 available). Starters include 5 figures (using two colors), a die, a double-sided effect card, a rule sheet, and a play mat (paper). The third starter play mat sports different coloring and English. Singles include a figure and a tip sheet showing how all the figures from the set might be used.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fool's Poker is a surprisingly deep poker variant which retains the hidden information and bluffing of poker but adds a strong deductive element.  It is played with a traditional 52-card deck.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, all players are have hands of size 5.  Each round, the players are dealt a new hand.  One player calls out a 5-card poker hand that they believe can be made by the collective cards of all the players.  The player to their left must call the previous player's bluff by saying &quot;BS&quot; or similar, or otherwise state a higher hand of their own.  Play continues clockwise until a player's bluff has been called.  Players pool their cards and see if the last name hand can be assembled from their cards.  If the hand is possible, the hand size of the player who called the bluff drops by 1.  Otherwise, the hand of the player whose bluff was called decreases by 1.&#10;&#10;The next round begins with fresh hands using the new lower hand limits.  The player who called &quot;BS&quot; last round starts the new round.  If a player's hand size drops to zero, they are out of the game.  Play continues until the players only have 4 cards between them, and the player with most cards remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;Rules for hands:&#10;Pair, Two Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, and 4 of a Kind: must name their card values&#10;Straights, Flush, and Straight Flush: must name their high card&#10;Flush and Straight Flush: also must name their suit&#10;&#10;Variant: The 2's are wild able to take any value and suit.  The 5 of a Kind hand becomes a valid poker hand, ranked higher than Royal Flush.  This variant addresses the issue where, late in the game, it may be difficult to assemble even small hands.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taktikus is a simple two-player abstract strategy game. The game is played with eight wooden marbles for each player (white and black, respectively) on an 8 by 8 square grid of indents. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s marbles. At the beginning each player places his or her marbles in the first row (i.e. the row closest to the respective player).  Each player then on turn moves one marble of choice. A marble may move horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as far as the player wants but is not allowed to jump over other marbles (of either color). Change of direction during a move is not allowed. Marbles are captured in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;     by capturing one or more of the opponents marbles (in an unbroken row or column) between two of one&rsquo;s own marbles.&#10;     by moving a marble into an empty space in-between two of the opponents marbles, which are both captured.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is left with only one marble (unless he/she is able to win the game in the subsequent move by capturing two of the opponent marbles) and the other player is the winner.&#10;&#10;The rule sheet that comes with the game has a couple of diagrams illustrating the two types of capture.&#10;The nice, small wooden board is in two hinged halves with storage compartment for the marbles inside when closed.&#10;&#10;",

The standard orthodox chess array is used, but in order to avoid uncapturable pieces at the edge of the board, two extra ranks and two extra files of edge squares are added. These edge squares can only be entered as the result of a capturing jump, and pieces sitting on them are obliged to capture if possible. The object of the game is to capture the opposing King, not to checkmate it.&#10;&#10;This game won the Chess Variant Pages 100 Square Contest.&#10;&#10;",

If the player&rsquo;s stone occupies the last empty cell in a hex, the stones of the dominant color in that hex are replaced by stones of the non-dominant color.

So....the more you know about John Stockton and how many assists he averaged, the better guess you can make as your answer.&#10;&#10;You don't ever have to be exact, but the more you know, the faster you move up the fantasy category charts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules book:&#10;&#10;Family kit contains five engaging games that combine U.S. geography with the math of numbers, data, logic, and strategy. The games are ideal for children 7 to 13 to play with parents, siblings, or friends. Children a little younger can play them with an adult or older child. The directions include ways to adjust the games to fit the age and experience of the players.&#10;&#10;Games included are: (1) Guess my state; (2) Take a trip; (3) Guess my rule; (4) Capture states; and (5) Closest match.&#10;&#10;(1) Guess my state - In this game, similar to &quot;Twenty Questions,&quot; players ask questions to try to identify a secret state that one player has chosen. At the start of the game, the state cards are laid out face up. Players take turns tryin to identify the secret state by asking yes-or-no questions (e.g., Did it become a state in the 1800s? Does your state border Canada?). After each question is answered, the states that have been ruled out are removed from the layout. The player who narrows the layout down to the secret state is the winner. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Take a trip - In this game, players navigate around the U.S. by finding states that border one another. At the start of the game, one state card is turned up. On the first turn, a player puts down a state card that borders it from their hand of 3 cards. The next player puts down a card that borders that state, and so on. For example, if Texas is turned up at the start of the game, on the first turn a player could put down Oklahoma, since it borders Texas. On the second turn, a player could put down Kansas, since it borders Oklahoma. The game is over when one player plays all of their cards or no more cards can be placed. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards. May also be played cooperatively with all players' cards face up.&#10;&#10;(3) Guess my rule - In this game,players try to discover a secret rule that one player is using to sort the states into two groups. For instance, a secret rule could be &quot;borders on an ocean.&quot; States that border an ocean would go in one group; states that do not border an ocean would go in the other group. the Rule Maker selects about six states form the layout ans sorts them into two groups according to the rule. Players take turns trying to figure out the rule by choosing a state that has not yet been sorted and saying which group they think it belongs in. After three turns in a row in which players sort states correctly, they may begin to guess the rule. The first player to guess the rule wins. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.&#10;&#10;(4) Capture states - In this game, similar to &quot;War,&quot;players compare the states according to a certain feature. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as year of statehood. On each round, all players put out a state card at the same time from their stack of face down cards. The player with the state that has the biggest number for the chosen feature (e.g., became a state most recently) captures all the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;(5) Closest match - In this game, players use math to find states that are most alike. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as number of libraries. In each round, they compare the states in their hand to a Goal state. For instance, if the Goal is Colorado, which has 253 libraries, they find the card in their hand of five cards that has closest to 253 libraries. They compare their chosen states, and the player with the closest of all takes the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10; - large map of U.S. for reference&#10; - 26 Blue fact cards, one for each of &#10;   the states in the Eastern U.S. &#10;   (sorry, no Washington, D.C.)&#10; - 24 Red fact cards, one for each of &#10;   the states in the Western U.S.&#10; - 10 Wild cards&#10; - 10 sample rules/question cards&#10;&#10;",
