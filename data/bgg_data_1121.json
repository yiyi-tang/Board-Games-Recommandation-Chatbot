    "Description": "In the land of Westeros, a title is a potential gateway to a life of leisure. Having land and dominion over those on it can easily lead to never having to work a single day. The Warrior's Sons, however, have eschewed all lands and titles, devoting their lives to the Seven. Instead of having servants bring them everything, they have honed their combat skills and owe their service to High Septon.&#10;&#10;The Warrior's Sons unit box for A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Lannister players a righteous arm out on the battlefield. These highly-skilled and well-equipped soldiers are an avenging scythe, cutting down those who oppose them and using their faith to bolster themselves during combat, gaining Faith tokens that they can use for different bonuses and abilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When one makes their way into the Night's Watch, they aren't simply made a Sworn Brother immediately. While the organization has traditionally lax rules for recruitment, there is still a period where those that sign up are simply conscripts, being used where necessary to keep those south of The Wall safe. Eventually, if they survive, and with proper training, they will have the opportunity to join the Night's Watch proper.&#10;&#10;The Conscripts unit box for A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game for the Night's Watch army is not as strong or as tough as many of the other units available to Night's Watch Commanders. However, what they lack in abilities they make up for in ease of fielding. Night's Watch units can get costly points-wise to bring to battle, so the Conscripts can help balance numbers closer to equal. And the Watch Recruiter Unit Attachment can help any unit in the Night's Watch army work just a bit more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Lightly armed and armored, the Trappers are well-versed at harrying tactics. Able to deal wounds directly to enemy units via their Hidden Traps order, they can greatly disrupt an opponent's plans. And being Insignificant, they aren't worth victory points when destroyed, allowing Free Folk Commanders use them more dangerously, without worrying about giving them up to the enemy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They don't relentlessly train and drill maneuvers. They barely have weapons, just scavenging a bit of bone or old swords from the battlefield. But what they lack in military tactics, they more than make up for in one thing: numbers. When the raiders come down from the north, they&rsquo;re like a tidal wave, overwhelming enemy defenses as they go.&#10;&#10;The Free Folk Raiders unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk commanders a new option for the battlefield. The unit may not have the best stats in the game, but that means their low cost makes them very easy to combine with any force. The Raid Leader Unit Attachment adds to their deadliness, allowing another Fee Folk unit to activate directly after the Raiders do.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Savage Giant is both resilient and deadly. Their Mighty Swing doesn't allow for Defensive Saves as it can bash through multiple troops with a single swing. The Giant is resilient, too, having five Wounds and only taking a wound for each two Hits it takes. Hurting the Giant just makes it mad, with its Mighty Swing doing more and more damage for each Wound the Giant has.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To combat this, Freedom Squadron has unleashed their own batch of reformed elite soldiers; the Carnage Corps. These elite members have been hand-picked by Corporal Carnage and reformed in his Carnage Dome to be the best of the best, and they are all steeped in the importance of teamwork, sacrificing their own time and efforts to bolster the greater good. Now enhanced on both sides, the battle truly becomes more epic between Freedom Squadron and VENOM!&#10;&#10;In VENOM Assault: Villians &amp; Valor players can now add all new VENOM Leaders and Support Cards to the game that bring the new Failed Combat mechanic into play.  Players must be more careful about charging into battle or risk losing cards from their hands.  New Freedom Squadron Soldiers bring along the Teamwork ability that allows them to be played out of turn to bolster the active player or they can be held in reserve to boost your own turn. Brand new Event Cards can be used to create a different event deck every game and feature all-new Dual Event Cards and Enhanced VENOM Strikes to bring an even greater challenge to the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Paradise Revolution is a four player strategy tabletop game inspired by the classic strategy games of the past like Risk, Axis and Allies, and Diplomacy featuring a Cold War theme and Latin American aesthetic this game aims to create a fun, intense, and thrilling experience for all players. This game can last for one to five hours, and is build to be easy-to-learn and hard to master, i.e. deep enough gameplay to entertain tabletop strategy veterans while being easy to pick up for new players.&#10;&#10;The setting of the game is Santa Maria, a fictional Caribbean island that is at the center of a proxy conflict between the great powers. Play as one of four factions, the Communists, Fascists, Liberals, or Socialists, and take over the island to form it in your desired image.&#10;&#10;This game was created out of passion and love for classic strategy board games, as well as the creators' keen interest in Cold War history and the history and culture of Latin America. Backing is needed to pay for manufacturing and distribution of the game.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Leader Cards&#10;&#10;Each faction controls a portion of the island at the start of the game. Each player picks a leader from their faction, which grants a special ability that can shape a player's strategy. This can range from directly stealing your opponent's resources, sabotaging your opponent's plans through espionage, aggressively pushing into enemy territory, out-producing your opponent, and more.&#10;&#10;Every leader offers a completely unique strategy. In general, fascist leaders focus on building and keeping early momentum, socialist leaders seek to outlast their opponents, communist leaders focus on espionage and sabotage, and liberal leaders focus on resource production and management.&#10;&#10;The Map&#10;&#10;Every state on the board has two resource values: Capital and Manpower. Each turn you can choose to either add your states' resources to your resource pool, or use your current resource pool to build partisans, the game's combat unit. States with a combined resource value of five of more (3/2, for example), are considered &quot;urban&quot; while the rest are considered &quot;non-urban.&quot; Controlling all urban states or controlling four urban states while having five action cards in your hand will win you the game.&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;&#10;These cards grant you bonuses or can be used to weaken your foes. They can take many forms, such as passive bonuses, combat buffs, free resources, and more. Action cards can be acquired in two ways. You can draw action cards once per turn, or you can pay 15 capital to spy on an opponent, meaning they must show you their hand, then choose an action card and give it to you. This is a very powerful ability, because not only does it give you a potentially game-changing boost, it can take one away from your opponents as well.&#10;&#10;Action cards, with a few exceptions, can be played at any time, including during an opponent's turn. That opponent who just attacked you with 4 partisans? You can target him with an action card and destroy three of them. Make sure not to spend all your capital on spying, because certain extra-powerful action cards require you to pay capital in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;The combat in this game is similar to that in Risk and other classic war-games. The attacker rolls up to three dice for each attacking unit, while the defender rolls up to two and has an advantage on ties. If combat is going unexpectedly poorly due to a surprise action card or a streak of unending poor rolls, you can choose to retreat, roll a die, and escape safely if you roll a three or higher. If you roll lower, one of your partisans is destroyed.&#10;&#10;Actions&#10;&#10;Players receive three actions per turn. These include things like invading enemy states, making truces, drawing cards, and spying. Actions are important because they add a new layer of strategy to the game, making it easier to punish an opponent's strategic error, adding new depth to plan around, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Necronomicon is a card game set in the dark worlds of H.P. Lovecraft where two players fight each other casting spells, summoning Mythos creatures and using firearms. The knowledge about the mythos can be learnt reading rare arcane books and the magical power can be increased to cast more powerful spells, but also the sanity of the character played will lose sanity progressively, leading to schizofrenia, agorafobia and other terrible effects.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to make the life points of the opponent reach zero. From the deck, 5 cards are dealt to each of the players and one card from the hand can be played each round.&#10;&#10;There are three ways damage can be inflicted, by using conventional fire arms, casting spells and summoning Mythos creatures. Creatures do not block direct attacks from the cards and they don&rsquo;t attack directly, instead they counterattack after your opponent has damaged you.&#10;&#10;Cards involving the Chtuhu Mythos (spells and creatures) have a sanity cost which is listed as a number in the card.&#10;&#10;Apart from the life points, there are four other parameters with a value that will change along the game: i) Elder sign, ii) Arcane power, iii) Taint of the yellow sign, and iv) Sanity.&#10;&#10;i) Elder Sign is one defense against the Mythos effects. It can be increased through the use of certain cards. For each point you have, you will take 1 less damage from spell cards and monsters.&#10;&#10;ii) Arcane Power represents the magical power gained by the knowledge of the Mythos. Arcane Power can be increased through the use of certain cards such as reading Arcane books. For every point you have, you will deal one extra damage for all cards that show the symbol next to the damage number.&#10;&#10;iii) Taint of the yellow sign is a magical curse that can be inflicted using certain cards. Its effect is that for every tainted point you have, you will take one damage at the end of your turn. The only way to purge yourself of the taint is to use certain cards.&#10;&#10;iv) Sanity: cards related to the Mythos cost sanity points to use. Sanity is the cost for delving into de Mythos and some cards cost zero due them not being of an occult nature. If your sanity reaches zero you will be insane. There are various types of insanity effects, and one of them will be applied randomly:&#10;&#10;     Schizophrenia: At the end of each turn, Elder Sign and Arcane Power go to zero.&#10;     Megalomania: At the end of each turn, add +2 Arcane and + 4 Taint.&#10;     Xenophobia: your summon cards have no effect.&#10;     Agoraphobia: you can only have 2 cards in your hand. Remove randomly any excess cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The maps should be printed on 12 x 18 inch paper to produce an 11 x 17 inch map.***&#10;&#10;Mind the Gap depicts a never fought 1979/80 engagement in the Fulda Gap using Jim Day's and GMT&rsquo;s MBT Game pitting an M60A3 Tank Company from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment &ldquo;The Black Horse&rdquo; against a reinforced Motorized Rifle Battalion equipped with BMP-2 and T-64BV Tanks acting as a Regimental Advance Guard which has penetrated the Regiment's screen line while the rest of the Corps moves into position.&#10;&#10;The scenario reflects my experience as a Platoon Leader in the gap as a tank and armored cavalry platoon leader and troop XO in the 1st Squadron, 11th ACR stationed in Fulda from January 1977 &ndash; December 1979. The game is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit. The actual fight was not; we had a healthy respect for the quantity, if not the quality, of the enemy.&#10;&#10;The objective for the Soviet Player is to move 51%+ off the map's West Edge while the US player attempts to destroy the enemy advance guard and restore the screen line.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game. The expansion includes 9 11 x 17 maps scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game), a Scenario Briefing, a B Troop Battle Book and a Soviet Battle book with deployment instructions and order of battle listing, and a small errata sheet. The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.&#10;&#10;The map will be mailed to customers and the files may be downloaded from this site.&#10;&#10;Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders. A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.&#10;&#10;Mind the Gap can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 6 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 6 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are symbols on the tiles that active actions when you match a cookie, such as: crumble - to send another players cookies back to the tray. Burn - to send everyone's cookies back to the tray.

Once earned, place on a single stack/variety to protect them. However, the stack is frozen as well, you cannot collect that variety! Oven mitts can be moved following the game rules, and other players mitts can be moved by drawing a tile with an oven mitt symbol and matching at least one cookie.&#10;&#10;It's an ever changing scramble of matching, collecting, stealing and protecting.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the last tile has been drawn, played and scored.&#10;&#10;The player with the most cookies wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the far future, humans have spread across the galaxy. Gigantic ships ply the stars - stars that lie under the shadow of a terrible swarm. The militaries of humanity are joined in an impossibly huge fleet to dam the bugs&rsquo; advance, but many planets have already fallen.  While the bulk of the fleets weighs anchor for refit, a fast cutter is dispatched to Helos - one such ruined world - with a complement of one hundred volunteers. They have ninety days to rescue as many stranded survivors as they can.&#10;&#10;Operation Last Train is a solo or cooperative game designed to use sci-fi soldiers from any range in any combination. Teams of six volunteers drop in mixed units to rescue civilians. They are opposed by a never-ending tide of ravening bugs. Fast combat and a simple AI make for quick and exciting games that fit on a kitchen table. Track the status and experience of each volunteer and rotate rosters to meet the needs of the day. This is a game of emergent narrative. It&rsquo;s easy to make the world personal and engaging. The volunteers may come from every company and regiment the future could hold. No two drops need look or play the same.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a volunteer may take a move action and a shoot action (any melee combat is resolved as part of the move action that brings volunteers and bugs into contact). Combat is resolved with ten-sided dice.  The bugs have no ranged capabilities - in any shoot action, the bugs are either missed, knocked down, or killed depending on the roll.  In melee, the volunteers' roll decides everything: a volunteer's failure is her enemy's success. A volunteer's load-out and regiment determine how many dice she rolls, and what qualifies as a hit. After the volunteers have performed all of their actions, a simple AI governs the movement of any bugs on the table.&#10;&#10;Scenarios lay out the specifics of the volunteers' objectives.  The game ends when those objectives are met, or all volunteers are off of the table. Generally, objectives revolve around searching for, and escorting survivors off the table.&#10;&#10;",

Players manage an economy of resources and play event cards in order to build and expand an empire and destroy their opponents.  There is only one winner in every game of Kingslayer, but there are three paths to victory:  slay an opposing king, control 20 territories, or control the most territories when the deck of event cards runs out.  Kingslayer, at it's core, is an exercise in resource management.&#10;&#10;Players will spend their resources to send their units into unclaimed territories and to build settlements.  Each territory may contain one settlement and for every settlement built players can add a resource to the resource pool.  Players may use their new resources to continue to move units, build settlements, or attack opposing units.  Players may also spend their resources on recruiting new units, which may only be placed on the same territory as their king, which can not move.  Combat is decided through dice rolls and favors outnumbering your opponent as well as the attacker.&#10;&#10;Kingslayer uses a unique turn order mechanic which moves in a clockwise order, but only for players with at least one resource currently in the resource pool.  If a player doesn't have any resources in the resource pool, their turn is skipped.  If no resources of any color are in the resource pool, the pool is refreshed and all players draw a card.  As long as players have at least one resource in the resource pool, they may play one card on their turn instead of spending resources.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
