Players race against the clock in the last few minutes of their complex heist.&#10;&#10;Each player will gather the tools necessary to satisfy their collection of jobs.  Tools are not used up, so the same tool can help to complete multiple jobs at the same time.  More efficient combinations of tools and jobs divided between players will allow the team to successfully complete one of several heist scenarios before the time is up and the thieves are discovered.&#10;&#10;Once the team masters the fundamental elements of the game, communication restrictions are introduced.  A member of the heist crawling through the ducts is unable to communicate as freely as the computer specialist in the van.  One team member might be speaking only in questions, a second might have to stare at the ceiling, and a third might be restricted to saying only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.&#10;&#10;If the players are lucky, everything will go, well, you know...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Square pieces move orthogonally (rook move) and jump diagonally. Players are trying to get three pieces in a line, past their centre line. Once this happens, the pieces &quot;Tafl Up&quot; into a stack. First player to get all their pieces into stacks, wins the game. Simple.&#10;&#10;Tafl Up takes the usual capturing style of the game and turns it on its head by making the players flank (capture) their own pieces. With no taking, there is no player elimination, but players will find strong competitive elements in blocking and efficiency.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Mankind has mastered technology and is finally about to cross the final frontier, leaving Earth and colonizing space.&#10;&#10;Since the recent discovery of vast resource deposits below the Moon's surface, four of the most wealthy and prominent nations have taken aim at establishing lunar outposts.&#10;&#10;In Lunar Outpost, the players take on the roles as the supreme and beloved leaders of the four nations. Lead your nation to glory and you will be forever remembered in the history books. Lead your nation to defeat and your entire nation will be forgotten as a parenthesis in history.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the space age.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;In Lunar Outpost, 2-4 players compete over a precious but limited resource. They do so through drawing and placing hexagonal terrain tiles depicting the barren surface of the moon.&#10;&#10;Most tiles feature a location suitable for constructing a building and a few tiles feature resource deposits. Each tile may connect to some, none or all of its neighbors through its edges. Tiles only connect when the terrain of the shared edge is passable.&#10;&#10;Each player starts out with a single building next to a small resource deposit and is only allowed to expand their outpost to connected tiles that are unclaimed by other players. This must be done as the total number of resources that may be extracted from the resource deposit is limited.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, new resource deposits will be discovered. In order to obtain the valuable resources, players must construct buildings capable of harvesting the resource in the direct proximity of the resource deposit.&#10;&#10;The game features several different building types that may be constructed, each with their own perks and granting a certain number of victory points. Resources are consumed when buildings are constructed so players will have to form a strategy and adapt depending on how the game develops.&#10;&#10;Agressive players may construct buildings capable of recruiting troops and attack other players' buildings and/or troops. Defensive players may construct defensive structures to prevent agressive players from reaching their resource producing buildings. Terrain can also be used as an advantage.&#10;&#10;A player may be heavily decimated from the attack of another player. It is even possible for players to coordinate their attacks against a stronger opponent and prevent them from dominating the game. Although rare, players can even be completely eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends in the turn where the last tile is placed. Players compute the total number of victory points awarded from each of their buildings left standing and the player with the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Power Grid: Middle East/South Africa is a pair of expansion maps for Power Grid!&#10;&#10;&bull; For decades, there has been an abundance of oil in the Middle East. However, in the near future the so-called &quot;peak oil&quot; threatens this area: This is the point in time when the output of the oil wells begins to decrease. Already, a few countries of this region have nuclear power plants, and that number will increase in the future as the amount of oil from the wells diminishes. Most likely, other energy sources will play a part, too, such as the recycling of plastic waste.&#10;&#10;The players start the game with an excessive supply of oil. Additionally, the players have access to plenty of natural gas (using the coal tokens of the base game) and a few solar plants (the green power plants). However, at the start of the game the players cannot buy nuclear or garbage power plants.&#10;&#10;During Step 2, the abundance of oil and natural gas will run dry. Both nuclear and garbage power plants will then be available as alternatives. Thus, in the middle of the game the players are forced to adjust their power plant mix.&#10;&#10;&bull; The energy supply in South Africa is executed almost exclusively by a single trust, which is the seventh biggest energy supplier in the world measured against the production of energy. Roughly 90% of the energy is produced in coal power plants. Additionally, South Africa uses a few nuclear power plants and both water and wind ecological power plants.&#10;&#10;Because of its size, the trust also supplies half of the rest of Africa with energy. Thus, the game board contains six international power connections and a lot of available coal.&#10;&#10;",

Each day one card per player is dealt to the center of the table, and then everyone simultaneously bids how early they'll get up.

Although the Ming Dynasty itself came to power through a peasant revolt, this did not mean that the rulers had any more empathy for the peasants than the previous rulers. Players will gain a lot of support from the peasants in this expansion, but if pushed too far, players will have to work together to avoid their wrath.&#10;     The Palace Stairs: Moving your Envoy towards the Emperor will not be without consequences with this expansion module. Players will be able to choose a longer or shorter path leading towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The shorter path will require some achievements, the long path will earn players rewards at first, but when they get close to the Palace, they will have to pay certain taxes or risk seeing their Envoy take steps back.&#10;     Extra Decrees and Gift Cards: Spice up your game with new Decrees and special kinds of Gift Cards, like the lamp and jade knives, which will add even more variety to your game of G&ugrave;g&#197;&#141;ng!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reinventing the classic Australian sheep-farming game 'Squatter', 'Extractor' is a dystopian board game that maps the possible dynamics of global data-driven businesses or 'platforms' as they compete for world domination. The vast accumulation of data needed for this goal is set against a backdrop of aggressively 'extractive' business practices and the impact they have on the planet. Extraction is a fundamental mechanism of most industries, with a small few accumulating great wealth by extracting value from the earth and the majority of its population. In the universe of Extractor, these global platforms--and aspiring monopolies--automate extraction processes and dominate industry, exhausting resources and polarising society in its wake.&#10;&#10;This is a playable artwork by Simon Denny, produced in a limited edition of 1000 copies to accompany the exhibition MINE, by Simon Denny, at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), Hobart (Tas.), June 2019 - April 2020.&#10;&#10;&quot;Instead of making an exhibition catalogue for Simon Denny's exhibition Mine, we chose to make a board game, thus giving you the opportunity to experience the dynamics of the data mining world, in addition to reading about it. [...] Making reference to the classic Australian sheep farming board game 'Squatter', Simon's game 'Extractor' allows you to read and theorise on the topic through a great selection of essays, but also to play against your friends in a highly competitive scramble to achieve world data domination.&quot; - Rule book foreword.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A deck building game that centers around tribes of squirrels harvesting acorns in preparation for winter.&#10;&#10;Theme: The winter is fast approaching and with the cold and snow comes a lack of food. The leaves are beginning to fall from the trees and with them the acorns. All of this means that it is time for the squirrel tribes inhabiting the forest to begin gathering food for the winter. There is just one problem! There is only one oak tree left in the forest making the much coveted acorns a source of warfare. The squirrel tribes have gathered their forces and have even resorted to hiring other forest animals to help them squirrel away as many nuts for the winter as possible. Gathering acorns is easy; protecting them from bands of raiders sent out by the other squirrel tribes is a different story. In Forest Fighters you will hire forest animals to help your tribe of squirrels gather and protect acorns while stealing acorns from your opponents. Once all of the acorns have been gathered, the game ends and the player with the most acorns wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After the use of these technologies in the military field and a devastating war, civilization finds itself on the margins of survival. In this climate of tension between the population of the lower social class and the political ruling class, the DeathRace CyberGlobe sport is consolidated. A violent race of BOTs driven by humans  for the conquest of fame and economic power. The DeathRace CyberGlobe has become the dream of turning life but also an outlet for the population that is being overwhelmed by this &quot;format&quot; as a dogma and only pastime. The teams take part in the races putting their lives at risk, even knowing that they have very few chances to win, since the Tracks are full of traps and in the race BOT automata are introduced to make the competitions even more lethal and spectacular.&#10;&#10;The game:&#10;The game is recommended for players over 10 years old, not because of the complexity, but because of some violent terms in it (although I believe that on TV there are certainly worse contents in the protected area). and some small component. Structured to play it from 1 to 4 players with a small and simple AI that controls the BOT automata. There are three categories that vary the difficulty and time of a game (between 30-90 minutes).&#10;The BasicLine: the simplest category that helps the player to understand the mechanics of the game.&#10;TeamRacer: The category dedicated to teams, where each player can compete with a team of 4 maximum BOTs.&#10;DeathRace: The most destructive category thanks to the additional weapons that BOTs can equip.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Spin the Spinner, pick the card from the corresponding Cards pile, if it is a &quot;Find&quot; card look for that feature on the map, if it is a &quot;Tell &quot; card look carefully at that feature/ map given on the card and answer correctly and if the spinner has landed on &quot; ? &quot;space, answer the question given on that card. If you have answered correctly move forward and take another turn. First player to reach the Finish square wins the game. To reinforce the knowledge and practice map skills fill and colour the blank maps with the help of maps given on the opposite page of every map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cardwords is a word card game where each card has a letter and players spell words with them.  Both double deck and single deck versions have been published.&#10;&#10;Each deck has two copies of each letter of the alphabet, along with a point value of 1-4 points.  In all of the games playable with these decks, a duplicate letter can be used as a wild card standing for any letter, e.g. in &quot;FFGHT&quot;, since there are two 'F's one can be considered an 'I', spelling &quot;FIGHT&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rules are included for seven games: &#10;&#10;    1: A fishing game like Logomachy (which is like Scopa), where a card played either combines with cards on the table to make a word, or is left on the table.&#10;    2: Poker using words, either 5-card stud, 7-card stud or 5-card draw. &#10;    3: Bingo, each player having a 3x3 array of cards, turning cards one at a time in any order (except the middle card last), with the first 3-letter word formed winning. &#10;    4: Rummy, where players draw but never discard, laying down words from their hand or adding to words on the table, and the first player to play all their hand wins. &#10;    5: Rummy, like #4 except a card is discarded at the end of each turn. &#10;    6: Rummy, like #5 except that adding letters to a word lets you steal the word. &#10;    7: Players start with 13-card hands, all players simultaneously pass a card to the left until one player announces having a word worth 15+ points and claims the pot. Then the player with the word gives one-word clues to their word until another player guesses their word, and the two split the second pot. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each game uses chips, with players adding chips to the pot during play, and the winner claiming the pot. Chips are not provided in the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Word-Opsy is a game of forming words from individual letters on cards. It has two decks, each of which 4 of each vowel (1 of the 4 having a star), 2 of each common consonant, and 1 each for the six rarer consonants.  There are rules for three games:&#10;&#10;In Word-Opsy, in each turn a player lays down a word from the hand, or adds cards to one of their existing words (in either case refilling the hand back up to 6 cards), or draws a card and passes. After the last card is drawn and everyone gets an extra turn, each word scores the square of its length, with every star in it adding the word's value again.&#10;&#10;Word-Rummy plays like Word-Opsy except that players discard a card at the end of their turn, and do not draw if they pass. The games ends when one player plays all the cards from their hand. Scoring is as in Word-Opsy with the player going out getting a 25-point bonus.&#10;&#10;Word-Cassino plays like Casino, where a turn is taking a card from the hand and either: making a word with it and cards on the table to claim those cards; adding it to cards on the table and announcing a word to be finished later in the round; or adding it to the table cards. After the deck is played out, the player with the most cards gets 3 points, the most vowels gets 1 point, and 1 point for each Q, Z, or star card. Hands are played until a player has 21 points or more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
