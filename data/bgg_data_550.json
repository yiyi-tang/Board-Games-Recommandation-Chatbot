Similar to &quot;Wizard&quot; and other trick-taking games you must guess the number of tricks you will take each round, but the total number guessed cannot equal the hand-size for the round (forcing at least one player to lose each round).&#10;&#10;Hand size starts at 8 then decreases by 1 each round until it is only 1 card, then it increases (1 card each round) back to 8.&#10;&#10;The deck includes rules for three games:&#10;UG I-is the standard 2&ndash;6 player trick-taking game&#10;UG II&mdash;is played in partnerships&#10;UG III&mdash;is a solitaire variant of the game&#10;&#10;From the rule book:&#10;In the future, the metric system will be adopted worldwide. The Universal Deck is the first to adopt a truly metric size, 6 x 9 cm.

    "Description": "Description of 2008 (print-and-play) 1st Edition:&#10;&#10;In the 1920s, United States military planners hatched a scheme for the invasion of Canada. Called War Plan Crimson, it was a subset of War Plan Red, the plan for war with England, the largest, most detailed and most amended of all the U.S. war plans. A war with Great Britain and the British Commonwealth would be a world-wide conflict, easily making the term &ldquo;Second World War&rdquo; appropriate.&#10;&#10;Even without the expected aid from Japan, the powerful British navy would threaten U.S. interests in and control of the Philippines, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Cuba and Puerto Rico as well as the Panama Canal. In exchange for these losses, the U.S. planned to conquer Canada. This would be a crown to Manifest Destiny and a platform to rebuild and eventually regain all that would be lost elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Canada would be invaded even if neutral. The Canadian government would be abolished and the conquest held in perpetuity. It would be made clear to Canada she would suffer grievously for resistance. The British peoples were seen as tough adversaries capable of fighting against odds to the finish. Use of poison gas was authorized from the start of hostilities. It would be a terrible war where populations would be on the front lines.&#10;&#10;Experience had taught the British the advantage of naval control, and geography provided an inland ocean. The Great Lakes would be a shield of the Canadian Dominion and another sword to cut and bleed the United States of America. A long period of tension during which both sides made military preparations would include building naval forces for the Great Lakes.&#10;&#10;Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is the most unusual game ever published in our popular naval series. While we've created games based on wars that never happened, fought with ships that were never built, in each case military planners thought about these battles and the ships at least reached the planning stage.&#10;&#10;In this case, designer Milan Becvar has created a game in which neither the ships nor the plans have a &quot;real world&quot; analogue. That allows for a wide-open strategic situation, in which friendly and enemy bases are so close together that fleets cannot hope to elude one another.&#10;&#10;There are 80 &quot;long&quot; ship pieces, using a larger size than usual for our naval games &mdash; both to make it easier to assemble them and because they're just plain cool.  This is further supplemented by 264 square pieces for smaller ships, aircraft, fleet and other markers.  The American and Canadian fleets are almost exclusively composed of &quot;lake battleships,&quot; similar to the coast defense vessels of other navies, with shallow draft and anywhere from four to seven big guns. There are also a handful of cruisers and a large number of destroyers.&#10;&#10;The map, by Guy Riessen, covers the Great Lakes basin at the usual 32 miles per &quot;sea&quot; zone. All of the lakes are covered, linked by canals, both those that existed and those that could have been built. Both sides of the lakes are dotted with ports, with the American side hosting many vulnerable industrial centers and the Canadian shores within easy reach of the Dominion's vulnerable east-west lines of communication.&#10;&#10;There are 13 scenarios, or separate game situations, included, with many more likely to join them in future Daily Content segments. The game uses the regular Great War at Sea rules, with some special rules to address this unusual situation.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is our first print-and-play game: The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.  The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of our Gold Club.&#10;&#10;",

We have a Dexter!&rdquo; &#10;Welcome to the world of Ambush Z, where the Revenant Plague has unleashed legions of walking dead upon the living. Fight as a Spec Ops team tasked to clear a Hot Zone or as civilian survivors desperately struggling to defend their barricaded homes. &#10;Ambush Z is a stand-alone game that brings Ambush Alley&rsquo;s swift but nuanced style of play to the classic horror/survival genre. Although a background setting is provided, the rules are generic enough for any zombie setting! Included are all the rules you need to play and descriptions of four different &ldquo;species&rdquo; of zombies, including the deadly Dexter whose semi-sentience and psychic powers make it a lethal opponent indeed! Ambush Z also delivers five hair-raising, brain busting scenarios! A copy of Ambush Alley is not required to play Ambush Z!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 36BC the Roman world was divided between Octavian and Antony. Octavian's legions were training for the inevitable clash by campaigning on the Rhine, and Antony needed a campaign to get his forces, living in the luxury of the East, in top shape. Political turmoil in Parthia suggested easy pickings, together with an opportunity to avenge Crassus' famous defeat in 55BC. Antony therefore assembled an army of eighty thousand men, including Armenian allies of dubious loyalty, and late in the campaigning season he set off through Armenia to attack the Parthian capital at Ecbatana, The first objective was Phraata, a Median city which must be captured to maintain communications with Armenia. Here Antony halted to wait for his siege train to catch up. Unfortunately, it never arrived. A Parthian army under the command of Monaeses ambushed and destroyed the train, and at this point the Armenians deserted en masse. Antony was now left in the middle of Media, with no siege train and his communications cut, and one quarter of his army already lost.&#10;&#10;2 players game on the disastrous retreat of Antony's army from Parthia in 36 BC.

    "Description": "Based on the short-lived Seven Network adventure game show of the same name that aired from 1996 until 1998 and hosted by Mike Whitney and Tania Zaetta.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice to move around the board, attempting to collect the most money by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Landing on a &quot;Street Dare&quot; space means picking up a &quot;Street Dare&quot; card and performing the dare. e.g. &quot;Allow someone to tickle you for fifteen seconds&quot;, &quot;Wiggle your ears on their own&quot; or &quot;Do ten push-ups in thirty seconds&quot;.&#10;&#10;If you refuse the dare, you win no money and it is the end of your turn.  If you attempt the dare, the other players debate whether they believe you have successfully completed the dare, in which case you receive a financial reward.&#10;&#10;If you land on a &quot;Major Dare&quot; space, you read the description of a dare and its value.  You then draw a &quot;Dare or Not&quot; card which will read either &quot;You're a Legend&quot; or &quot;You Wimped Out&quot;.  The former means you win the dare value, but the latter means you have to pay out the dare value.&#10;&#10;There are other random element spaces as well as veto cards you can win to exempt you from losing out on Major Dares.&#10;&#10;I infer that the the major dares written on these cards were ones attempted on a Australian television program, on which this board games appears to be based.  e.g. &quot;Bullet Proof: You have been asked to test the new jacket at the firing range! - Win or Lose $500&#10;&#10;Made in Australia - as seen on 7 (Channel 7?)&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, in initiative order (roll 1d10) creatures move (a distance determined by species), attack one another (opposed d10 rolls adding attack &amp; defence per species), suffer the consequences (damage reduces characteristics), attempt to spot other creatures (sensory acuity by species) and test for panic if attacked or hurt (panic rating, again, by species, less aggressive species panic more easily. Rules on ambushes, charges and some very simple terrain effects are included, as are rules for time-travelling human intervention - either 'cave men' or modern hunters.&#10;&#10;51 species of ancient creatures are detailed (all of which are available in 10mm scale metal miniatures from the publisher), along with variously armed humans and their vehicles (with ranged combat rules). A number of possible scenario suggestions is included. The rules are simple by figures gaming standards, but fairly complete as a combat game. Graphics are very basic, and the rulebook is 24 pages of A4 stapled with a clear plastic cover.&#10;&#10;UPDATE: as of the end of 2020, the latest version, while seeming to have the same rules, presentation, and physical format, has a MASSIVELY expanded list of creatures, close to 600 of them! These now cover everything from the Cambrian (admittedly with only one entry!) to the Tertiary. Accordingly, page count has increased to 44.&#10;&#10;",

Tivots are moved on the plastic playing board to gain ground and complete equations.  The game is scalable from basic addition to algebra with different templates.&#10;&#10;From product description:&#10;&#10;TIVY is a math board game invented by an Oklahoman. The game is designed to teach strategy and sportsmanship in addition to fundamental mathematics. Each board comes with &quot;tivots&quot; (the game pieces), score sheets, a rule book, and a variety of gamesheets for use from grades three through nine. During game play, players move their tivots, which are numbered, across the board and land in score goals. Each score goal is paired with a math problem that is missing a number. When a player lands a tivot in a score goal, they create a completed math problem by replacing the missing numbers with the number on their tivot. Phases of the game include strategy time, game play time (when the tivots are moved), calculate score time (when players solve the math problems they created), check opponent time (during which players check opponents' work), challenge time (when any disputes are settled), and agree time (when players agree on their final scores).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Panzer Grenadier: Campaigns and Commanders is a new series of book supplements that adds campaign games and World War II roleplaying to our long-running Panzer Grenadier game system. The series introduces new rules that let Panzer Grenadier players create Leader Characters representing officers in the armies of the great powers that fought World War II. Leader Characters participate in battle scenarios just like normal Panzer Grenadier leaders, but have far more detailed skills and abilities that add a whole new dimension to Panzer Grenadier play.&#10;&#10;Each book in the series includes historical campaign games that let Leader Characters fight a sequence of battles where they can gain combat experience, improve their leadership abilities and acquire new skills. Most importantly, Leader Characters can earn medals for bravery and move up the ranks so that by the end of the campaign they can be high-ranking officers in command of large military formations. Leader Characters who survive a campaign can move on to new campaigns later in the war.&#10;&#10;In addition to the campaign game scenarios, each book includes rules that let players design their own scenarios and create their own campaigns. There is a detailed point-based force-generation system for players who want to plan an entire campaign in advance, and a random scenario generation system for players who want maximum &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; in their campaigns. This gives the system infinite re-playability and lets players take their Leader Characters into any World War II combat situation imaginable.&#10;&#10;War in the East includes the campaign games &quot;The September Campaign: 1939,&quot; &ldquo;Barbarossa: 1941,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Battle for Germany: 1945.&rdquo; It also includes historical articles and strategy tips on how to use Leader Characters in battle. It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front Deluxe, Road to Berlin and White Eagles to enjoy all of the campaigns.&#10;&#10;",

First there is a fast parade around the city walls when each team's force is secretely determined by the cards. Second, the actual battle for the possession of the Center Bridge where the expert usage of Strategy Cards by the Generals and their Captains can increase the strength of a team.&#10;The game is rapid, exciting and never repeticious. No two games are ever the same cause the Strategy cards (Warriors, Flags and Pageant Figures etc.) can continually reverse the momentum of the Battle.&#10;All Players are involved from the beginning to the last second of the game.&#10;This game can be played by 2 players, by an entire family (4-6 players) or by a group of friends (8-14 players). The more expert players will enjoy studying the battle statistics and organizing tournaments.&#10;The duration of this game is about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;This box contains:&#10; - 1 large Playing Board representing a na&iuml;f plan of a Medieval City of Pisa, subdivided into two opposing sides along the Arno River: Tramontana (north) and Mezzogiorno (south).&#10; - 200 illustrated Strategy Cards: Warriors, Flags, Pangeant Figures, Captains, etc.&#10; - 2 Dice.&#10; - 2 Parade Tokens.&#10; - 12 &quot;Chariots&quot;, one for each team to be used for the Bridge combat.&#10; - Stickers with the emblems of the 12 teams.&#10; - 4 Large Card Holders.&#10; - Game Booklet with explanation of the rules and examples of strategic moves.&#10;&#10;",

These items were mainly obtained by exchanging with the Phoenician traders the products and commodities the Aristois obtained through their lands and workers.&#10;The game finishes as soon as the Tartessian culture is absorbed by Carthage. At that given time only the most educated and wealthy Aristoi will survive &ndash;namely, the ones with the most luxury items in their possession.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds.

Before each trick, the top card of the trump changer deck is flipped.  Most of the time, the card will determine the trump color for the trick.  However, some cards will make players swap hands with their partner or swap hands with opponents, so you never know for sure if you will have your hand of cards for the next trick, making hand management difficult.&#10;&#10;Scoring is simple, with each trick being worth 10 points, and the last trick of a hand worth 30!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Triumph of Fascism: The Spanish Civil War 1936&ndash;1939 is a two-player a Card Driven Wargame: a board game integrating the political and military spheres of a historical conflict, with cards driving the action. Players assume the side of RED (Republican forces &ndash; the elected government) and BLUE (anti-Republican forces/ &rdquo;Nationalists&rdquo;/ Fascists / Francoists &ndash; those seeking to overthrow the elected government) in the Spanish Civil War (SCW). This epic conflict involved the toppling of a democratically elected government, its replacement by a totalitarian regime, significant foreign intervention, a major component in the march towards WWII and a struggle for control of Spain.&#10;&#10;Each side begins enlisting its political &ldquo;camps&rdquo; (BLUE: Nationalist Army, Carlist, Falange and Army of Africa, RED: PCE, Republican Army, UGT, Anarchist, POUM, Cataluonia and the Northern Autonomous Governments ) to build their national armies and by gaining support from foreign powers (BLUE: Germany, Italy and Portugal, RED: Britain, France and Russia) to improve their resources to wage the conflict. Players will also decide their resource investment in force preparation: there is an &ldquo;untried columns&rdquo; mechanic very similar to one first utilized by Panzergruppe Guderian.&#10;&#10;There are three phases to a game turn: Strategic, Action, and Logistics.&#10;&#10;The Strategic Phase requires players to &ldquo;spend&rdquo; their Action Cards (think of ACs as currency) planning their turn, influencing political dynamics (enlisting support of &ldquo;camps&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign powers&rdquo;), impacting the battle for hearts &amp; minds, pursuing alternative historical foreign policy paths and shaping the air and naval war. Additionally, players construct a Hearts &amp; Minds (H&amp;M) pool. The H&amp;M pool is supplemented during the turn by wide variety of actions and events (reflecting the vagaries of support for both sides); the more friendly H&amp;M blocks placed into the pool, the greater the chance of gaining dominant control of Spanish provinces.&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, players utilize their respective decks of Action Cards (ACs) to activate units for movement and combat, implement events (receive reinforcements, etc.), conduct a range of political operations, generate replacements or strategically redeploy units. And, in a twist from other games in the Paths of Glory genre, players must plan out their play of ACs in advance: players secretly specify the order of play of their ACs (&quot;the AC stack&quot;) and allocate one AC to &quot;the AC reserve&quot;. Limited air operations occur during the Action Phase.&#10;&#10;During the Logistics Phase, players addresses attrition, rebuilding units, determining province control and other odds and ends. Province control is a function of controlling Provincial Presence Locations and the Provincial Capital and making a successful Province Allegiance Attempt (H&amp;M blocks have an important effect). One key H&amp;M dynamic is a random draw from the H&amp;M pool, placing those H&amp;M blocks on provinces and a variable ending to the phase; players are not quite sure &ldquo;when the music will end&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The campaign game is playable in about six to eight hours, while a shorter introductory scenario takes between two and four hours. The game is won by controlling key geographical locations (ex: dominant control of provinces and control of urban areas), which generates victory points.&#10;&#10;Triumph of Fascism is somewhat of a sequel to Triumph of Chaos (ToC). Changes versus ToC include inclusion of: &#10;&bull; A less-abstracted air and naval components&#10;&bull; A significant hearts &amp; minds mechanic &#10;&bull; More of an emphasis on the buildup to the conflict&#10;&bull; A foreign policy track; allowing for a wider range of outcomes the conflict could take&#10;&#10;Both games utilize the Paths of Glory game engine, supplemented by a significant political &ldquo;game&rdquo; component, which has its roots in Days of Decision and Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East.&#10;&#10;Originally planned release date was Spring 2015.&#10;&#10;",

On or around April 12th, the North Vietnamese began a 7,000 round a day bombardment and launched attacks beginning on April 13th. Under attack by two NVA and one Vietcong division (a total of about 35,000), the ARVN 5th Division along with ARVN airborne and ranger units, which numbered about 7,500, held off the continued assault by infantry and tanks with the help of US airstrikes and B-52 arclight bombings.&#10;&#10;The game uses area movement and interesting chrome such as NVA sappers, variable applications for artillery bombardment and of course airstrikes as the ARVN is hard pressed to duplicate the efforts of the 5th Infantry.&#10;&#10;The NVA Player has just a few turns to take enough of the ARVN controlled areas and gain victory while the ARVN Player must maintain the ARVN Resistance Level or be forced to withdraw and lose the game. The game is easily playable solitaire and short enough to be played more than once in an evening for competitive players.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One, 11&quot; x 17&quot; map&#10;    36 single-sided unit counters&#10;    One, 2-page rule book&#10;&#10;&#10;(description for second edition from http://hfdgames.com)&#10;&#10;&#10;1st edition: published in Panzer Digest #4.&#10;&#10;",

The new line profiles famous regions of Germany during the Middle Ages, when Celts, Romans, and Germans intermingled.&#10;&#10;This fixed map covers the Nordrhein-Westfalen area of Germany, which includes the modern-day industrial area around the river Rhein (Rurh). Many BGG-ers will recognize the city of Essen. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.&#10;&#10;The rules follow closely to standard Catan, with a few notable exceptions:&#10;Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.&#10;Furthermore, victory points can be obtained by building the first road onto a &quot;victory point crossing.&quot; These points are indicated by tokens (e.g. from the Seafarer's expansion) placed there.&#10;&#10;",

The cards show cartoon outlines of animals and community members (a pig, a lobster, an astronaut, a cowboy, etc). Your face replaces theirs, which looks really silly, and everyone can see what you are except you. Each player rolls a die and asks questions about their card to deduce what it depicts. The die tells them whether they can Ask, Guess, Lose a Turn, Reverse Direction, etc. Questions must be Yes or No: for example, &quot;Do I have a lot of fur?&quot; &quot;Do I wear boots?&quot; &quot;Do people drink my milk?&quot; A tally sheet is used to keep track of which characters aren't on your card, based on the answers given by the other players. The first person to correctly guess what their card depicts is the winner of the round.&#10;&#10;Team Challenge&#10;Each team gives clues to a player on their team who is wearing the card. They are allowed only five clues (three for advanced play) before the player must guess who they are. The first team to guess correctly wins a chip; first team to five chips wins.&#10;&#10;Charades&#10;Players select a card that only they can see. They then act out the card and each player in turn gets one guess. The player who guesses right gets two chips and the actor gets one.  Then another player chooses a card and is the actor. First person to collect ten chips wins.&#10;&#10;Lightning Round&#10;One team gets all the animal cards, the other team gets all the people cards. Players use one card at a time and guessers are only allowed one clue from their teammates. The team who guesses the most cards wins the round; if you guess the entire pile you get 3 bonus points. Card piles are shuffled and swapped. At the end of that round whichever team has the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pumpkin Patch Phonics is a simple children's game that teaches players phonics.  Players spin a spinner, and move their token to the nearest picture that starts with the letter that the spinner is pointing to.  There are five special spaces on the board, where a player can slide up or down the track - similar to Chutes and Ladders.  There is an alternative version included (the other side of the spinner) where players can use the ending sound of a word, rather than the starting sound.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An expansion for Zooloretto, given for free by Abacus at Spiel 2008 in Essen.&#10;&#10;This expansion consists of 1 tile with a gorilla.&#10;&#10;Use the normal rules for Zooloretto, except for one rule: the first player to fill his 6-space enclosure, takes the gorilla enclosure from the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;The owner of the gorilla enclosure may once during the game place a drawn tile (which may be a coin tile) directly into his zoo instead of on a delivery truck. Keep track of usage by placing the spent coin on the Gorilla enclosure. The coin remains there until the end of the game and is not involved in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;From Rio Grande's Website:&#10;&#10;Gorilla is a small expansion for the award-winning Zooloretto and the folow-on game Aquaretto.&#10;&#10;For Zooloretto, it contains a savings book for each player and job boards. Savings books can be used to earn interest during the game and to break ties at the end of the game. It also contains job boards, which encourage players to acquire specific animals for their zoos. At game end, players score additional points for having collected the animals shown on their job boards.&#10;&#10;For Aquaretto, we have added three co-worker tiles: the Research Station, the Training Area, and the Technical Area. Players may take these tiles when they take co-workers to score more points. It also adds Trains to the game. Players can collect different train tiles to score additional points at game end.&#10;&#10;",

Only one will emerge as captain, the one who can somehow get the other officers to follow orders.&quot;&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get other players to carry out the missions you assign so that you accumulate 10 pips worth of missions completed. Missions are worth between 2 and 4 pips. Every other player can refuse, so you need to be able to convince them it's in their best interest. Thankfully, the missions are easy, but it requires someone to actually perform them.&#10;&#10;Of course, if the missions don't get performed, things go wrong, terribly wrong ....&#10;&#10;Winner of the 2003 PolyCon Independent Game Design Prize for best Board/Card Game.&#10;&#10;",
