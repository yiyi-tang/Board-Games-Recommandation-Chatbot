The action is driven by cards drawn from the scenario specific deck. The mapboard path and card deck are subdivided to represent different stages of the adventure. Typically one deck is used for the first fifteen spaces on the path -- the second deck is used for the last fifteen spaces on the path.&#10;&#10;The scenarios available for Artifact include: Depths of the Earth (first travel through the Earth&rsquo;s crust, then adventure in the Lost World of dinosaurs), Mummys Tomb (first travel down the Nile, then explore the tomb searching for the treasure of the pharaoh), Lost Continent of Atlantis (travel deep below the sea by submarine, then explore the lost continent in diving suits searching for the Pearl Trident), and The Shadow of a Dark God (a Cthulhu style scenario where the players first investigate a friend&rsquo;s death, then search a cult temple).&#10;&#10;",

Both decks have 62 cards. Notice that most cards have a force value. The Germans also need 20 tokens to represent bomb damage.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Both players start the game with four cards. The players draw two cards at the start of each turn, with the maximum hand size at the end of the turn being eight cards. The German player has the option not to play a raid, in which case the turn ends. If the German player plays a raid, the players alternate playing force cards until neither player wants to play a card. The strength of the opposing forces are compared. If the RAF has a higher force total, the raid is stopped. If the German has the higher force total, then the amount of bombing damage caused by the raid is determined and added to the German&rsquo;s score.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;If the German&rsquo;s accumulate 20 points of bombing damage then they win. Hitler decides to go ahead with operation Sealion. If the German player goes to draw a card and there are no cards left in his deck the British win. Hitler postpones operation Sealion indefinitely.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Combat occurs from the last space a unit enters. The written combat orders consist of indicating the weapon system fired and the mapsheet grid number being targeted. Damage inflicted depends on defensive equipment of the target ship (fields, screens and jammers) and the type of weapon used. Nukes and missiles caused fixed amounts of damage, while energy and projectile weapons have diminished capacity at longer ranges.&#10;&#10;Statistics are given for nine types of base ships, ranging from the lowly Transport (used for scenario victory conditions) to the burly Battlestation. Ships are rated for cost, move, hits, number of shields, and number of weapons. Some types of ships can carry Fighter Squads. Ships can be equipped with three types of shields: Albedo Screens (protect against energy weapons), Intertia Fields (protect against projectile weapons), and Jammers (protect against missiles.) Weapon systems that can be purchased include Lasers, Rail Guns, Missile Launchers, Missiles, and Nuclear Missiles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;G.I. Joe vs Cobra. 2 player game: Board, Cards, Dice. There are 2 decks. One player gets the Joe Deck. The other player gets the Cobra Deck. Victory: You win if you ever capture your opponent&rsquo;s base, or you control all &lsquo;Urban&rsquo; spaces on the board.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game is played on an 8x8 grid with spaces large enough to hold a card. The G.I. Joe base is in one corner of the board and the Cobra base is in the opposite corner. The remaining 62 spaces are a random mix of eight terrain types: Jungle, Swamp, Sea, Desert, Mountain, Forest, Urban, and Arctic.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four Teams and a hand of cards. Each card has the name and statistics for a soldier. The cards are placed under each Team counter to represent the soldiers in that Team.&#10;&#10;Teams engage in combat by moving into the same space as an opposing Team. Combat is resolved based on one of three unit factors (as determined randomly by a die roll): Firepower, Close Combat, or Tactics. Combat bonuses are given for various factors, including having a team with soldiers from the same service branch or when units are defending their base. Combat resolution also takes into consideration artillery units, armor units vs. anti-armor, and air units vs. &ldquo;anti-air.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",
