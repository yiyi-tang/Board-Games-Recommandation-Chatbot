Every Chicken has certain traits, and to match, Chickens must have two and only two of these traits in common. On your turn, draw Chicken tiles from the draw pile, and switch them out for Chickens in your Yard. When you have a fully matching Army, you win! But don&rsquo;t be too obvious about which Chicken you&rsquo;re matching&mdash;your opponents can use special actions or even throw an Egg to try to guess your Leader, and if they&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re out!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Resolution of the turn&#10;&#10;End of the Game:&#10;If at the end of a round you have achieved the 13 Zapatista demands and the 7 principles of leading by obeying, you have won the game.

As is appropriate, each Navigation card also includes a pun.&#10;&#10;Players only encounter as many cards as they move (ex: two cards for two spaces). They will roll encounter dice equal to the danger rating (0-3), then remove one passenger or cargo for each ! symbol they roll from the indicated boat section.

Lost and Found tokens allow players to collect lost passengers or cargo. Players will also stop at Outposts (which allow them to reload Warning Shots and collect cargo or passengers). Depending on their chosen route, players may also encounter Clue spaces (which show one of the families NOT chosen by Alberta).&#10;&#10;When the first player reaches Headquarters, they may collect a tip token. Once all players have arrived, the new caretakers are revealed, and players add up their scores. Passengers belonging to the caretaker family are worth more.

Go on a quest to win silverware, build your team, trade players and show your friends who the best manager is. All the illustrations were made especially for Hattrick, completely in the Hattrick style. The cards in the game will contain the English, German, Spanish, Italian and French Language. The manual that comes with the game will only be in English, however a free downloadable version will be available for all other main languages.&#10;&#10;Your task is to manage your own club and become the most successful by winning as many trophies (league, cup and international cup) as possible. To do this you need to build a strong team, and outsmart the others managers&rsquo; strategies.&#10;&#10;The game is played by moving a marker around a season calendar. Whenever a match day is reached, matches will be played. The teams consist of player cards that every manager will put into formation before the games. Based on these formations, dice will then decide the outcome. As the season goes by, players can be sold and bought, contracts can be extended, injuries and suspensions may appear, players may go on international duties, and you may have to fight against bankruptcy, or end up swimming in money. But remember, money is far from everything - winning will always be about football.&#10;&#10;The game contains a hundred unique player cards of different nationalities, strengths and positions. Furthermore there are international cup cards, and action/strategy cards that can be used to influence matches.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by 2 to 4 people, but was mainly designed for 4 players. You decide yourself how many seasons to play, which mean you decide the length of the game. One season takes about 30-45 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

To achieve this you will have to put into operation all your skills and you will also have a team that will help you stabilize the patient, such as atropine, oxygen, defibrillator, cardiac monitor, etc.&#10;&#10;Playing at 10 Beats is to face a puzzle that must be solved following a correct sequence. If it is achieved, 10 Beats offers different levels of difficulty that can be added and that will increase the stress of the games, as if you were in an emergency room.&#10;&#10;It is recommended that, at the beginning, the difficulty levels are not used, but simply trying to solve the correct sequence of the puzzle. In case of a microinfarction, the patient should be stabilized as soon as possible. If the game is finished without having achieved it, it is convenient to look at the sequence on the table and try to find the correct sequence. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either.&#10;&#10;Although 10 Beats is a game of 2 to 4 players, you can count on the help of more people to help solve the puzzle.&#10;&#10;We are waiting for you in the emergency room.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=================================================El objetivo de 10 Latidos es estabilizar a un paciente consiguiendo 10 latidos libres de microinfartos.

This game allows players to re-enact the invasion.This was the third game in the Rand Command Series, Volume 1.&#10;&#10;The game has a small (17&quot;x16&quot;) map and 72 unit counters representing armor, infantry, mech, parachute, glider and ranger/commando units, varying in size from battalion to brigade. Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.&#10;&#10;There are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of &quot;What Ifs&quot;), and an historical commentary.&#10;&#10;The Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.&#10;&#10;Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location.

The fruit growers want to produce the most they can, and if this means stealing... er, borrowing it from their neighbours, then so be it, regardless of the odd flavour it might give to their product.&#10;&#10;Fruit Bandits is a quick card game in which players use a simultaneous action selection method to choose either to harvest their own crop or try and steal from another player - but this will only work if that player chooses to harvest their own crop.  Although everyone will produce exactly the same quantity of fruit during the course of the game, the production will be in a random order, so choosing when to harvest or when to try and raid is dependent not only on your own potential but that of your rivals too.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces on one grid may not interact with pieces on the other, although pieces may at times change grids.

After your first or second roll, you collect a card from the table that matches the number on the die. If you can't collect a card, the round ends and if the color of a card in front of you is present among the face-up cards, then you lose that card. You might lose everything depending on how jinxed you are!&#10;&#10;Players who lost a card receive a random bonus card for any remaining rounds. These cards have different powers such as adding or subtracting 1 from the die roll, rolling a third time, and choosing a card numbered 4-6 instead of rolling the die.&#10;&#10;Cards that are safe in one round might be lost in a subsequent round, so ideally you can roll well or use the bonus cards to clear out troublesome colors.

And now, they have descended on our planet looking for new games wherever they can find them. On a seemingly innocent and charming little farm, the Odynauts are witness to a high stakes strategic game in which hens are the coveted prize. The roosters seek to draw as many of them in as possible with their charms. A sly fox is sneaking around the coop for a delicious meal, while the farmer is on a mission to catch him in order to protect his precious little hens.  The Odynauts, of course, see a highly entertaining game in all of this. Are you the biggest, baddest rooster? Or are you just the smartest one?&#10;&#10;Rule the Roost (a.k.a.

The goal is to become the leader Rooster of one or more barns and to collect as many chickens as possible for points.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game each player tries to obtain a majority in one or more of the three barns with her own rooster cards by placing these cards under the barn cards. For each barn in which a player has the majority of roosters at the end of the game, she receives one point for each of the chicken cards present. Players should try to have as many chickens as possible in the barns in which she dominates by either placing her own chicken cards there, or by banking on others doing so.&#10;&#10;But beware! Danger is lurking. Players can prevent an opponent from having the majority of roosters in a barn or collecting chickens in a barn by throwing eggs, playing fox cards or famer cards because foxes have chickens on the menu and the farmer is eager to move roosters from one barn to another.&#10;&#10;",

A game of Lasting Tales will also require a handful of standard six-sided dice, a tape measure or ruler, and miniatures. Fortunately, Lasting Tales is a miniatures-agnostic game, meaning players can use any fantasy miniatures in their collection.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The connection to the movie is tenuous (alien-looking ships on one side) but it's Battleship, after all.  This is a throwback to the &quot;classic&quot; edition -- non-electronic with separate player boards that lock together into a futuristic-looking carrying case with a handle.&#10;&#10;Play modes include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The time-worn original Battleship, with each player firing a single shot each turn.&#10;     Almost equally-time-worn Salvo where you start out with five shots per turn and lose one each time one of your ships sinks.&#10;     A &quot;Special Ops&quot; mode with a card draw each turn to determine player actions.  Most of these are from 1-3 shots, but there's a variety of special actions, e.g.:&#10;         attacking an entire row or column&#10;         converting all future one-shot cards into salvoes (as in the Salvo game above)&#10;         having the other player tell you a coordinate on their ship to hit&#10;         scanning a row for number of hits (but not exactly where)&#10;         firing one shot, then drawing and playing another card&#10;    &#10;     An &quot;Advanced Special Ops&quot; mode with a hand of the above cards, and two card actions (either draw or play) per turn.  This last one can get confusing, as the rules for the cards are obviously written with the assumption that you're playing one per turn, requiring some house rules to fill in the logical holes.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last wrinkle is Comm Tower cards (which presumably has something to do with the movie) which persist when played.  The first player to collect four of them has their subsequent shots go nuclear, destroying the entire target regardless of size with a single hit.&#10;&#10;The following is manufacturer's marketing copy, or at least written like it is:&#10;&#10;Includes three exciting games in one portable case that&rsquo;s always ready for the battle. Play the traditional game, taking turns calling your shots. Or choose the Salvo game in which you stack up as many shots in one turn as you have ships afloat. Finally, call on the movie-based Special Ops cards for a third game. These strategy cards give you special powers such as Blitz, Scan, and Reveal as you plot to prevail over your enemy.&#10;&#10;",

Will the intrepid reporters be able to expose the corruption before it's too late?&#10;&#10;Two corrupt politicians need to exchange messages and dirty money while two investigators try to intercept their actions and publish them in the international media.&#10;&#10;Winner of Button Shy's 18 identical cards challenge, Interceptor is a game for 4 people in pairs that will sit facing your partner.&#10;&#10;The cards have two sides: money or message. Players must place one of their 5 cards with one side forward and make a pre-arranged secret code for their partner to place the same side forward. Corruptors should try to avoid investigations by placing the opposite side that their opponents put, while investigators want to put on the same side as their opponents.&#10;&#10;After 4 cards on the table, they are all revealed and losers lose their cards. Whoever runs out of cards loses the game.&#10;&#10;But there is one more thing. If you discover your opponent's code, you can say &quot;Interceptor!&quot; and make a guess. If you're wrong, you lose a card, if you get it right, you win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;It is a fast and very fun game, great for playing several games in a row.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Winner of Button Shy's 18 Card Challenge: Design a game with 18 identical cards.&#10;&#10;",

The player who played the highest card in that color gets to choose all cards of a color of his choice from the cards in the middle and keeps them as victory points. Then, the player with the second highest card in that color gets to choose, etc. Finally, the cards that were played during the trick are placed in the middle of the table for the next trick. If two or more colors are tied with high value, then no one who played in those colors (or any colors with a lower sum) scores any cards.&#10;&#10;Once all nine tricks have been played, players add up the values of the cards they won during the game.

Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.&#10;Stonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.&#10;&#10;",

Units that are out of command range can only switch to Maneuver orders or stay in reserve. Orders affect melee and fire strength and also the strength of a unit's Zone of Control.

    "Description": "The kingdom's most celebrated warriors have come from far and wide to do combat in a grand tournament that will determine who is the fiercest of them all. Each has a personal reason for competing in the event, but there is a single thread that unites all of them: the desire to put their fighting skills on display in order to earn the right to be called champion.&#10;&#10;Sainome Colosseum R is an ultra-accessible and fast-paced PvP combat game for 2-4 players that allows players to take on chosen character roles, each with an assortment of individual skills and abilities, to do battle with one another in an epic gladiatorial showdown. Using action selection, hand management, card drafting, and dice rolling, Sainome Colosseum R gives players important decision points while blending strategy, luck, and balanced replayability. As you explore the game, you discover the strengths and weaknesses of each fighter as well as interesting combinations that can put your opponents down for the count.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player chooses two out of five actions, resolves both, then discards to meet the hand limit requirements. To gain the advantage in battle, gear can be attached to your character by physically placing equipment cards on any side of your fighter with a corresponding slot. These equipment cards can then activated using a unique dice mechanism to attack your opponents and initiate a wide range of special effects. Adding further to this dynamic gameplay is the ability for each character to transform from their beginning Normal Form to a heightened Awakened Form, which grants skill upgrades. The player who best utilizes these various systems to reduce their opponent's HP to 0 is ultimately the winner!&#10;&#10;",

This time, our beloved character changes the 221B of Baker Street for feudal Japan to investigate a mysterious theft at the palace. However, this is a case he can't solve alone, and he will need your help to figure out what was stolen, who did it, and where.&#10;&#10;In Sherlock in Time, each player is investigating a crime on their own. You start with a hand of clue cards that show one of four suspects, one of three locations, and one of three stolen objects. One of the clue cards in your hand faces the other players, not you, and you must identify the three symbols on this secret card in order to solve your crime.&#10;&#10;On a turn, place a card from your hand face up. The other players will tell you how many symbols on the revealed card &mdash; 0, 1, or 2 &mdash; match the symbols on your secret card, but not which ones. Place the revealed card on a reminder card so that you can remember how many clues matched, then either end your turn or attempt to identify the three symbols on your secret card. (Remember that you can see the secret card held by each other player, in addition to their revealed cards.) If you're correct, you score points based on how many others have already guessed their secret card; if you're incorrect, you're out of the round.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds, and once during the game you can spend your honor card to learn whether one specific symbol is on your secret card. An unused honor card serves as a tiebreaker, so don't spend it unless you have to. At the end of three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Once you're comfortable with the game, you can add additional clue cards that introduce a fourth stolen object, which makes the game more challenging.&#10;&#10;Sherlock in Time is a game with easy and straightforward rules which you can extend with Watson in Time. With this game mode you'll get extra assistants with special skills that make the game more fun and unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Will you be clever enough to solve the mystery that haunts the palace and earn Sherlock Holmes' respect?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Choose a scenario, gather your friends, select  your Heroes and prepare yourselves for loads of fast-paced adventure!&#10;&#10;In order to move around the board, a Quodd must tumble! Tumbling activates one of five upgradable movement skills, or your Q skill (is it Q-Power?) based on the side of your Hero that is facing up after you tumble. While moving, you'll be interacting with special board obstacles and tiles like raging rivers, springs, teleporters, dangerous pits, and of course your opponents (or teammates). But don't worry... I'm sure your friends always have your best interests at heart.&#10;&#10;Along your journey, be sure to collect the crystals you find on the board. They'll activate special abilities unique to your Hero, but be careful&mdash;other Heroes can steal the crystals you&rsquo;re carrying! During your turn you will also discover food, runes and other useful stuff to enhance your natural abilities, modify the board, and slow down your opponents.&#10;&#10;Out in the world you&rsquo;ll also occasionally find secrets, usually hidden away in difficult to reach places, but always worth the journey as they often contain game-changing advantages for your Hero. A Hero who slows down by activating their Q will also discover the secrets of the world which are available only to those who look for them.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn you will read an event card out loud. Event cards affect all players, but don&rsquo;t panic, usually nothing bad happens&hellip; and sometimes they&rsquo;ll even invite you to upgrade your Hero!&#10; WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#10;&#10;The game includes beautiful miniatures, exceptional components, and eight beautifully illustrated, infinitely-replayable scenario maps, each offering a fun new challenge. Scenarios include races, Rallies, pick-up-and-deliver challenges, and team games like capture the crystal, sheep soccer and more!&#10;&#10;On top of all that, the Quodd Heroes game system is truly a sandbox and lends itself to quick and easy building of your own home-crafted scenarios&mdash;the sky's the limit!  &#10; What&rsquo;s New in 2nd Edition&#10;&#10;- Vastly improved, professionally written and edited rulebook, with more example images, an index, and quick reference for frequent rules questions&#10;&#10;- Streamlined player experience with more intuitive upgrade system, player board design&#10;- New Q-Powers and Crystal Powers create a more thematically immersive, and unique feel to each Hero.&#10;- Reworked turn structure and event system remove the feeling of uncontrolled chaos and being &ldquo;beat by the game&rdquo; that some players had issues with in 1st Edition while still maintaining the feeling of an ever-changing environment.&#10;- Game ships with an organizer for fast setup&#10;- Reduced component count keeps setup and cleanup to a minimum.&#10;- Improved visual and usability design across almost every component in the game.&#10;- Hero cubes and painted miniatures replace the unpainted minis from First Edition for a more intuitive player experience.&#10;- A scenario book with durable, high quality fold out maps greatly improves setup time, and scenario quality, compared to the fully modular boards in 1st Edition.&#10;- There&rsquo;s so much more, too!&#10;&#10;Quodd Heroes 2nd Edition is truly a must-experience game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Upthrust is a jumping game where you try to jump your pieces into higher scoring levels. The board is a pegboard consisting of 4 columns and 11 levels. Each player starts with 4 pieces each in a different column at the lowest 4 levels of the board.&#10;&#10;On your turn, one of your pieces can jump up the number of levels (while remaining in the same column) equal to the number of pieces on the level it jumps from. However:&#10;- Only one piece may occupy each space.&#10;- The highest piece of any color may not make a single level jump.&#10;- In the non-scoring levels, two pieces of the same color cannot be at the same level.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no player can legally move or if there 2 pieces left in the non scoring levels. Highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;This was originally published as a solitaire game titled Score Up, but the gameplay is almost identical. (In the original version two pieces of the same color can never be in the same row.)&#10;&#10;",

Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are 1 - 3 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides a mule. On a turn, three color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. But if all three dice show the same color, this mule runs three spaces ahead. Simple enough so far.&#10;&#10;The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one or two of the dice and only roll the remaining ones. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that color intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.&#10;&#10;",

Prepare for augmented fun, major geeky learning, and diminished boredom!&#10;&#10;Players begin by choosing 1 of 13 musical instruments that grant variable player powers. To win the game, players must draft the right Note cards to their hands, according to the active Key Signature tile. Notes are then played to the field, and combined to form Chords. When a Chord that matches the current Key Signature is completed by a player, that Key Signature Tile is claimed! The first Player to collect 3 Key Signatures is the Bringer of Harmony, the Destroyer of Dissonance, the Lord of the Chords!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you first draft 3 cards, then make 3 moves. You may spend your moves by (1) playing a Note card, or (2) playing an Action card.&#10;&#10;Other ways to spend moves include: (A) Moving a Note card from one chord to another, (B) buying Accidental Tokens, or (C) spending 2 moves to draft 1 additional card.&#10;&#10;Note cards must be diatonic to be played, according to the active Key Signature. Action cards range from punny composer cards like &ldquo;More-zart&rdquo;, which allows you to draw 2 more cards, to powerful music theory concepts like &ldquo;Major 7th Steal&rdquo;, which allows you to turn the tables by stealing another player's hard earned Key Signature tile!&#10;&#10;Accidental Tokens make it easier to complete chords. They are placed on Note cards to raise or lower the note by a semitone/half step, depending on whether the sharp or flat side is facing up, respectively. Accidental tokens are bought by selling a dotted quarter note/dotted crotchet worth of Note cards.&#10;&#10;All cards are drafted from a pool of 6 cards, so memory, prediction and counter-strategizing are key to victory. Every play is noteworthy - you can't miss a beat!&#10;&#10;The player who most recently practiced music goes first, so go practice!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

When playing Quadefy, you have to think a little bit strategist and a little bit puzzle builder. Players take turns stacking their game pieces on the base, each attempting to keep their entire game piece &quot;in bounds.&quot; &quot;In bounds&quot; means that the piece must be completely over the game base and no more than four &quot;cubes&quot; high. The first player to force their opponent to have to play out of bounds, wins. Every move is both offensive and defensive, making Quadefy very fun to play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Quadefy is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&#10;&#10;",
