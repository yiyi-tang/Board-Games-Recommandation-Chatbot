    "Description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.&#10;&#10;",

More impressive, at least, than all the villages around it.

But with her visit quickly approaching there's no time to really fix your village, so you're just going to have to make it look as impressive as possible. That is to say, you're faking it. You'll accomplish this by drafting interior cards that are either real or fake, then combining them with facades to construct an imposing, if flimsy, kingdom.&#10;&#10;You score points by producing goods in your industrial buildings, exposing opponents' fake buildings with spies, constructing government and cultural buildings, and passing off fake buildings as real ones.

During these actions, the player must be careful not to increase the noise indicator, which is responsible for guard behavior.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player's turn, there is a movement of guards after certain pools. If the player finds himself on the field of the guard and is not hidden he loses a life point and an alarm is declared.The alarm means the release of dog guards who scour the entire villa and it is difficult to hide from them - meeting them ends the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the player completes the objectives and escapes from the mansion or when he is defeated by the guards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Somehow, you just know that you need a way out of here! Fortunately, there is a whole barnyard full of friends who can assist you in your quest. You need to break out and see what the governor can do about this!&#10;&#10;The Turkey Trial, title #7 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room-style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.&#10;&#10;Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion website (compatible with all smartphones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the website will tell you which card or cards to take next. The website also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.&#10;&#10;This system is non-destructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game but can pass it on to another group for their use.&#10;&#10;This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve and is rated 1 out of 3 in difficulty.&#10;&#10;",

The 1986 versions comes with manufactured components of a much higher quality than previous editions including:&#10;&#10;Four high quality color map boards that fit together &quot;puzzle&quot; style, two bags of colored 3-D playing pieces representing ancients-era military units, a four-page rulebook (two double-sided pages), and an attractive storage box.&#10;&#10;Set in a time of ancient warfare, Conquest is a strategy game that emphasizes strategic movement, sort of like an upgraded version of Chess. Players control different combinations of foot troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications and/or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations. There are several scenarios included in the short rule book (Really a booklet!) and players are encouraged to design their own.&#10;&#10;Though confusing in name, Conquest is a re-implementation of this game with the same name but with play up to four players.&#10;&#10;",

The game is scale-agnostic, allowing players to use suitable models from their collections in a stylized and abstracted game (rather than one that attempts to simulate the period).&#10;&#10;The second edition of the game is available as a 208-page hardback rulebook (increased from the 64-page paperback first edition) with significantly improved formatting and presentation. Rules have not changed significantly from the first edition of the game and all retinues created under the first edition rules remain playable as warbands in the second edition. Points values of the original troop types haven&rsquo;t changed, but the troop types have been renamed to cover the broader period of history covered. Restrictions on units in warbands have been removed to give players more flexibility in creating their warbands. Minor errors have been corrected; clarifications/modifications of rules have been provided; and additional rules have been included as a result of community feedback.&#10;&#10;New rules include additional unit upgrades, extra scenarios, expanded sample Warbands, more detail on laying out tabletop terrain, and a number of optional rules.&#10;&#10;",

Leading the first of those campaigns was the great general, Flavius Belisarius. Belisarius&rsquo;s War is a two-player game of the Vandal War, in which the Eastern Romans reconquered North Africa. One player commands the Romans, the other the Vandals. Both players maneuver units representing elite regulars, tribal warbands, fleets and militia. The point-to-point map covers North Africa as well as the islands of the Western Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;In Belisarius&rsquo;s War each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate recruits, movement abilities, special bonuses for combat, and historical events. Some of the cards include: Naval-Land Campaigns, Organize the Exarchate, Ambush, and Procopius.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with fierce Vandals pitted against disciplined Roman heavy cavalry. There are special rules for Huns, rebellions, morale and leaders such as Belisarius. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between victory and disaster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Game components include 2 full-size maps, 700 die-cut counters, rules, six scenarios, and charts and tables.

Beyond lie the industrial Donets Basin and the farmlands of the Ukraine, and to the south the possibility of trapping 2 more German Armies against the Sea of Azov. The opportunities beckon! But on the flanks loom 10 German panzer and motorized divisions that are not in retreat, but rather are maneuvering to Duel for Kharkov!&#10;&#10;With sweeping movement, low-counter density, and dynamic action, Duel for Kharkov is your chance to command in the mightiest tank battle the world had ever seen.&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS: Two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps and 800 die-cut counters.

The Stars Align is a two-player game of placing and manipulating patterns of stars on the 7x7 night sky map grid.&#10;&#10;A play of The Stars Align begins at dusk. Players place their color stars onto the Night Sky Map. After dusk comes the Night Phase. More stars appear and those already in play start to flicker (twinkle)! When groups of stars align, they shoot across the sky and disappear!&#10;&#10;The Stars Align is a tight combination of grid placement and pattern manipulation. In the Dusk Phase, each player will draw a constellation card on their turn and choose where to place their stars on the shared Night Sky Map following the pattern shown on the card. As the night draws on, more stars appear until a player draws a constellation card that can't be played. At this point, the initial board state is established and the Night Phase begins.&#10;&#10;Placement rules shift when the Night Phase starts. Now parts of the constellation pattern may overlap stars already in play. Overlapped stars flip to their opposite side. Players take turns manipulating the Night Sky Map so that an entire row or column of seven stars align in their color. This is a shooting star. The stars in that row or column are removed from the board and a point is scored. The first player to score 5 points wins the game!&#10;&#10;For an added challenge, experienced players can add a chess timer with five-minutes per player to spot their five shooting stars. The first to spot five shooting stars or still have time left on their timer when their opponent runs out of time wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To start players are dealt four cards face-down and take turns either drawing a card from the pile or taking the last discarded card. Cards on the table can be shed, viewed and swapped so it's important to gain knowledge of card values and their locations. A game consists of multiple rounds, a round ends when a player calls &quot;KOMBIO&quot; with hope they have the lowest score on the table. &#10;With a complexity to keep people engaged and a simplicity that allows for quick learning, KOMBIO is great for trips or livening up any given day with competitive fun.&#10;A unique rule in KOMBIO is the ability to access opponent's hands AT ANY TIME. Regardless of turn, players can shed cards by grabbing a card and correctly matching it on the last discarded card. This rule creates a competitive atmosphere fueled by focus and anticipation.&#10;&#10;IN THE BOX: 70 playing cards, 2 reference cards, 1 rule booklet, 4 stickers&#10;MATERIAL: premium cardstock (310 gsm german black core with linen finish)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In JurassAttack!, two players face off in an epic face-to-face dinosaur battle!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player chooses a dinosaur or pack of dinosaurs of the same type from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously to compare Ferocity values. The player with the highest total Ferocity wins the round, taking their rival's dinosaurs into their score pile. Different types of dinosaurs are worth varying amounts of victory points, so it's important to plan well and make sure not to give away too many points in the event of a knockout!&#10;&#10;These fierce, prehistoric beasts each have their own special effects as well. Some hunt alone while others may pack with dinos of different types. And sometimes, with a well-placed bluff, players may even be able to sneak some of their precious eggs into their own score pile to protect the future generation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Storm Over Madrid 1936: Miracle of November&quot; simulates the fighting that took place during the attempt to capture of Madrid, that lasted between October 1936 and January 1937 during the course of the Spanish Civil War. A long and bloody siege affair.&#10;&#10;&quot;Storm Over Madrid&quot; uses a modified version of the well-known area-impulse wargame system. The modifications to the original system are many and carefully considered. Besides a new morale points system that highlights the intrinsic febrility of the Republican side, support points that oblige players to plan ahead and event chits, our combat system has several new concepts: defensive fire and counter-attacks, automatic losses depending on the intensity of the battle... Attacks are never free and the actual decision to attack must be thought through carefully.&#10;&#10;One game turn represents a week and the game runs from 9 October 1936 to 21 January 1937 (15 turns). 2 short scenarios and a campaign game allow you to play the battle from start to finish, with each scenario requiring a different style of play.&#10;Units are for the most part battalion strength.   The Nationalists have the (Spanish) Legion and Moroccan troops, while on the Republican side there are anarchists, communists and the International Brigades.&#10;&#10;An interesting 2 player wargame, one that is fun to play and historically correct.  It&rsquo;s a game that allows you to understand the ins and outs of this asymmetric siege by revisiting a game system that has already proved its worth.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

He orders his division's motorized infantry regiment, the crack 8th Bersaglieri, to occupy three battalion strongpoints around a key cross-roads near the well (bir) of Gubi. The 8th Bersaglieri, supported by the reinforced divisional artillery, begins moving into position around Bir el Gubi and digging in. Most of the M13/40 tanks of Ariete 's understrength 132nd Tank Regiment are kept to the rear.&#10;&#10;At the same time, General William Henry Ewart Gott, commander of the British 7th Armoured Divi-sion, orders the 22nd Armoured Brigade  (Brigadier John Scott-Cockburn) to attack the Ariete at Bir el Gubi, a complete change from his original orders for the brigade to secure Sidi Rezegh, 25 miles to the north. The reason for the change is still not clear: perhaps Gott hopes to give this well-equipped but inexperienced brigade an opportunity to season itself against an Italian formation that he assumes will be a weak opponent; possibly he just wants to clear his division's left flank before advancing. Whatever the reason, the full-strength brigade, equipped with 162 brand new Crusader tanks, is eager to emulate the Commonwealth's easy victories against the Italian Tenth Army die previous winter.&#10;&#10;The stage is set for a swirling desert battle between evenly matched opponents.&#10;&#10;Ariete covers this entire mobile action in turns representing 30 minutes each and a map scale of 150 meters per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. A minimal amount of special rules bring the Tactical Combat Series to North Africa, highlighting the unique tactical challenge of the desert environment.&#10;&#10;The Italian player must manage a mobile defense against stronger British armored units until reinforcements arrive in the form of the 132nd Tank Regiment. He must make good use of artillery and AT assets (especially truck-mounted 102mm guns) to bloody the Brits and set them up for an armored counterattack.&#10;&#10;The Commonwealth player must solve the problem of using an armor-only force to crack defensive positions held by a well-led combined-arms force. The desert environment, with swirling dust clouds and relatively long lines of sight, will not help him in this regard!&#10;&#10;&#10;     12 Scenarios:&#10;        Destruction of the III/8 Bersaglieri, 2 turns&#10;        The Nearest Thing to a Cavalry Charge, 6 turns&#10;        The Attack on the 8th Bersaglieri, 6 turns&#10;        The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 6 turns&#10;        The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 6 turns&#10;        Attack of the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, 10 turns&#10;        Attack of the 4th County of London Yeomanry, 11 turns&#10;        The Ram Strikes, 6 turns&#10;        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (historical), 11 turns&#10;        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 11 turns&#10;        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 12 turns&#10;        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Free Deployment), 11 turns&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 30 minutes&#10;Hex: 164 yards / 150 meters&#10;Units: most vehicles Platoon/Squadron, infantry platoons, support weapons generally individual &amp; sections&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Tactical Combat Series version 4.02 rulebook&#10;One 16-page Ariete game-specific rulebook&#10;Two 4-page Tactical Combat Series version 4.02 Charts &amp; Tables&#10;One front coversheet&#10;One rear coversheet&#10;One plastic zip lock bag&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one red, and one white 6-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;Note: In order to keep production costs down, Ariete is produced as a bagged game only; there will not be a boxed edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The thriving colonies of Zel'var are the destination for many adventurous souls who choose to leave the solar system and good old planet Earth seeking a new life and good fortune &ndash; but not all find what they are looking for. Many become disillusioned, discontent even, and turn to pirating the prosperous trade routes between the five planets, much to the regret of the colonies' leaders, who have great need of the trade income in order to advance technologies and create jobs for the newly-arrived colonists.&#10;&#10;Colonies is a game of resource management in the far reaches of space in which the players compete to dominate in trade, politics and technological development. Each player controls the administration of a planet with access to a unique resource. In order to win you need to collect the most colonial credits by trading resources, upgrading your technologies, keeping your trade lanes free of pirates, and perhaps pushing the council's decisions in the right direction.&#10;&#10;At the begining of each turn, players receive an income of their own resource. The council meets each turn to vote on how to handle an occurring event. The outcome can reward those willing to put in an effort or punish those who are not. Players may do well to form alliances in order to sway the vote in a favourable direction.&#10;&#10;The resource income and the colonists that arrive each turn &ndash; sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small &ndash; are used to make advances in five areas: Community, Military, Commerce, Influence and Industry. Following the council's vote, players take turns to either upgrade these areas or activate one of them to grant asylum to pirates in exchange for resources or hunt them for bounty, sell resources for Credits, make trade agreements more beneficial, or produce additional resources. When everyone has had three such actions, the players receive and pay resources according to the trade agreements, and any colonists that players have failed to employ turn to piracy, preventing players from getting income from their trade agreements next turn unless preemptive action is taken.&#10;&#10;Colonies lasts ten turns, with players earning victory points (VPs) from colonial Credits and technology advances. In the end, the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

The card set includes insects &mdash; common flies (fruit flies, midges, houseflies, and mayflies), royal flies (fireflies, robber flies, damselflies, and dragonflies), and wasps &mdash; and Murray. Common flies are useful for building swarms and getting more cards. Royal flies and wasps are useful for building swarms and for their unique special abilities.&#10;&#10;Your main goal is to create swarms of insects to score points while using Murray to eat your opponents' swarms. Players keep their swarms face up on the table in front of them. Higher value insects and insects of the same type form higher value swarms &mdash; but you need to be careful because when Murray eats a swarm, he leaves a tadpole behind...and tadpole points can increase very quickly!&#10;&#10;Ultimately, your success depends on how well you build your own swarms and how well you exploit opportunities to ruin other players' swarms, not to mention how well you manage Murray. The arrival of the hawk in the second round of play sets the endgame triggers in motion.&#10;&#10;Your objective is to maximize your score. At the end of the game, your score will be based on the swarms and tadpoles you own. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

LOT was born while researching the concept of a simple piece-removal game mechanism that made loops impossible, but at the same time, produced potentially long games in a very small playing area. (The name LOT comes from &quot;Line Of Three&quot; and also from &quot;Lots Of Turns&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns, with the second player having the option of swapping colors after the first turn (pie rule). On a turn, a player does the following in order:&#10;&#10;1. Lays out a thing on an empty space: Place a piece of your color on an empty space of the board.&#10;&#10;2. Looks over that:  If at least one line of three or more pieces (not stacks) of your color in any direction (orthogonally or diagonally) has been created, then you must do the following in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Choose one of the lines of three that have been created and remove two pieces, but leave one there.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Add one level of tower, by adding another piece of yours to the single piece that you left in place during the previous step, thereby creating a stack.&#10;&#10;&#10;If at the end of the turn at least one line of three (or more) stacks of the same color has been created, the line's owner triumphs. If the board fills up before this happens, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the introduction:&#10;&#10;One of the biggest problems facing wargamers is finding the time to actually play. Most commercially available sets of rules require several hours to set up and play to a conclusion; some can easily swallow up a whole day or weekend. For many gamers this means that their lavishly prepared miniature armies rarely get used at all. Apart from time, the other consideration is space, which further constrains the opportunities for a game. In One-hour Wargames, veteran gamer and rule-writer Neil Thomas has addressed both these problems. Now it is practical to play a game in around an hour on a normal dining table or living room floor. The book contains 8 (all-new) sets of very simple rules for various periods, from Ancient to WW2 and 30 scenarios which can be played using any of them, so you don't even have to take too much time thinking up a stimulating tactical situation and objectives. All the rules and scenarios are intended to be played on a 3ft x 3ft battlefield. The rules only require a small number of miniatures, so this really is an ideal way for new gamers, or veterans trying a new period, to get started with minimal investment of time and money. Also ideal for a quick game in the evening when a friend pops round. There are also sections on campaigns and solo games.&#10;&#10;",

Some Nazis have a soft spot for certain things (for example, card suits) and bring further specifications into play. In addition, each character has its own rules of play that must be followed. The game is accompanied by an app that provides 18 increasingly difficult levels and also acts as a timer as new Nazis appear at regular intervals. The group loses if it has been surrounded by Nazis. If, on the other hand, all Nazis could be convinced within the time limit, the players win together.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Killer is a sort of &quot;live action&quot; role playing game. The goal is to successfully &quot;kill&quot; your opponents within the rules of the game. Don't worry, the rules are carefully constructed so that no dangerous weapons are used. Typically the game is played in real time -- that is, the game is more likely to be played at school or at a game convention over a period of days or weeks than at a friends house in an afternoon.&#10;&#10;There are many scenarios outlined in the game but the simplest is to give every player the name and picture (if necessary) of another player and a dart gun. If you successfully kill your target you take his target as your new target. You may not shoot at anyone who is not your target except in self defense. Obviously, there needs to be at least one moderator.&#10;&#10;There are several other interesting scenarios as well as suggestions for far more elaborate and interesting weapons than dart guns. For example, there are sci-fi, mafia  and spy vs spy scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "KerFlip! is a fast-thinking word game that rewards you for making anagrams from a group of letter tiles faster than your opponents can. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously drop a predetermined number of tiles onto the board, then quickly flip them all ivory side up. (The fronts of the tiles are ivory, while the backs are orange.) At this point the round is a free-for-all, with players racing to call out one word each. If the last player is taking too long to call a word, any of his opponents can &quot;hurry&quot; him by starting the timer; if he doesn't call out a word in 15 seconds, he busts, scoring nothing.&#10;&#10;Once every player has called a word for the round, they score points in the order they called out the words, so the first player who called scores first, the second player second, etc. The first time a tile is used &ndash; that is, while its ivory side is face-up &ndash; the tile is worth 10 points. Once it's been scored, flip (or &quot;KerFlip&quot;) it to its orange side, reducing its value to 5 points for all other players who used it in the same round. Some tiles, identified by a small number in the bottom right corner, are &quot;premium tiles&quot; that award players cards with bonus point values.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, return any unused (ivory) tiles to the draw pouch and sweep all used (orange) tiles into the collection chutes in the game box. The game lasts 15-20 minutes (about 10-12 rounds) depending on the number of players (2-4). To clean up at the end of the game, pick up the game box and gently shake it to funnel the tiles into a collection cup under the board.&#10;&#10;",
