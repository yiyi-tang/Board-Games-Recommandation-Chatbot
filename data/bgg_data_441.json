Collect your favourite players and clubs.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a simple card game where players lay cards from a face-down pack hoping they will form a sequence that would allow them to shoot.  If not, the opposing player could attempt to intercept.  This could lead to a successful tackle or a foul, which in turn could lead to a penalty.&#10;&#10;It can be played with one or two packs of Top Team cards.  Each pack represents a different team from the upper reaches of the 1979 English First Division.&#10;&#10;The game itself is pure chance.  Prominent players of the era were represented as 'artist's impressions'.&#10;&#10;",

This is a&#10;game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody&#10;responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls&#10;the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.&#10;All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody&#10;to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps&#10;if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive&#10;study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you&#10;to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for&#10;eventual world domination.&#10;&quot;Elegance in Simplicity&quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the&#10;dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.&#10;Enjoy.&#10;All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are&#10;composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players&#10;may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal&#10;&ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined&#10;by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,&#10;or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.&#10;But it all boils down to:&#10;Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of the game is to be the first to score 77 points by winning rounds by playing the highest value of cards. The deck consists of 49 cards numbered 1 through 7 in seven coloured suits. In each round each player lays a meld of matching number or matching suit from a hand of seven cards. Points are scored according to the number of cards played and the total points value of the meld. The player with the highest score wins that round and keeps all the cards played by all players. When the deck is exhausted each player adds the number of cards won from that deck to a running total, the deck is shuffled and the game continues until one player's running total reaches 77. At that point the game stops immediately with that player winning.&#10;&#10;Es gilt, in jeder Runde eine m&ouml;glichst wertvolle Kartenkombination auszuspielen, um Rundensieger zu werden.  Denn als Rundensieger gewinnt man die ausgespielten Karten.&#10;&#10;",

A risky attack means that the energy of the cyclist will decrease. A cyclist can also follow the slipstream of another player, which will cost the cyclist in front 1 energy point.

Each time a player rolls a four and is able to move four spaces, he is entitled to an additional turn.&#10;&#10;4.

When a player lands on a space occupied by ANOTHER PLAYER, he replaces that player's playing piece with his own and sends the other player's playing piece back to the matching base, where that player must start again.&#10;&#10;BONUS:&#10;1.  When a player's roll of the die places his playing piece exactly on any of the six black BONUS spaces, around the center of the board, he may, on his next turn, choose to move that playing piece around the board, using the black BONUS spaces only and thus shorten the path to HOME.&#10;&#10;2.  He moves the number of spaces as rolled, counting around the BONUS spaces until he reaches the row by his HOME and continuing down that row the remaining number on the die.&#10;&#10;DOUBLE BONUS:&#10;1.  The center black space is a double bonus space that may be entered from any location on the board, by rolling the exact number to land there.&#10;&#10;2.  In order to leave the double bonus space, a player must roll a one and he then proceeds to any of the six bonus spaces on the board.&#10;IN BOTH OF THE ABOVE BONUS CASES, IF A PLAYER LANDS ON A BONUS SPACE ALREADY OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER PLAYER, RULE 6 OF PLAY APPLIES.&#10;&#10;TO WIN:  To be the first player to move all four playing pieces to the matching home is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You will also be sent to areas of the game board which symbolize key aspects of women's lives: home, employment, personal style, and public achievement. As American women have known both frustration and triumph in their struggle for equality, you too will progress or lose ground on the board as you learn the landmark developments of women's history, the fight for women's suffrage, and the continuing effort for fair treatment at work and at home.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for both simple and more complex play. Those players who have had little exposure to women's history will most enjoy the simple version, which familiarizes them with details and people but does not test their knowledge. Those players who are ready for the risks (and pleasures) of a challenge will enjoy the complex version. Here questions are asked and must be answered in the course of pursuing the goal and planning game strategy.&#10;&#10;In both game versions, the objective is to reach the end of the path where the Statue of Liberty stands as a symbol of freedom of choice and opportunity - the life goal of both women and men in America.&#10;&#10;",

As you would expect, players hope to make profits by buying and selling shares in one or more of six companies whose prices can rise or fall dramatically during the course of the game.

These have immediate effect on one (or more rarely all) companies once a player lands on a particular square&#10;2 - The Stock Exchange. Players select a company in which they have a minimum holding and roll dice to determine the extent and direction of the share price of that company.&#10;3 - Inside Information cards. The most fun, these cards can be kept by players and played at the most advantageous moment. For example, by raising a share price immediately before you sell, or dropping it as you want to buy (or your opponents sell!).&#10;&#10;This UK game was released at the height of the yuppie, 'greed is good' period in the late 80's.&#10;&#10;",

There are two major components of play: a mapping mechanism and a system of glyphs, or patterns of orthogonally adjacent squares.  The mapping mechanism works as follows.  Your last move points to the mini grid in which your next move must be made.  For example, if your last move was in the upper left corner of a mini grid, then your next move must be made somewhere in the upper left mini grid.  The glyph system works as follows.  There are 19 named glyphs of various sizes from 1 to 9 orthogonally adjacent squares.  Glyphs that you form during play are worth points.  The majority of points scored in a mini grid wins the mini grid.  The winner of the majority of mini grids wins the game.&#10;&#10;For the complete rules to Scribe, see http://marksteeregames.com/&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It isn't clear if the game was originally conceived on an NxN board or a 4x4 board.  The game is in the public domain.&#10;&#10;The first major publicity for the game was probably in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in the February 1958 issue. The column and reader's responses were later re-printed in his first book collection of columns, &quot;Hexaflexagons and other Mathematical Diversions; The First Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions.&quot; Mr. Gardner notes that reader's analysis left no doubt that the 4x4 game was a second player win even though no simply strategy was found.&#10;&#10;",

This game appears to be a teaching aid, as there is little to no strategy, and focuses on highlighting the people, places, and facts of the American Revolutionary War.&#10;&#10;It is a roll-and-move game, with a board divided into three sections: a left circular track, a right snake-like track, and a middle track that is a straight-away to the victory space on top.  Each space on the board has a bit of trivia that I assume is intended to be read aloud when a player lands on it.&#10;&#10;The flow of the game is as follows:&#10;&#10;Section I, People&#10;Players roll and move on the right side of the board, landing on spaces that describe the major players of the war.  Some spaces require you to draw a card, which could move you forward or backward.   The object is to get to the end of the Section I path.&#10;&#10;Section II, The Original 13 Colonies&#10;Once they reach the end of Section I, players roll and move on the left side of the board, landing on spaces that represent the 13 colonies.  If a player lands on a colony that they have not previously landed, they mark on a piece of paper that they have &quot;collected&quot; this colony.  Players will continue on the circular path until they have &quot;collected&quot; all 13 colonies, which will allow them to move to Section III.&#10;&#10;Section III, The American Character&#10;A player rolls and moves up the center path towards the top of the board.  The player must roll exactly to land on the last space, The Bell Tower, in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

The 1949 edition contained 6 small cars in lead, each car for a player. The goal of the game is to take your car to a wedding, to pick up family members and get a present on the way to the wedding. But first U have to get your driving license. This is done by moving on the track on the board and learning/respecting the road code (speed limit, unique direction). Several things can happen on the board: an accident, blown tire,... There also is a garage, a gangster, a d&eacute;panneur (troubleshooter) and a gangster that can be met on the board.

    "Description": "&quot;In GONE BANANAS your ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO come together on a game board that confronts you with real-life situations.  You take risks and develop strategies.  You will experience 'the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.'  But win or lose, you will know that you have been in a game!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a fairly typical &quot;special interest&quot; roll-and-move game with a psychoanalytical theme and a couple unique twists.&#10;&#10;As players move around the outer track, they collect ID, EGO, and WOW!/OW! (Superego) cards through square instructions and a Chance card mechanism.  You use these cards throughout the game to buy BUTTONS and ZAPPERS, and to avoid penalties.&#10;&#10;Linked at the corners of the outer track are four independent alternate routes, one each for the themes IS/EGO/SE and GONE BANANAS.  While on these alternate paths you have the chance to earn a BUTTON (literally) of the corresponding color...but each path also entails risk and expense.&#10;&#10;Some of the squares along the outer track where &quot;Chance&quot; cards are had can be &quot;owned&quot; by players by buying ZAPPERS with ID cards.  Once bought, the squares are marked with one of the player's ZAPPER tokens.  That player gets benefits for landing on the ZAPPER, while his opponents landing there have to give him a BUTTON or WOW! cards, and the opponent gets all his OW!s.  Each ZAPPER location can be bought and re-bought (at a higher price) throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when one player has buttons of all four colors (representing a balanced personality) and more WOW!s than OW!s (representing positive self-worth...I guess).&#10;&#10;The production value is first-class, as is the professional artwork on the nicely-mounted board.  The bits are plastic and specially designed for the game - the player tokens are bananas on a little colored base.  The cards are the only weak spot, small print on heavily-colored, cheapish  card stock.&#10;&#10;The double goal and constant shift of buttons might make this game a cut above the standard RaM fare.  Keeping resource cards and buttons hidden would also increase the fun...and the chaos.  I've had many of these low-volume specialty games pass through my thrifting hands, and this may be the first I actually try.  The Freudian theme might wear thin early, but who knows, I might learn something about myself...or my mother.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jungle Jaws is a simple children's game that involves catapulting your insects into the jaws of the waiting Venus Flytraps The winner is the person who gets the most bugs into the jaws of the jungle plants!&#10;&#10;This is a great looking game with a 2 level board - four colorful Venus Flytraps on stalks and 4 sets of 4 plastic insects in different colors. You also get 4 leaf themed catapults to launch your insects. The board is held together with 1 large elastic band and the jaws of the Flytraps also snap closed thanks to elastic bands too.&#10;&#10;The nice thing is that each bug is different instead of 4 identical ones and that the game looks great when assembled.&#10;&#10;",

It uses a board similar to Twelve Men&rsquo;s Morris, but the board is color coded so that the red lines cannot be used to create a line of three. The game only uses ten men on a side.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a placement phase, then a movement phase. Forming a line of three in either allows a player to remove on of his opponent&rsquo;s men. A player reduced to two men loses. There are a number of other rules about movement and removal of men.&#10;&#10;",
