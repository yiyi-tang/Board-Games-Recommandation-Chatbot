    "Description": "It is now 2017, one hundred years since the United States entered the First World War on the side of the Allies in one of the most unnecessary and wasteful wars ever fought.&#10;&#10;The research required almost got in the way of the game system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after many rewrites it was decided to create one book as a game system and another as a simple note book. Both over lap each other. It did seem necessary to describe the tactical techniques in some great detail. Fortunately there is plenty of information on how these weapons were used on the battlefield. This availability of information made it possible to transform information into a realistic game system. However incomplete as it may be, the rules still effectively cover only a small part of the late ground war.&#10;&#10;The game system includes supportive diagrams, illustrations, tactical notes and Quick Reference Sheets (Q.R.S.). The Turn Sequence and Turn Phases, once understood, make play easy and fast. The system has two Turn Sequences one of which is optional and the other mandatory. Six basic Turn Phases move the game along to a conclusion. Manufacturers will be glad by the fact that the game is best played using lots of figures and models. Let us be glad that there are sources for figures and models.&#10;&#10;Basic units are 12 figures for a platoon with four platoons making a company and three to four companies making a battalion. Figures can be mounted individually or on multiple stands. Morale is based on unit size and applicable modifiers. Movement is with a D-10 die roll for both infantry and tanks. Transport and field artillery movement is determined by the roll of a D-6. There are two Turn Phases in which players can shoot. Hand-to-hand combat is easily performed. Players are always encouraged to adjust the rules to suit their perceptions.&#10;&#10;To me, Yanks and Tanks captures the flavor of the late war. I hope your games will be hard fought, yet fun, and the game system competes well with other similar systems.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Your neighbor must have lost their gryphon again. You decide to round it back up and, hopefully, you will not need a finger reattachment from the cleric again...&#10;You walk out of your cottage, it is winter but there&rsquo;s no snow on the ground. Not yet. Climate change has seemed to shift the snow into the early months of the new year (and they say it&rsquo;s a hoax?). Anyway, the towering buildings of the bustling city can be seen in the distance to your right, it is strange though&hellip; you are clearly part of a fantasy world, but the cityscape looks quite modern, like New York, Seattle, or Portland. There&rsquo;s no time to dwell on the finer details though, you have a gryphon to catch!&#10;When you look up on your roof, you do not see an eagle-lion at all. Rather, to your aghast, you see a very different creature! Above you, holding a bag full of wrapped parcels and decorated from wingtip to tail, is Kringle Klaws! You didn&rsquo;t even believe in Kringle but here she is, right in front of you. A sack full of gifts and all. What a sight to see! Not only are you shocked that you are beholding Kringle Klaws but you are nearly floored when she starts to speak to you.&#10;&ldquo;Adventurer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Something terrible has happened and I have been forced to seek your aid. I have known of your deeds since that very first piggly-wiggly you saved over in Yazoo and I need your skills. Only you can save our holiday.&rdquo;&#10;Knowing that you are too stunned to speak, she continues. &ldquo;Another godly being has come from the land of the Vikings, the fiend calls himself &lsquo;Kris.&rsquo; He has stolen my Red Globe of Illumination and I need you to get it back before the sun sets. Without the globe, I cannot deliver the gifts to your fellow humans.&rdquo;&#10;You have only the whit to ask &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;I watched him place the globe into a chest strapped to one of his reindeer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was able to follow the furry beast to a fort in the hills not far from here.

Players work to win the nomination of their party in the first phase of play then join together in teams to compete in the national election. Votes are gained by using political influence in this trick-taking game. Do you have what it takes to run for office and lead your country to greatness or, at least, have a lot of fun trying?&#10;&#10;Run For Office is played in two phases of seven rounds each. The first phase is the Primary where each player works to win the nomination of their own party. The second phase is the Election where players work together in two competing teams to elect a president (winner).&#10;&#10;In the Primary, each player gets a party, negotiates a platform by trading cards, and then gains Influence Cards. The Influence Cards are used to win Vote Cards by taking tricks. The Top two players who collect the most votes in their party are the winners of the Primary. The remaining players form teams with the two winners and a final Election takes place. Again, players gain Influence Cards to take Vote Cards through tricks but must do so in teams. The party members with the most votes at the end of the Election are the winners.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each colour has its own actions associated with it: Green for political expertise, black for family life, purple for business, gold for bribe and deals.&#10;&#10;During the game, several elections are held. During each elections, players invest money - which buys them votes. These translated in positions in congress, which will give back money. There are also special positions, which will give you different advantages. A player wins the game if he manages to get a majority during the elections (50%+1).&#10;&#10;Players can negotiate alliances, which allows them to share the benefits of special positions - though it is not possible to win together.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take a thrilling ride through Sacramentos most beautiful and iconic locations, while collaborating to connect them together and with the game.&#10;&#10;- A great filler or gateway game that will hit the table often.&#10;- The game can be taught in a few minutes and is highly thematic and accessible.&#10;- Bike route is a light route building game that is semi-cooperative but includes optional rules for more complexity.&#10;- The game has a great climax where eveybody fells like they are 'one turn away from winning.&#10;&#10;In the game players build bike routes around the city winning community rewards. The first player to 7 points wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes exquisite paintings of local landmarks and locations both past, present and future. This is not the Sacramento of today but a Sacramento of the imagination, with ideas that excite the spirit, from the historical past to the hopeful future. Bike Route includes everything from the majestic Alhambra movie palace to the soon to be completed Powerhouse Science Center on the river. All the wonderful things that you think about when you imagine Sacramento are included. Come play in the Sacramento that never was but will always exist in our hearts.&#10;&#10;Bike Route has a long history and has been in development for over 10 years. Originally called Connections the game was never published and looked like it would end up on the pile of great ideas that never were. My daughter AR kept it alive by insisting that we play. &quot;Papa lets play Connections&quot; she would say and we would play. Despite the weak art the game was good and we kept enjoying the drama of the game. Eventually we decided that it should be brought back with new artwork and Bike Route was born. Connections was at heart a game about building connections between places and it seemed a perfect fit for a game about building bike routes. The idea took off and it has kept going ever since.&#10;&#10;I was play-testing Bike Route at the main library with a local family and the boy across from me said &quot;We live here...&quot; and pointed at the map. &quot;and I have been to the Zoo.&quot; he continued, indicating Land Park at the bottom of the board. Watching him I realized that a lot of kids know places in Sacramento but their mental map doesn't really connect them together. It was great to see the gears turning in his head as he saw all the places in town fit. He also knew DOCO and Old Town and quite a few other places. This was moment of affirmation; I realized that Bike Route could also bring back that great sense of place that is getting lost. Google guides us from place to place without any context or sense of relationship. Yes you can turn left and turn right but where are you?&#10;&#10;I travel a lot for work and I am always happy to come home. Ususally I go to a town that is excited about what they are doing but in Sac we have it in spades. It seems that every week brings something new to our doorstep. Mabye a brand new artist or shome classy hippy selling tea. We have to recognize this exciting moment we are living in and celebrate it. Bike Route puts this fantasitc idea down on paper and freezes this instant so we can stop and savor what we have. Take a break from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a great game with family and friends. Recognize how lucky we are and enjoy it.&#10;&#10;Bike route is for people who love bikes, games and Sacramento.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overlap is a card game using small, square cards, each with nine squares that are each colored red, yellow, or blue. The goal of the game is to score points by placing cards such that squares of the same color align. As the name suggests, the cards can overlap one another, adding another level of strategy and requiring spatial-reasoning and critical thinking skills.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Set up: Shuffle the deck of cards, then deal each player five cards. Each player places this stack of cards face down in front of them. Place one card from the deck face up in the center of the playing surface.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Choose a starting player. That player draws the top card from his/her stack and plays it on the playing surface following card placement rules, and then calculates and records his/her score for the turn. Play then continues clockwise. When all players have placed all their cards, the round ends and the cards are shuffled back into the deck. The number of rounds corresponds with the number of players, with each player having an opportunity to go first.&#10;&#10;Card placement: Cards may be placed adjacent to other cards in play, but they must be played so that at least one square aligns with a square on an adjacent card. Additionally, they may be played so that the cards partially overlap, as long as the squares align. When cards are played, at least one square must lie over an empty space (you cannot occlude 9 squares with any given card.)&#10;&#10;Scoring: When you place a card, any instance in which a square of a certain color lies next to a square of that same color on another card is worth one point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Oh, and it&rsquo;s got psychotic bunnies. Don&rsquo;t forget the bunnies.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you need to ensure you have the lowest score possible each round. The last bunny standing is the winner. That might sound easy, but with only 10 seconds to view half or your drawn cards and the other half of your hand a complete mystery, it soon becomes more of a challenge!&#10;&#10;Play can become incredibly strategic (e.g. do you 'play safe' and try to attain low scoring cards, or do you collect high scoring cards that others are more likely to discard, running the risk of being stuck with them when play ends?).&#10;&#10;Then there's the element of luck. You have no idea what half of your deck contains. Sometimes at the end of a round, they're as much as a surprise to you as to the rest of the players. This can be a good or a bad thing! Add to that several 'Trick or Treat' cards designed to test your skills (and your sanity), and Psychobunnies is an absolute riot to play.&#10;&#10;No bunnies were harmed in the making of this game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the forces of revolt and revolution gathered strength. First there were protests in the 13 American colonies as well as a minor rebellion in Louisiana, and a short but sharp guerilla war in Corsica. The great powers though continued on, making a few concessions but assuming their power was unbroken. Then came Lexington, where British regulars and American militia traded shots. In the end, the British lost the American colonies, but avoided losing territory to France and Spain. France, having bankrupted itself aiding the Americans, underwent a revolution that is often considered the dawn of the modern age.&#10;&#10;The French Revolution was complicated, confusing, violent, and inspiring. It was an age of wonders and nightmares. It also would have ended if not for the French army. The combination of post-Seven Year&rsquo;s War reforms and the transformation of the army from an instrument of the Bourbons into a citizen&rsquo;s army made it a formidable force. Warfare in this age blended old and new tactics. Linear formations in the style of Frederick II continued, but with a greater use of skirmishers and light troops. The French mastered this new style of warfare and won a series of sweeping victories that undermined the old powers and ushered in the bloodiest and most fevered war of the era.&#10;&#10;Battles included are...&#10;&#10;Borgo - October 8, 1768 &ndash; &ldquo;Europe is watching you.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Kagul - August 1, 1770 &ndash; The Glory of Catherine&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill - June 17, 1775 &ndash; &ldquo;Another such would have ruined us.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Long Island - August 27, 1776 &ndash; &ldquo;If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Princeton - January 3, 1777 &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine fox chase my boys!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Germantown - October 4, 1777 &ndash; &ldquo;Form!

    "Description": "The final phase of the French Revolutionary War saw the rise of the greatest commander of the era. Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte was a military and political genius, who used his growing popularity to make himself ruler of France. After an assassination attempt, he made himself emperor, hoping to be accepted by other monarchs. He was not, and the mutual distrust and antipathy led both sides to choose war over peace. The conflict spanned all of Europe, from the mountains of Portugal to the gates of Moscow. The struggle spilled into the wider world, in time dragging America into the conflict as she waged a separate and futile war with the British.&#10;&#10;Constant warfare and decades of military theory led to a major shift in warfare. The pace of operations, and the depredations of war, increased to a frenzy not seen in Europe since the Roman Empire. Battles were big, decisive, and bloody. Infantry became more mobile and proficient, with mixed formations and tactics being used. The French in particular pioneered a combined arms approach to warfare where infantry, cavalry, and artillery were used in concert. Even after the wars ended the desire for fast decisive action would dictate western military policy until World War II.&#10;&#10;The battles included are...&#10;&#10;Rivoli - January 14, 1797 &ndash; Bonaparte's First Masterpiece&#10;&#10;The Pyramids - July 21, 1798 &ndash; &ldquo;Forty centuries look down upon you.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Novi - August 15, 1799 &ndash; &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for action!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Hohenlinden - December 3, 1800 &ndash; The Zenith of Jean Moreau&#10;&#10;Austerlitz - December 2, 1805 &ndash; &ldquo;We are babies in the hands of a giant.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Cape Town - January 8, 1806 &ndash; &ldquo;The bitter cup must be drunk to the bottom.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Auerstadt - October 14, 1806 &ndash; &ldquo;Tell your Marshal he is seeing double.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Friedland - June 14, 1807 &ndash; &ldquo;Then we have already made peace.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Bail&eacute;n - July 19, 1808 &ndash; &ldquo;The whole nation is exasperated and determined to fight.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Wagram - July 5-6, 1809 &ndash; Archduke Charles&rsquo; Last Battle&#10;&#10;Bussaco - September 27, 1810 &ndash; &ldquo;I have never witnessed a more gallant charge.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Albuera - May 16, 1811 &ndash; &ldquo;Die hard 57th, die hard!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Queenston Heights - October 13, 1812 &ndash; Disaster at Niagara&#10;&#10;Maloyaroslavets - October 24, 1812 &ndash; &ldquo;Here began the flight and destruction of the enemy.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Dresden - August 26-27, 1813 &ndash; &ldquo;God has uttered His judgement.

    "Description": "With the final defeat of Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte, a new conservative era of anti-liberal and anti-republican politics began in Europe. It was a false dawn for the forces of reaction. In the Americas, Spain&rsquo;s empire evaporated in a series of rebellions. The defeat of the republicans led to a renewal in great power struggles, such as the Crimean War, and nationalist and expansionist wars. The middle of the century saw the unification of Italy and Germany through warfare. America, wracked by division over slavery, politics, and economics, was ripped apart by a civil war that ended in the reunification of the nation.&#10;&#10;The great changes in government and ideology were matched by a shift towards industrialized war. By the 1850s railroads, telegraphs, and photographs were changing the face of battle. The smoothbore flintlock was replaced by the rifled musket, which was in turn replaced with repeating rifles. The era of linear combat, the basic tactics of western warfare for thousands of years, now gave way to a looser form of warfare, where technology was as important as training and generals. It was the end of an era.&#10;&#10;The battles included are...&#10;&#10;Ayacucho - December 9, 1824 &ndash; &ldquo;If from Romulus, Rome; from Bol&iacute;var, it is Bolivia.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Alamo - March 6, 1836 &ndash; &ldquo;What are the lives of soldiers, than so many chickens?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Mudki - December 18, 1845 &ndash; Opening Battle of the First Anglo-Sikh War&#10;&#10;Buena Vista - February 23, 1847 &ndash; &ldquo;Tell him to give &lsquo;em hell!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Cerro Gordo - April 17-18, 1847 &ndash; &ldquo;Mexico no longer has an army.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Novara - March 22, 1849 &ndash; The Abdication of Charles Albert I&#10;&#10;Balaclava - October 25, 1854 &ndash; &ldquo;There, my lord, is your enemy!

    "Description": "A simple dice game that requires 6 dice and a way to keep score. The goal is to score as few points as possible, while also attempting to knock the player to your left out of the game.&#10;&#10;The player takes the 6 dice and rolls them with the objective of getting a total of 30 or more showing on the dice. After each roll the player must set aside one or more dice. The player's turn continues until all 6 dice have been set aside, and then the face value is added up to determine the total for that player.&#10;&#10;If a total value of 30 is achieved, the player scores 0 points. If the total is LESS than 30, the player scores the difference in points (a roll of 26 would score the player 4 points). If the total is MORE than 30, the player takes all 6 dice and rolls again. Every die that shows their total - 30 is set aside and they continue rolling until they do not roll any more of that number or all 6 dice have been set aside. The player to the left then gains points equal to the total shown on the set aside dice.&#10;&#10;Example: Player A's original roll totals 32. Player A rolls all 6 dice and gets one 2. That die is set aside and the remaining 5 dice are rolled. This time there are two more 2s. Those two dice are set aside and the remaining 3 dice are rolled. No more 2s are rolled so Player A stops. The player to Player A's left gains 6 points for the three 2s that were rolled.&#10;&#10;The dice are then passed to the left and play continues.&#10;&#10;Once a player scores 30 or more points, that player is eliminated from the game. The game ends when only one player remains and that player is the winner.&#10;&#10;For a shorter game without player elimination, the game can be played until the first player scores above 30. When that happens, the player with the fewest points is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Helmut Wulf, a hitherto unremarkable Lineman for the Bruendar Grimjacks, once volunteered to try out a risky new piece of equipment at his coach&rsquo;s request. He picked up a chainsaw for the first time and a lifelong bond was forged. It is quite likely that since that day he&rsquo;s never gone more than five minutes without at least one chainsaw in his hands &ndash; certainly, he&rsquo;s never been seen in public without one.&#10;&#10;In 2483 it is the height of the chainsaw craze and Helmut Wulf has risen to prominence as a master of his craft. In a memorable match against the now-disbanded Bogstaff Beardlings, he broke a strong cage formation single-handedly by leaping into the middle and spinning around wildly. How he survived (especially considering how very slippery it suddenly gets) is a mystery, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that the man&rsquo;s got style.&#10;&#10;Helmut Wulf is a Star Player who can be included in the following teams: Amazon, Chaos Renegades, Human, Lizardmen, Norse, Vampire. His unique brand of carnage and mayhem means that your opponent will be running scared from the first kickoff, and the revving of his chainsaw will haunt their nightmares for nights to come.&#10;&#10;This is a complete, multipart resin kit which contains one Helmut Wulf. He is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl base, and his rules can be found in the Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Karla von Kill takes a day off from the family pig farm to watch some Blood Bowl at a local stadium with some friends. Having never seen the sport up-close before (only having caught the occasional big match on the crystal ball in the local tavern), she is immediately taken with the flashy plays, colourful commentary and over-the-top violence. She sticks around after the match to help clear up and manages to speak to some of the Hochstadt Hellfires, who convince her to abandon the provincial life and join them on the road. She spends the next few weeks driving carts, raising stands, selling tickets and dealing with troublemakers, but it isn&rsquo;t long before the Hellfires open their doors for new recruits. Karla is one of the first in line, where her passion for the sport impresses head coach Kru&#204;&#136;ber. She takes a spot on the reserves bench and never looks back.&#10;&#10;In 2483 Karla helped the Hellfires quit the backwater circuit and start hitting some of the bigger stadiums. She has proven herself a natural Blitzer, always leading the team from the front. When they came up against the Bloodskull Brutes, she coordinated the front offence to bring down both of the team&rsquo;s Trolls in short order, and was awarded the position of team captain in recognition of her efforts.&#10;&#10;Karla von Kill is a Star Player who can be included in the following teams: Amazon, Halfling, Human, Norse. This highly detailed miniature makes a fantastic addition to any team that can afford to hire her.&#10;&#10;This is a complete, multipart resin kit which contains one Karla von Kill.

Ruthlessly rise above your rivals to be crowned the boss of bosses.&#10;&#10;(website)&#10;&#10;Players start with one boss card, but there is a public marketplace that allows players to fill out a tableau (their syndicate) by draft-purchasing up to 3 extra *historical* gangsters, 4 assets (usually venues associated with crime) and 4 upgrades (eg drug boats, evidence, guns, armor).&#10;&#10;The tableau allows each gangster to be lined up with an Asset and an Upgrade which increase the gangster's abilities.&#10;The players will take it in turn to activate each gangster, with various abilities including earning money, stealing money, attacking other gangsters, stealing other gangsters, destroying Assets/Upgrades and attempting a narcotics shipment. The success of these actions depends on a dice roll, but increasing the gangsters' abilities increases their chance of success. If they do not succeed, a gangster they have targeted will usually have an ability that allows retaliation.&#10;&#10;Some of the Assets (locations) give income at the end of each round, if they still have a gangster assigned to them.&#10;At the end of four rounds, the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;(NB this is based on the 2018 version of the game)&#10;&#10;",

One of each card type is used to create the main character, the hero/ine of the story.  A main character will also have a Trait and a Theme that help direct the narrative.&#10;&#10;The players take turns as the Author to add cards from their hand to the table.  Everyone who is waiting for a turn is an Editor.  Editors offer suggestions (in the form of cards from their own hands), and reward the Author for creative plays with &quot;Awesome cards&quot; - as in &quot;That was awesome!&quot; - which are bonus cards added to the Author's stock.&#10;&#10;Any card may introduce the namesake element into the story (eg. a volcano, Zombie, or mask), OR be used as an action to describe another character doing something (eg. incinerating, chasing, or tricking).  The cards provide a growing pool of words to be used, reused and reinterpreted as the story goes on.  The rules of narration may be as strict or generous as the players wish.  Spontaneous role-playing and voice-acting are often observed in casual play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the main character's conflict is resolved, or any player runs out of cards.  Players can resolve &quot;cliff-hanger&quot; endings in a number of ways: they may reveal the remaining cards, ad-lib a fitting resolution, or by player elimination.&#10;&#10;CoAUTHORation can also be used for brainstorming or as a tool to overcome writer's block.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
