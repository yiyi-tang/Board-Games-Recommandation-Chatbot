    "Description": "Lightning strikes a nearby tree. Fire! Your group of Neanderthals must now endure Mother Nature and work together to keep the fire going long enough to learn its mysterious powers and destructive capabilities. You have 14 days to uncover its secrets before a massive flood drowns the valley and extinguishes humanity&rsquo;s one chance at becoming the apex predator and escaping extinction.&#10;&#10;Don't Let It Die is a cooperative survival game based on early humanity's struggles to cement their place at the top of the food chain. You will gather resources &amp; food, fight deadly predators, and learn the mysteries of fire. Your task is a difficult one, but no matter what happens, remember: you and the fire must survive...&#10;&#10;Your tribe consists of 4 characters, all taking turns to search for resources, fight off dangerous animals, unlock new discoveries, and working together to keep the fire alive!&#10;&#10;Designed from the ground up to offer a re-playable, interactive, strategic cooperative experience for 1-4 players. The key to victory lies in your group's ability to adapt to the ever-present and always changing threats of prehistoric life. Should you focus on hunting and foraging to feed your starving tribe? Or should you be more concerned with supplying the dwindling fire with more wood? Perhaps constructing a weapon or tool might ease the stress of gathering resources...&#10;&#10;These choices and more await you in what will surely be the ultimate test of survival.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher blurb (Yoka Games English Edition):&#10;&#10;Throughout the rich history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms has always been a chaotic and awe-inspiring time period.  Larger than life characters such as the fierce SHU general ZHANG Fei, the cunning WEI warlord CAO Cao, and the legendary SHU strategist ZHUGE Liang have inspired generations of people with their stories of valor, deceit, and strategy.&#10;&#10;Legends of the Three Kingdoms replicate this historic age and allows players to assume the identities of these fabled heroes.  Combining these heroes with role play, battle, deception, and other elements, we created a fun and exciting game that can be shared with many.  We hope you will have as much fun playing as we had bringing this game to you.&#10;&#10;Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and shares many rules with BANG!. The differences are as follows:&#10;1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.&#10;2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.&#10;3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.&#10;4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.&#10;5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.&#10;6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.&#10;7. Reincarnation*: The Dead may return to the game (start with 1 life) when he gets 3 or 4 cards from other players (a player may only give 1 card to the Dead within his round); the risen Dead are not counted to the winning condition.&#10;&#10;*(removed from rules since 2010)&#10;&#10;*(This version (LTK) has since been phased out for War of the Three Kingdoms (WTK). The alternate gameplay mode of &quot;Kingdom Wars&quot; is only available in English under the new WTK name.)&#10;&#10;",

Birds may not be placed directly adjacent to other friendly birds and may only move (&quot;fly&quot;) towards other birds if they enlarge an existing friendly flock. Flocks may never be split, so players are forced to add new birds to the game, and this is actually where the competition unfolds.&#10;&#10;If an opponent's birds are isolated by the active player dividing the board in multiple regions through flock movement, the active player must remove trapped birds from the board, which may benefit the opponent.&#10;&#10;If a player ends up with one contiguous flock (of any size), he wins.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;      Boardspace.net Real time or turn based, against humans or robot players&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the end, the team with the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#233;&#129;&#169;&#229;&#144;&#136;2-4 &#228;&#189;&#141;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#229;&#141;&#161;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#233;&#169;&#133;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#231;&#136;&#173;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#229;&#190;&#183;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#139;&#177;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#152;&#135;&#232;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#155;&#155;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#162;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#229;&#184;&#165;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#233;&#160;&#136;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#231;&#173;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#160;&#148;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#229;&#159;&#183;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#230;&#147;&#138;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#151;&#137;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#230;&#147;&#180;&#229;&#188;&#181;&#233;&#160;&#152;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#136;&#173;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#231;&#167;&#145;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#190;&#142;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#159;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

You can also earn money from event cards, with staff and facility cards granting discounts and other benefits.&#10;&#10;After a certain number of rounds, the first set of award cards will appear, with the awards being handed out one by one or returned to the bottom of the event deck in case of a tie. Sample awards include most felines, most money in hand, and highest total star value. As soon as a player has collected three awards &mdash; or four awards in a two-player game &mdash; that player immediately wins. If no one wins during the first award ceremony, then complete another round of events, after which more awards will be distributed.&#10;&#10;",

Along the way, you will make decisions which will affect the outcome of His journeys and teachings. Thirteen possible alternate outcomes are included not to imply that other outcomes were in fact possible, but to build a strategy game that includes challenges with possibility of success and failure as the player of the game. Achieving the Major Victory (the historical outcomes) will demonstrate the extraordinary set of circumstances that took place and were necessary to achieve the birth of Christianity.&#10;&#10;The events that take place often cause the political and religious leaders of the area (represented by Caiaphas, Herod Antipas, and Pontius Pilate in the game) to take notice and become increasingly concerned. In game terms, this is shown by moving those Leader markers along a track on the game board, advancing them from their start spaces one step at a time until they reach the final space on that track (&ldquo;Arrest in Jerusalem&rdquo;), at which point they attempt to arrest Jesus.&#10;&#10;You get the chance to react to these movements with several choices each game turn. The goal is to assemble all twelve apostles, maintain a high level of piety, and enter into Jerusalem. Additionally, when trying to reconstruct the beginnings of Christianity historically, it is imperative that Judas betrays Jesus in Jerusalem. Events tend to push Jesus towards Jerusalem, but try to avoid entering too early before all the important pieces are in place!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;",

Each die is like a different club; the D4 like a putter, and the D20 a driver. Move forward as your rolls keep succeeding. The kicker: you MUST keep rolling until you fail. Don't choose the D20 unless you want to go far. Dice have various other sides, some which turn the ball, get stuck in trees, or won&rsquo;t roll on fairways.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ve practiced your swing and are eager to hit the fairway, but do you have what it takes to get a Roll in One?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

L'Arm&eacute;e du Nord for his final campaign: Waterloo. Man for man they were arguably the best troops he had ever commanded. They were the veterans, chosen from among the half a million men that answered the call to arms in the frantic mobilization following his dramatic return from exile. Each man burned with the desire to revenge the humiliating reverses of the past few years.&#10;&#10;Ahead lay the crossing of the Sambre River at a place called Charleroi; an intersection barely visible on their maps called Les Quatre Bras; a sleepy little village on the banks of the meandering Ligny brook; a narrow bridge at a place called Genappe; a bustling little town called Wavre; and another intersection set amidst the gently rolling Brabantine farmland. . . .a place called Mont. St. Jean . . . . just south of the village of Waterloo. The road to Brussels then was a straight shot north. Two days of hard marching would see them in the capital, three if they had to fight a battle. . .&#10; As Napoleon, can you mass the French in time to crush each Allied army in succession? As Bl&uuml;cher or Wellington, can you mobilize, and then unite on the field of battle to stop the sheer torrent of energy that is. . . .Napoleon?&#10;&#10;The game includes three 34&quot; x 22&quot; beautifully illustrated maps and one and 1/2 counter sheets.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM:&#10;- scale = 700m/hex,&#10;- time = 2hours/GT,&#10;- strength = 1,000men (Inf); 500horsemen (Cav); 1 Battery of guns (Art)/SP.&#10;&#10;",

No matter what your identity, your goal is to eliminate all your competitors by catching them in a lie &ndash; but making a false accusation will take you out of the game. If you want to make informed accusations, you must amass resources and spend them to investigate other players. To win, you have to both avoid accusations and judiciously make them, all the while making your opponents believe that all your lies are true. Whoever is devious enough to outlast all the other players wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The princess is sleeping. You, the royal servant, must prepare the perfect breakfast for her before she wakes up, which is difficult, because everything is a bomb. You must consult the prophets about what kind of breakfast she wants (before they explode) &ndash; you must prepare the desired dish (before it explodes) &ndash; and serve it to the princess the moment she opens her eyes (and explodes...everything explodes, this is inevitable).&#10;&#10;All is Bomb is a quick and puzzly solo/cooperative 18-card game for one or two players. Your goal is to manipulate the deck, so the princess ultimately eats the desired dish &ndash; but before you discard too many or too important cards.&#10;&#10;Aside from the initial setup, there are no random or hidden elements to the game. Each turn, you play one of your &quot;equipped cards&quot;. The played card's number says which card from the deck you &quot;equip&quot; next; you then perform the played card's action and recycle the card back into the deck. When the cards are played, they progress from the passive state to ignited state and are ultimately discarded, so the whole deck is constantly on the brink of exploding.&#10;&#10;You win by fulfilling 3 win conditions: you must play Prophet cards to find out what is the &quot;desired dish&quot; - you must prepare this dish by igniting it - and ultimately, you must play the Princess to &quot;equip&quot; the &quot;desired dish&quot;!&#10;&#10;The game also comes with 6 modular expansions, a variant and a campaign.&emsp;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Gier (Greed), players steal cards from one another to build their own collection, and once you start clawing at others' goods, it's hard to stop &mdash; but whoever wants too much will go home empty-handed.&#10;&#10;At the start of player, each player takes one crook card and seven number cards, with the number cards being dealt face down from the deck. Players will build up a personal collection turn by turn, with these collected cards being face up.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they play a card from their hand into their collection, then they're allowed to go on a card raid. They choose an opponent, then draw a card from their hand and place it face up on the table. They can stop and keep that card, or they can draw again from the same player; if two stolen cards have the same number, then the player's turn ends, and the cards return to the victim's hands. If the active player has drawn a crook (and stopped voluntarily), they can take a card of their choice from the opponent's collection.&#10;&#10;Some cards have a special action on them that takes effect as soon as they're drawn from someone's hand, such as looking at an opponent's hand or placing cards from the deck into a collection.&#10;&#10;Whoever first collects six cards of the same value wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Ore takes place during the industrial revolution, and aims to simulate the complexities of effective supply chain management.&#10;&#10;Players take turns carefully placing their workers on one of several locations:&#10;&#10;     In mines, to collect one of five different resources (lead, coal, copper, iron, or gold);&#10;     In distribution, to secure lucrative contracts that allow for players' operations to scale.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with $5+ and 4 workers. Early on, players have very limited means. However, by mining resources, acquiring assets, securing contracts, and expanding their operations through new initiatives, players become more readily able to generate more and more amounts of income.&#10;&#10;Mines become exhausted after they have been mined for a certain number of turns, and, once exhausted, they are replaced by subsequent mine cards. Similarly, a limited number of assets, initiatives, and contract cards are available for players to take, and, after being acquired, they are replaced until their respective decks run out.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of Turn 7.&#10;&#10;At that point in time, the player with the greatest amount of victory points from buildings, Money, and completed contracts is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Third Winter: The Campaign for the Ukraine, September 1943 - April 1944, begins with the &ldquo;Race to the Dnepr,&rdquo; as Army Group South rushed to a secure defensive position behind one of Europe&rsquo;s largest rivers.   Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.&#10;&#10;The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  &#10;Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.&#10;&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army&#10;&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles &#10;&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.&#10;&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including four 1-map games.&#10;&#10;Scenario 1 The Dnepr Battles (Grand Campaign Game, 4 maps, 63 turns, 26 Sept 1943 to 26 April 1944)&#10;Scenario 2 Die G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung (January Campaign Start, 4 maps, 27 turns, 26 Jan 44 to 26 April 44)&#10;Scenario 3 Red Thunder (April Campaign Start, 2 maps, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)&#10;Scenario 4 Manstein&rsquo;s Fire Brigades (Battle for Kiev, 1 map, 9 turns, 26 Dec 43 to 22 Jan 44)&#10;Scenario 5 II SS Pz Corps Strikes Back (Battle for Ternopol, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)&#10;Scenario 6 Rumanian Finish (Odessa and breaking into Rumania, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)&#10;Scenario 7 Hube&rsquo;s Pocket (The &ldquo;Moving Pocket&rdquo; Battle, 1 map, 8 turns, 22 Mar 44 to 15 Apr 44)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 Week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 km&#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10; Game Inventory:&#10;Four 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS rules booklet&#10;One Third Winter game rules booklet&#10;One Third Winter scenario booklet&#10;Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Portrays the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port city of Dieppe in 1942. The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.&#10;Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.&#10;&#10;The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.&#10; Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase&#10;1. Unit Transport&#10;2. Landing Check&#10;II. Operations Phase&#10;III. Commonwealth Action Phase&#10;1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.&#10;2. CW Actions&#10;3. Recovery&#10;IV. End of Turn Phase&#10;&#10;",

Seven hands are played with each initial meld requirement of &ldquo;sets&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;runs&rdquo; getting progressively harder each time. As the requirements go up so do the number of cards dealt.&#10;&#10;The game uses &ldquo;draw and discard&rdquo; mechanics as well as the ability for anyone in the game to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a card if the player whose turn it is does not want the card. The card is purchased by also taking a &ldquo;penalty card&rdquo; from the unused stock.&#10;&#10;An individual hand ends when one player goes out by either melding or &ldquo;laying off&rdquo; all of their cards in hand. All others count their hand point totals against them. At the end of the 7 rounds, the player with the least amount of total points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Broadhorns: Early Trade on the Mississippi players take the role of merchants based in St. Louis, financing cargo expeditions down the Mississippi River during the early part of the 19th century. The game is played over the course of a year through the varying seasons, each presenting its own challenge. During the game, the players will finance a number of trips. With each one they will need to obtain a boat (known as a broadhorn or flatboat) and purchase cargo. The player receives a higher return for their cargo the farther down the Mississippi they travel. Some of the cargo is perishable so time is of the essence. In addition, there are travelers willing to pay for passage down the Mississippi.&#10;&#10;The players begin the game in St. Louis with a small amount of gold. They will be able to afford only the smallest of three sizes of broadhorns for their first expedition; when they have earned more gold they will choose between smaller faster broadhorns and larger broadhorns with more cargo room. They will load their broadhorns with cargo from five available types: apples, flour, pork, fur and whiskey.  Apples, flour and pork are perishable and the players have a limited time to deliver them before they spoil. The players may stop at any town along the way and deliver their cargo and purchase more, the farther down the river they sell their cargo the greater the return. Players may also pick up travelers at various towns to earn additional gold by taking them to their destination.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, you need to bring the right things together to think outside the box, clear obstacles out of the way, and work together to stop the insane Professor Knix, the former mentor of the ChronoCops.&#10;&#10;The players explore different timelines, which can be opened up only gradually by successfully solving puzzles. Each timeline has different jump markers that players can travel to, some in the past or future, others in alternate realities. There are clues and objects hidden everywhere that the ChronoCops can collect and combine with the Chrono Decoder to use at a specific location. The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.&#10;&#10;In ChronoCops: Einsteins Relativit&auml;tskrise (&quot;Einstein's Relativity Crisis&quot;), Professor Knix wants to build a time paradoxomat to unify all timelines into a single mess, but the ChronoCops can't allow that to happen! To stop the mad professor, they need the help of Albert Einstein. But on their journey, the Cronks, Professor Knix's strange helpers, get in the way repeatedly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series from Black Box Games, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as a deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;Yomi: Round 2 is a standalone item that contains four characters (out of twenty) for the second edition of Yomi. With these characters, you can compete in 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, and solo modes, with each player in the game needing one character deck. The character decks in Yomi: Round 2 can also be played against those in Yomi: Round 1 or any of the individual character decks that comprise the second edition of Yomi. As for the characters, they are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Quince (challenging to play well)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Quince can play TWO cards in combat sometimes!&#10;    Quince can spin his combat card around after seeing what the opponent played! &#10;    Politicians are straightforward and truthful, but this deck is very tricky to play&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Onimaru (easy to understand)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Onimaru has attacks that can beat any other attacks in the game.&#10;    Onimaru relies on single hits for high damage, rather than big combos.&#10;    He can guard crush through an opponent's block. &#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Bal-Bas-Beta (very difficult to understand)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Put your opponent at long range and they can't even damage BBB, but BBB can damage them.&#10;    BBB can play relatively safely while dealing low damage, then shift to high damage plays to end the game. &#10;    Robots have a lot of moving parts, so it takes some thinking to understand BBB, but once you do he isn't as hard to play as it seems.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Troq (easy to understand)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Troq is simple and powerful.&#10;    Troq smash. &#10;    Troq throw 'u'.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The owner of that piece loses the round, and forfeits the offending piece. A new round begins, with the winner of the previous round playing first. Play continues until one player has no pieces when it is their turn to move; they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Batik Kid is essentially the same game, but instead of geometric shapes, the playing pieces are irregularly-shaped and represent sea creatures.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A solitaire board game that places the player in command of US submarines patroling the waters of the WWII Pacific Ocean. The goal is to sink enemy shipping, perform special missions, accumulate experience, and manage crew stress.&#10;&#10;The American submarine campaign in the Pacific during World War II was a major contributor to the ultimate defeat of Japan. During the war, American submarines comprised less than two percent of the U.S. Navy, but sank almost 60 percent of the Japanese merchant marine and more than 30 percent of Japan's navy, including eight aircraft carriers. Gato Leader moves the Leader series to Pacific waters, letting players lead a group of American submarines against the Empire of Japan. The core system of the game is built on U-Boat Leader and will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to get into the game quickly. A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you send your boats to the distant, better-defended, merchant-rich Japanese Home Waters, or do you hit the convoys supplying the far-flung Japanese bases? You can spend Special Operations Points to upgrade your submarines, concentrate intelligence resources, and send your submarines on special missions, such as mine-laying and hunting the Imperial Japanese Navy.&#10;&#10;When a patrolling submarine encounters an enemy force the action then shifts to the tactical display where the submarine tries to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to identify the ships and decide which ones are worth firing torpedoes or guns at. In addition to fighting the enemy, your submarines also have to deal with your own torpedo problems, including dud torpedoes and ones that turn on your submarine.&#10;&#10;Gato Leader includes the following U.S. Navy submarine types: &#10;S Class&#10;Narwhal Class&#10;Permit Class&#10;Salmon Class&#10;Tambor/Gar Class&#10;Gato/Balao/Tench Class&#10;&#10;Gato Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Pacific submarine war:&#10;&#10;Holding the Line: Submarine operations from Australia during 1942&#10;&#10;Against the Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1942&#10;&#10;Turning the Tide: Submarine operations from Australia and Pearl Harbor during 1943&#10;&#10;Setting Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1944 and 1945&#10;&#10;Component List:&#10;165 Full Color Cards&#10;352 Full Color Counters&#10;Tactical Display Sheet&#10;Ship Display Sheet&#10;Player Aid Sheet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game begins at the dawn of the 1920s, and the player-pilots aim to open the first air routes. To do this, they have at their disposal only a few military biplanes from the First World War, such as the Breguet XIV, recycled into dusty transport planes. These machines were often outdated and underpowered, forcing pilots to fly only on the shortest routes.  Then, thanks to the technological and commercial development, they will have at their disposal more and more efficient aircrafts, and will be able to venture on more and more important distances. Then will come the time to try to accomplish great firsts, such as crossing the Atlantic or crossing the Andes, with the ultimate goal of an aerial tour of the globe!&#10;&#10;The Air Postal game is built around a solid historical context highlighting the pilots of the time, men and women with incredible destinies, as well as the most famous civilian airplanes of the 20s and 30s... some of which are still flying today, nearly a century after having written the most beautiful pages of aviation history in the sky! Finally a game that deals with the peaceful, technological and heroic aspects of the world of aeronautics, and allows you to relive an epic that has become mythical: the fabulous flight of air transport.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game:&#10;To become a legendary pilot by accumulating the most GLORY POINTS. GLORY POINTS are earned during the game by flying to a STAGE CITY, completing an OBJECTIVE and achieving a world-first flight. In addition, at the end of the game players also earn GLORY POINTS based on the TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL of their aircraft and the amount of money they have.&#10;On his turn a player must perform one of the following three actions:&#10;&#10;     take an OBJECTIVE card and collect your INCOME.&#10;     improve its aircraft or change it.&#10;     Load your aircraft, refuel, fly and deliver passengers or goods.&#10;&#10;&#10;During a flight you roll the dice corresponding to the colors of the course. The length of the route, the fuel used, the endurance of the pilot and the reliability of the engine will allow you to cover the distances or not.&#10;&#10;",

He was able to trial 40 scenario proposals before settling on the set provided.

Which color action a character takes determines what dice they roll.&#10;&#10;Gameplay quickly moves back and forth between players. When a character is wounded, their actions get worse - but they also can have a chance to react to the attack by moving away or counterattacking. The character with control of the battle is the one who is currently taking actions with one of their characters. You lose control when your active character runs out of Actions. Characters can try to activate other friendly characters. This creates fast-paced back and forth gameplay, where control of the game passes back and forth, without getting bogged down in phases, upkeep, and accounting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the card game version of Aladdin's Dragons, but carries the same title as that game.&#10;&#10;In ancient and long forgotten times heroes were lured to Eastern lands by tales of bountiful treasure and powerful magic.  The treasure was found, not lying about, but in dangerous caves guarded by fierce dragons.  Those strong enough to gather the dragon&rsquo;s treasures had to compete among themselves for privileges that would smooth the way to the Caliph&rsquo;s palace.  On reaching the palace, the heroes found their way blocked by powerful guards.  Here they could pass the guards only with the right influence or, failing that, generous bribes.  Within the palace walls, the heroes bartered their hard won treasures for magical artifacts in a contest to see who could acquire the most artifacts and gain the praise of the Caliph.&#10;&#10;The Aladdin&rsquo;s Dragons Card Game (Morgenland Kartenspiel) is based on the award winning board game of the same name published by Rio Grande and Hans im Gl&uuml;ck.  The game consists of a double pack of cards and is played over a number of rounds, usually four or five in total.  Each round has three phases.  In phase one, new artifact and treasure cards are laid out.  In phase two, players play their hero cards into the various locations.  In phase three, the locations are resolved.&#10;&#10;",

Will you?&#10;&#10;Galenus is a worker placement game where you plan to do up to 6 actions and then decide when and how to resolve them. As such, some players can still be planning their actions while you are already resolving them. You can choose to recruit and treat patients &mdash; gaining knowledge in one of four humors &mdash; publish works based on that knowledge, acquire herbs to aid your work, rejuvenate in the baths, or adopt a new philosophy. At the end of the year you compete in medical contests expending your focus and knowledge to gain reputation. If you publish enough notable works or otherwise make the biggest impact on Galenus, you will earn his respect and enter his inner sanctum.&#10;&#10;",

Playing with fewer than five players requires at least some players to play multiple Houses.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, there are in fact only two scenarios provided in the box, one for the Third (or possibly Fourth) Succession War, starting in 3025, and one for the First, starting in 2786.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;For over 200 years, the five Successor States of the near-legendary Star League have warred among themselves for dominion over the whole Inner Sphere. There have been three Succession Wars to date, but no victor. The cost of war is high. The leaders of the Successor States must weigh each maneuver to see whether the gain in territory is worth the loss of 'Mechs. Only the most ruthless and brilliant leader will emerge as the next Star Lord.&#10;&#10;The Succession Wars is a 2- to 5-player game, where each player assumes the role of a House leader. All the most famous and infamous regiments of the BattleTech universe are at your command - the elite Kurita Sword of Light, the Davion Guards, and the mercenary unit Wolf's Dragoons. The game allows players to fight any Succession War, including the fourth, toward which the Inner Sphere is now building. The game system is simple and fast allowing strategy - not the rules - to be the deciding factor.&#10;&#10;",

When a player is able to reach a set number of influence, dependent on player count, and is able to retain it until the end of a round, they win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What is this game about?&#10;&#10;This game is played in turns. Each turn one player has to leave the room while the other players draw a card which shows a word. All remaining players have now to draw the word on the card on their drawing tables. They have about one minute (-&gt; sand timer) to do it. Before they call the person who left the room, they shuffle their drawings.&#10;This person has now one minute to guess the word from the drawings. If his/her first guess is right, he/she gets 2 points (= 2 wooden disks), otherwise only 1 point if his/her next two guesses were right. After 3 wrong guesses or after the given time elapsed, he/she gets nothing.&#10;Afterwards the guessing person has to give one drawing that he/she thinks was best 2 points (which will go to the owner of that picture). Then he/she has to assign the drawings to the other players. For each right guess the guessing person gets another point, otherwise the person who got another but her own drawing gets one point.&#10;You can play as long as you want. As there are two words on each card (a red one - easy, a blue one - difficult), you can play, for example, two rounds - a red one and a blue one.&#10;The player who got the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;&#10;As one person leaves the room, you can play this game with up to 8 players, although there are only 7 drawing tables.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1756, Frederick the Great launched a preemptive strike on Saxony and his archenemy Austria, sparking the Seven Years War and pitting the most powerful countries of Europe against the fledgling state of Prussia. Frederick's gamble nearly destroyed Prussia, but a few stunning victories over numerically superior forces, many delaying actions, British gold, and the timely death of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia saved Prussia and ensured Frederick's place in history as a great general.&#10;&#10;Prussia's Defiant Stand recreates the fierce struggle for mastery of Central Europe. Using the well-proven, card-driven action system the game showcases the importance of maneuver, fortresses, sieges, supply, and the potentially costly option of winter campaigning. The countries of Prussia, Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden are represented with units for leaders and artillery, heavy and light infantry, cavalry, Cossacks, and fortresses.&#10;&#10;Players will have difficult choices in managing their cards as some can be used for &quot;commands&quot; to move units, or used to modify combat odds.  The game mechanics reflect the period's focus on maneuver for position and a &quot;Frictions of War&quot; table beautifully models the indecisiveness of many allied leaders.  This explains more than anything how the small nation of Prussia was able to withstand the combined weight of the most powerful states of the day.  Frederick himself attributed Prussia's survival more to the timidity of allied commanders than to his own actions.&#10;&#10;This game is available now at www.worthingtongames.com&#10;&#10;",
