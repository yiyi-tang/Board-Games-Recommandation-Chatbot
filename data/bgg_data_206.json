    "Description": "In many ways, the famous Battle of Hastings in 1066 was just the beginning for the Normans, with many challenges awaiting them in the British Isles. In order to secure the Welsh border, William the Conqueror (recently crowned as King of England) established loyal Norman nobles in strongly garrisoned Earldoms along the frontier. What followed was decades of warfare and diplomacy as these &quot;Marcher Lords&quot; sought to extend their domains by subjugating the stubbornly independent Welsh.&#10; The Marcher Lords is a simulation of the Norman conquest of Wales in the 11th century on a grand strategic scale. Players assume command of Norman Earls or their Welsh foes, and make the decisions on a area movement map that will determine the course of the war. To be successful, the Normans will have to fortify their conquests by building castles and hold out against Welsh counterattacks, Viking raiders and various other threats.&#10;&#10;The 11 x 17&quot; map covers all of Wales. The 208 counters show Kings, Earls, knights, teulus, Vikings, Irish and more.&#10;&#10;The newer boxed version says it is 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;",

Can you add all 13 objects to your collection or will you be overcome by the evil within?&#10;&#10;The mini-campaign game uses a unique reveal mechanic that slowly reveals which type of ghost is haunting the object. Attentive investigators will learn the strengths and weaknesses of these ghosts and use that knowledge to better strategize.&#10;&#10;To win, you'll have to create dice combinations and manage your character's resources.&#10;&#10;The game includes 3 Characters which can be paired with 3 Skill cards for up to 9 different combinations.

You don&rsquo;t have to guess the exact index number (which would be, like, impossible). Instead, all you have to do is guess its proper place within the index. If you guess correctly, you win the card. If not, it passes to the next player to guess. The first person to accumulate 10 cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players alternate placing marbles on the board. Each player has a color of marbles, and the game is set-up to allow team-play. The first player or team to get five in a row on the entire 9x9 grid wins, but there is a twist: Every time a player places a marble they also turn any one of the game&rsquo;s eight outer boards 90&deg; in either direction. The ever-changing game board makes the game all the more challenging.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Pentago&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Multiplayer Pentago&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In DOG Cards, players need to create rows of number cards in front of them from 1 to 14. The first player to create two rows &mdash; or in a four-player game, the first team in which each teammate has created a row &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 104 number cards from 1-14 as well as 8 jokers and 8 thieves. To set up, each player receives a hand of seven or five cards (depending on the number of players) and a row of 13 cards is laid face up on the table; if any numbered card is in a position that matches its number &mdash; e.g., the number 2 in the second position &mdash; discard this card and replace it with another card from the deck. On a turn, a player takes one of five actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discard a number card, buy the card in this position from the face-up row, then draw a new card to fill this slot. A joker can buy any card.&#10;    Start a new row with a 1/11 card or a 13 card, or add to an existing row. (In the team game, you can play on your row or your teammate's.) You must add the cards in ascending numerical order, with a joker substituting for any non-14 card.&#10;    Swap a number card for a joker in someone's row, adding the joker to your hand.&#10;    Use the special power of a card, with the thief allowing you to steal a card from the end of someone's row, the 14 netting you any card in the discard pile, the 7 grabbing one of the seven top cards in the deck, and the 4 buying any of the first eight face-up cards.&#10;    Discard a card, then draw a new card from the top of the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you complete a row by placing the 14, place the other thirteen cards in the discard pile, with discards being shuffled to form a new deck if needed.&#10;&#10;",

They just peck at things randomly, making a mess of the house.&#10;&#10;The game consists of fifty number cards (0-49), seven penalty cards, and three reward cards. Adjust the number deck based on the player count, then deal cards evenly to all players. After receiving their cards, players order the cards in their hand however they wish, but then cannot change the order during play. Each round starts with the active player playing the leftmost or rightmost card in their hand, then everyone else does the same in clockwise order, again playing only their  leftmost or rightmost card. Whoever plays the highest valued card takes the trick, then leads to the next trick. If you take a trick with more than one chicken in it, you take a penalty card equal to the number of chickens you took; if you take a trick with exactly one pig in it, then you receive a reward card that gives you a bonus in the next round, such as playing your card face down or playing from any spot in your hand.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been played, players tally their scores: each chicken claimed in -1 point, penalty cards are -3 to -15 points, and reward cards are +3 points. Whoever took the last trick can choose to ignore all chickens they took or all penalty cards they took other than those taken on the last trick. If someone uses the 0 to beat the 49 in the last trick, then they can alternatively erase the entire score from a previous game.&#10;&#10;Play as many games as the number of players, then whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

It is a full box game.&#10;&#10;The Battle Manuver syster game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - often a different number for each player! - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Counter-Attack, and Rally, among others. Players may play as many of their cards up to 5 when it&rsquo;s their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards&hellip; and the turn is over.&#10;&#10;Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some large counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;Playing time for each battle is about 2 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages! Balance is excellent, and because of the use of cards and their random distribution each turn, no game is the same as any other. And the game is playable solitaire (with specific rules for doing so).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;Napoleon was, by 1813, the victim of his own success. His Grande Arm&eacute;e had ransacked most of Europe, but then the Prussians, Austrians, Russians, Swedes and others converged their armies, collectively known as the Sixth Coalition, around Leipzig in an attempt to annihilate Napoleon once and for all. The coalition commanders knew they had to approach cautiously. Napoleon had previously defeated each of those nations' armies, and had demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome unfavorable odds before. At Leipzig, however, Napoleon was heavily outnumbered, and the princes of Europe realized there might never be a better chance to vanquish him and finally end the Napoleonic Wars.&#10;&#10;Leipzig utilizes an all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the era while also simulating the unique aspectsof 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.&#10;&#10;In Leipzig a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that time. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Living well is the best revenge, and the best way to live well is by unlocking your inner power! In this dice game of strategy and chance inspired by the art of Steven Rhodes, will you aim to unleash your point-gaining abilities, or plan ahead with powerful dice manipulation? Gain points during an opponent's turn and watch their good fortune become another path to your success. Be the first to reach your full potential and transform from zero to hero!&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds. The player with the most points at the end of the 3rd round wins.&#10;&#10;PLAYING A ROUND&#10;Players take turns rolling and resolving their dice individually. This continues until a player has unlocked all 10 of their ability cards, or only one player is left in the round.&#10;&#10;ON YOUR TURN&#10;When it is your turn to roll, follows these steps in order:&#10;1. Roll Dice&#10;Begin your turn by rolling your player dice and Power dice together.&#10;Each of your opponents rolls their Power dice only.&#10;2. Opponents Score&#10;Each of your opponents gains 1 point for each of their Power dice that matches BOTH 1 of their unlocked (faceup) ability cards AND at least 1 of your dice (either your player dice or Power dice).&#10;3. Use Unlocked Abilities&#10;Next, you (and only you) may use any number of your unlocked (faceup)ability cards, in any order.&#10;4. Unlock New Abilities&#10;After you use your abilities, add up the numbers on only your player dice to determine your player dice total (and apply any modifiers from unlocked ability cards if desired).&#10;Then choose a combination of your locked (facedown) ability cards that add up exactly to your player dice total, and flip each of them faceup to unlock it.&#10;You must choose a combination of cards that are ALL locked. For example, if your #1 card is already unlocked, you may not choose any combination of cards that include a 1 (regardless of what you rolled).&#10;If you have no combination of locked cards that add up to your player dice total, you may not unlock any new cards and are instead out of the round.&#10;After unlocking cards, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of abilities:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Power Die Ability (#1-6): In order to use a Power die ability, you must roll the matching number on at least 1 of your Power dice.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Modify Player Dice Total (#7-9): Once you have unlocked one of these abilities, you may use it once per turn to modify your player dice total for unlocking new abilities (see Step 4). Do not change the die faces you rolled when modifying your total.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Extra Power Die (#10): Once you unlock your yellow Power die, you may roll it for the rest of the round.&#10;&#10;    1. Power Die: Gain points equal to 1 of your dice.&#10;    2. Power Die: Gain a reroll token.&#10;    3. Power Die: Steal 3 points from another player.&#10;    4. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your locked cards.&#10;    5. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your unlocked cards.&#10;    6. Power Die: Choose a player to lose half their points, rounded down.&#10;    7. You may subtract 1 from your roll.&#10;    8. You may add 1 to your roll.&#10;    9. You may remove any 1 die from your roll.&#10;    10. Gain an additional Power die.&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once a merchant fills his storage card, the game ends and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;During this time period, wares were transported in sailing ships, cogs or later holks. To reduce the risk of such a dangerous and uncertain journey, merchants formed so-called companies with one or several partners and thereby distributed valuable loads on several ships.&#10;&#10;In this game each player shares a Hansa cog with his left and right-hand neighbors. And there are risks to the voyage on all sides. Whether it be the feared pirates, the Vitalian Brotherhood, as they were known, wreaking havoc, whether storms rage over the North and Baltic Seas, or a harbor is blocked, a thousand things can cause difficulties in the life of an honorable merchant...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With the sun setting in the horizon, adventurers glide in on their flying carpets, searching for valuable treasures in palaces and bazaars. But steering a flying carpet to the proper destination is a lot trickier than it sounds. A strong wind can push a carpet off its course and into a desert, even though its intended destination was the camel bazaar. But maybe the magic lamp can still save the day?&#10;&#10;In Fliegende Teppiche (&quot;Flying Carpets&quot;), players try to guide their flying carpets to the most attractive destinations to score the most points &ndash; and by &quot;guide&quot; read &quot;toss&quot; as the carpets are actually cards. To set up the game, each player receives one carpet (two in a two-player game) and a set of genie cards. Shuffle the 52 destination cards.&#10;&#10;To set up a round, the active player turns over destination cards one by one and places them on the table as she desires. A card can't be placed more than the width of a card away from other cards, and at least 1 cm must separate adjacent cards. After revealing twelve cards, the player can swap cards or rearrange them to some degree. Then the player to her left &quot;flies&quot; his carpet onto the destination cards, followed by each other player with the active player going last. Once all carpets have flown, check to see who claims what:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a carpet lies on no destination cards (or is only underneath cards), return it to its owner, who receives nothing.&#10;    If a carpet is alone on top of one or more destination cards, the carpet's owner claims these cards, whether or not he wants to.&#10;    If more than one carpet is on a destination card, the players involved simultaneously reveal one of their genie cards. The player with the highest genie claims the destination card, then swaps that genie with the player who revealed the lowest genie.&#10;&#10;&#10;If four or more destination cards are still on the table (and they're not all deserts), fly the carpets again. Once fewer than four cards remain, compare the number of palaces held by each player (with magic lamps counting as a palace if a player chooses to do this). The player(s) with the most palaces scores five points, while the player(s) with the fewest loses five points. Remove palace and used lamp cards from play, then pass the destination deck to the next player, who lays out twelve more cards. Players toss carpets, etc.&#10;&#10;Once all players have laid out cards once (twice in a two-player game), the game ends. Players score additional points for claiming pairs of matching bazaars (5-7 points), sets of different adventure cards (1-15 points), and treasures (3 points), while losing five points for each desert claimed. Magic lamps can cancel a desert or be used as a wild card. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood Berets was Target Games first entry into the American gaming market. It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.&#10;&#10;This game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his &quot;scanner&quot; - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.&#10;&#10;Probably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 39 &amp; 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets. New scenarios, rules, items and pretorian stalkers.&#10;&#10;",

However, he knows that the brilliant detective, Sherlock Holmes, has caught on to his plans and is trying to sabotage them! Prepared for this possibility, he has hired all his henchmen through intermediaries and hidden himself among them. Who will be discovered first: Sherlock or Moriarty?&#10;&#10;Moriarty's Machinations is a party deduction game for 5-10 players. Each player starts with a unique role card, and which roles are in the game depends on how many players there are. Each role has different information about the other players.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Information Exchange&#10;At the start of the game, a script is read to inform each player of their privileged knowledge about some of the other players.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Heists&#10;Players take turns selecting crew members to go on Heists. If the majority of the table approves, then that crew goes on a Heist. Each crew member is given a set of Heist Cards. Cops can choose to Foil the Heist, and it only takes one cop to successfully do so. If no Cops Foil the Heist, then the points are awarded to the Robbers. Otherwise the Cops get the points.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Accusation&#10;Once one team has reached the required point total, the Accusation phase begins. Jack the Ripper and Inspector Lestrade reveal their roles publicly and try to guess who the leader of the opposing team is. If they guess correctly, their team wins. If they tie, then the win is based on Heist points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fantasy Pug Quest is a non-collectible card game for 1-5 players which lasts about 30-45 minutes for Heroes of age 10+ which will have to cooperate in order to defend their worlds from the conquest of the evil forces menacing them.&#10;&#10;Fantasy Pug Quest is inspired by the heroic atmospheres belonging to the first Dungeon &amp; Dragons edition and on tactical combats from JRPG like the very first episodes of Final Fantasy: the will to cooperate and the fraternity spirit which usually bonds adventurers are the main basis of our project!&#10;&#10;The players, the brave good-doers pugs struggling to bring peace among the animal races, will have to fight Monster and their Bosses in order to free the Worlds they live in, adapt to their rules, gather Energy to perform incredible Combos, pick up Treasures and share with their party in order to maximize their power and finally save the day!&#10;&#10;HOW THE GAME WORKS:&#10;A game of Fantasy Pug Quest is fast and easy!&#10;Starting from the youngest player and continuing clockwise, every player chooses an Hero Ability Card and the corresponding Hero Character Cards are placed on the Gaming Area starting from the Hero with the lowest Initiative value.&#10;&#10;Then every player draws as many Energy Cards as shown by the table and a World Card is revealed in order to know which special rules will apply to this game: the World Card also determines where the Monsters will spawn on the Gaming Area.&#10;&#10;Everything is ready for the fight and the creature with the highest Initiative value starts the first Turn of the first Round of combat. &#226;&#128;&#168;Heroes use their Energy Cards to perform as many Combos as they want during their Turns (chosen from those available from their Hero Ability Card); moreover they can perform up to 2 Actions chosen among: Move, Attack, Draw, Discard. The same Action can be performed more than once.&#10;&#10;Monsters follow the rules written on their own Cards: one random player will move them and make them perform their attacks during their Turns by simply following such rules.&#10;&#10;Are you afraid it is too hard for your small fluffy pug to fight all such scary Monsters? No panic! Your faithful doggo will find precious Treasures on its path and increase its Level in order to unlock new Combos, power up its attacks, cure its wounds and that will definitely help him/her save the day!&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;The fight goes on until the Heroes are defeated or the Monsters are; first scenario: the game ends.&#10;&#10;At the end of each scenario the brave pugs will meet a Pug Merchant so they can buy Treasures or trade their own Energy Cards or loot: collaboration is the key to survive!&#10;&#10;Second scenario: the players may go on to the second World and eventually to the third one, the Boss lair.&#10;&#10;Bosses have their own special abilities and will represent the hardest enemies for you proud doggos to defeat!&#10;&#10;Godspeed you, brave pugs! May the cards be ever in your favor!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Friedland 1807, is a simulation of The Battle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), a major engagement of the Napoleonic Wars between the armies of the French Empire commanded by Napoleon I and the armies of the Russian Empire led by Count von Bennigsen. Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.&#10;&#10;The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland&ndash;losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield&#10;&#10;Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #151, along with Vittoria.&#10;&#10;A page of errata was published in S&amp;T #153.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: approximately 1 hour&#10;Hex: approximately .6km&#10;Units: Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters, approximately 100 per game)&#10;One 28-page combined Vittoria/Friedland/Napoleonic Battles System rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-2 Hours&#10;&#10;Players will have to provide one 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

That era saw the Ottomans go from a small nation competing for survival in the Near East to a regional superpower, forming a state that lasted until the end of the First World War. To build their empire, the Ottomans conquered the remnant of the Byzantine Empire, won smashing victories over other Islamic states and twice pushed to the gates of Vienna.&#10;&#10;There are four factions in the game, each represented by a color: the Turks (Ottomans and others), the Holy League (mainly Catholic Europeans), the Orthodox (eastern Christians), and the Caliphate (a general term for the more established Islamic states). Within each faction there are individual nations. For example, the Turks include the Ottomans and the Seljuks.   Each player controls a &ldquo;core nationality&rdquo;; that is, one nationality within a faction of which he may never lose control. In the course of the game players may gain control of additional nationalities, some of which may be inimical to each other.&#10;&#10;Ottomans is played in a series of turns. Within each game turn, players pick stratagem markers (which allow players to take certain political and military actions), move their forces and engage in combat. A player, while representing an individual faction, may control forces from other factions. Players will find themselves sometimes attacking forces they control, while perhaps temporarily aligning themselves with an opponent, in order to reach their final goals. Throughout each game turn, players may use stratagem markers to gain military and political advantages as well as to undermine their foes. Players receive reinforcements depending on which regions they control.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to build the strongest empire. At the end of the game, players check to see which faction won the game. The player who contributed the most to that faction&rsquo;s victory wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Extracted from consimworld.com:&#10;&#10;IBEROS is an operational simulation of low to medium complexity of warfare in the Ancient Peninsula. It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.&#10;&#10;The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).&#10;&#10;Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Two Civil War Campaigns to take Richmond&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1861, Richmond, Virginia became the capital of the Confederacy.  Being a manufacturing powerhouse only 120 miles from Washington DC and the Confederate capital, it became the focus of Union attention. The threat of capture by Federal forces was constant.&#10;&#10;The Late Unpleasantness covers the two major attempts to capture the Confederate Capital City. Gates of Richmond covers the Seven Days Battles with Robert E Lee facing down George McClellan. If It Takes All Summer is Ulysses S Grant&rsquo;s overland campaign of 1864, which added the names of Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse and Cold Harbor to Civil War history.&#10;&#10;Each game stands alone, but share the majority of rules. Simple enough to learn and play in an evening, but enough twists and turns to make you want to replay it until it is worn.&#10;&#10;The maps use a point to point movement system, rather than hexes to simulate the campaigning over the road networks and river crossings, rather than mass movements cross country. Combat is integrated into the movement, making coordination of large bodies of troops difficult.&#10;&#10;The Gates of Richmond map covers the area from Richmond in the west to the White House on the Pamunkey, and from Mechanicsville south to Harrison&rsquo;s Landing. Key features such as Malvern Hill, Beaver Dam Creek, and the bridges over White Oak swamp and the Chickahominy are highlighted. Will the Union army fail to attack the Richmond works as a result of &ldquo;Prince John&rdquo; Magruder&rsquo;s antics?&#10;&#10;If It Takes All Summer covers most of Central Virginia, from Brandy Station and Culpeper to the Cold Harbor north east of Richmond. The Wilderness features prominently in the campaign with a special table to create some of the confusion as a result of fighting in this tangle.&#10;&#10;The basic units are divisions (a bit larger than usual for Civil War, but right in this case). Each unit is listed for strength and overall leadership/morale quality.  Stacks are hidden for limited intelligence. Corps and Army leaders are available to modify the die roll in an attack as well as to help coordinate attacks from more than a single stack.&#10;&#10;Sequence of play is straight forward with supply first.  Units out of supply suffer movement and combat penalties and those with a continued lack of supply will suffer attrition.  Confederate supply is a simple trace to either Richmond or a railroad, while the Union needs to relocate his base to keep his offensive moving.&#10;&#10;Units move, then attack as a part of the stack&rsquo;s movement. Terrain, strength and leadership are all die roll modifiers, in combat. Combat losses are in terms of strength points, but a third die is rolled to determine if the combat ends in a retreat or continues. If it continues, you count it up and do it again. (and possibly again) If your leaders are good enough, they may be able to break off a losing battle.&#10;&#10;Thrown into the mix are random events cards, but the game is not card driven. Each player can hold a hand of up to 10 cards, which can be played in nearly any combination and at any time (except during combat continuation). You use the cards to enhance your units or mess with the other player (ie. Grant steals a march - all Union units +2 MP this turn, or Rain - 1 left shift on all attacks) Others are one time events (Sedwick gets killed, Jackson falls asleep) that will ruin your perfect plan.&#10;&#10;Each game can be picked up and learned in under 30 minutes, and played entirely through in 4 hours or less. The cards, leaders and Wilderness/Magruder tables add a level of chrome and history to the games without making them difficult. Combined with the hidden strengths and dummy counters, no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 days (IITAS)&#10;            1 turn = 1/2 day(GOR)&#10;Map Scale: Point to point movement&#10;Unit Scale:  Divisions&#10;Players: 2 players&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Two 22 X 34 inch maps- One for each game&#10;Three Countersheets&#10;Two decks of 55 playing cards (1 for each game)&#10;Two Rulebooks (1 for each game) with examples of play&#10;Player Aid cards with Charts and Tables&#10;Three 6-sided dice&#10;One Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the early 20th Century, and the great museums of Europe and America compete for artifacts from around the world in order to fill their museums with the most prestigious exhibitions. In Artifact, players are archaeologists researching sites around the globe to search for artifacts, which are then shipped back to the museums in order to produce exhibitions that increase funding for future digs and earn prestige to win the game. Actions and funds are limited, however, and competition is fierce. Sometimes it is even necessary to deal on the black market in order to generate extra income or to acquire the one artifact that will complete a valuable exhibition.&#10;&#10;The player who earns the most prestige points through producing exhibitions and managing his budget best wins the game.&#10;&#10;Artifact is a rich gaming experience that provides players with many options to think about. In order to make it easier to learn the game, the rules have been separated into the Base Game, followed by rules for the two expansions that, when added, make up the Complete Game. The game can be played and enjoyed as the base game or by including any one of the expansions, but the complete game is highly recommended for experienced players.&#10;&#10;",

If you are the monster, then you want to do your best to avoid being killed and wound the other players in hopes to escape the mansion with your life. Play continues until either the monster is slain or all the other players declare that they have been crippled.&#10;&#10;",

Players join forces to rescue all the gophers by leading them through the tunnels before the water floods their dwelling, trying to gather as many foodstuff as possible during the flight. They can move any of the gophers in their turn, and collect items in their own cheek-poaches. The game ends when all the gophers have escaped from the burrow. Players are rewarded for speed, but the game is continued until there are any gophers under the ground. The player who collects the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;J&ouml;n a v&iacute;z! Menek&uuml;lni kell!

    "Description": "It's a balmy summer evening, and you're sitting with your family on the terrace, playing a few games. A perfect evening &mdash; that comes to a sudden end as a flock of mosquitos is lured by the light of your lamp!&#10;&#10;In Mosquitozzz, you have to fight off the attack of this swarm to lose as little of your blood as possible. To keep yourself from being stung, you cover yourself with many repellents, and if all else fails, you still have your hand ready to slay the attackers. How will you defend yourself against the mosquitos?&#10;&#10;Mosquitozzz can be played either competitively or co-operatively.&#10;&#10;- Game play&#10;&#10;Each player has his own set of cards. At the beginning of the game each player draws 5 cards from his deck.&#10;In the player's turn these cards can be used to avoid the attacks of the mosquitoes. Then they go on an individual discard pile. &#10;At the end of the turn the player chooses one new card from a set of stronger &quot;experience cards&quot;. This new card also goes on the player's individual discard pile. &#10;When the player runs out of cards in his deck he grabs his discard pile, shuffles the cards and builds a new deck.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn the player sends all remaining mosquito cards from his hand into the swarm and gives the lamp card to another player.&#10;The swarm follows the light and then attacks this player. Before the active player can defend himself against the swarm the other players have the opportunity to play one concealed card.&#10;They can either play a mosquito card which will reinforce the swarm or a defense card to support the active player (e.g. in the co-operative play).&#10;&#10;- &quot;Slap your luck&quot;&#10;&#10;While defending against the mosquitoes the player can play a card named &quot;Flache Hand&quot;. Normally you play at least one card of this kind in your turn.&#10;If you do, you take a number of markers inside your hands, shuffle them and slap them on the table.&#10;The markers show a living mosquito on one side and a dead mosquito on the other side - so this slap determines how many mosquitoes finally survive the player's defense.&#10;It is allowed to play multiple cards &quot;Flache Hand&quot; in a row.&#10;&#10;- Target of the game&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 drops of blood (wooden).&#10;&#10;Competitive play: &#10;The game ends when one player runs out of blood. The player who has the most blood drops left wins the game.&#10;&#10;Co-operative play: &#10;The players win the game as a team if no player runs out of blood until the deck of &quot;mosquito cards&quot; is empty.&#10;&#10;",

Rosencrans faced the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg. Both generals decided to fall on the enemy's left flank, and the confused battle that followed was one of the most desperate and savage of the Civil War. To recreate this fierce encounter, Murfreesboro provides an innovate brigade level simulation that reflects the difficulties involved in moving and fighting on battlefields of the period. Each counter occupies two hexes, and, coupled with rules for leadership, morale, routing, capturing artillery, exhaustion, and ammunition depletion, the game becomes a vivid representation of the actual event.&#10;&#10;",

They visit a bustling pirate tavern to seek out able bodied sailors to join their crew and fill their ragged ranks.  But Avast!  Other Captains who survived the battle have made port as well and are also looking to hire on crewmembers of their own.  Players must bid on sailors looking to sign to a new ship, carefully build out their crew, undermine the efforts of their fellow Captains, and avoid getting plundered themselves as they attempt to get their ship manned and ready to set sail.&#10;&#10;'All Hands on Deck!' is card game centered around an auction/trick taking mechanic.  Players blind bid to attempt to win sailors that are turned over on the top of the deck, using the numbered value of different cards they already have in their hand as bidding capital.  There are ten different pirate ranks in each of three 'suits' that represent pirates from three crews that returned to port without their Captain.  Players leverage the cards in their hand they don't need to try and win cards at auction that will help them build a winning hand.  They must be careful, however, as other players will use the many different action cards in the deck to try to influence the bidding process to their own ends, offering rum bribes, drowning available pirates, or even luring them to their demise with the deadly song of a mermaid!  The first player to build a winning pirate crew shouts 'ALL HANDS ON DECK!' and proves themselves the craftiest Captain in these waters.&#10;&#10;The game contains 108 cards, a Rulebook, and loads of pirate attitude.&#10;&#10;",

This card presents you with an action you must perform &ndash; a role to act out, a story to tell, an opinion to explain.&#10;    Draw a Curse card and give it to another player. &quot;You, bark like a dog whenever the player on your right reads a card!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;So where's the game? You must obey the Curses placed upon you at all times &ndash; and if someone notices that you're not barking or declaring eternal love or doing whatever else it is you're supposed to be doing, then that player rings the central bell and reveals you for a louse and a nogoodnik. As a penalty, you must turn the Curse card you violated face down. And while you might think that lifting a Curse is good, break three Curses and you're out of the game. Eventually only one person will remain, and this Curse-loving looney wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, they reveal a new card from the deck, then must reveal a card that matches either the creature or the color on this new card.

The true power, however, is a little further down the hierarchy in the different councils working under the City Council.&#10;&#10;In the card-driven game Councils &amp; Contracts, the players act as developers who try to push their own objectives &mdash; namely, receiving lucrative building contracts. Therefore, it's important for them to gain influence in every one of the councils since doing so is crucial for deciding the assignment of building contracts. Naturally, all of the developers are keen to gain that influence...&#10;&#10;Councils &amp; Contracts is the winner of the third game author's competition  &quot;Edition Kofferspiele&quot; organized by M&uuml;cke Spiele/Spielmaterial. In that competition the limitation was that the game fits in 11 x 7,5 x 3 cm metal box. Similar to Hart an der Grenze smuggling boxes.

There are then two extra actions per player and final scoring.&#10;&#10;Game variants:&#10;&#10;First/short game: Remove cards 29 - 37 and the promos.&#10;&#10;Mixed setup: After shuffling the A and B decks (separately) remove four cards from both of them.&#10;&#10;Gears council: Use the gears (brown) council like the 5 player council instructs but receive gears influence.&#10;&#10;",
