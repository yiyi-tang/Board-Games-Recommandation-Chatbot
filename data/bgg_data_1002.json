    "Description": "Nugget is a card game about building the best poker hand.&#10;&#10;Played over multiple rounds. Each round, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt one card. The rest of the cards are placed in the middle of the table in a face down stack. On a turn, a player draws either the top card from the deck or a card from the center (if any). When they draw a card from the deck, they may keep it or they may discard it to the center of the table. If they discard it, they must draw another card from the deck, which they must keep. This occurs until everyone has seven cards in hand. From those seven cards, each player builds their best five-card poker hand and is awarded points based on the strength of that poker hand. Whoever has the most points after multiple rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Nugget is in the same family as Sacramento and Bonanza.&#10;&#10;Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games.&#10;&#10;",

Anyone who rolls double 1 or 2 gets to roll again. There is an initial ante, and various spaces call for fines to be paid or bonuses received, either to/from the pot or other players. Spaces 12, 21, 25 and 28 make players go back to 5.&#10;&#10;Anyone who lands on 35 must take the Black Peter token and is out of the game, while other spaces give players a black token - and three black tokens also eliminate the player. Any player that runs out of money along the way is eliminated too. First player to 70 collects the pot.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tarabish, also known by its slang term Bish, is a trick-taking card game of complex rules derived from Belote, a game of the Jass family. The actual pronunciation of the name is &quot;tar-bish&quot;, even though it can be spelled &quot;tarabish&quot;. It is played primarily by the people of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in Canada, where it was brought in 1901 by a Lebanese immigrant George Shebib.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one or both teams accumulate 500 points or more. Points are counted at the end of each hand and both teams always count their points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;A Tarabish deck consists of a normal deck of playing cards with the 2 through 5 of each suit removed. In preparation for the hand the dealer shuffles the cards in the usual manner. When finished the person to the right of the dealer cuts the cards. The cut must leave at least four cards in each portion of the deck. Once the cards have been cut, no further shuffling is allowed.&#10;&#10;The 36 Tarabish cards are dealt in groups of three beginning to the left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise until all the cards are passed out. The four players look at their first six cards; the last three, called the kitty, remain face down until after the bid is complete and a trump suit has been chosen.&#10;&#10;Cards value&#10;The cards have a strict point value in trumps:&#10;&#10;J = 20 points&#10;9 = 14 points&#10;A = 11 points&#10;10 = 10 points&#10;K = 4 point&#10;Q = 3 point&#10;8 7 6 = no value&#10;The order and value in a non-trump suit are:&#10;&#10;A = 11 points&#10;10 = 10 points&#10;K = 4 points&#10;Q = 3 points&#10;J = 2 points&#10;9 8 7 6 = no value&#10;&#10;",

But beware! Every Hero is out only for themselves and will try to swindle the winnings away from you and the rest of your group. Build your lootstash and take what is yours and theirs before they do. Are you ambitious enough to be the Lewt Ninja!&#10;&#10;The game Lewt Ninja includes&#10;&#10;1 Monster Deck &ndash; The monster deck consists of 40 unique monsters and Boss monsters, players draw monster cards during the beginning of their turn.

Players will then play their Roll cards for the treasure dropped by the monster. If more than one loot card has been drawn players will roll only on one item at a time. Roll cards are placed face down and only revealed once everyone has played a card. The player with the highest roll card wins the treasure.&#10;&#10;Phase three, the Ninja phase is final phase of the round. During this phase players can play any of the System or Player Action cards to steal away treasure or protect treasure they have won during the round.

The counters indicate the resources to be gain at that location or restrictions/advantages conveyed by that location.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a set of counters of a unique colour, plus one unique counter that designates their homeworld. Players share a common set of resource tokens and a common deck comprising two types of card &ndash; basic technologies (of which there are 12 with each player starting at level 1 in each) and special technologies (which do not have levels &ndash; players either have them or they don&rsquo;t).&#10;&#10;Each turn has 8 Phases. Within a phase, the start player goes first and play proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;1. Draw Phase.  &#10;-  Each player draws 2 cards from the Tech Deck.&#10;&#10;2. Trade Phase&#10;-  Players may trade/gift Tech cards and resource tokens, as well as make promises and alliances. &#10;-  The player with the highest trade level may steal a random card from any target opponents hand. &#10;-  The player with the highest diplomacy level may declare one target player as an ally. The Ally may not jump fleets onto the diplomat&rsquo;s currently occupied spaces.&#10;&#10;3. Tech Phase&#10;-  Each player discards one Tech Card from their Hand and increases their level in that tech by one.  Alternatively, a player may discard one Special Tech Card from their hand and gain that special ability. &#10;-  Any player then may discard 2 cards of the same type to increase their level in that tech by one.&#10;&#10;4. Mine Phase&#10;-  Each player gains Resource Tokens (RT) for star fields, clusters and homeworlds occupied, and for Tech cards discarded.  The RT gained is modified by the manufacturing level of the player.&#10;&#10;5. Build Phase&#10;-  Players may buy fleets. A fleet costs 4 plus your attack and defence levels minus your miniaturization level. All fleets start stacked on your homeworld.&#10;&#10;6. Jump Phase&#10;-  All movement is simultaneous. All players must write movement (jump) orders which are revealed at the same time. An order moves 1 fleet or a stack of fleets you control from one space to another space. Players must include the start and finish coordinates as well as the number of Fleets jumping in the Jump Order. Jump distance and fleet size is dictated by jump level and logistics level&#10;&#10;7. Fight Phase&#10;-  If 2 or more opposing fleets occupy the same space, there will be combat until only one side remains. Attack order is determined by Initiative level and the damage delivered is based on fleet size, attack level and defence level of the opposing fleet.&#10;&#10;8. Final Phase&#10;-  Max hand size is 3 + the player&rsquo;s research level. All players discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by occupying all opponents&rsquo; Homeworlds at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the apocalypse, the Earth is all but destroyed, save for the last city. The few remaining humans who were neither good enough for Heaven nor evil enough for Hell are stuck in limbo, held on Earth. Angels and Demons wage war against each other across the universe, trying to gain control where they can. They care not for the humans in limbo, for their souls won&rsquo;t ever be released to them. As the Earth is removed of most humans, nature has decided to take back what is left, to consume the land with their plants once more.&#10;&#10;The final Battle for earth begins!&#10;&#10;&#10;This is a strategy game for 2 - 5 players, where you build your base, gain resources, and send units to build or attack.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on a 10 by 10 grid, with each player choosing a race, then placing them at the relevant starting location (dependent on the number of players). Each player then takes it in turns to spawn units, take two actions for each unit (move, build or attack), constructing buildings that will either give them money (for building and upgrades), weapon tokens (for attacking and defending) for creating more units (for making actions). Players can build in an empty space, so long as they have the resources, however if the space has an enemy building, they can attack+build (redemption!) to create a building of one level higher than that attacked (for the cost of a lower level building). After each player has taken a turn, you roll for obstacles (Meteorites, etc) which can land anywhere and destroy buildings, whilst also being &quot;Redeemed&quot; by players to give them an easy higher level building.&#10;&#10;Each race has their own goal, such as to own the majority of the board, along with a unique ability that aids them in this goal.&#10;&#10;Once a player has reached this goal, they win the game after one more round.&#10;&#10;",

Furious, muscular and bedecked with spiky bits, he is posed in an appropriately aggressive manner, both of his sharply toothed maws likely shrieking unintelligible threats at whichever poor opponent is in the way. Each of his four (count &lsquo;em!) hands is ready to kill, with metal gloves and a spiked ball among the turmoil. There&rsquo;s even space for some Skaven symbols on his armour.&#10;&#10;This resin kit comprises 10 components, and includes two 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&#10;&#10;",

Bang! Crash!&rsquo; way, but slowly and silently&hellip;&#10;Unknown to most they are secretly replacing us with exact copies of the people we know.&#10;&#10;NOW ANYONE COULD BE AN ALiEN!&#10;&#10;Fortunately, it has become apparent that the copies take time to fully assimilate our thoughts and memories.&#10;Following extensive background research and testimonies from family, friends and acquaintances the authorities have compiled a set of questions with verified responses designed to expose the galactic imposters.&#10;&#10;Mr Doombar, Mrs Mayhem, Lord Uppercrust, Professor Banana, Lady Toff, Mrs Ditch, Doctor Butt, Harry, Otto, Norma and many others are all under suspicion.&#10;Everyone will be asked one critical question - failure to respond with the established answer will reveal the ALiEN within!&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Are You An ALiEN?&rsquo; is a card game for 2-6 players.&#10;The deck is made up of 180 cards. On each turn players have a simple choice;- draw a number of cards from the deck or select a card belonging to another player and ask them a question.&#10;As a human Subject suspected of being an ALiEN you must try to answer your question correctly.&#10;However, you will also assume the role of an interrogation Agent with the 'ALiEN Imposter Detection Unit'.&#10;In all, the cards feature over 300 different types of question and answer, after a quick look you will have to remember all the information on your drawn card(s) before placing them face-down in front of you. The more details you can remember the greater the chance of answering your question correctly.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, you must either form a coalition with 1-2 other players to stomp out the traitors, or you can scheme against everyone and seize power in the vacuum.&#10;&#10;Each plot features five rounds, and during each round a faction plays one card face down, usually a power card featuring boots for Bolsheviks or fists for Mensheviks. One card is swept away into the State Secrets folder to be revealed at the end of the plot and the remaining cards are simultaneously revealed. After five rounds are completed, the State Secrets folder is opened and all cards are resolved. If boots outnumber fists, the Bolsheviks win the plot. If fists outnumber boots, then the Mensheviks win the plot. The losers forfeit their supporters to the corresponding winners in the tableau and another plot begins.&#10;&#10;During the rounds, players may choose to play a leader card at any time to promote a player from the Mensheviks to the Bolsheviks. You can play a leader from your faction to increase your chances of being in the winning coalition, or you can play a leader from another faction giving players the chance to ruin the counter-revolutionary plots of their friends.&#10;&#10;Commies!

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In May 1918, German troops occupied Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. All of the Central Powers &ndash; even the Bulgarians &ndash; made claims on at least some of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet as war reparations, as did the newly-independent Ukraine. The German Navy intended to man the best ships with Turkish crews backed by German &quot;advisors&quot; and send them to protect the Dardanelles. Only one ship, the dreadnought Volya, would ever sail under a Central Powers flag (on a single test cruise with a German crew), but the Allies fretted over the appearance of the former Russian ships outside the Turkish Straits.&#10;&#10;The New Year's 2014 Golden Journal includes 25 new laser-cut, mounted, scorchless and sootless pieces for the Turkish Black Sea Fleet: 15 &quot;long&quot; ship pieces, 9 square ones, and a seaplane. And we have some scenarios for them, too.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;At the end of the Great War, the German High Seas Fleet was interned at Scapa Flow at the northern tip of Scotland as a guarantee of the November 11th Armistice. Within weeks, French leaders were demanding that at least a portion of the ships, if not all of them, be handed over to France as compensation for the destruction wrought on French soil during the war. The discussions came to an end in June 1919, when the German sailors still aboard the ships scuttled them rather than see them flying enemy flags or worse, displayed in victory celebrations.&#10;&#10;Victoire is a variant for U.S. Navy Plan Gold, in which the French have successfully received the most extreme of their demands: all of the most modern German battleships, battle cruisers and light cruisers. Newly refitted and ready for action, these vessels join the French fleet projecting the Republic&rsquo;s naval power into the Caribbean basin. With the addition of 14 formerly German dreadnoughts and six cruisers, the Marine Nationale is now a match for the U.S. Navy. The Monroe Doctrine is about to become a dead letter.&#10;&#10;The Harvest 2015 Golden Journal includes twenty new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these ships in Great War at Sea format. They bear French livery and new names, and revised artwork. It&rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.&#10;&#10;",

Seemingly an insane proposition, the fleet had a very real purpose: to secure the lower reaches of the Baltic Sea in the event of a war between Poland and the Soviet Union in which Germany remained neutral while Britain and France provided materiel and supplies but did not commit their own naval forces to keeping the sea lanes open. That seemed the most likely scenario for a future war, and a strong Polish Navy would be vital to victory.&#10;&#10;There are 20 one-inch-long Polish ship pieces included. And you even get a couple of scenarios for Second World War at Sea: Sea of Iron to study this Polish war plan.&#10;&#10;",

To support the powerful but immobile big guns, Finnish strategy called for small, armored coast-defense ships that could slip between the islands and torpedo-armed ships to dart out and sink attacking enemy warships.&#10;&#10;That never came to pass: the Finns built two top-heavy armored gunboats which they called &ldquo;battleships,&rdquo; but never funded the third member of the class. A handful of motor torpedo boats would be fielded during the Second World War, but plans to build or buy a group of six small destroyers repeatedly failed to win Parliamentary approval.&#10;&#10;The Daylight Savings 2017 Golden Journal comes with 20 new laser-cut and mounted playing pieces representing Finland's Fantasy Fleet composed of these new ships, plus a couple of new Sea of Iron scenarios for their use.&#10;&#10;",

There are three types of &quot;units&quot; a player can gain points in and a player scores their lowest of these three, so they must try to maximize each unit type equally in order to win. Random effects through the drawing of event cards will also occur. While each player has little control over which credits and penalties they receive in the game, the overall purpose of The Media Game is educational. It was designed for employees of the CBC Sales department as a way to make them familiar with company terminology, policies, and marketing strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Naturally, the sneaky duo will try to influence the outcome of the contests, while Zeus keeps a watchful eye on their activities.&#10;&#10;Wager of the Gods is unique in that players will simultaneously need to manage three distinct races, each with its own rigors and pitfalls.

A roll of two six sided dice, potentially modified by a roll of the ten sided &quot;Third Die&quot;, produces a number of hits for the half inning being played.&#10;&#10;Then, for each hit, a percentile roll versus the batting team's Conversion Percentage is made determining whether that hit produces a run.&#10;&#10;Repeating this process for each half inning, individual games can be played in minutes, and seasons (or post-seasons) in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with a rulebook and the 12 seasons of the All American Girls League, 1943-54.&#10;&#10;As well as the complete history of both the National and American Major Leagues, the following yearbooks are also available: &#10;American Association, 1946, 1947 and 1948&#10;Big South League 1996 and 1997&#10;Canadian Baseball League 2003&#10;Dixie Association 1971&#10;Federal League 1914 and 1915&#10;Inter American League 1979&#10;International League 1965 and 1966&#10;Lone Star League 1977&#10;Mexican League 1955&#10;National Association 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874 and 1875&#10;North American League 2011 and 2012&#10;Pacific Coast League 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957&#10;Pecos League 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016&#10;South Atlantic League 1963&#10;South Coast League 2007&#10;Texas League 1950, 1951 and 1952&#10;&#10;",

Each SFB box comes with 600 cards (6 categories with 100 cards each), a timer, die, and a whole lot of love and bad jokes.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is incredibly simple- a team/player rolls the die, and then is asked a question from the corresponding deck. If they answer correctly, they keep the card and roll again. If they get it wrong, it's the next person/team's turn. First team to get one card in each category is the winner!

    "Description": "OVERVIEW&#10;The GUVNOR is a gangster themed card trading game. Players trade crime cards simultaneously in order to gain RESPECT from the other players. The first player to win 30 RESPECT points wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Players are dealt nine random CRIME cards at the start of the game and seven REPECT points. The dealer starts the trading by shouting 'LET'S DO BUSINESS' after which all players may trade cards face down across the table. The first player to collect nine identical CRIME cards shouts 'AVE SOME OF THAT!' to win the round. The winner of the round becomes The GUVNOR and receives a win bonus (PROFIT). All the other players then pay The GUVNOR one RESPECT point from their pile. Any players caught RED HANDED (i.e. they have six or more identical CRIME cards in their hand) pay a penalty. The GUVNOR then takes a DECREE card from a wild deck - it may effect them directly or it may be used to hindered/help another player. The CRIME cards are then returned, shuffled and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ACNOS: acknowledge the potential&#10;&#10;ACNOS is a competitive abstract strategy game for two players. In ACNOS, players manipulate armies of shapes within a standard 8x8 chessboard with a win condition of either capturing the opponent&rsquo;s treasure square, or depriving the opponent of a legal move.&#10;&#10;There are 24 pieces per side in ACNOS, each of which has unique move sets determined by the arrows shown on their face. Throughout the game, pieces get placed on the board, moved according to their arrows, flipped to produce mirror images, rotated in multiples of 90 degrees, or merged to create more powerful shapes. During setup, players secretly choose a treasure square and 8 pieces to surround it. Each turn, players choose to activate one of three abilities (place a new piece on the board under your control, build a blockade to remove a square from the board, or declare a merge between two pieces to make a stack), then choose two different pieces under their control and move them. Initially, pieces are limited to 2 shapes per merge stack, but when a piece makes it to the other side of the board, it can teleport home by moving off the opponents back rank, thereby deepening its merge potential by one extra piece.&#10;&#10;ACNOS is extremely complex (over 10^35 legal setups, 36 million possible states per square, over 200 thousand legal first moves on average), and rewards deep strategic thinking, careful planning, and tactical calculations. Acknowledge the potential, and capture your opponent&rsquo;s treasure! NOTE: For casual play, reserve pieces are drawn randomly from a bag, with each &ldquo;next piece&rdquo; being public information. For tournaments, players determine the order of reserve pieces during setup phase, and the entire order becomes public information when the veil is lifted.&#10;&#10;",

The stones and the pentacles each come in three colors: crimson, cream, and cobalt. Stone placement follows this order, and players take turns placing the next color of stone on the board. There are only two rules to placement: no stone may be placed on a pentacle of its own color, and no two stones of the same color may be placed next to one another.&#10;&#10;Stones on pentacles sharing an interface are connected. Connected stones, enclosing at least one pentacle, are a loop. A loop that encloses at least one pentacle of each color is a shrine. The player to complete the first shrine wins the game.&#10;&#10;Shrine is distinct from classic stone-placing games in that players become decoupled from colors. A winning structure will usually include stones laid by both players, but the winner is the one who places the final stone. This leads to an interesting dilemma: how much do I cooperate with my opponent to build this shrine?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once upon a time, Ali Baba, a poor lumberjack from Persia, discovered a hidden treasure belonging to a forty thieves gang. Emeralds, diamonds, rubies, precious objects&hellip; GOLD! All was hidden in a cave which was open and sealed magically. To open the cave they prounounced the words &ldquo;Open Sesame!&rdquo; and, to seal it, &ldquo;Close sesame!&rdquo;. While the greedy thieves were out, Ali Baba entered the caved and took some of their treasures. Ali Baba&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s Cassim, dishonest and usurer, discovered the sudden wealth of his sibling and followed him to the cave, where he entered unseen. Fooled by his own greed and excitement to so many treasures, Cassim forgot the magic words and was found by the thieves, who carved him up due to his temerity. Now you will play as Ali and Cassim and, with your loyal servant Moxana&rsquo;s help, will get the highest number of treasures in The Magic Cave without being noticed by the Forty Thieves.&#10;&#10;Take all the components from the box and leave the box in the center of the table. Put inside the box all 20 small treasure cards and close it. Place uniformally all 40 big treasure cards surrounding the game box. Deal to each player 1 character card, 2 Moxana cards of the same color and 3 carrots to each player. The 20 treasure tokens have the same treasure pictures as the 40 large tokens. On the small tokens there is a treasure on each side; on the large tokens there is a treasure on one side and the drawing of a thief on the other.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round one player has the open box at least 5 seconds (min), and next he close the box. The box does not reopen until the end of the round. In your turn, you can play as Ali (picking up as much large treasures as pointing to the dice, treasures that have to be visible face up inside the box). If you are wrong, you will deduct points. If you don't remember more of the treasures that are in the box face up, you play as Cassim. Cassim flips the big treasures to hinder the other players. If you play as Cassim, you can't play as Ali until the next round. The round ends when everyone has played as Cassim. Successful and failed treasures are checked.&#10;&#10;Treasures and special characters help the players to get more points or subtracting rival's points.&#10;&#10;After 4 rounds, the player who earns more points with the treasures wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Cuenta la historia que Al&iacute; Bab&aacute;, un pobre le&ntilde;ador de Persia, descubre el tesoro oculto de una banda de 40 ladrones. Esmeraldas, diamantes, rubies, objetos preciados,...&iexcl;ORO!, todo lo esconden en una cueva que abren y cierran m&aacute;gicamente. Para abrir la cueva pronuncian las  palabras &ldquo;&Aacute;brete, S&eacute;samo!&rdquo;, y para cerrarla, &ldquo;&iexcl;Ci&eacute;rrate, S&eacute;samo!  En ausencia de los &aacute;varos ladrones, Al&iacute; Bab&aacute; entra en la cueva m&aacute;gica y se lleva algunos tesoros.&#10;Cassim, el hermano deshonesto y usurero de Al&iacute; Bab&aacute;, descubre la repentina riqueza de su hermano y lo sigue hasta la cueva, en la que entra a escondidas. En su codicia y nerviosismo ante tantos tesoros, Cassim olvida las palabras m&aacute;gicas y los ladrones lo encuentran y lo descuartizan por su osad&iacute;a. Ponte en la piel de Ali y Cassim y, con la ayuda de la leal sierva Moxana, consigue el mayor n&uacute;mero de tesoros de La Cueva M&aacute;gica sin alertar a los 40 ladrones.&#10;&#10;Saca todos los componentes de la caja y colocar &eacute;sta en el centro de la mesa. Introduce en la caja las 20 fichas de tesoro peque&ntilde;as y ci&eacute;rrala. Coloca las 40 fichas de tesoro grandes alrededor de la caja del juego, repartidas de forma homog&eacute;nea. Reparte una ficha de personaje a cada jugador, dos fichas de Moxana del mismo color y 3 zanahorias. Las 20 fichas de tesoro tienen los mismos dibujos de tesoro que hay en las 40 fichas grandes. En las fichas peque&ntilde;as hay un tesoro en cada lado, en las fichas grandes hay un tesoro por un lado y el dibujo de un ladr&oacute;n por el otro.&#10;&#10;Hay 4 rondas. Al principio de la ronda un jugador tendr&aacute; la caja abierta m&iacute;nimo 5 segundos. La caja no se volver&aacute; a abrir hasta el final de la ronda. Por turnos, los jugadores jugar&aacute;n como Al&iacute; (cogiendo tanto tesoros como indique el dado, tesoros que tienen que est&aacute;r visibles boca arriba dentro de la caja), si se confunde restar&aacute; puntos. Si no se acuerdan de los tesoros que hay en la caja boca arriba, los jugadores juegan como Cassim. Cassim da la vuelta a los tesoros grandes para molestar a los otros jugadores. Si juegan como Cassim ya no pueden jugar como Al&iacute; hasta la siguiente ronda. La ronda termina cuando todos hayan jugado como Cassim. Se comprueban los tesoros acertados y los fallados.&#10;&#10;Tesoros y personajes especiales ayudan a los jugadores a conseguir m&aacute;s puntos o quit&aacute;rselos a sus rivales.&#10;&#10;Gana el jugador que consiga m&aacute;s puntos con los tesoros.&#10;&#10;",
