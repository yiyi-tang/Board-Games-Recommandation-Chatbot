Easy to learn, interesting to discover, challenging to master, coated in nice comic-based design and tested on humans.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In late December 1944, the American 7th Army was overextended throughout the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, covering for units drawn northwards towards the vicious fighting around Bastogne. Sensing this weakness, German High Command launched Operation NORDWIND to retake Alsace and the French city of Strasbourg.&#10;&#10;In early January 1945, after several unsuccessful thrusts, the Germans committed key panzer reserves in the form of Panzer-Division 21 and Panzergrenadier-Division 25, targeting the neighboring French villages of Hatten and Rittershoffen. The initial attack fell on Hatten and nearby Maginot Line positions manned by the inexperienced doughboys of the 42nd &ldquo;Rainbow&rdquo; Infantry Division. After a brief but valiant defense, they were relieved by two veteran infantry battalions from the 79th &ldquo;Cross of Lorraine&rdquo; Infantry Division, whose soldiers slowed the German advance but in turn, became surrounded in the villages. Tankers from the 14th Armored Division then engaged the German panzers head-on in an attempt to relieve the infantry.&#10;&#10;The eight scenarios and two Campaign Games in Hatten in Flames focus on the first five days of the fighting inside of Hatten, as panzer units sought to break through to the open terrain of Alsace that lay beyond Hatten and Rittershoffen. These capture the portion of the battle where an intense combined-arms struggle between a few handfuls of infantry companies and tank platoons of both sides played out on a daily basis in this small French village. In rendering these encounters, the Hatten in Flames CGs provide players with all the challenging options and decisions of bigger CGs while remaining much more manageable than most. Campaign game mechanics are based on tried-and-true systems used in previous ASL historical modules.&#10;&#10;Hatten in Flames contains:&#10;&#10;     one box and lid&#10;     one 30&quot; x 32&quot; map&#10;     two countersheets&#10;     Chapter HF rules&#10;     eight ASL scenarios&#10;     two Campaign Games&#10;     two Chapter Dividers&#10;&#10;&#10;Hatten in Flames is not a complete game; ownership of the Advanced Squad Leader Rule Book, BEYOND VALOR, and YANKS is required for play.&#10;&#10;(from MMP's website)&#10;&#10;",

Towering several stories over its smaller brethren, this creature shakes the ground wherever it goes, causing small localized earthquakes in its wake. Near impervious to small arms fire, wounds dealt to it are regenerated almost instantly. It has been noted that when it eats its victims, its alien healing power actually speeds up, knitting even the most terrible wounds back together.&#10;&#10;At range, it can project a huge ball of acid which if it hits even a target that is dug in, will melt them to little more than a puddle of matter. When it gets in close, it will unleash a screech, killing its initial enemies and then rush in with surprising speed for a creature of its size. Its gigantic claws and long tail are able to tear tanks and infantry to pieces in equal measure. Luckily, only a handful of such creatures found in the largest xenomorph hives, has ever been catalogued by human scientists.&#10;&#10;Shipping of this product starts 16th of April 2018.&#10;&#10;Box contains:&#10;&#10;1x multipart resin Alien King model&#10;&#10;1x &quot;The Bug Hunt Gamemode&quot; booklet in English language&#10;&#10;",

Risen from the ranks of the Elite, often having several xenomorph Queen kills in their tally, his job is to oversee and train Youngbloods, administer and watch over Hunts and lead the clan in off-world matters in the matriarch&rsquo;s stead. A single Elder can be found in command of an entire mothership of yautja. It is he that determines the location and targets for a Hunt.&#10;&#10;Should there be Youngbloods on board who need to prove themselves, he will watch the ritual from the command station to confirm success or failure of the participants. Such a position is highly sought, and should an elder die, only the strongest and most honored of the Elite may vie for the place of elder.&#10;&#10;When  an  Elder  enters  battle,  he  will  be  equipped  with  the  finest  weapons  from  the  armoury.  Each  one  has  cultivated a unique combat style over countless years, and to come face-to-face with a yautja Elder most likely means a swift death and a new skull for the Elder&rsquo;s trophy wall.&#10;&#10;Set contains:&#10;&#10;3x 32mm scaled miniatures&#10;    3x ping tokens&#10;    3x stat cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Finn Bjelke's Popquiz Boardgames is a trivia game based on the popular NRK(Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation)-program, where you can really show off your knowledge of music. Maybe you know the name of all the songs on the radio, and all the band members, but do you know much about pop? Do you know who warmed up for Rolling Stones the first time they played in Oslo, or which Ray Charles song Kayne West has sampled?&#10;&#10;After a million conversations about music among your friends, you now want to prove that it is you who is the biggest music lover. Now all the hours with LP-records, worn CD's and music streaming finally counts. Pop music is the soundtrack of life, and here the music is the focus.&#10;&#10;Somebody will say that you don't need to know who was the drummer in The Beatles before Ringo Starr, or what has Elvis Presleys middle name. They can't be more wrong. Without this essential knowledge, you never will become the greatest in PopQuiz!&#10;&#10;The d10 dice guides you fast to the correct music category. Now you must show what you know! Answer correctly, you move closer to the goal. Do you answer incorrectly, you can now enjoy that you have learned something more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Tyrant must be eliminated! In Matem o Rei, you must kill the King by moving your assassin among the guests of the masquerade. Using poisons, daggers, and bombs, you need to be the first to depose the Despot. But beware, the other players may stop you by changing the direction of the dance!&#10;&#10;Matem o Rei contains 48 cards, 17 masks and a board. During their turns, the players can use their cards to move the guests of the same color and same mask around the board, making a way to the King or hindering other players. Knowing which cards to keep, which to use and which to discard can be the difference in the victory. Players can also attempt to murder the King. But beware! Each player also has a bribed Guard, which can protect the King.&#10;&#10;Players don't know each others identity, neither of the Guards. Use this to your advantage, moving your assassin in secret until the right time. You can also change your mask or weapon better suit your strategy.&#10;&#10;The first player to assassinate the King wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player will have a political alliance with one of nine political parties and try to score points based on the laws the players pass throughout the game. The player at the end of the game with the strongest political party becomes the first President of the country.&#10;&#10;After dealing out cards, players will draw another card on their turn, choose between the two cards for what laws they want to pass, and arguing will commence. The twist for Boardgamelandia's new Constitution though states that every bill must pass. It is up to the players to determine which part of the bill will go through through every political means possible&#10;&#10;In this tiny 18 card game, players will constantly have to defend their political beliefs in 18 different categories on cards that are usable in four different ways. But, if you see the laws are not going your way, you may decide to change political parties mid way through the game. Will you represent The Mind of the Republic with dignity, will you argue for the Agricolarians and their ways of life, or are you a member of the Secret Fascists and plotting world domination.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However, other events represent the Traitor's ability to remain hidden &ndash; but as soon as his luck runs out, he is exposed as an Englishman and his clan&rsquo;s claim to the throne is lost.

Landing on an &quot;X&quot; on the board will draw a sketchy card which changes how the other players must draw. From non-dominant hand to blind draw, sketchy cards always draw a laugh.&#10;&#10;First one across the finish wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You will have to control your bots, make them fight, move and hack the enemy bots in order to emerge victorious from the fight.&#10;&#10;The game is played out as a succession of rounds during which the active player can play &quot;routines&quot; cards and / or activate his driver.&#10;&#10;The &quot;routines&quot; cards are one of the original points of the game. They represent both the possibilities of actions of your bots and the defense programs of your pilot. If you want to activate your bots it will be necessary to play a card and to realize the action described on this one. If your pilot takes damage, you will need to discard a card.&#10;&#10;The different bots you have under your control have special abilities. It's up to you to use them wisely to dominate your opponents in the arena.&#10;&#10;The RoninBot has advanced combat software, Jujitsu 2.0, which allows it to attack multiple opponents at once.&#10;&#10;The PushBot can move other Bots thanks to its Tesla pistons, but their programming prevents them from pushing a Pilot.&#10;&#10;The SipderBot is equipped with an electromagnetic web allowing it to hack remotely.&#10;&#10;The combat and hacking actions are resolved by a die roll. &#10;A bot that suffers a success to a combat roll is destroyed and removed from the arena. A pilot who suffers a success to a combat roll must discard a &quot;routine&quot; card.&#10;&#10;A bot or terminal changes sides when hacked. The successful hacker places a possession marker of his color on the base of the hacked bot or terminal.&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, the active player draws 2 &quot;routine&quot; cards. When a player finishes his deck of &quot;routine&quot; cards the game ends.&#10;&#10;In order to determine the winner, players score points in the game and at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each terminal under your possession at the beginning of your turn grants you a victory point. Each bot under your possession, at the end of the game, grants you a victory point.&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, the active player draws 2 &quot;routine&quot; cards.

Each bot under your possession, at the end of the game, grants you a victory point.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest number of victory points wins the game.

If the dice lands out of the box you lose the ball to the other player for a throw-in.&#10;&#10;Shots at goal must be defended by the goalie by rolling the dice. If the goalie rolls a 1 or 2 the ball is lost to a corner and the attacking player gets a chance to strike again. If the goalie rolls a 3 or 4 the goal is scored and the game restarts from the centre. A save is made the goalie throws a 5 or 6 and the game restarts from the Goalie Dot.&#10;&#10;The player who scored the most goals in 15 minutes is the winner. Extra-time can be played on a draw or the game can be decided with a Penalty Shoot-out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hearts of Iron: The Board Game is a game of grand strategy warfare, tactical battles, and shrewd diplomatic choices based on the Hearts of Iron video game franchise released on PC by Paradox Interactive.&#10;&#10;In the game, you lead one of five nations &mdash; United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, or the German Reich &mdash; during World War II, but will you re-enact history as it happened...or play out an alternative timeline, leading your nation down a new path? During set-up, you pair your nation with one of a suite of ideologies. You might choose, for example, to enact real history by playing the German Reich under fascism &mdash; or you could return the Kaiser to power and play the German Reich under monarchism. Each ideology has access to different focus decks, which will affect your resources and your routes to victory; these cards are played turn to turn and can influence everything from scoring victory points, to making lucrative trade agreements or declarations of war.&#10;&#10;Each board game nation has its own player boards, ideologies, cards, tokens, and minis. Each player's tracker board shows their current supply levels of vital resources, such as political power, stability, production, and manpower.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive resources based on how many territories you control with resource icons and factories. (You also gain resources during the game for trade agreements and engine cards that grant bonus resources.) You must pay to upkeep your stability, or pay even more to improve it. High stability grants bonuses to your nation, but with a high cost &mdash; although possibly not higher than letting your stability plummet.&#10;&#10;You have a political board that shows all playable and non-playable nations, and you use it to manage who you're allied with, who you're at war with, and everything in between. During the political phase, you can spend political power to adjust your alliances and conflicts; for each point you spend, you move one of your flag tokens, changing your political stance with one other nation. Changing your stance aggressively will eventually lead to a state of war, whereas changing your stance peacefully will lead to forming an alliance &mdash; and the more your ideologies match, the less political power you need.&#10;&#10;While at war with another nation, when your units move into their territory, you'll start combat. If you win, you'll conquer and take control of that territory, which is the fastest way to gain more resources. While in an alliance with another nation, you can move your units through their territory without starting a fight. You can also deploy units in your allies' territory! By forming an alliance, you can send units across the board to invade a distant nation.&#10;&#10;The game lasts six rounds, covering 1939-1944, and you need the most points to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the hybrid chess game 'POWER62&reg;DELTA', your objective is to capture the opponents' EPK (Eranium Processor Key) or eliminate the opponent's Emperor. Players start out on opposing sides of the playing board placing their characters &mdash; EPK, PTxCreatures, BLACK HOLE and Terrain Obstacle pieces &mdash; in a pre-set position. From there they take turns trying to out-strategize their opponent to win the game.&#10;&#10;There's only one strategy game that has withstood the test of time: CHESS. Using that as a foundation, we built up a set of new gameplay mechanics to create the next generation of chess. Unlike in chess, the movement of your pieces are controlled by a deck of Move Cards. For additional offensive and defensive capabilities, the Power Cards help randomize gameplay. And then, there are dangerous obstacles like Terrain Obstacles to worry about, and the SPR-8 Markers are the Mother of All Game Changers for each player. It's like chess on steroids. Finally obstacles like Black Holes and Terrain/Obstacles, featuring some of the exoteric landscapes and flora seen in our soon-to-be-released online comic! (Coming 12/2021).&#10;&#10;Another innovation for the game play is the added QR code in the cards to help define the movement of the piece, quickly.Even if you play the same deck multiple times, the outcome will differ. &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot; on the Move cards, Power cards and SPR-8 markers has a huge factor in whether your strategy works or crumbles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Phoenix expansion for Wyvern introduces two new types of Action cards:&#10;&#10;Hidden Action&#10;Play under a face down card during an Action Phase. The Hidden Action card tells you whether to play it under one of your cards or under an opponent's card. The Hidden Action is not revealed until the card it is placed under gets turned face up during the normal course of play. You may not look at any Hidden Actions placed under your cards by your opponent until your card comes face up during play. Place the Hidden Actions sideways as a reminder of this. As soon as a card with a Hidden Action under it comes face up, check to see if the Hidden Action applies to the card it is under. If it does not apply, it is discarded and has no effect. If it does apply, follow the instructions on the Hidden Action card. The Hidden Action card remains attached to the card it was under for as long as that card is in play, unless it is removed by a game action.&#10;&#10;Intercept Action&#10;Play immediately after your opponent has chosen a dragon to use for attack, and has announced which card he is attacking. If your opponent is attacking a face down card, you play the Intercept Action before the card is turned face up. If the Interceptor has a base strength, the attacking dragon must kill the Interceptor before reaching the intended target of its attack. The attacking dragon and the Interceptor fight a normal battle with the Interceptor counting as a dragon in the row attacked. If the outcome is anything other than the Interceptor being killed, the Battle Phase ends immediately. This means that the Interceptor could lose the battle but survive with a Golden Apple or Fountain of Youth, and the Battle Phase would still end. If the battle is cancelled, the Battle Phase ends. If the Interceptor wins the battle, the losing Dragon dies and the Interceptor is discarded, ending the Battle Phase. If the attacking Dragon does kill the Interceptor, it then immediately attacks the card it originally intended to attack. If the Intercept Action does not have a base strength, follow the instructions on the card. Intercept Actions are always discarded after use.&#10;&#10;",

Players take cards from each of three decks:  sets, props, and characters.  They must then develop a quick story including each of these random elements.  One player each round serves as the director.  He/She takes a card indicating a direction or goal for the winning story - that only the director knows.  Players tell their stories, and the director chooses the best one.  The winning storyteller receives $1, which may be used as a victory point, or to choose a different card when telling a story.  The first player to 5 points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After all player ships have participated, the enemy turn will begin, during which the enemies will attempt different actions against the player ships or planet earth depending on the Strategy Card that has been revealed.&#10;&#10;After each round, the state of the game must be checked to determine whether the match has ended, be it in favor or against the players. If the match has not yet ended, another round is prepared, advancing the marker on the portal to another dimension to the next counter, among other things. The game will inevitably end when the marker on the portal to another dimension reaches the last counter and cannot be moved any forward at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The players must use the limited amount of turns at their disposal to try and prepare their ships and improve them as much as possible, with better modules and more crew, in order to be victorious. Achieving good synergy between the modules of a ship and maintaining good communication with companions might result in a seemingly impossible task being successfully completed.&#10;&#10;The earth is counting on you!

If a spy louse jumps (or bumps) to a monkey containing lice of an opponent, all of the lice will stay on that monkey. From now on that &quot;spy louse&quot; counts towards the number of worker lice on that monkey. A monkey may contain only one spy louse at a time.&#10;&#10;This expansion also gives you a new game mode in which you control a species of monkeys. (Yes, you won't be playing as lice.) The goal of this game mode is to be the first player to get rid of all of the lice colonizing your monkeys.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "[Overview]&#10;Rock Paper Monsters is a turn-based card game that follows the core mechanics of Rock Paper Scissors, with an added element of scoring points based off of the card value. Every card has a cartoon illustrated monster, with some having trigger abilities that occur at various points in the game.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing Monster or Bonus cards to both destroy opponent&rsquo;s cards and score the most points. Each Monster type has a strength and weakness against another type. Bonus cards can be played instead of a Monster card, providing unique advantages. The player with the highest score after all cards are played wins a Monster Bite. Cards are then reshuffled and the next round begins. The first player to 10 Monster Bites wins.&#10;&#10;[Gameplay]&#10;Beginning Phase:&#10;Each player draws 6 cards. Then, each player takes 3 cards off the Draw pile and places then face down in a row across from each other. When ready, flip over each card and determine the winning Monster. Monster cards battle directly across from each other.&#10;&#10;Play Phase:&#10;At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they may choose to discard 1 card in hand and draw 1 card from the Draw pile.&#10;&#10;Next, the player plays 1 card immediately to the left or to the right of one of their cards in play. If they have no cards in play, they must play a card across from one of their opponent&rsquo;s cards. When playing a Monster Card, if their opponent has a Monster Card directly across from their Monster Card, they begin the [Battle]. When playing a Bonus Card, no battle occurs.&#10;&#10;This completes their turn and it is now their opponent&rsquo;s turn to play. Continue alternating turns until all cards in hand are played.&#10;&#10;",
