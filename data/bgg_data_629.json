The exact origin of the game is unknown but it was actively played as a paper-and-pencil game in Saint Petersburg State University in 80s. There were several variants of the game with slightly different rules.&#10;&#10;Players must make five steps per turn. Each step is either placing a new virus on the board or &quot;zombifying&quot; one of the enemy viruses. The goal of the game is to leave the opponent without legal moves.&#10;&#10;",

The dealer then turns over a single cut card. The result is 5 hands of 5 cards for each player. The scores are added up for all the hands. This is repeated for five deals. The highest score at the end of the five deals wins the game.&#10;&#10;From published rules on the box.&#10;&#10;",

It's the main strategy, hence the name of the game: Mentirosa (Spanish: liar).&#10;&#10;EACH SET INCLUDES:&#10;&#10;* 6 Mentirosa Player's Tubes&#10;    * 6 sets of casino-grade poker dice&#10;    * Loser Chips : These chips will help you keep track of the winners and losers.&#10;    * Mentirosa Professional or Travel storage case&#10;    * Instructions in English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;2 to 20 Players (with extra sets) Ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;&#10;How to play Mentirosa&#10;&#10;In this version of liar's dice, the object of the game is to guess the number rolled, of any suit, among all the dice.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player rolls a single die in open view of other players. The player&#10;with the highest suit starts the play. If a tie occurs, only those players in the tie roll again.&#10;&#10;Players throw five poker dice into their tube. They look in their tube to see what they rolled.&#10;&#10;A turn begins when the starting a player makes a call, for example three Jacks. This&#10;means they believe that there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play.&#10;&#10;The next player has two options:&#10;&#10;1. Raise the call. This is done by, raising the suit called, raising the number of dice&#10;      called, or both. In this example, the next player could call three Queens, three&#10;      Kings, three Aces, or four of anything else. Any of these would be higher than the&#10;      three Jacks called. Or...&#10;&#10;2. Challenge the call. When a player challenges a call, he or she does not believe&#10;      that the hand called, in this case three Jacks, exists among all the dice in play.&#10;      To challenge, a player raises their tube, revealing their hand and signaling to the&#10;      other players to do the same. At this point, the suit in play is counted.&#10;&#10;In this example, if there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play, the&#10;challenger receives a loser chip and a new turn begins. If there are less than three Jacks among the dice in play, the calling player receives a loser chip and a new turn begins.&#10;&#10;The loser begins the next turn. There is no passing. Once a call is raised, it is the next player&rsquo;s turn and he or she has the same two options.The game continues in this manner, player after player, until a call is challenged.&#10;&#10;Once a player receives 5 loser chips, they are out of the game. Last man standing wins!&#10;&#10;Source: www.mentirosa.org&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chariot Arena is a Grim Trojan board game based on the chariot races of Roman times and the first of Grim Trojan&rsquo;s Downloadable Board Games.&#10;&#10;To keep the game fun for different levels and ages of players, optional rules have been created (the alternate rules follow the official rules).&#10;&#10;This board game is very loosely based on historical records about chariot races. With that said, never forget the game is a board game and as such has been modified to keep game play fun. The arena is based (again, loosely) on Rome&rsquo;s largest and oldest circus, Circus Maximus (called a circus because of the oval shape).&#10;&#10;Attacks are allowed to simulate the whipping and bumping that occurred in a chariot race and the curves are more dangerous in the board game because they were in the real races.&#10;&#10;Chariot Arena has two different playing boards to allow for better game play. The larger board comprised of four pages&#10;with smaller hexes was designed for a larger group of players and for those who enjoy longer more detailed game play. The&#10;smaller board comprised of two pages with larger hexes is designed to allow a smaller number of players to have more&#10;interaction in few laps and its charts are less complicated. Try both and play the one that best suits your style of play.&#10;&#10;As each player takes their turn, they must first move their pawn 6 hexes. They then have the option to stay where they are or roll 2d6 (two six sided dice) and moving their pawn across the board one hex at a time the number of hexes shown on the dice. Movement can be forward left, forward right or forward. Moving a pawn backward on the track is not permitted. Only one&#10;pawn can occupy a hex at a time. If a pawn is in your way, you must move around it. The player also has the option to move&#10;the pawn less hexes than indicated on the dice (example: a player rolling 10 can move only 7 hexes if they wish). If a pawn&rsquo;s path is blocked by other pawns and it is impossible to move forward while moving the base 6 hexes, the player must choose which pawn to stop behind. The player and the owner of the other pawn must both roll from the Accident Chart.&#10;&#10;",

The defending player may block the attack with his own characters.&#10;&#10;Cards, once in play, can be used either as resources to put new cards in play, or to activate their special abilities, or to attack. Either way, when used they are rotated and are not available until next turn. A rotated card may not be used to block the opponent's attack.&#10;&#10;After each attack, some experience points may be awarded to either player. The heroes may level up when they reach 6 experience points, and again when they reach 18 experience points. There are two possible ways to win: either kill the opponent's hero, or level up twice with one's own.&#10;&#10;Free translation from the back of the starter box:&#10;Chose your hero and his dimensional bag and explore the world of Dofus and Wakfu.

    "Description": "OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conquer the galaxy - either by occupying the most stars; or by capturing the opponent's home base star, or by destroying the opponent's forces.&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;&#10;Each player should draw a 10 by 10 grid. Each set of adjacent 4 squares is grouped into a quadrant, and labeled from A to Y, starting from the top, left hand side quadrant. Each square in a quadrant is numbered from 1 to 4, starting from the top, left hand side square.&#10;&#10;One player is allocated the 6 quadrant in the top-left hand side of the board as his home sector, and the other takes the 6 quadrant in the bottom-right hand side of the board as his. The remaining 13 quadrants form the neutral sector. The corner quadrants in each player's home sector are their respective home quadrants.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 45 points to create stars in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Quadrat Z is very much a game of cat-and-mouse. As in many wars, you have some idea of an opponent's strength and general location, but very little about the exact composition and location of his forces. Hence, the value of intelligence gathering should not be underrated.&#10;&#10;Strategy will vary from game to game, but a major focus should be on the capture of stars: without them your forces will not grow, and , in the long run their lack will certainly cause you to lose. Think carefully about the initial layout of stars, and place your ships to capture the maximum number of points as soon as possible. Try and maintain a balanced force of ship sizes. Movement is hidden, and fairly rapid shifts of forces from one quadrant to another are possible. Remember that in combat the aim is to have the largest combined force - not necessarily a single, high value ship. A single, large strike ship may penetrate enemy lines and take out the opponent's home base... but if he sees it coming he may have time to regroup and knock it out. Spreading your ships out too thinly in a quadrant could also be problematic in combat.&#10;&#10;",
