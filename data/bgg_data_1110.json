They can be beaten or neutralized, yes, it may even be that you can not use them at all. But as long as they are on the board, they pose a threat to the opponent. You will be amazed how a TAMSK potential affects your strategy and that of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Apparently this new (2019) product contains 6 TAMSK potentials. The base game TAMSK includes 6 TAMSK potentials. The first GIPF expansion GIPF Project Set 1 (from 2001) contains 12 TAMSK potentials, so this new product seems intended to let TAMSK owners have the recommended full set of 12 TAMSK potentials without having to buy the earlier expansion with 12 of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the distant future, the year 2000. Mankind has colonised all of the rocky planets of the inner solar system. However Ceres, deep in the heart of the Asteroid Belt, remains a distant and desolate outpost even after the industrial process used to create fertile soils and an oxygen-rich atmosphere.&#10;&#10;You are one of a few hardy (some would say fool-hardy) galactic pioneers who have sunk everything they own into a patch of Cerean land and a handful of 'bots to tend and defend it. For the rapidly growing crops of Ceres fetch premium prices back on flooded, overpopulated Earth. Meanwhile the warlike colonies of Mars, intent on their independence from Earth, continue to blockade and harass Cerean shuttles. Will you make your fortune and retire to the balmy resorts of Venus? Or will the challenges of Starfarm Ceres overwhelm and ruin you?&#10;&#10;Starfarm Ceres is a worker placement solitaire game divided across three game boards. On the first, you deploy your 'bots to sow crops and harvest them once they mature using a unique time delay mechanism. On the second you must shoot down Martian saucers that multiply and descend to raze your crops. Finally you must send shuttles back to Earth, through the Martian blockade, to the third board where you sell your produce and buy upgrades. The language-independent game boards are double-sided with slightly different scenarios on each, giving eight different game setup possibilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this Wild West town the stakes are high as every last one of you worthless lawbreakers are WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE for reckless and criminal behavior and are fugitives on the run. You must navigate the dangerous streets surrounding the Courthouse in order gather your posse together, escape capture and rule the town. Your posse of fugitives will attempt to round up reluctant and disloyal accomplices&mdash;trying to keep them in tow to accomplish their ill-conceived agendas. Beware, your accomplices can be taken from you at any moment, you may be hauled off to jail or even challenged to a duel.&#10;&#10;The Wild West in 1879 was ripe with lawlessness. But in the vast Arizona wilderness the town of Prescott grew even wilder. A row of saloons cropped up and took over an entire street. They coined it &quot;Whiskey Row.&quot;&#10;&#10;After much drinking and gambling, reckless and criminal behavior ensued. The townsfolk dueled it out with their six shooters on the dusty streets&mdash;each acting as judge and jury. The souls of those shot in cold blood haunted the town.&#10;&#10;With opposing ill-conceived agendas, the townsfolk divided into four renegade posses and all became FUGITIVES of the law.&#10;The unruly CITIZENS,&nbsp;&#10;The dishonest MERCHANTS,&nbsp;&#10;The brutal OUTLAWS&nbsp;&#10;&amp; The corrupt local LAW.&#10;&#10;2-8 players each use four real poker chip Wild West characters (their posse) to move around the board by choosing to play one of two 'wanted dead or alive' cards or roll two dice with an option of splitting the dice to move TWO characters. Each player has a posse of four. For instance, the Outlaws have the Gunslinger, the Madame, the Dealer and the Bartender. As they move through the streets of this dangerous town, strategic options are chosen to decide which of your opponents players you choose to force into being your reluctant accomplices by stacking them under your own posse's fugitives&mdash;you will need them to escape the law and win the game. The cards list a group of four wanted fugitives for a particular crime, so you may choose one from your own posse, OR one of your opponents, thereby giving you the chance to move an opponent's fugitive and waylay their attempts to win the game. Duels may be called before each turn in order to steal your opponents accomplices, kidnapping the Marshal or the Judge keeps you protected from capture and sending an opponent to the jailhouse or a haunted property slows down their ability to escape capture.&#10;&#10;Although there are at least five strategic choices to choose from during each turn, the game moves along quickly. During another player's turn there is much to think about, so you are engaged the entire time. All players remain in the game until it concludes and there is no clear winner until it pans out in the end&mdash;with one player's posse escaping caputure by returning to their individual hideouts...with the help of their accomplices.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You may find KAM&rsquo;ON interesting for one particular reason- you can scam. Although this turns out to be incredibly interesting and allows for millions of different scenarios, plays, and manipulation, KAM&rsquo;ON has many other aspects and cards that give it a quite perfect balance between fun, complexity and possibilities. For example, take poker, a game that is not too complex yet allows for so many different plays on account of the player/human factor of the game; players can manipulate others, bluff, etc. KAM&rsquo;ON is very similar, although frankly our cards look a bit nicer.&#10;&#10;Having tens of distinct cards lets the player combine different plays, playing as many cards as they  would like during their turn, yet only playing one card per type. The true intrigue comes when you realise that you may not make it without trading- or scamming. You decide to bluff. You lie about having a card that another player needs only to scam him out of a card you need. A player may only complete their part of the trade during their own turn, therefore it is quite easy to scam someone- at the cost of your in game reputation.&#10;&#10;This aspect of KAM&rsquo;ON works perfectly with the beautifully designed cards that work to get you your 4 organs- the cards needed to win. In all honesty, KAM&rsquo;ON is quite simple. Do everything you can to get 4 organs, whether it be destroying your opponents and stealing their organs, or scamming them out of their organs. Whichever it is, as long as you get an organ, it was probably worth it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Convince your companions that your share is really not so big...&#10;&#10;Split the Loot is a card game in which during each round players divide treasures (16-18 cards each round) using an unique &quot;reversed bidding&quot; mechanic. The active player makes an offer stating which cards he would like to take and places bid markers on them. The other players in clockwise turn order either accept the offer or make an counteroffer by removing the markers from the cards; as you can only remove markers the counteroffer will be a subset of the initial offer. Once all players agree to an offer the bidding player gathers the cards with markers on them and drops out off the round while the other players continue to divide in the same manner the cards available in this round .&#10;&#10;Besides gathering treasures player may gain action cards that provide a one time bonus during the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when players divide among themselves the whole Treasure Deck, which depending on the number of players will take between 5 and 7 rounds. The players count up the points from their gained cards. Different cards score in different ways - while you want as much Rum as you can gather, if you found a couple Cannon balls you really should look around for a Cannon...&#10;&#10;While the card titles are printed in Polish the game is totally language independent and the rules are printed in both English and Polish.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     280 two sided counters.&#10;     Four A4 sheets map. (Or 1 x A2 map).&#10;     One air placement auxiliary sheet.&#10;     One rulebook with playing aides.&#10;&#10;&#10;Although the battle was mainly a one sided business, with the Paraguayan conducting three successive envelopments (thanks to initial Bolivian command sclerosis and lack of reserves), the Bolivian player still has a lot to do, husbanding his forces and trying to save as much as he can from the Paraguayan onslaught.&#10;&#10;On the other side, the Paraguayan player must at least accomplish what historically was done: envelope and force to surrender two, out of three, Bolivian divisions and tear down the front, forcing his opponent to abandon the battle area. And this means having the noose tightened up to the end, and sticking to a strict schedule.&#10;&#10;Being the Chaco an extensive bush country, intelligence on your enemy is a key to carrying out enveloping maneuvers. Remember that this was &rdquo;MG time&rdquo; and you couldn&rsquo;t just walk naively into an entrenched killing ground. The game provides rules for intelligence gathering in order to simulate surprise.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

While the rules are not written for any particular scale of miniatures, they will work very well with 3mm, 6mm and 10mm figures, where each stand can look like a unit in its own right. Playing in 15mm is certainly possible, but tank models will take up a disproportionate amount of table-space compared to infantry stands.&#10;&#10;GROUND AND TIME SCALE:&#10;The game does not adhere to a strict time scale. A turn is the time it takes for a meaningful action to take place on the gaming table and for units to potentially incapacitate an enemy company sized formation. Depending on the actions taking place, this may be from a few minutes to half an hour or longer. If you are tracking time for the purposes of a scenario, assume an average of 10 minutes per turn or roll 3D6 each turn, to determine how many minutes it took. Think of your game as a movie. As the battle rages, the camera zooms in on a particular unit and focuses on it, while the rest of the world ceases to exist for a moment. Ground scale is roughly 1&rdquo; = 100 yards.&#10;Engagement distances have been kept very conservative, to account for the fact that our flat, featureless tables would be covered in hedge rows, hills, crevices and depressions.&#10;&#10;",

The killer secretly writes down two numbers between 1 and 6, one for themself and one for their preferred victim. &#10;Now both players take turn to place a number on one of the six fields of one of the six empty &quot;crime scenes&quot;. At any time after the placement of the 16th number, the detective can ask a question like &quot;Has a murder been committed in these areas?&quot; and point to one or more crime scenes. The killer must truthfully answer yes if they placed the killer number in a crime scene where the victim number was already present, otherwise they answer no. The detective can ask this kind of question three times in the course of the game. &#10;The detective wins if&#10;- at some point they can make a correct accusation, naming both the killer's and the victim's number&#10;- the killer fails to murder anyone at all.&#10;The killer wins if&#10;- the detective makes a wrong accusation&#10;- no more cubes can be played, and they have committed at least one murder.&#10;&#10;",

I do not recognize the meaning of the word.&quot; &ndash; Margaret Thatcher April 1982, start of the Falklands War&#10;&#10;In April of 1982, Argentina invaded the British sovereign territory of the Falkland Islands, in the South Atlantic. The Argentines had long claimed ownership of the islands, which they called Islas Malvinas. The unforeseen attack and occupation sparked international outrage, and Great Britain quickly mobilized a naval task force to retake the islands, 8,000 miles from home. Relying on the &eacute;lan of their professional and highly trained military personnel, the combined air, sea and land forces succeeded against the odds, victorious less than 80 days from the Argentine seizure of the islands. For the British, it was no less than a spectacular feat of arms.&#10;&#10;A Feat of Arms is an expansion module for Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical: Heroes of the Falklands. Play 12 scenarios on six new X-Maps, including a new Port Stanley Map for a revised take on Operation Rosario, the initial Argentine invasion. Other new terrain includes rugged hills&mdash;for new battles on Mt. Harriet, Wireless Ridge and Sapper Hill&mdash;and a grass airfield, for the SAS&rsquo;s audacious raid on Pebble Island and the ferocious final action of the Battle of Goose Green. Across the islands, the bold British Paras and Royal Marines fought well-armed Argentine Army conscripts and Marines defending vital terrain and counterattacking upon lost ground. The conditions were harsh, with most of the fighting done at night, among minefields and under heavy mortar and artillery fire.&#10;&#10;The Falklands War was a test of mettle. Are you up to the test?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(In English it would be Antlion Pit and the Romaji could be read as ARIJIGOKU). The game was produced with help from DIY &#229;&#141;&#147;&#229;&#177;&#139; (DIY Takuya), the manufacturing section of a board game circle named &quot;Play Space Takuya&quot; based in Sapporo, Japan. DIY Takuya helps by making game boards, components and organizers using laser-cut wood.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game of ARIZIGOKU, you try to save members of your faction from the Antlion pit.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you are assigned one of four factions. Member tokens are scattered in a concave pit-shaped game board. Each member belongs to two factions, inscribed in each side of the token.&#10;&#10;You have three actions each turn. By spending an action, you move your rescuer pawn to save a member, or move a soldier pawn to force a member fall one tier. If a member falls to the bottom, that member is lost.&#10;&#10;You win the game when you save a certain number of members of your faction. You lose the game when three victims of your faction fall into the bottom of the pit. (Other conditions may apply.)&#10;&#10;This game has two modes: basic game and standard game. In the standard game, there are Antlion turns in which the Antlions may capture members actively.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#159;&#187;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#183;&#163;&#231;&#169;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#183;&#163;&#231;&#169;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#159;&#187;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#160;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The first player to roll a 6 is aunt Anna's escort and places his pawn in the center of the game board. The other players place their pawns on any space (luck symbol) on the ring of their color. Then the escort player places aunt Anna on a heart in a column where no pawn is standing and rolls the die. He may move aunt Anna in any direction according to the result of the roll. If aunt Anna lands on a column with one ore more pawns, the player of each pawn has to pay a token, which is placed inside the hollow aunt Anna figure and the escort rolls again. If aunt Anna lands on a column with no pawns, the next player gets his turn. He rolls the die and moves his pawn clockwise. If he lands in the same column as aunt Anna, he gets chosen to be her new escort, if not, the next player has his turn. If a new escort has been chosen, the abandoned escort gets all tokens inside aunt Anna and her new escort gets to move her to collect tokens for him.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one player looses all his tokens. The player with the most tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Roll for the Galaxy: Rivalry, the second expansion for Roll for the Galaxy, consists of three expansions in one box.&#10;&#10;First, it adds expansion content to the base game: 62 more game dice, a new die type, start factions, home worlds, and more than double the number of game tiles for the bag as in Ambition, the first expansion for Roll. This material is compatible with Ambition, but that expansion is not required to play Rivalry. If you are familiar with the dice from Ambition, then you can add this content and start playing immediately. (If not, you'll need to read about the new dice.)&#10;&#10;Rivalry also contains two optional game modules &mdash; the Deal Game and the Orb Game &mdash; which can be played separately or combined. These modules can also be combined with the goals in Ambition, although the publisher suggests not combining them all at once for new players!&#10;&#10;&bull; The Deal Game has a new deal phase in which players assign $ dice to a new deal board in order to swap assets they don't want for those they do &mdash; and pretty much everything is fair game in terms of possible trades. Not using all your credit track? Why not trade in the top part of it to get a useful die? Or, if you're running a large economy and need a credit track that goes to 11 (or even 16), why not trade away a couple of white dice to get a larger track?&#10;&#10;Have a bunch of extra tiles clogging up your construction zones from previous Explores? Why not trade them in for new dice? Or, a chance to draw from the bag until you find a 6 cost development? Or a pair of VP chips? Or a talent counter? Or some credits? Or, another Leader die? Or, a chance to draw a world of a desired color from the bag? Or, to turn some Citizenry dice directly into Developers or Settlers? Or...&#10;&#10;Seven deal dice are rolled each turn before players assign their workers to determine what asset types can be potentially gained or traded in that round. After you swap assets, your deal will start to mature over several rounds. If you (or someone else) calls &quot;Deal&quot; again before your deal expires, then you might want to send another dealer in to reverse your trade, trading back for what you originally spent and making some credits and talent counters along the way. Of course, while your deal is maturing, some other player might swoop in and reverse it before you wanted to, taking their cut and converting your attempted temporary loan into a permanent exchange. These things happen...&#10;&#10;&bull; The Orb Game gives one yellow &quot;Alien Orb&quot; die to each player, and the faces of these dice can be popped out and upgraded to various &quot;lines&quot; of faces that allow you to customize what you can do in the game. (Think of the lines as being akin to a tech tree.)&#10;&#10;You can assign dice to become researchers in the Research phase, and for each assigned researcher, when someone calls Research, you get two &quot;dots&quot; of upgrades to your dice. The first dot gets you a 1-dot face in any line; extra dots get you better faces in that line. (If you want to switch lines for a given face after entering a line, pay 1 dot more.) These upgraded dice affect your play. For example, if you roll the 2-dot beige -1 develop face, you receive a -1 die discount on all developments you build that turn.&#10;&#10;Orb dice are rolled in front of player screens at the start of a round. If, for example, you roll a face that grants virtual workers, then everyone knows that you will benefit if Explore occurs and can plan accordingly as they assign their dice and decide which phase to call.&#10;&#10;To allow improved Orb dice more opportunities to affect play, the Orb game ends at 15+ tiles or when the initial VP chip pool is exhausted, which is increased to 15 VPs per player. At game end, each 2-dot and 4-dot face on your Orb die is worth 1 and 2 VPs, respectively.&#10;&#10;&bull; Replacement player screens including a summary of the optional games (in different colored type faces) and all three added dice types are also included.&#10;&#10;",

They are special crystals, that add new rules to the game, increasing its strategic aspect. Before the game distribute them on all regions. One type of those new crystals increases the Region value, the other decreases it. That change in Region&rsquo;s value will mean you would need to play your whole game differently!&#10;&#10;New Crystals is a very simple mini-expansion that adds a ton of strategy to the game. In the setup phase, players will plant different regions with white and black crystals. Unlike the ones from the base game, these black and white are one use only, sort of objectives to grab, secure and score. And unlike the ones from the base game, white and black crystals are located precisely where you want them to be. You set the scene. You prepare the game. You let other players know which region is vital for you. After the setup phase is over, the board is filled with white and black crystals, markers that manifest players plans. For winning in the region with white crystals, you get additional points. If you win in a region with black ones, the score for this battle will be lower. The map gets extra dimension, unique net of scoring opportunities plant on the board by players themselves.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan is a combat-driven and strategy dependent RPG board game. It follows the steps of three heroes, who set out to slay a legendary Zmey, who has risen from the grave. Vengeance of Ognyan is a core-set and includes everything you need to play in a total of 4 game modes!&#10;&#10;During the Vengeance of Ognyan campaign, players will be able to pick one of three available heroes to venture out alone or in a party with one goal: to slay Ognyan once and for all. Each character has their own mechanics and relations to the others. Every one of them has their own die, stats and skill trees. During turns, players will have a chance to move and then initiate combat, but dice will determine the success of their announced actions. Positioning also plays a large part of strategizing your way to victory: while standing next to specific characters, you gain different buffs or debuffs.&#10;&#10;During the Campaign players will follow open-ended quest-lines, which can lead them through different routes to victory or failure. Each quest is tied to a location and a setup. Every location has its own rule set. You place your heroes, arrange the enemies and proceed with combat until you achieve victory. That can mean different things, depending on your current quest goal - like slaying all enemies or surviving an onslaught for a given number of turns. During a campaign run, players will have to complete numerous encounters, cleanse dungeons and participate in many events before the party reaches Ognyan&rsquo;s Lair. You can also invite a more experienced fourth player to join you and act as your guide through the world of Mythos, but if you do &ndash; their word becomes the law of the game, as long as it&rsquo;s fun for everyone!&#10;&#10;With every battle, the heroes grow stronger through a leveling system. If a player can bank enough experience tokens, their hero can level up. The player will have to choose one of two available skill options and with each choice their hero will become a unique result of their play through. But watch out &ndash; enemies gain levels proportionally to the party as well!&#10;&#10;After you've mastered the game's rules and mechanics, you can try one of the other game modes present: Ognyan Unleashed, RNG Challenges and Player versus Player Combat are there for more experienced adventurers or those, who are looking for a fast battle without context. Better yet - now that you have these tools at your disposal, you can design your very own epic adventures and share them with the Ognyan Slayers community for a chance to win awesome rewards!&#10;&#10;The World of Mythos awaits you. It's time you rise and put an end to Ognyan's tyrannical reign once and for all!&#10;&#10;You can have a look at the Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan public rule book here: http://1am.studio/Mythos-Vengeance_of_Ognyan_DigitalRulebook.pdf&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Vengeance of Ognyan core-set is the based on the &quot;Mythos&quot; franchise by 1AM Studios, which is inspired by ancient Slavic mythology.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
