    "Description": "The four elements of hip hop are deejaying, rapping, break dancing, and graffiti painting, and these elements inspired Grafito, a rondel-based game about street art in the modern cities. Each player takes on a role of a graffiti artist, and you need to pick paints, and combine and use them to create great panels with your signature. Are you ready to control the walls of the street?&#10;&#10;To set up, place eight paint cubes in each of the four rondels of the main game board; each rondel looks like an old-school LP record divided into eight colored sections. Use only primary paint cubes (blue, red, yellow and white) for now, then place the wall board next to the main board. Take an individual player board to organize your components, then shuffle the mural cards and reveal four face up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, collect paint cubes or use a mural card to occupy a place on the wall board. By scratching the LPs &mdash; that is, turning the rondels &mdash; you can collect paint. You can rotate a rondel one space for free or spend workers to move more spaces or a second rondel; by matching colors across LPs, you can collect paint. By discarding a worker, you can use Basquiat's Lessons to duplicate paint cubes in your bag, change their colors, or obtain secondary colors.&#10;&#10;Once you have the necessary components, you can complete a mural card by discarding the paint cubes required, possibly creating secondary colors along the way by discarding primary cubes. You receive points for these cards at the end of the game, and these cards depict different elements of hip hop, with you scoring bonuses from bonds of matching elements on the wall board.&#10;&#10;When the wall board is finished, the game ends, and whoever has the most points becomes King of the Wall!&#10;&#10;",

The rules mention different numbers of cards which are to be distributed to the players if different numbers of players are playing.&#10;&#10;After the cards are distributed &mdash; the main objective of the game, making sets starts guiding the players. The unique thing about Wanderlust is the close connect between the story and the game mechanism. Sets need to made &mdash; but why, which and most importantly how?&#10;&#10;The game has four type of cards. Destination cards, Currency cards, Journey cards and Reward cards. Each of the sets (Explorer, Planner and Fun Person) has a certain sequence of cards specified. This sequence is a mix of Destination and Currency cards or only one of these two kinds of cards.&#10;&#10;In the game players collect Currency cards and trade Journey cards to get different Destination and Currency cards. This way different kinds of sets are made and Reward cards are won. The number of sets to be made is finite. The game is over when the Reward cards are over or if the game play gets stuck.&#10;&#10;It contains 52 high quality cards and 1 easy-to-understand manual.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Every turn starts with more cockroaches getting added to the game. Some cockroaches have special abilities that make them more desirable roommates - but they are also worth more points. The goal is to be the last apartment standing with less than ten roach points.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can use their cockroaches to infest their neighbors' apartments or play supply cards like bug spray or Exterminator to kill their roaches and send them to the basement. If a player has more than ten roach points at the end of their turn, they&rsquo;ve lost the game! Losers turn over the apartment mat to reveal they&rsquo;ve been fumigated, and their roaches scurry off to remaining apartments. The last apartment standing wins!&#10;&#10;Infesting is the central mechanic in Cuddly Cockroaches. To infest, players pick a target neighbor, select any number of roaches from their apartment to infest with, and roll a die. To successfully infest, the dice roll has to be higher than the total value of roach points they&rsquo;re infesting with. If successful, those roaches get sent to the target neighbor&rsquo;s apartment. Roll equal or lower than the point value of roaches chosen for an infestation, and those roaches stay in the player&rsquo;s apartment. Either way, the player attempting the infestation gets to draw a supply card.&#10;&#10;Infesting challenges players to gauge their odds as they gamble to get rid of roaches. Bet conservatively, and risk the chance of getting fumigated before your neighbors over time. Take too much of a gamble, and risk never getting rid of your roaches. Supply cards can pass roaches from your apartment to your neighbors, add points to your dice roll or actions to your turn, or kill roaches and send them to the basement. But the only way to draw supply cards is by infesting, so players are rewarded for playing aggressively. Players get two actions per turn, any combo of infesting, playing a supply card, and shuffling their hand into the deck, and drawing three. Just like a real-life roach infestation, it&rsquo;s a losing battle of bugs - but a lucky roll can be a game-changer!&#10;&#10;Be a good neighbor, and share your roaches!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Commerce raiding formed a critical part of the strategy for several nations &ndash; Germany&rsquo;s Kriegsmarine almost brought Britain to her knees whilst the US Navy similarly strangled Japan&rsquo;s movement of industrial goods, materials, troops and supplies.&#10;&#10;Grouping ships into convoys meant there was more expanse of empty ocean out there &ndash; hopefully raiders would not even find the convoy. It also made escorts more effective, but in the event a convoy was hit by a surface raider, such as a heavy cruiser or battlecruiser, the target would be devastated in short order. Nevertheless, the convoy system helped a great deal. It would fall to the escorting ships to defend them until either a heavy covering force could come up in support or the merchants could make their escape. Some of the most heroic, and worst mismatched, actions of the war took place in defence of merchants convoys or troop ships.&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Be warned, not all of them are quite as kind natured as your fellow Nymphs, it is not just the Flowers of Malum Hortus that you need to fear.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To place this card on an island, place it straddling between cards so that it covers the portal of the island. To play, you only need one copy of the Dice Tower.&#10;&#10;Effect: When the active player wants to complete an Heroic Feat on an island with the Dice Tower, he has to defeat the Dice Tower first. To do so, he places his Hero pawn on the Dice Tower Portal then rolls the dice like he was getting the divine blessings, except he has to pay the resources shown on his dice instead of winning these, all in order to defeat the Dice Tower (paying rules apply as for the Minotaur&mdash;See Dice Forge rules).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The goal of Dragon's Gate is to be the first player to get one of your own Dragons across the board and through the enemy&rsquo;s gate. (The corner spaces marked with Chinese characters are nominally the posts of the gate.)&#10;&#10;A Dragon moves forward by taking a single step, either diagonally or vertically, onto an empty space. A Dragon may also fly (jump) forward over a single friendly Dragon to the empty space just beyond. But it may not fly over an enemy Dragon.&#10;&#10;A Dragon captures enemy pieces by withdrawal. This means if a Dragon begins its turn with an enemy Dragon adjacent and just in front of it, it may take a single step backwards, in the opposite direction, to the empty space just behind it.(Imagine a Dragon rearing its head back to breathe fire.) The enemy Dragon is then removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In a typical game of breakthrough/attainment there are usually two basic elements: 1. - The player is trying to advance his own pieces across the board. 2. &ndash; The player attacks his opponent&rsquo;s pieces to prevent him from doing the same. Backwards captures is a mechanic that affects both of these simultaneously. You can remove one of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces only at the cost of delaying your own advancement.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the strategy game by BelloLudi! Nice that you have taken an interest in wargaming. These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. BelloLudi designed these rules especially for teambuilding purposes. During our sessions we received feedback that people liked our game, but it was initially too complicated. Now, we have a ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.&#10;&#10;The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. We have collected huge armies over the years but, as you are new to the game, you&rsquo;ll probably do not. Do not fear! The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.&#10;&#10;This rules-set simulates battles in the period of 1700 to 1900, the age which historians call the long 19th century. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.&#10;&#10;In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chips, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry charges and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.&#10;&#10;Your role will be that of a brigadier in a nineteenth century army. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Covid is a funny, strategic card game about our struggle to self-isolate. It's a game everyone should have at home as a laughable reminder of the craziness that went on in the Covid era.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win, either become immune by collecting Vaccine tokens or eliminate other players by giving Infection tokens.&#10;&#10;There are 108 cards containing stories and pictures of the strange things that people have done during the pandemic.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you read your card aloud, choose who you will play it on and assign the token(s) in accordance to what the card instructs.&#10;&#10;Infection cards usually have stories of the unbelievable and sometimes stupid things people have done, like cutting holes in masks to breathe better, or suggesting we inject disinfectant to control the spread. They are played on other players to give Infection tokens.&#10;&#10;Vaccine cards have stories of the more heroic or mundane things that we have had to do, but have all done them anyway, like having a wine tour in your house or doing YouTube workouts to curb the iso-snacks. They are played on yourself to gain Vaccine tokens.&#10;&#10;Strategic cards are used to block Infections by wearing a mask or social distancing, or they can be used to create havoc by forcing opponents to only use specific cards.&#10;&#10;Then there is Bat Soup, the card that started it all. Bat Soup gives an Infection that keeps spreading each round until someone, anyone removes it with a Vaccine card.&#10;&#10;The required amount of tokens to eliminate a player with Infection tokens or win outright with Vaccine tokens is always equal to the amount of active players.&#10;&#10;Five players requires five tokens, four = four, etc. If a player is eliminated the required tokens is now one less. This can result in a domino effect and remove all your opponents at once or even accidentally take yourself out!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Shooting Star was designed in fewer than 6 months around the British Halford H.1 (Goblin) engine and first flew in 1944, with P-80s flying under combat conditions in Italy the next year.&#10;&#10;By the time of the Korean war, the aircraft was considered somewhat obsolete, but was at the forefront of the initial sorties across &lsquo;MiG Alley&rsquo;, of which 1500 flights were made in the first four months alone. It was on November 8th 1950 that a Shooting Star claimed the first MiG-15 shot down, in one of first ever instances of jet-to-jet combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, a big part of the strategy is how to lay your tiles and deploy your pieces to best achieve checkmate.&#10;&#10;The puzzle tiles create chasms and gaps that change the dynamic of chess. Each player gets 8 puzzle board tiles. An extra neutral piece is placed on the table first.&#10;&#10;The players randomly choose who goes first and take turns adding their puzzle tiles to the game board. If necessary, place one of your chess pieces on your tiles to avoid confusion about who placed which tile. After the board is completed and all tiles connect, arrange your chess pieces on your tiles where you think they work best for your strategy and the landscape of the battlefield. Whoever placed the first tile is the first to move a piece to begin a game.&#10;&#10;Pieces move as they do in a standard game, EXCEPT:&#10;&#10;     There are no PAWNS. They don&rsquo;t work on this kind of board.&#10;     Since KNIGHTS can jump, that means they can jump over gaps in the board. But they must still move in the classic &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape and be able to land on a physical square.&#10;     Even for tiles that don&rsquo;t connect by tabs, if their corners adjoin, BISHOPS may be able to cross from one piece to the next.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Japanese, the word &ldquo;Shi&rdquo; can mean, depending on the context, either &ldquo;the number four&rdquo; or &ldquo;death.&rdquo; That is why in Japan 4 is considered an unlucky number in much the same way 13 is in the West.&#10;&#10;Object: A player loses if reduced to 4 pieces.&#10;&#10;Samurais vs. Ninjas. Samurais go first.&#10;&#10;Pieces slide like a Chess Queen. There are 8 pieces per side, set up on the players first row.&#10;&#10;Jump Attack: Captures of enemies can only be made by jumping over a single, friendly piece along the path of attack. Any number of unoccupied spaces, including none, may exist between the attacking piece, the piece being jumped, and the piece to be captured. This is much like the attack of the Cannon piece in Chinese Chess. Except here the intervening &ldquo;screen&rdquo; must be a friendly piece and never an enemy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LnLT Battle Generator system allowing you to generate your own battles.  What we&rsquo;ve done is to add features that offer some generic systems for building your own battles. This allows players to mix and match forces from different games and even different eras. Players can have the Viet Cong forces from Heroes of the Nam face off against the German forces from Heroes of Normandy.&#10;&#10;We now provide two ways for this, the first is our Generic Unit Point System we&rsquo;ve designed, which can be applied to all games in the series. The second is our Pre-defined Unit Cost Charts. We have also kept the Pre-defined unit cost charts included in the previous Battle Generator. Players can use either the newer Generic Unit Point System or our Pre-defined Point Base Unit Costs. Moving forward, newly released games will include the Pre-defined Point Base Unit Cost Charts with the module rules. The amount of points is defined by the forces in the battle you want to play and then modified up or down by the variables of the battle. This means that you get to the action fast but allow the battle to be very flexible.&#10;&#10;This Battle Generator has been tailored to work with all Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical modules in the series past, present, and future. Players can mutually agree on one or all Battle Generator features they want to use, the choice is all yours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We gather within its walls tonight for one thing and one thing only. To play the game it has given us. Play bravely young champions towards the finals and towards the ultimate prize known to man&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;life!&rdquo;  The roar of the crowd erupts as the holographic Commissioner H.R. Cloverfield fades away.&#10;&#10;It is the year 2067. Mankind has regrouped after &ldquo;Gods departure,&rdquo; a series of natural disasters that devastated the world over two decades ago. The surviving populations are now divided by regions governed by various companies and ideas on how to reshape the future. Despite the isolation between societies, they all covet the same source of power. Etherium, also known as &ldquo;E-cellz&rdquo; is the highly efficient energy source of today. This power along with advanced formulas is only generated in the grand vessel amongst the clouds known as the Stadium.&#10;&#10;Stadium: A Sport Odyssey (or SASO) is a competitive two player collectible card-board game based loosely on the rules of good old American football. You and your opponent take on the role of Head Coaches hired by a company to take command of their team in the ongoing contest held in the Stadium. By playing with pre-constructed or your own customized team deck of cards, Coaches go head to head playing cards in phase turns. In the last phase the stats of the revealed cards played are tallied and determine the success of the play.&#10;&#10;The goal is simple; out think, outlast and outscore your opponent before time runs out. Calling the right plays, managing your players and spending momentum wisely are but a few of your tasks for victory. The real challenge is taking control and maintaining the Stadium&rsquo;s ever-changing environment. Whoever masters this&hellip;. masters the game and future of the world.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With thirteen new adventures and a branching storyline full of mystery and intrigue in and around the Kingdom of Dale, the trials presented by this campaign are sure to thrill even the most experienced Fellowship.&#10;&#10;The party has been summoned by King Bain, son of Bard the Bowman and current ruler of Dale. Concerning rumors have emerged of a dangerous shade stalking the land, cattle have been vanishing or turning up dead, and tensions are rising with the neighboring Dwarves in Erebor. At the behest of King Bain, you must convince the council of Dale that you are capable of investigating these rumors and&mdash;hopefully&mdash;able to combat the shade as well. However, time is of the essence, and there are more rumors than you will have the opportunity to chase.&#10;&#10;In Haunting of Dale, players will learn of multiple rumors regarding the shade and other events surrounding the region of Dale. They will need to decide which rumors to pursue, knowing that they cannot pursue all of them in a single playthrough. Depending on which leads they follow, the players will explore not only Dale and its surrounding farms and wilderness, but also the neighboring Erebor, where the party can seek the shade while gaining the friendship of the Longbeard Dwarves. These multiple branching paths make every playthrough of the Haunting of Dale campaign unique, allowing players to return to Dale again and again for plenty of thrilling adventures.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
