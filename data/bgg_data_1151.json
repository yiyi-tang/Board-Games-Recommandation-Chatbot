It includes a sound button, True Blue, which flashes bright blue and calls bullshit 70 different ways, 52 standard playing cards with original art, and a new wild card, the activist.&#10;&#10;The addition of the activist card allows stand alone play with three to six players.  BS Button Game Expansion Pack can also be combined with BS Button Game to accommodate up to twelve players.&#10;&#10;The activist is wild and can be played to call a rank out of sequence and force an opponent to discard that card or to bluff.  Players have the option of hitting the BS Button anytime they suspect a bluff.&#10;&#10;The first player who discards every card while avoiding a valid call of bullshit wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This book brings together several related exercises in game design. The game of Tetrad itself is the product of an effort to devise a simple game of abstract strategy for four players . . . .&#10;&#10;The Tetrad board was designed with several considerations in mind: to provide a layout well suited to a four-way game, to accommodate a wide variety of traditional games, and to be compact enough to fit on the cover of the book. . . .&#10;&#10;The TETRAD playing field consists of 120 octagonal spaces arranged in an octagonal pattern. This pattern is printed on both covers. The game is played on one side of the closed book. The playing pieces and dice are stored inside of the book.&#10;&#10;The game of TETRAD is designed to be played by exactly four people.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the book&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with six pieces of the same color. These are arranged in a row along one side of the board.&#10;&#10;At the center of the board is a group of four spaces. These are each marked with a symbol. The objective of the game is to group four of one's playing pieces at the center. The first player whose color occupies all four of these spaces at the same time, wins the game.&#10;&#10;The players take turns casting the dice and moving their pieces. A player begins a turn by casting the two dice. The score of the dice is the total number of steps that the player's pieces may be moved in that turn. One step is the movement of one piece from one space into the next. The pieces can be moved vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Moving your piece onto a space that is already occupied replaces your opponents color with your own.&#10;&#10;The TETRAD board can be used to play many other games; instructions for various and adapted games are included in the book.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Every second stone is fixed leaving a movable row of neutral tokens between them. This results in 4 moveable rows on the board.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a total of 9 tokens of which 3 are unnumbered and the rest has a number between 1 and 6. The players start shoving their tokens in the gaming board and try to push out the opponent's already placed stones. The clue about this is, that you only can insert a stone in a row if your total score supersedes your opponent's.&#10;&#10;If you manage to put all your tokens in the board you win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cannibal Collective is a party game for people who have a strong stomach.&#10;&#10;The premise of the game is simple, you have been invited to the 58th Annual Cannibal Collective initiation dinner and as part of the initiation you have to collect the very best bodyparts to comprise your meal.&#10;&#10;The first person to collect 1 of each of the 7 body part cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;But be warned! There are many other aspects at play! These include The Platypus of Doom, Mystic Lamp Wizards, Assassins, Cloaks of Invisibility, Martians, Zombies, Ninjas, Vampires, Psychics, Leprosy, Magicians, Chainsaws and more.&#10;&#10;You collect the body parts by using attack cards and wildcards to steal them from other players, as well as picking them up from the deck. You lose body parts when other players attack you, though you can use defence cards and wildcards to stop other player's attacks.&#10;&#10;Wildcards include the Magician card, where a player leaves the room and a card is hidden. They then have to find it and if they can't they lose 3 body parts.&#10;&#10;The game takes roughly 20 minutes to play but gets quicker as it progresses as the number of body parts in the deck dwindles.&#10;&#10;Each player can play as many cards as they want during their turn and ends their go when they pick up a card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What can you see at first?&#10;&#10;There are two coal armies lined up against each other. In the terrain where they move, every square obligates the characters to transform. When a character moves to a square of transformation, it has to change, but not only it&rsquo;s appearance  will be different, but it&rsquo;s ability to move and attack will be also changed.&#10;&#10;3 characters, 2 teams, 1 battle&#10;&#10;If I want to look for a similar game to Carbomorphozis, the first game that comes to my mind is the great, classic chess. Checkered board with 64 squares, 8 puppets, step and punch actions. However, while chess pieces are diverse with many features, we only have to count on 3 characters. And as long as everything is given in chess and victory depends solely on tactics, in Carbomorphozis the characters change from one step to another and this influences the outcome of the party and the applied military plan.&#10;&#10;This board game is educational as well, because it combines three types of carbon in our minds for a lifetime. Thanks to the variety of the board, there are 256 different playing fields.&#10;&#10;You can start the game on any side, giving you 1024 different play options, so the chance of repeating play is 1 to 1000, it means you won't get bored during the replays.&#10;&#10;The playing time is relatively short, 20-30 minutes, so it is suitable for you if you have just little freetime. It doesn't need too much preparation, just take it out from the box and the game can begin. Another advantage is that it does not take place on too much space, so you can play it even while traveling by train.&#10;&#10;I walk, I walk ... but what will happen to me when I stop?&#10;&#10;The main driver of the game is transformation. Since it is a transformation of coal, the name of the game is the result of the fusion of the Latin name of carbon (carbon) and the Latin word for transformation (metamorphosis).&#10;&#10;The pictograms on the game board symbolize a transformation. The given square determines what character should step on it in order that the carbomorphosis  can occur. It also specifies the new material structure.&#10;&#10;Coal here or there&hellip; or is it already graphite?&#10;&#10;There are three actions that you can take in the game: move, punch and transform. The first one and the second one are the player's decision, and the third one is the result of that decision. It is determined by the player&rsquo;s move with the selected character or the square where the character is moved after the punch.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to beat all of your opponent's characters on the playing field. The more valuable our puppets are, the easier the task is for us and the harder for the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is as loose as the connection between the layers of graphite&#10;&#10;What do we obtain with this game? The game primarily focuses on concentration and foresight, and therefore develops tactical skill. Because the rule is simple and easy to understand, the character's stepping and punching features are depicted on the characters themselves, and the transformations on the game board, so there is no need to learn the rules separately. The game can be started instantaneously and does not require lengthy learning.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, circumstances change so this board game is suitable for the more impatient children, too ; because it inspires them to make flexible decisions and modify easily  the previously planned steps.&#10;&#10;If the players are children, the game can match to their forward thinking, which is only 1-2 steps. But nevertheless, it may require 4-5 step forward thinking from adult players, so the same game can be fun for all ages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jan-Ken-Po (a Hawaiian name for Rock-Scissors-Paper) is a collectible card game with eighty cards in total, of which each box contains a random and poorly collated fifty. It is possible to get five of the same weapon in one set.  &#10; The game is set on Krone II (according to the box) or Pangea (according to the rulebook), where a centuries-old war has created three clans: the Paper Clan (yellow), the Scissors Clan (magenta) and the Stone Clan (blue). Most cards show badly drawn members of each clan and their weapons.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously reveal the top card on their deck, and stone cards beats scissors cards, scissors beat paper, and paper beats stone. With the exception of resolving ties and a 3-player version, that's the rules. Except there are rare monsters that beat all the clan cards, the wizard Jan-Ken-Po who beats everything, and a 'You Lose!' card ('the Herb of Destruction'), which must be played on yourself and makes you lose.&#10;&#10;An attempt to cash in on the CCG boom of the mid 1990s, the game is noted for its low production values, amateurish art that is often printed sideways on the cards, a backstory that makes no sense, and gameplay that  takes Rock-Scissors-Paper and removes all the skill and tactics.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slavisti is an abstract strategy game that comes with matches. It seems very simple at first glance, but is a game with strategic depth. It is designed as a non-commercial game.&#10;&#10;Each player has two play areas on the table. In one area, only Roman numbers of 1s (I) 5s (V) and 10s (X) are formed with sticks. In the other area forms are laid. With the exception of the first stick, in the second area, sticks may only be laid at one end of a laying stick. So that both created an angle of 60, 90 or 180 degrees. It usually creates squares and equilateral triangles.&#10;A special feature of the game is that a player can also lay sticks in the opposing areas. If you have laid down a stick in the enemy area, which has an open side, you may only lay there again, if you can lay a stick there, which is then closed at both ends. If that does not work, you can only lay down sticks in your own area.&#10;When all the sticks have been laid, you can only lay sticks; never taking away the last laid wood. In the end, no stick may have an open end. &#10;The goal is to match the number of shapes (rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, and triangles) with the number of the Roman numeral.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A deck of cards shows the start or end letters of words, and on the other side a topic or theme. The deck is shuffled and placed showing the theme side face-up. Then two cards are dealt to the table, flipped to show the characters. One letter to start the word, one to end the word. Players race to identify a word that fits the topic, and starts and ends accordingly. The first to get it right collects cards and scores points.&#10;&#10;The publisher states that the shuffling of the deck will produce a large variety of combinations, keeping the game fresh to play with very simple rules. The publisher also says you can play the game with more players than shown on the box.&#10;&#10;There were three subsequent editions published with new themes.&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188; (Word Sniper Family) - with softer themes aimed at age 5+&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#179; (Word Sniper Imagine) - with more abstract themes to encourage imaginative answers&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160; (Word Sniper Extreme) - an expansion deck that adds more context to the themes, and has more letter forms on the flip side.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#232;&#161;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#141; &#10;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#231;&#180;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#159;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#229;&#165;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

The cards work the same as the original game, with themes on one side and letters on the reverse. But the theme is tucked onto a base card (like a pillow on a bed), and so adds a more complex context to the theme. Likewise, the letter side of the cards show several characters, forcing more challenging solutions.&#10;&#10;",

Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914 looks at what happened before the Battle of Jutland: Helgoland Bight, the Scarborough Raid, the Yarmouth Raid and more.&#10;Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914' is different from other works on the North Sea campaign, thanks to its ties to our Great War at Sea: Jutland game. We look at how the game simulates the operations, and then we flesh them out with more battle scenarios &ndash; fast-playing actions using just the Tactical Map, where you fight out the battles between ships with guns and torpedoes.&#10;Jutland, the game, has a lot of scenarios: 51 in total. Forty-four of those are operational scenarios, but only seven of them are battle scenarios. So the Battle Analysis adds 26 more of them, based on the surface actions that could have taken place &ndash; or at least one side hoped would take place &ndash; based on the expectations of one or both naval staffs when they sent the fleets to sea. Plus nine new operational scenarios.&#10;Jutland is already a very fine game (our most popular ever, even more than Third Reich) and a good instrument through which to re-play history. The Battle Analysis makes it even more so, while adding more quick fun by fleshing out the battle scenario aspect of the game.&#10;Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914 is a 64-page, large-format book supplement for Jutland; you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the game to play most of the scenarios and Cruiser Warfare to play all of them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bossbattle Bunnies is a short, fun card game for 3-6 players. In this game you embark on a 10-20 minute bunny-themed dungeon crawl with your friends. You'll find loot, get cursed, fight monsters, and most importantly, test your friendships. It's easy to learn the game as you go along, so grab a beer (or a lemonade) and go adventuring!&#10;&#10;As if a pocket-size dungeon crawl wasn't awesome enough already, this game doubles as regular playing cards. That means you can use it for Poker, Solitaire, Go fish and all the other classics. Talk about value-for-money! You can even take it to the bar, do some tricks and sweep someone off their feet. Just be sure to send me an invite to the wedding if you do!&#10;&#10;Bossbattle Bunnies originally had my own artstyle for consistency, but then I figured it would be way cooler to have many different artists (18 in total) contribute to this project in their own style. This resulted in 54 unique illustrations that together turn this 2-in-1 deck of cards into a portable museum!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If there are no identical cards on the playing area, players move to the next step.&#10;&#10;When there are two identical cards on the playing area, the first player to hit the disc matching the character on them taes a card from his own pile and covers one of the identical cards.&#10;Players move on to the next step only when there are no identical cards on the playing area.&#10;&#10;Note: Identical cards may be found in any column, not necessarily facing each other. In that case, players proceed in the same way. The player who is the quickest to hit the right disc covers one of the identical cards using a card from his own pile.&#10;&#10;The first player to play the last card on his pile wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Not every moment will prove to be popular though, as players watch the trending topics change round after round.

Players draft cards from an open area each round with the final, unselected card becoming the trending topic (thematically this is to say that no matter what the players end up posting there is always something cooler than all of them&hellip; they are wannabe influencers after all!). After drafting players add a card from their hand to their feed (a row of cards in front of them). They then score based on chaining categories together (such as 3 Food posts in a row) and also earn points for matching the trending topic. As rounds proceed players remove cards from the end of their feed, placing them in their discard, making only their most relevant posts matter.&#10;&#10;A casual, filler game, learned in minutes, Influencer is a lightweight experience that allows its designer, Peter J&uuml;rgensen, to play with humor and satire regarding a topic that many people can relate to.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Fighting Chance choose one of four heroes to try and save the city. But everyone wants to be the best hero in the city, not only do you battle a collection of increasingly powerful rouges, you are trying to be a better hero than the heroes beside you.&#10;&#10;Fighting Chance is a cooperative game of every person for themselves.&#10;&#10;Fighting Chance is a game of three battle rounds to see who can become the strongest hero and save they City between two phases: training and battle.&#10;&#10;Training Round &#10;Players can play two training cards from the training pile.  Follow any instructions on the training card. Put the used training cards in the training discard pile.  Players must discard their remaining training card.  At the beginning of the next training round players may draw three training cards again, but still play only two.  If there are not enough cards in the training card draw pile, shuffle the training card discard pile.  There is a training card called Diversify Your Portfolio, this card allows players to gain two of any attribute, but it may also be split between to attributes.&#10;&#10;Battle Round &#10;Once the heroes are trained let the battle begin. &#10;Flip over the rouge for round 1.  Place the energy marker on the rogue board.&#10;In additional rounds flip over round two&rsquo;s rogue at the beginning of the battle round for round two, and round three&rsquo;s rogue at the beginning of battle round three.&#10;Note any special abilities that this rogue may have.  If a rogue is immune to solo attacks of level X, a player may play a solo attack if their skill exceeds the immunity.  For example if a rogue is immune to solo attacks of three or greater of mysticism, but the player has a level four or greater of mysticism, they may still attack at this level.  &#10;The most experienced player should go first.&#10;For the first round each player gets dealt seven cards, but has a hand size of three.  They players draw three cards in their hand, and draw up to three at the beginning of each turn.  If the player discards all their Battle Cards during a round, they are out of the round, but live to fight another day. &#10;For round two each player gets dealt eight cards with a hand size of four.&#10;For round three each player gets dealt ten cards with a hand size of five.&#10;At the end of each round place all unused cards in the discard pile.  Shuffle the Battle Cards and deal them for the next round.&#10;&#10;They player with the most points at the end of round three wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ramo is a game that has the best parts from Contract Rummy, Mahjong and Uno combined, hence the name RAMO.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the least amount of points after playing the 8th level.&#10;&#10;For each hand, each player's object is to complete and lay down his/her current level&rsquo;s requirement, and then rid their hand of remaining cards by discarding them on laid-down levels, called &quot;expanding&quot;. The player who does this first wins the hand and scores minus fifty; all other players earn penalty points according to the value of cards remaining in their hand.&#10;&#10;In each round the players reduce the value of the cards held in their hands by laying on the table those cards that fit the requirement of his/her own level which consists of Sets and Runs.&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Set consists of three or four cards, all different colored&#10;     A Run consists of three or more cards in sequence, all same colored &#10;     The 13th card can be used in the middle when making Runs (eg: 12-13-1)&#10;&#10;&#10;There are 60 cards in one deck, and two decks are used in a 3 or 5-player game, three decks for more players:&#10;&#10;     52 numbered cards: each valued from 1 to 13, in four different colors. &#10;     two Wild cards&#10;     one Skip card&#10;     one -1 card&#10;     two x2 cards&#10;     one +3 card &#10;     one ? card&#10;&#10;&#10;The Deal&#10;&#10;The first player (dealer) shuffles the deck and before dealing, the next player &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; the deck, the dealer then deals 13 cards to the next player, and 12 cards to the rest of the players, the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the Draw Deck, the player with the 13 cards in hand discards one card from his/her hand to start a Discard Pile, then the game continues counter-clockwise.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player:&#10;&#10;     Draws either the face-up top card of the Discard Pile or one card from the deck.&#10;     May lay down their completed round-appropriate collection of Sets and Runs.&#10;     May play off other players who have laid down once they have laid down themselves.&#10;     May discard one card from their hand onto the discard pile. When a player discards a card that could have been played off on their own or another player's laid cards is a &quot;Ramo&quot;. Only players that are LAID DOWN may call out Ramo. The FIRST player to call Ramo must take the discarded one card to make a new Set or Run, or expand any laid down cards in the game even if it&rsquo;s not his/her turn. The regular counter-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for Ramo if the player who calls Ramo is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues counter-clockwise from the player who calls Ramo. If multiple players call Ramo for a discarded card, priority for the discard goes to the player who calls out Ramo first. &#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues, in alternating turns, until one player goes out, or has no cards left in their hand. A player goes out when he successfully discards the only remaining card in hand, marking the conclusion of the step for all players.&#10;&#10;It is customary to announce other players when there is only one card left in your hand. This alerts other players of closeness to going out. Points are tallied and recorded by a score-keeper. All of the cards are shuffled and the next round of play commences. Whoever has the most amount of scores (penalties), deals the next round (Level).&#10;&#10;Level requirements:&#10;&#10;     two sets&#10;     one set and one run&#10;     two runs&#10;     three sets&#10;     two sets and one run&#10;     one set and two runs&#10;     three runs&#10;     four sets or four runs&#10;&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Five points for each card remaining in hand with value 1-9&#10;Ten points for each card remaining in hand with value 10-13&#10;Twenty points for each Special Card remaining in hand&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The alliance between House Tully and House Stark is one of the strongest in Westeros. The two have been taking to the field together for generations. In its darkest hour, House Stark knows it can rely on House Tully to be there, sending their best troops to engage the enemy. And those best troops are arguably the Tully Cavaliers, some of the most resilient and well-trained cavalry units in the land. House Stark players will soon be able to add this stalwart unit to their ranks. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what these riders can do.&#10;&#10;If there is one thing the House Tully Cavaliers are known for, it&rsquo;s their devastating charges. While cavalry units of all types are known for strong charge attacks, the Tully Cavaliers&rsquo; make any other cavalry&rsquo;s charge seem quaint by comparison. On the tabletop, this is represented by the Cavalier&rsquo;s Lance attack. It rolls six dice whenat full ranks and gains several bonuses when charging, including: 3 extra dice, Critical Blow, and Sundering. So, they have more dice to attack with, gain extra Hits when they roll 6s, and the enemy&rsquo;s Defense Save is reduced. Truly, they can devastate an enemy formation with an attack like that. The Cavalier&rsquo;s best bet is to charge in and wipe out an enemy right away.&#10;&#10;However, assuming that doesn&rsquo;t happen, the Cavaliers aren&rsquo;t entirely helpless. Their own Defense Save is a very sturdy 3+ and their Morale is a 5+. The unit will not easily be taking Wounds and will be passing most Morale Tests they make, even if they are given some sort of disadvantage.&#10;&#10;The view of a unit of Tully Cavaliers baring down on their enemies is enough to raise the morale of surrounding troops. This is brought to the tabletop via the unit&rsquo;s Embolden ability. It grants other friendly units within Short Range a +1 to their Morale test rolls. This means more of the Stark player&rsquo;s rolls will be successful and fewer models will be removed when a test is made. As such, the Cavaliers are a great centerpiece, literally, to any army.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players go through phases of examining the safe, declaring a robbery, then dividing up the spoils. And one player is secretly a detective, trying to spoil the thieves attempts.&#10;&#10;The $Billions is stored in a safe, but only one of four locations actually has the money. Players start by examing the decks to find it (players can lie about what they find). When a player feels sure, they declare the job is on and players play bid cards face-down. If the total bid beats the target, the safe is cracked. Then the players bid again in an auction to divide up the loot (matching bids are cancelling). At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;If the detective can make the robberies fail, or recover the loot, the thieves fail.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MAZE . . . is a game to entertain people of all ages. It is a two player game which combines strategy with chance.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get all four of your playing pieces on the center dot (and off the board) before your opponent does.&#10;&#10;Players start their men on opposite ends of the board. During the game, each player tries to get past the network of walls which his opponent is building against him. As he removes walls that are blocking him, he repositions them where he feels they will most hinder his opponent. Each tries to reach the center red dot (which is the only way off the board).&#10;&#10;With both players heading for the center red exit dot they will often find themselves facing each other with no walls between them. These head to head encounters create exciting situations in which one or more pieces can be sent back to their respective &quot;jail&quot; corners to start over again.&#10;&#10;The game is quite simple and lots of fun. The advantage can swing from one player to the other and back again many times throughout the entire game.&#10;&#10;MAZE is [a wooden product] produced on home-made machines, silk-screened and assembled by hand. It is not a factory product, and is only offered in limited quantities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the inside of the box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Depths of Courage volume 10&quot; is a solitaire wargame on a proposed Italian mini-sub attack on New York Harbor during the summer of 1943. The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the three, two-man crew S.L.C. (Siluro a Lenta Corsa) Maiale (Pig) class and CA 2 mini-submarines. You must endeavor to overcome the US defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or escaping.&#10;&#10;An Italian raid with by their frogmen was seriously planned and approved by both the Regia Marina and the Decima Mas. The planned raid was to have taken place in December 1943, but for game purposes I&rsquo;ve moved it up to the summer of that year, before fascist Italy&rsquo;s invasion and surrender.&#10;&#10;A raid on the US was desirable for a number of reasons by the Italian naval high command. Potential targets in the Mediterranean were, by late 1942, well aware and experienced with the Italian raiders, and Allied defensive measures were increasingly deadly. The early 1942 German Operation Drumbeat U-Boat offensive, dubbed the &ldquo;Happy Time&rdquo;, exposed serious weaknesses and deficiencies in the US coastal and harbor defenses. A successful strike at the most prominent harbor in the US would be a tremendous psychological as well as military victory for the Axis cause. However, when it was proposed to their German allies in late 1941, Admiral Doenitz declined to support the operation with any U-Boats, but did approve sending any and all intelligence they came across to support Italian raid.&#10;&#10;Unlike the frogmen raids conducted at Gibraltar, Alexandria, Algeciras and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the raid on New York would also include the newest mini-submarine in the Italian navy&rsquo;s arsenal, the CA 2. Armed with two torpedoes, these small submarines were so top secret they were never entered into the Regia Marina&rsquo;s Order of Battle. Similar CA 5 type mini-submarines had raised havoc in the Black Sea and Adriatic, sinking numerous vessels and supporting blockades of enemy held ports. The CA 2 mini-sub and its crew, as well as the frogmen&rsquo;s Maiale submersibles, would have to be ferried to the target area by a much larger submarine. The only one capable of doing so in the Italian navy was the fleet submarine Leonardo da Vinci. Modifications to its hull to transport the CA 2 were made in German occupied Bordeaux, and training of its crew and the raiders done in ultra-high secrecy in the Bay of Biscay. However, in May the Leonardo da Vinci was surprised and sunk by the British destroyer HMS Active and frigate HMS Ness with all hands. By that time Sicily was invaded and the Mussolini government soon over-thrown. The chaos that Italy descended to, and the new government&rsquo;s later decision to cast their lot with the Allies, rendered the raid on New York to the dust bin of history.&#10;&#10;Could the Italian navy pull off what no other nation had achieved since the War of 1812? I hope all who play Depths of Courage volume 10 learn and enjoy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The lunges, parries and infinite combinations thereof allow players to enter a world where cunning and skill win the day&hellip;not strength or size.  The basic lunges and control cards are used to score points, the parries and movement cards to prevent touches, and the Specialty cards are used in combination with the previous cards for  spectacular and powerful effects.&#10;&#10;True to international foil fencing rules, Quicksteel gives players a tabletop equivalent to actual fencing.  The goal of every match is to be the first to score 5 points/touches (Competition mode involves 3 matches requiring a total of 15 points to win).&#10;&#10;Quicksteel grants players a glimpse into the world of fencing, into the mind of a fencer and into one of the most ancient forms of combat &ndash; the duel.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each region has upper limits on the capacity of characters, livestock and crops.&#10;&#10;The game has economic and military features. Each player starts with a single clan region and tries to gain control over additional clans by conquering more regions. The goal is to be the first to occupy a certain number of clans depending on the number of players. Conquests are made by troop movements.&#10;&#10;To spread, players can move their pawns to neighbouring regions. Empty regions can be occupied. In occupied regions peaceful coexistence or conflicts can occur, which are then solved by figure majorities.&#10;&#10;Conquered areas are farmed and generate income in the form of money and agricultural resource yields.&#10; Each clan has a knight. By participating in tournaments, which are driven by dice rolling, knights can gain weapons and shields that increase their fighting power and are thus useful in conquering, protecting and managing areas.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is divided in 3 phases (build-up, protection and endgame) with 4 seasons each.&#10;&#10;",
