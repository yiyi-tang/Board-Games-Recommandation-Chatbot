    "Description": "Sim Serim is an abstract game designed for two players (or two teams consisting of two players each).&#10;&#10;This game by Heinrich Glumpler is played on a square wooden board with 7&times;7 fields where the fields in two corners are replaced by icons representing the players (&quot;moon&quot; and &quot;sun&quot;). The players sit at the corner of the board showing their respective icon.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. At the start of each round players reveal 1 to 4 stones of their color simultaneously. The number of revealed stones decides the order in which both players place their stones on the board.&#10;&#10;The player do not have a lot of choice when placing their stones since new stones must be placed in the current row - meaning: the row where the last stone was placed in the previous round. Only after the current row is filled completely the active player may select a new row by placing a stone at the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;It is much more important to foresee the order in which stones are placed since the resulting patterns on the board will decide the number of points each player gets at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The special flavour of the game results from the fact, that the scoring takes place in the vertical and horizontal lines of the board - running in a 45 degree angle to the rows where the stones were placed.&#10;&#10;Players earn points for each magic wand, meaning each combination of exactly three stones lying in line and adjacent to each other. The tricky part is, that a player will lose points for any magic wand that is too long - having more than three stones.&#10;&#10;",

One page of rules, fantastic graphics on the map, 20 plastic miniatures, dice, and hours of simple war gaming fun.&#10;&#10;This game is not designed to simulate, it is a game.  Fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, and even mothers with children will love the simplicity and speed (most games last less than 30 minutes).  Old school gamers will also love it as a quick fix game.&#10;&#10;It is 1940.  Players choose the Allies or the Axis to play.  The board has preset armies for both side that begin on the board.  A game last 15 turns unless a clear winner before then.  Some turns have preset first phase players, some the players dice for initiative.  On those turns player get to go first automatically, they also receive reinforcements.  Essentially, the allies must hold out until mid-game or they are going to loose.  The Germans must win quick, or the allies will eventually overwhelm them.  Hey! Just like the real war...&#10;&#10;The game uses very simple mechanics for movement and combat, and it is in no way a simulation.  The idea is to provide a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game for those who don't have time to play a more involved wargame.&#10;&#10;The concept behind the Battle Box series is simple and fun:  Play when you can.  The game is perfect for introducing young would be generals to wargaming, as even as early as 10 years old the rules and concepts are easily grasped.&#10;&#10;Available at  www.flamingmonkeygames.com&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Champion Game of Baseball was published by the Proctor Amusement Company of North Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1889. It consists of a baseball field printed on the bottom of the box with a metal spinner in the middle, a rules sheet, and an envelope with nine blue and nine red cardboard disks.&#10;&#10;There is not a lot of strategy in this early game - each team uses the spinner on its turn to bat. Most of the results are either outs or hits (spaces for single, double, triple and home run), but there also are spaces for strikes, balls and base on balls. It is therefore possible but unlikely to get three strikes or four balls. There is one space for a foul ball, and any spinner stopping on a line is considered a foul as well.&#10;&#10;The one strategic option open to the batting team is whether to have base runners try to steal. In this event, the stealing team spins again, but uses an outer ring where the results are divided between &quot;out&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;sacrifice&quot; (where the runner advances but the current batter is out). An out result always picks off the lead runner.&#10;&#10;* * see corrections in Community Wiki below&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There were a few more real life dictators in the world when this game was published in 1939.  Very little information can be found about this board game.&#10;&#10;Update - The game comes with many lead minatures (8 Aviators representing each player, 12 submarines, 8 Battleships and 16 aeroplanes). Definitely the king of game play pieces by weight alone.   The map contains a circle of spaces surrounded by 3 territories which hold the game's key resources- Manchukuo (Iron), Dutch East Indies (Oil) &amp; Ukraine (Wheat).  The game play spaces have actions (like collect $4 million or capture enemy plane) or consequences (sub sunk) and even political events (revolt, coup or treaty - which are separate cards).&#10;&#10;The center of the board represents the armament factory and all the minatures begin there to be bought by the player as they build up their forces. The players move around the circle by the roll of the dice collecting and losing money, armaments and political cards to be used in the game.   The goal of the game is to collect military forces so that you can control the 3 territories (1 at a time or if you are strong enough, all at once). The players move military units into and out of the territories on their turns, conquering weaker opponents (and taking their units).   If you have the required military units in the territory and you have earned a propaganda card (by landing on the right space) you gain the resource of that territory.  Having all 3 resources wins the game.&#10;&#10;It is believed that even copies in very good to very fine condition, used copies that may even be missing a part or two, were worth between $500 and $600 as recently as the year 2000.  For those looking for this game, it comes in a long red box with the word &quot;Dictator&quot; written across the front in red lettering on top of a curved white stripe.&#10;&#10;",

Interestingly, the game time is set at the beginning.

The board has a circular track with a number of spaces representing Australian &amp; International businesses (of which all contributed to have the game published). A portion of each company may be purchased by players landing on the relevant space (called 'chairs'), to a maximum of three. The cost of 'chairs' are controlled by the current economic climate, which can vary. Cash is received from players landing on businesses owned by other players ('rents'), using a multiplier depending on the number of chairs owned. Other spaces on the board control the economic climate, income &amp; sales tax payments, receiving dividends &amp; buying or selling of new chairs. &#10;The game ends after a pre-determined time (90 minutes is suggested in the rules leaflet), at which time the player with the largest net worth wins (consisting of cash on hand plus the  current value of chairs).&#10;&#10;",

The remaining cards in the other suits (A to 10 in spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds) make the other four suits.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re starting a hand, you must play one or more cards of only one suit (S, H, C, D, royals). Play passes to your left.&#10;&#10;When play passes to you, you may pass or play. If you pass, play passes to your left. If you play, you must play a homogeneous set of cards that beats what was most recently played. The rank of the card you play is irrelevant, but the number of cards you play and their suit is relevant.&#10;&#10;Suit Ranking:&#10;Hearts beat spades and clubs. Clubs beat hearts and diamonds. Diamonds beat clubs and royals. Royals beat diamonds and spades. Spades beat royals and hearts.&#10;&#10;If the most recent play was one heart, you can play one club, or one spade, or two hearts. You can not play more than what you need to beat what was played; you can&rsquo;t play three or more hearts or two or more clubs or spades.&#10;&#10;Short play example:&#10;Alice starts a hand by playing two clubs. Bob plays three clubs. Cathy passes. Dan plays three diamonds. Alice passes. Bob passes. Cathy plays three royals. Dan plays four royals. Alice plays four diamonds. Bob plays four clubs. Cathy plays four hearts. Dan passes. Alice plays five hearts. Bob, Cathy, and Dan all pass and Alice takes the hand.&#10;&#10;If play passes back to you and you were the last player to play, you get the ewe totem and all of the cards played go face-down into your Wool Pile. You get a one-point bonus to your score. The hand is over.&#10;&#10;If all players have cards left in hand, the player to the left of the player with the ewe starts the next hand. If at least one player is out of cards the round is over. If you have cards in hand at the end of a round, you lose one point for every card in your hand. If you have the ewe at the end of a round, you get a two-point bonus to your score.&#10;&#10;If the round is over, count the number of cards in your Wool Pile and have the scorekeeper add that to your score. If one or more players have 100 points or more, the game is over. If the game is not over, collect and shuffle all of the cards.&#10;&#10;If you have the ewe at the end of the game, you get a 5-point bonus to your score.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to score points with the dice (10,000 to win) and strategically use the Upset cards to beat your opponent.  Players strategize not only on how and when they play their cards, but also how to get or avoid getting the cards.  However, the special dice contain letters as well as numbers and if someone rolls the word &quot;Upset,&quot; then everyone else, no matter how close they are to winning, must restart from scratch.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.playupset.com/&#10;&#10;",

Modified skiffs will be available as landing craft for those poor Marines without ground assault variants of the local gunboats. Many unique ships are in this product. The Federation is getting a National Guard survey cruiser, while the Klingons get the AD5W escort. The Romulans are getting the FAK and FAB, while the Tholians are getting heavy web tenders. The Andromedans are getting a construction station, while the Orions get a special new ship everyone will want (to kill). The Lyrans make out like bandits with tug, scout, and carrier variants of their NCA. Isolated ISC outposts are building system defense variants of their destroyers and frigates as well as a unique blockade-running cruiser.&quot;&#10;&#10;Module R11 is due out at the time of Origins 2007.&#10;&#10;",

Kanji symbols are visual representations of words, word fragments or entire ideas.  While there are as many as 50,000 Kanji in existence, Japanese people use only about 2,000 today.&#10;&#10;For 2 to 4 players ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;THE OBJECT:  To be the player to collect the most points by the end of the round.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:  The Kanji game has three levels of play.  Set up the double-sided playing board according to the level of play you choose.  Divide the 176 cards into four card groups:  GO, 1-2-3, Kanji and Dot.  Give the arrow a spin and let the race begin.&#10;&#10;A card is drawn and players must think and react quickly as they learn how to speak, read and visualize Kanji symbols.  The first player to find the card's exact match on the playing board (matching color and symbol) and to place his or her pawn on the match wins the card.  Did you draw a Kanji Samurai card?  Now you must draw the Kanji symbol, the final step in putting it all together!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points at the end of the round wins that game!  Sounds easy?  Think again!&#10;&#10;What are you learning?  Not only are players learning the elements of a foreign language, they are also building the skills necessary to improve mathematics, memory, concentration and visual relationships while actively being motivated to think, respond and learn!&#10;&#10;",
