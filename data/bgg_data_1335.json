Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.&#10;&#10;King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.&#10;&#10;For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.&#10;&#10;Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and out think them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.&#10;&#10;With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone else's. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

All of them, that is, except one! &#10;&#10;When your grandfather, Howard Carter, discovered the remains of the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamen, he believed there was another tomb connected to the first. A hidden tomb. A Lost Mummy. Now, many hard years and one fateful slip later, you find yourself trapped in that very tomb! Will you escape, or will you become just another lost memory buried under the sand?&#10;&#10;The Lost Mummy is a printable escape room game that transforms any space into a kids escape room experience. The game is designed to challenge 10 &ndash; 13 year-old children. It combines the teamwork, tension, and puzzle-solving of escape rooms with the laid-back ease of group party games.&#10;&#10;Players will work together to escape from an ancient Egyptian tomb before time runs out. Gameplay is centered on a series of sequential puzzle sheets hidden around the room. Each puzzle solved progresses the story, and puts you one step closer to escaping the Lost Mummy&rsquo;s tomb. Game setup is quick and spoiler-free, and hints are handled by an online hint system that players access on their smartphones. This means that no game master is required to supervise the experience, so you can join the game alongside your players.&#10;&#10;The game can expand to accommodate any number of players by dividing your group into teams of 2-4, and then having them race against each other to see who escapes first. In addition, you can edit the game file before printing to customize your own escape room experience.&#10;&#10;Will you solve the mystery of the mummy&rsquo;s tomb, before you&rsquo;re trapped here forever?&#10;&#10;",

With the help of colourful renditions of the original Zener cards as well as your very own minds, you and your friends can perform the same scientific experiment to disover which one of you has the greatest capacity for telepathic communication - or simply is the luckiest. Who knows? See for yourself!&#10;&#10;Telepatio is turn-based and played over 24 rounds, or until the first player reaches 17 or -11 ESP points. You score ESP points by successfully sending or receiving the correct telepathic signals.&#10;&#10;Every round a player assumes the role of a 'Sender'. The Sender rolls the Zener dice with the dice cup and views the result in secrecy. The Sender then flips over the hourglass, and must try to telepathically communicate the right Zener symbol to the other players. No words or visual cues of any kind are allowed, you must rely on the power of your mind.&#10;&#10;By the time the hourglass runs out all other players, known as 'Recipients', must have chosen a Zener card with the symbol they believe is being telepathically sent to them. The Sender then reveals their dice roll and Recipients reveal their cards. Was the Sender successful in communicating the Zener symbol? Did the Recipients read Sender's mind, or did they score by simple guesswork?&#10;&#10;If a Recipient chooses the wrong card, the Recipient moves one step back. The Sender moves as many steps forward as the number of correct matches from the Recipients, plus two extra steps. If the Sender does not match up with any of the Recipients, the Sender stays put.&#10;&#10;The player with the most ESP points after 24 rounds is the most telepathic of the players, or does it all come down to luck?&#10;&#10;",

Grid poker uses a 3x3 array of cards from which players make two poker hands simultaneously. Players form one poker hand using the communal cards in the rows of the grid and another poker hand using the communal cards in the columns. Additionally, each card has unique game effects which players can use to influence the outcome.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a 3x3 grid of communal cards is dealt. This is called &quot;the market&quot;. Each player is dealt 7 cards and selects 2 of them to form a company. Each turn players can use the game effect on one card in their company and one from the cards in their hands. Then, in the grid poker phase, players use their company and hand cards to simultaneously form two poker hands. One of the poker hands must use their company cards and another must use cards from their hand. One of the poker hands must use the row cards and the other the column cards in the market. The best poker hand among the rows is determined and scores the row winner point(s). Then, the best poker hand among the column hands is determined and scores the column winner point(s). Companies can be improved each round using hand cards. The game ends after four rounds.&#10;&#10;Grid Poker uses the Tech Deck which is a game system. Each Tech Deck card has game effects, a value and domain (suit). The Tech Deck is designed to serve as the basis for many other games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Boer War is based on the conflict between the British Empire and the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, which started in 1899 (generally known as the Second Boer War). The game covers the first year of the war; the conventional phase when the Boers could have gained a conventional victory. The latter part of the war was primarily a guerrilla conflict that did not officially end until 1902 and by which point a British victory was pretty much inevitable. In the game, each player is trying to seize an early victory: the British, in order to forestall the aforementioned guerrilla war, the Boers to gain sufficient support in Europe for their claims to full independence.&#10;&#10;The game has three scenarios. Two of them begin with the commencement of hostilities in October 1899 and the initial Boer successes. The third begins with Lord Roberts taking command of British forces and launching the counteroffensive which took the major Boer towns.&#10;&#10;Boer War Game Scale. One hexagon = approximately 90 kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations. A corps represents two or three divisions plus corps echelon troops. A field force (division group) represents one or two reinforced divisions. A commando, brigade, or group represents 1-4000 fighting men.&#10;&#10;",

These tokens are turned into dungeon gems. The first player to collect 3 dungeon gems is the winner.&#10;&#10;FCMT uses the novel Fate Deck system for determining encounter outcomes.

Players progress through the dungeon by peeking at cards, revealing cards and trying to overcome the challenges they encounter.&#10;&#10;By overcoming these challenges, which include traps, monsters and more, players will be rewarded with dungeon tokens. Each time a player earns 5 tokens, they are awarded a dungeon gem.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has 3 of these gems, they are declared the winner and the greatest dungeon delver of all time.&#10;&#10;",

The card games are designed to create a vibrant, thrilling and engaging atmosphere between players. Each participant will compete against the others or in team, depending on the card game.&#10;&#10;Asgard is a bluffing game where players must act as a Norse deity while bluffing to stay undercoven. The last one remaining alive wins the match.&#10;Omen is a push-your-luck &amp; memory game where players place bets to guess the number of cards on the board. Omen cards act as a jolly and can turn luck and memory against everybody.&#10;Valhalla is a combat game where players compete against each other and against monsters to remain the last man standing in the arena.&#10;&#10;Once the games are complete, the results and the points obtained by the players, together, form the traits of their characers in Mask of Loki, the Role-playing game that acts as a forth module. The game comes with a handy game manual explaining the rules: Mask of Loki, in fact, is a very simple game (it takes half an hour to be mastered) that rewards cooperative play and awards poor luck in the previous character creation session.&#10;&#10;Hours of funny, thrilling and amazing adventures in the Norse society are waiting for you.

Invest in properties and companies, accumulating wealth and doing business around the world, with this strategy game that will make you a millionaire.&#10;&#10;Imperio (&quot;Empire&quot;) is a board game, in which each player will try to build their own business empire. Inspired by the market economy, Imperio proposes to simulate the economic growth of people in the real world, through the purchase of goods in any of the 34 cities of the planisphere.&#10;&#10;You will be able to acquire houses, buildings, restaurants and hotels or set up your own factory to sell products all over the planet and manage them by moving with your own plane. You can even have your own casino, while increasing your economic power. These goods can be purchased in any of the 34 cities in which the planisphere is divided, while you move along the path of the board with your avatar. Your profession can also help in this exciting enrichment career. The acquisition of new cities will allow you to increase the number of goods at your disposal, giving you greater chances of winning the game.&#10;&#10;Although the objective is common to all players, the strategy is their own, so taking into account market conditions, at any time during the game, you can change your strategy to win the game. The first player to meet the goal of $ 1,000,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;The players move along the track and advance to the position indicated by the dice. Once the city is acquired, the player has the right to collect a rent for it and can additionally invest in different goods to increase the rent. Investments can be real estate such as houses, buildings and towers with a different value for each one, both for the purchase and the income obtained. Another type of investment can be in businesses such as hotels and restaurants, which have a variable income or a casino that, being the most expensive, can be acquired when there is already capital, but the profit obtained is quite high when the players fall into that town. And finally another type of investment is the acquisition of factories that allows players to buy inputs and sell products to the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;Market conditions may vary throughout the game and may make it necessary to modify the strategy. Likewise, these changes also allow obtaining high dividends for those who can take advantage of them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then, the Big Boss will take the players cards and shuffle them together so they wouldn&rsquo;t know who played which card. Then, the Big Boss will put these cards in front of the job vacancy and ask the players to put down their qualification cards. Some of the qualification cards have positive effect and some have negative effects, depending on the job and/or the vacancy. Players can either put negative effect to their rivals or put a positive effect on themselves. Cards can be stacked in case one job has multiple positive andand/or negative effects. Then, the Big Boss will call everyone for an interview session. This is the discussion phase. The Big Boss will ask the players for their current job and why they think they would be the suitable candidates for this job. A clever player would use the negative effect that was put on him and twist it to be a positive effect for them. The game depends on persuasion skill after all. A taxi driver can be a minister if you know how to convince the Big Boss. Afterward, the Big Boss will choose the winner which will get points depending on the vacancy.&#10;&#10;(Slightly abbreviated description from the designer)&#10;&#10;",

And again, the player with the lowest five card poker hand from the cards exposed gets to either take another card or fold.&#10;&#10;When a deck runs out the other player gets a point and can keep playing, and scoring pts till their own deck runs out.  First to six points wins. If both decks run out game ends also, and scores are compared.&#10;&#10;",

Players can experience the action of a fighting game and RPG in less than 3 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The idea is simple: each player chooses a character that represents a fighting class. You can use a printed or digital version of it, it's the same! Then using dice, the players will take turns to defeat each other. The last one standing wins.&#10;&#10;And something important, depending on the table you play at, it will change the battlefield.&#10;For example a table of 4, or for 6. Or in a bar! Even in a classroom or in the car, even at the cinema before the movie starts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
