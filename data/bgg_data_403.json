Athos, Porthos, Aramis, d'Artagnan, Rochefort, and MiLady DiWinter move around Paris, fighting duels and completing missions to earn the favor of the King and Cardinal. Both characters and players earn Favors throughout the game and bonus points are scored at the end when players reveal their true allegiances. The winner is the player who's earned the most Favor!&#10;&#10;All For One is a pickup/deliver game for 3-5 players. Players are not tied to any specific character, rather each turn you choose which character to activate and then take actions with that character. Each player is secretly assigned one of the characters whose score will be added to their own at the end of the game. Your 'secret identity' helps drive decisions during the game, but in order to win you'll have to utilize all of the characters.&#10;&#10;The board is an interconnected web of streets, some of which are patrolled by Cardinal's Guards. The guards serve to hinder the musketeers' progress. There are 6 named locations where the characters begin the game, and the other 18 locations are home to 1 plot token each. 2 of the tokens are horses, which can be ridden by the characters. The rest are used to complete missions.&#10;&#10;The missions are printed on Mission Cards, which detail which character must complete the mission, which Plot Tokens are necessary to complete the mission, and the location at which the mission must be completed. Completing these missions involves collecting various Plot Tokens from around the board, and bringing them to specific places. Some missions involve getting 2 of the characters to a specific place at the same time, and some missions involve a duel between two characters.&#10;&#10;",

However, if the move is appropriate, the piece remains in its new position thus revealing its identity. Subsequent moves can be made accordingly.

On the back are two questions--one &quot;buff&quot; level, the other &quot;scholar&quot; level.  Get either question right--it's not clear, from the rules, who gets to choose which question gets asked, the asker or the answerer--and you get the points listed on the card.  There is often no clear connection between the point value of the question and its difficulty.  The pictures, however, are very nice.&#10;&#10;In an odd twist, if a card's question goes unanswered, the answer is then read aloud and the card set aside.  After all the rest of the cards have been dealt with, this pile of discards--whose answers, again, have been revealed--gets shuffled up and gone through again.  Presumably this is to test short-term memory.  The game ends once all cards have been correctly answered.&#10;&#10;This is part of a series of &quot;WIT&quot; games from this company, which included trivia games on wildlife, National Parks, and other Americana topics.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces are captured if they are sandwiched between two pieces of one other player of if the piece becomes the third piece in a diagonal formation.  Captured pieces entitle a player to reclaim pieces previously lost.&#10;&#10;There are three levels of winning.  Basic - by eliminating all of your opponent's pieces.

The four colors are red, blue, green and yellow.&#10;&#10;To set up, you attach 12 articles of clothing to the washing line, three of each color of pants, shirt and socks (in increasing order of difficulty), wind up the mechanism and let it go. The clothes line spins and the players hit the paddles to make their dog leap up to grab the clothing.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the person the highest score. you get 10 points for pants, 15 for the tee-shirt and 20 for the socks in your color. Each article of clothing your dog gets that isn't in your color costs you 30 points, so it pays to be a bit careful.&#10;&#10;A warning to parents...

    "Description": "&quot;Piece together the scarecrow, collect and count the birds but watch out for the scaredy cat.&quot;&#10;&#10;Scaredy Cat is a children's game for two to six players Ages 5 - 10. The object of the game is to collect cards with birds on them. the winner is the player who has the most birds when the game ends.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, all the cards are shuffled together and placed face down on the table. Players take it in turns to draw a card&#10;&#10;There are three types of cards in the deck:&#10;&#10;Most of the cards in the deck are Bird cards which have a picture of one to six birds on them. When a Bird card is drawn, the player puts it on the table in front of them.&#10;&#10;Scaredy Cat cards have a picture of a cat on them. When one of the three scaredy cat cards are drawn, the player who drew it loses all of their bird cards. The bird cards are shuffled back into the deck along with the scaredy cat card.&#10;&#10;The six Scarecrow cards each have a different part of a picture of a scarecrow on them. When one is drawn, it is placed in the middle of the table. When all six pieces are on the table, and the scarecrow is complete, the game ends and the birds are counted.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the birds on all the bird cards on the table are counted, the player with the most birds wins.&#10;&#10;We have found that the game works best with three or more players. Two player games tend to go on for a long time with much frustration.&#10;&#10;",

Dominos in two colors on a standard Checker board work well. On a turn, a player pins one end of any of his/her pieces, then rotates it 90&deg; clockwise. If, and only if, that would cause the rotating end of the piece to occupy a space that is either already filled, off the board or behind the pivot end of the piece, continue rotating the piece another 90&deg; to 180&deg;. Likewise, continue rotating another 90&deg; to 270&deg; if the next target space is unavailable or illegal. If none of the three target spaces make a legal move, the player must select a different piece to move. The first to land one end of a piece on the opposite row wins.&#10;&#10;",

Playing pieces are small spiders which slot into the board. Movement is determined by a twister-style spinner.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player takes one of the spiders and, in turn, spins the spinner. The player may spin up:&#10;- 2,3,4 or 5: the spider moves that number of spaces up the board; &#10;- &quot;switch spiders&quot;: the player may change places with another spider higher up on the board; or&#10;- &quot;turn the tap&quot;: the player turns the tap at the top of the spiderweb, releasing one of the blue balls.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to move your spider up the spiderweb to the top. During the game, the tap may be turned, the ball released has a fairly good chance of hitting some of the spider playing pieces and knocking them off the spiderweb. Spiders which are knocked off have to start again at the bottom. The winner is the first player to reach the top.&#10;&#10;",

The spheres are used to build a pyramid layer by layer on a central grid.  In rotation, each player adds a sphere to form a chain of their color.  When a layer is complete the next player starts a new chain on the next layer up.  Each sphere is now supported by four spheres below, one or more of which must be of the same color.  If a player is blocked they must fill all the empty places in that layer.  However there is an option to sacrifice a sphere into the tomb.  The player who places the final sphere at the top of the pyramid wins.&#10;&#10;There is a puzzle version for one.  With two players, each player plays with 46 spheres in two colors.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;O my dear, what a mess!&quot;, mother burst out while clapping her hands over her head. She has just entered the children's room. Laura and her younger brother Tommy have been playing all day and their toys are scattered across the little room. They must tidy the room before they go to bed, but it is already beginning to get dark. Will the children be able to finish and be in bed before Laura's star is twinkling in the sky?&#10;&#10;Laura's Star Game is about playing - hearing - feeling - reading!&#10;&#10;The 12 Displays form the entire room of Laura's as a 6&times;2 picture. Each display has two empty slots for a couple of almost identical items like cars, airplanes, hand mirrors, flashlights, rubber ducks and slippers.&#10;&#10;These items are placed inside a bag that has two separate pockets, and each pocket will contain one of each item plus either the dog or the bear. The 7 pieces of the Sun is assembled to form a clever timer: it has a central star-shaped part plus 5 pieces, each with 3 beams filling out the slots between the arms of the star. Finally is a cloud piece covering the sun when the game begins.&#10;&#10;A player will stick a hand into each pocket of the bag, trying to identify two identical shapes without looking. This is much harder than it seems since the pieces have nicely rounded edges that makes them feel somewhat like each other, and even adults will find it difficult. It is however good training of the motor skills - especially for the wrong hand!&#10;&#10;When the player is confident that two identical pieces have been found are the two pieces simultaneously retracted: If identical have the player succeed and the pieces are placed in the corresponding display and placed in front of the player.&#10;&#10;Should the two pieces turn out not to be identical are they returned to the same pockets they were drawn from, and a piece of the Sun puzzle is removed. When only the central part of the sun remains will it be flipped over the next time a player fails, thus showing the star of the story. It's bedtime, the game is over and all the players lost because they didn't make the room tidy in time.&#10;&#10;If the players manage to make the room in time, that is when the only tiles left in the bag are the dog and the bear, will the winner the player with most displays in front of her.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On January 7, the British 12th Brigade, which had been hammered back for weeks, now faced a new bold foe: Japanese tanks (type 95 and 97) composed of two companies supported by the 42nd Regiment. With only a few antitank weapons, the British defenders were hard pressed when the Japanese bold use of armor in the jungles began at 0330. What followed was simply a mini-blitzkrieg as the Japanese tanks found numerous previously undiscovered roads through which to bypass British defenses. The British really did not know what hit them and by 0830, the Japanese had secured the Slim River bridge and the road to Singapore was open. In the game, chance cards create the uncertainty of battle from the sudden approach of Japanese aircraft, discovering a bypass road, stumbling onto a minefield, or the sudden activation of British units. Formation cards determine which formations activate and in which order, depending on the player that plays them. This will vary with every game turn. All this creates a totally unpredictable game.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 11x17 in. map, 280 counters, formation and chance cards, which are used to activate the counters on the map, a rulebook. The scale is 350 yards per hex, platoons, individual tanks\\weapons, 30 min. turns for a total of 11 turns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dunwich Horror is a large-box expansion for the Fantasy Flight Games edition of Arkham Horror, and is a part of the Arkham Horror Series.&#10;&#10;Once again, terror has come to New England, this time spreading to the small country town of Dunwich, just a few miles from Arkham. The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace. But however much the people of Dunwich may distrust outsiders, they desperately need your help against the Horror that has manifested on the Whateley farm...&#10;&#10;Dunwich Horror adds 8 new Investigators, 4 new Ancient Ones and many new Investigator cards, Mythos cards and monsters to the base set.  It also adds new location cards, for a total of 14 cards at each location instead of 7. Dunwich Horror also adds many new mechanics. Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game. Players reduced to 0 stamina or sanity have the option of drawing from the Injury or Madness deck, acquiring permanent handicaps, rather than losing half their items and clue tokens. Gates are no longer permanently sealed (a popular house rule in the base game). Condition cards provide benefits to all players may be activated. And, of course, the Dunwich Horror itself - not as strong as the Ancient Ones, yet far stronger than any other monster in the game.&#10;&#10;This expansion also features revised rules and an FAQ that addresses many of the perceived faults of the base game. Replacement cards are provided for items and spells that are subject to errata.&#10;&#10;",
