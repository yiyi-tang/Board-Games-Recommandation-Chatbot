The game takes place during Japan's rapid industrial growth during the Meiji era, where you take the role of one of the entrepreneurial railroad baron of that time.&#10;&#10;You plan and lay track, upgrade your trains, sell goods to distant cities, and use operation cards to become the richest railroad baron of Japan! Balance your budget wisely, since taking too many bank bonds can ruin your business over the course of the game. Also, watch the competition closely because you can only use the track that you laid down personally to trade.&#10;&#10;Since the island of Japan is mountainous and narrow there is often not enough space for everyone to lay their track where they want. Foreseeing your competitors moves and well thought out moves will ensure you an undisputed railroad empire!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1973 was possibly the nearest that the world came to World War Three. Just following the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, and during the height of the Watergate scandal, the Americans were both war weary and disillusioned. The stock market crash of that year only made the situation worse, and when the Yom Kippur War erupted in October, the Israelis began to prepare thirteen of their nuclear weapons to halt the invading Arab armies! In response, the Soviet Union threatened to intervene, thereby causing the United States to alert its forces worldwide to prepare for a war against Russia. Such a war would have occurred when the United States was the most vulnerable and divided, but, ironically, the Americans would have had a vast reservoir of combat veterans from the Vietnam War to commit to action.&#10;&#10;The Dangerous Year: 1973 uses a standard area movement system but includes a deck of 54 event cards that add a chaotic element to the game, such as &quot;Denmark Withdraws from NATO&quot; which prevents units from entering the Denmark space that turn, or &quot;Hotline&quot; which allows a player to prevent his opponent from conducting tactical nuclear attacks for the current game turn, and so forth. Event cards represent the various occurrences that could happen in the midst of a sudden war, and they ensure that this game gives the feeling of World War III. One moment, a U.S. aircraft carrier may be sunk by a Soviet submarine, but the next moment, a Soviet ballistic missile may explode on the launch pad. The randomness of a shuffled deck each game ensures that no two games are the same, and there is no perfect strategy...only a sudden execrable war of the worst variety.&#10;&#10;This game uses a very simple combat system that is designed to resolve combat quickly, and includes the full panoply of combat units, armor, mech, infantry, artillery, SAMs, ships, fighters, bombers, et cetera, and not to mention the inveterate threat of tactical nuclear weapons. One thing is for sure, if the players do not trigger Armageddon, casualties will nevertheless be high for both sides.&#10;&#10;",

Your simple goal is to be a better railroad baron than your opponent. You do this by winning contracts to build track which connects one USA city to another in a series of competitions. The major elements you need are materials, labor and cash, although interesting people (contacts, investors, etc.) and effects such as material shortages and labor unrest will come your way. Engaging in a little trickery won&rsquo;t hurt you, either.&#10;&#10;A game of 1859 is played over eleven competitions (rounds). At the beginning of each competition, one player will choose a card from two which show the possible routes to be contested. Each player has a hand of five cards.&#10;&#10;After a player plays a card, a replacement is drawn from the deck, replenishing his hand back to five cards. After a number of competitions, usually eleven, the game ends. The player who earned the most profits wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

New stealth rules allow for all manner of sneaky and underhanded tactics, while expanded rules for arcane powers offer glory but could cost you your sanity. Alongside these are a host of new scenarios, Hired Guns, monsters, skills, and gear to challenge or assist those who dare venture into the Deep South of Dracula's America.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When all the coins of a given color have been flipped, the die of that color is used in the second phase to move the pawn and coins of that color.&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equiped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.&#10;&#10;But where to begin? Clearly, the problem was not finding an idea but choosing the right one from my vast amount of ideas&hellip; The arrival of the FFI dice and order tokens tilted the balance. Reading up on the subject along with finding several internet images pertaining to the French Resistance provided inspiration. My vision on how this page of our history is intertwined with the secret war in the universe of Achtung Cthulhu prompted me to create a new FFI unit and different options.&#10;&#10;For a long time I wanted to expand this faction so as to turn it into a complete and in certain cases independent army. Initially made to represent only the French Resistance, an FFI army can be used to depict any group of civilians that has taken up arms, regardless of their nationality in the scenario or whether they are deployed in the HoN or SoN universe. I spent many hours in front of my screen, with trials and errors, corrections, new attempts&hellip; So finally today, I have the pleasure of presenting to you, my first punchboard. It is approved by Yann and Clem and validated as an official DPG product.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero&rsquo;s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes&rsquo; side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain&rsquo;s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Fa Mel Ruins Arena offers new objectives, new challenges and a brand new strategy set in a glass-cannon capture the flag battle!&#10;&#10;There is a new way to earn victory on this map and an added benefit/threat to all opponents. The task is to get a stripped down archer from your end of the battlefield to the other side. But before you can move him, you need to get the crowd involved. As you gain favor, your archer gains the ability to move...and more. Eventually, if protected, it becomes as strong an asset as your champion! Losing your archer does not lose the game but it's a lot like losing your queen in chess. It might be hard to recover. With center pillars blocking movement, you will need to rely on your city's specific abilities and tactics to work your way past the beasts and engage your opponent. Plenty of new challenges await you in the FaMel Ruins!&#10;&#10;This arena fits right inside the Hoplo TLC or RoR boxes and will work with units from all 3 Hoplo games!&#10;&#10;",

This game reflects many features seen in fighting video games, such as character-specific abilities, distance control, anticipating opponent's moves, three-way-deadlock skill interactions, and overdrive skills.

Players sit in a circle and flip over cards, if the symbol on your card matches another player&rsquo;s, you face-off, and race to answer each others&rsquo; card prompt first. Your card might say &ldquo;Civil Rights Leader,&rdquo; and their card might say &ldquo;Renewable Energy&rdquo;&mdash;the first player to correctly answer the other player&rsquo;s prompt (&ldquo;Malcolm X!&rdquo;) wins their card.&#10;&#10;But watch out: A few cards force all players to give an answer at once or provide not one, but three answers! What ensues is shouting, laughing, high-fives, and the opportunity for important conversations.&#10;&#10;This game is simple to learn, a blast to play over and over again, and refreshingly insightful.

Every Commander has its own skills and values around which specific and focused strategies can be built.&#10;&#10;Each player must create their decks using 30 cards for the main deck and a certain amount for the Reserve deck (if requested by certain cards).&#10;They can choose from a huge variety of classes and types. Players can use in the same deck every combination of units they wish, like: infantry, artillery, reconnaissance vehicles, AA guns, tanks, SPG, fighters, bombers, aircraft carriers, submarines and many others.&#10;&#10;Units have a certain deployment cost, attack and defense values, skills and historical descriptions.&#10;When the battle begins, both players start with 0 Manpower. This value is necessary for card deployment and skill activation and it grows up by 1 each turn, but it can be lowered or increased even more using powers (like a well performed bomb-raid or a supply vehicle deployed).&#10;&#10;Units fight each other and can attack the Commanders. &#10;Ground units cannot attack the Navy, except for some special cards like coastal defense guns. The Navy can attack ground units only if the fire is coordinated by a spotter. Like in real life, the Aviation is a crucial part, planes are capable of attacking every other card on the field and can be attacked only by other planes or Anti-Air capable units.&#10;The player who most wisely creates his deck and uses the synergies between its cards to beat the enemy commander will win the game. Beware...there are secret weapons, which can overturn even the most desperate situation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the Middle Ages, the Iberian Peninsula was divided into several small states, Christian kingdoms (in the northern half) and Muslim emirates (in the southern half). Over almost eight centuries, these two cultures went through periods of war and peace, intolerance and coexistence, and the fragile alliances between ones and others kingdoms changed overnight depending on the political interests of each sovereign. (Christians against Muslims, Christians against Christians, Muslims against Muslims), with the Jews as an economic force that exerted as a hinge. Likewise, foreign powers such as the Papacy or the Caliphate also played their cards in the peninsular contest. In &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot; you will have to take control of one of the main six Iberian medieval kingdoms: three Christians (Kingdom of Castile, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Navarra) and three Muslims (Emirate of Cordoba, Emirate of Granada and Emirate of Valencia). Through political intrigue, diplomacy and war, as well as economic and cultural development, you will have to fight to make your kingdom or emirate become the most powerful on the Peninsula, and be named &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot;.&#10;&#10;For this, you will have the opportunity to occupy villages, castles and walled cities, and then build farms, palaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, libraries, towers and lighthouses, which will magnify your kingdom. Likewise, you must recruit armies and build fleets to defend yourself from your dangerous neighbors, and in no case will you do well to neglect the basic nutritional needs of your subjects, since you could face brutal peasant revolts of unpredictable consequences. You must also ensure the defense of your coasts, since the fearsome Viking warriors could land on them and destroy all the wealth of your prosperous State. To help you with these challenges, you will have four historical leaders from each kingdom (Isabella, Ferdinand, Urraca, Abd al-Rahman, Boabdil, Zobeyda ...), each of them provided with special skills depending on the position assigned to them (King, advisor, ambassador, emir, vizier ...), and you can also use them to seal alliances with other kingdoms through marital links, which will make you join forces to protect yourself from more belligerent third parties, while allowing you to engender heirs (princes and princesses) to ensure the survival of your legacy.&#10;&#10;In the same way, using your political influence and the support of your allies in the assembly, you will have the opportunity to reach the cusp of the Iberian Court (common to all peninsular kingdoms), which will allow you to control powerful elite units. Nor should you underestimate the power of the conspiracy, which will allow you to carry out espionage missions, instigate internal revolts and even kill rival monarchs. Finally, you can embark on exciting sea voyages to the East (Rome, Baghdad, Jerusalem and China) in search of external support to implement your political structures and deal with your enemies, although long journeys will never be without danger. Are you prepared to travel to the Middle Ages and enter an exciting world of castles, swords, religious conflicts and palace plots?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "HOW TO PLAY&#10;EleMasters is a 2-8 player game that fosters a blend of competitive and co-op play. The objective of the game is to bond as many Atomo cards as you can on your turn, in order to win.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Place the Octomic Ring in the center of the table. &#10;Shuffle the full deck of Atomo Cards.&#10;Deal each player their Hand (9 minus # of players). &#10;All player hands remain face up in front of them as &lsquo;in play&rsquo;.&#10;Place the remaining cards face down on the center of the Octomic Ring as the Atomo Deck. &#10;Player with the highest Valectron count in their hand starts, then counterclockwise.&#10;&#10;GAME OVER&#10;The game ends when there are no more Summoned Atomo left on the Octomic Ring to play. When this happens, everyone discards the rest of their hand so only point deck cards remain. &#10;&#10;    Long game option: When the Octomic Ring runs out of Atomo cards, reshuffle the discard pile as a new set. Repeat until there are no more summoned Atomo, or no more bonds can be made by any player.&#10;&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;The objective, is for each player to Bond as many cards as possible, so that you get to claim them for your Point Deck. &#10;3pts/per Atomo card in your point deck.&#10;1pt/per Valectron on each of those Atomo cards in point deck.&#10;1pt/per Bond made with your point deck during end game scoring.&#10;&#10;ROUNDS&#10;The Active Player starts their turn by flipping the top card of the Atomo Deck over to reveal it as the Summoned Atomo for that round.&#10;&#10;The Active Player then decides, based on all the cards in front of each player, themselves included, which cards to bond with the Active Atomo. The more cards bonded, the more of them you get to keep &amp; add to your point deck at the end of that round, but also stay aware of how many Valectron points that card has as well.&#10;&#10;    Point Deck cards are not &lsquo;in-play&rsquo; to bond to. &#10;&#10;&#10;As the active player searches for bond combos, the other players should be verifying the bonds being attempted, as well as suggesting bonds that will help themselves as well as the AP. In this way, the game is both co-op as well as competitive.&#10;&#10;At the end of each players turn, they should draw enough cards from the Atomo Deck to refill their hand.&#10;&#10;Four modes teach you the game by starting simple, then adding mechanics which you can mix and match as you like:&#10;&#10;Beginner: Basic Octets.&#10;Casual: Phases to cool &amp; heat Atomo&rsquo;.&#10;EleMagi: Radioactive Isotopes add stabilization complication.&#10;EleMaster: Use correct bond types to ionize Atomo&rsquo; for more bonding options on your turn.&#10;&#10;BEGINNER MODE&#10;&quot;Octets&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Ignore all other modifiers&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Valectron&rdquo; is EleMaster slang for &ldquo;Valence Electron&rdquo;.&#10;For this mode, you just want to create a total of 8 (an Octet) Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo.&#10;&#10;To bond a card to the Summoned Atomo, place a hand card from yourself or another player onto a BondBloom (the glowing mineral leaves on the edge of the Octomic Ring). You can bond up to four cards.&#10;&#10;For a successful bond, the total of Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo, plus the Valectrons around each bonded Atomo must equal a total of 8. No more, no less.&#10;&#10;If you bond, place all the bonded cards into your point deck. If you can&rsquo;t make a bond, discard the Summoned Atomo, return all hand cards to their owners, then end the round and let the next player start their turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;    In this Beginner mode, if the Summoned Atomo drawn has eight already, you simply add it to your point pile as an automatic point and that ends your turn. This does not apply in the other game modes.&#10;&#10;&#10;CASUAL MODE&#10;&quot;Phases&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase modifier&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s where we harness some of the core concepts of chemical bonding through the &lsquo;EleMagic&rsquo; of the Octomic Ring.&#10;&#10;Each Atomo has it&rsquo;s own default &lsquo;phase&rsquo; on it which refers to the Heat Energy it contains at standard Earth temperatures, which determines the &lsquo;state&rsquo; it&rsquo;s in.&#10;&#10;For example, &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; with low heat energy makes it a Solid we call Ice. Add more heat energy and it &lsquo;melts&rsquo; into the Liquid we call Water. Add even more heat energy, bringing it to a boil and this begins to break it down into the Gas we know as Steam or Vapor.&#10;&#10;The higher the heat energy, the more likely it is to lose valectrons, and thus its bond.&#10;&#10;Adding an Atomo&rsquo;s phase to its matching color on the ring, has no effect. However, if you add an Atomo to a color with more Heat Energy it loses -1 Valectron per phase increase. Likewise, you can add +1 Valectron for each phase downward you go as well.&#10;&#10;This starts to give you more flexibility in working with the available cards in play.&#10;&#10;ELEMAGI MODE&#10;&quot;Radioactivity&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase modifiers.&#10;&bull; Radioactive Atoms must be stabilized.&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t see the decaying skull, it&rsquo;s not a radioactive Atomo, and you can ignore this. However, if an Atomo card does have the Decaying Skull on it, this means it is radioactive and must be stabilized in order to use it.&#10;&#10;If the summoned Atomo is radioactive, ALL bonds must be made through the plasmagic (yellow) blooms which makes it a stable isotope.&#10;&#10;If you fail to create a bond with a radioactive summon on your turn, you must not only discard the Summoned Atomo but also one card from you point deck. &#10;&#10;     If you have no cards yet in your point deck, you must discard one from your hand after refilling.&#10;&#10;&#10;ELEMASTER MODE&#10;&quot;Metal &amp; Bond Types&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase and Radioactive modifiers.&#10;&bull; Use the correct Bond Types (below).&#10;&#10;Metal Types:&#10;Each Atomo has one of three Metal Types on it. These determine which cards can bond with the Summoned Atomo, based on the BondBloom you use.&#10;&#10;Bond Types:&#10;Each of the BondBlooms is able to perform one of three main Bond Types. You must use the correct pairing of Atomo, or the Bond will not work.&#10;&#10;If the bond does work though, it adds or subtracts a set number of Valectrons from the bonding Atomo (no partials):&#10;Ionic:         +/-  1 Valectron&#10;Covalent:      +/-  2 Valectrons&#10;Metallic:      +/-  3 Valectrons&#10;&#10;WORLD&#10;EleMasters begins in the world of the Fractal Forest, where science and sorcery collide. Through the Octomic Ring, you can communicate with Atomo', the spirits of Atoms and particles. In learning to wield that ring, you as an EleMage can teach the Atomo' how to alter and bond elements of the periodic table. Train with your fellow EleMagi and then together take this expertise with you to save the world.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;After centuries of never-ending wars, the dark magic of Faer has taken hold of the lands of Euthia. One of the most powerful mages, the mighty Rasgaroth, had succumbed to this darkness. He was leeching away the energy of all living things wherever he appeared. As his power grew, Euthia was in danger of being engulfed by this evil. The mages of the order of Vis forged a secret union to deter this looming threat. After many years of studying ancient tomes of forbidden knowledge, they eventually found a way to awaken mighty dragons, control them and with their help to defeat Rasgaroth and his minions. The mages were successful - Rasgaroth was torn to pieces by dragons and his fortress, Arakius, was reduced to ashes. The wars were over. But some of these mages thrived for even greater power and tried to use the mighty dragons for goals of their own. However, their magic was not powerful enough to control the dragons forever. Dragons eventually broke free of their masters control and ripped them apart. The order of Vis was brought to an end. The retribution of the dragons was about to begin...&quot;&#10;&#10;Legends of Euthia is a strategic competitive role-playing game set in a medieval fantasy world. The land of Euthia is threatened by powerful dragons who, with powerful elementals, destroy one village after another and the dragons themselves seek to destroy the last hope - the Church of St. Michael. Become one of the four heroes: the priestess of light, &Aacute;el; the unstoppable warrior, Dral; the cunning and wild rogue, Keleia; or the fire mage Maeldur. Protect the remaining villages, the church and kill all three dragons. As one of these heroes, you will have unique abilities and various strategies. Explore Euthia and fight dangerous monsters controlled by other players who try to kill you with various monster cards. Get loot and rewards from victorious battles and you mine resources at specific places on the map. With these resources and loot, you can buy equipment and new skills from the markets. During the game all heroes gain reputation for fighting dragons, monsters or elementals, for liberating various places of trade and locations with rare resources, but also for conquering and gemstone mining. The winner is the player with the most reputations points.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Players choose whether they want to play the basic game or the champions version for more of a challenge. Each player selects a hero and prepares the specific hero board. Then the other boards are prepared; the game board where reputation points and rounds are counted; the trade board with specific market offers and the combat board with monster cards and elemental cards. After that the starting tile with the church is placed in the middle of the playing area (where the heroes start their adventure). Other tiles are sorted by chapters; separate chapters are shuffled and then sorted into the correct chapter order. Each player rolls two dice, and the one with the highest amount begins the game.&#10;&#10;Course of the game:&#10;Players take turns in a clockwise direction. Each turn, a player can use action tokens to carry out different strategies. They try to get as many reputation points, golden coins and other accessories (monster ability cards, potions and Gaars, used for re-rolling) as possible by using these tokens. By gaining reputation, heroes unlock new abilities which can be learned by paying gold coins. Heroes can also buy new equipment and heal wounds inflicted in combat. In mountains, lakes and caves, heroes can mine rare raw resources to get more gold and reputation points. During specific turns, elemental monsters begin their invasion of Euthia and must be destroyed by the heroes to protect places of trade and the portals of Euthia. If the elementals are not killed by a certain round, the place is destroyed and reduced to a common piece of land (mountains, lakes, caves). During a dragon attack, all heroes are teleported back to the church, healed and then encounter the dragon. They do not help each other during the attack but try to inflict as much damage to the dragon individually, because when the dragon is eventually slain, the reputation points are distributed to heroes according to the damage caused. The hero dealing the most damage also gets a special reward.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Movement &ndash; Movement is carried out on the map by using action tokens, equipped boots, jewelry, special abilities or portals. The combat action token can be used for a combat action or 3 movement points, the trade action token can also be additionally used as 2 movement points, and the mining action token can be also used as a one movement point. Moving to an adjacent map tile costs one movement point.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Map exploration - new map tiles are placed on the board when a hero moves to an edge of the explored area.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fighting monsters - by entering a monster map tile the player must use a combat action. The encountered monster is controlled by the player sitting on the right or a different player can take over the monster by playing a monster ability card - Mind control or Magical mind control. It is not possible to run from combat and the first player to attack is the player controlling the monster. He or she rolls 2 dice and determines the attack strength according to the monster cards and monster ability cards used. The dice can be re-rolled using Gaars which come in a limited amount for both heroes and monsters. Next, the player controlling the hero chooses an ability they want to use to attack, rolls 2 dice and determines the attack power or eventually multiple abilities can be combined. These phases repeat until either the hero or the monster dies. After slaying a monster, the hero is rewarded with reputation points, corresponding number of monster ability cards and loot from the map tile. If a hero dies the player controlling the hero gives their token to the player who controlled the monster. For this token, the monster-controlling player gains 2 reputation points and the hero-controlling player loses 2 reputation points at the end of the game. The slain hero is revived in the church and is given 4 Gaar tokens by the priests, a specific number of monster ability cards depending on the turn they were killed in and then they can get back in the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Trade - by entering a tile with one of the three places of trade and using the trade action token, a hero can spend any gold coins they have to get equipment, healing, new abilities, potions and Gaars. It is also possible to sell items or, just once per encounter, to refresh all things being offered by the vendor. Each place offers different things to buy. If a hero liberates a place of trade from enemies, they are paid one gold coin by other heroes using this place.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mining - A hero can use the mining action on places designated for the action (mountains, lakes, caves) to get a piece of raw resource which can be traded for gold and reputation points. Each hero can mine each tile only once per game. If you perform the mining action on a tile occupied by a different hero, you pay one gold coin to each hero who has their hero token on the tile. Then you also place your hero token on that tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;Milestones:&#10;You do not have to start a new game from the first round over and over again. You can decide to start your new game from a milestone. Setup the regular game with few modifications. Start the game from a different map tile chapter, you have some reputation points right from the start (meaning some hero abilities are unlocked) and gold that can be traded for items and vendor services even before the game starts.&#10;&#10;You can also agree that the game will be concluded sooner than the 24th round.&#10;&#10;Game for champions:&#10;The champions version is prepared in the same way as the regular game, but the game board, the trade board and the hero boards must be turned with the goblet-icon up. Additionally, quest cards are used in the champions version. The course of the game is the same as in the regular game with the exception that no events take place, apart from the fight with the dragon Brasath in the 21st round.&#10;&#10;Compared to the regular game, there are numbers in the gold coin symbol next to the picture of the trade points on the trade board for the champions version. During their Trade action, a player may place their hero token on this tile to claim it if they spend the amount stated. Some hero boards already contain basic equipment.&#10;&#10;Unlike the regular game, there are quests in the champions version. If a player is successful in completing these quests they are rewarded with reputation and gold. The quest cards are divided into three levels.&#10;&#10;Ending the game:&#10;The game ends in a predetermined round or if players do not defend the church against one of the dragons. At the end of the game, reputation points are awarded for claimed locations on the map, the loot and the hero tokens that the players got by killing other heroes when controlling monsters. The player with the highest number of reputation points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to capture the opponent's four Vital Element pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four different Vital Element pieces (circle, triangle, rectangle, square) on their back rank and six identical Warrior pieces on their second rank. On their turn each player moves one of their Warriors one square, or one of their Vital Elements up to two squares. They can capture an opposing piece by landing on its square, although a Vital Element cannot capture an opposing Vital Element unless it is the same shape.&#10;&#10;When a player captures a Vital Element they may make a special bonus move, such as teleporting a piece across the board or resurrecting a captured Warrior, according to what shape of Element was captured.

Each PUG consists of three cards that are all the same OR all different in their individual traits. There are three traits on every card of Frog Pig Pug: type of animal, color of animal, and number of animals. Six cards are dealt on the table face-up from the deck into the community pool, and each player is dealt one card that only they can utilize. Once a PUG is identified, a player yells &quot;PUG&quot; and gathers the cards in the PUG once confirmed by the other players.&#10;&#10;Any used community pool cards or cards from the player's hand are replaced and play continues until all the cards from the deck are spent.

There is also a strong Set Collection mechanic, where you build your composition in the best way possible to achieve your goals, involving your ships, captain and crew.&#10;It also has pick-up and deliver mechanics in the game, where you take a delivery in your port and have to take it to a specific place, and finally Dice Roll, which is optional to do when exploring. In P&eacute;laghos, Combat is designed in two different ways: Naval Artillery and Boarding, both with their distinct mechanics. That being said, all of your card choices may affect the results of different paths chosen in the game, mitigating how Luck affects your game.&#10;&#10;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&#10;&#10;P&eacute;laghos &eacute; um mundo de navios e magia, um mundo com grandes oceanos cheios de ilhas inexploradas ou pouco conhecidas.&#10;As na&ccedil;&otilde;es humanas mais poderosas e influentes dominam a maior parte do mundo, mas ele tamb&eacute;m &eacute; lar para criaturas ex&oacute;ticas como Elfos, Minotauros e Fadas. &Eacute; tamb&eacute;m um mundo de perigos.

    "Description": "Sustainable development geek is a trivia/debate game based on questions about the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). Question cards are associated with one of the 17 SDGs and provide 2 possible answers (A/B). The correct answer is listed on the back of the card with an explanation.&#10;&#10;Two game modes are available:&#10;&#10;     Achieve them all (2-4 players)&#10;     The great debate (5-10 players)&#10;&#10;&#10;Two additional &quot;animation&quot; modes are described:&#10;&#10;     General assembly (10-70 people)&#10;     Facilitation (any group events)&#10;&#10;&#10;In the &quot;achieve them all&quot; game mode, each player takes a turn answering as many questions about SDGs as they want. They receive each card they answered correctly, but the card is only saved once the player decides to stop. Whenever a player gives a wrong answer, all is/her unsaved cards are discarded and his/her turn ends. The next player then takes his/her turn. The first player to collect cards for all 17 SDGs wins the game.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;great debate&quot; game mode, 2 players (debaters A and B) are picked to argue for 30 seconds in favour of answer A or B. Other players (deciders) then vote on which answer is correct. The debater who got the most votes keeps the card (counts as 1 point). Deciders who found the right answer score 1 point. The game ends after a set number of turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
