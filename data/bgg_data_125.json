It is going to be an epic battle for bragging rights and fireworks as you compete with one another to see who will have the most money at the end of the week!&#10;&#10;Lemonade Stand is played over seven turns (days), and each turn players start by turning over a forecast card which shows the weather forecast for the day along with number of customers and the price they will be willing to pay for each possible weather outcome. Players then place a 5, 10 or 15 cent price card down along with any signs or lemonade inventory they want to put out, all face down. All players reveal their cards at the same time and then a new forecast card is revealed which has an arrow pointing to one of five spots on the old forecast card, which determines which weather event occurred. Each player then collects money based on their price and # of glasses of lemonade invested versus the actual weather that happened.&#10;&#10;Money is gained or lost, and play continues for seven rounds. Most money wins!&#10;&#10;",

Do the ninja recklessly force their way through their opponents whilst undoubtedly raising the alarm level, go too slowly and stealthily though and they face losing the advantage that night brings, dawn ultimately bringing an unreckonable force down upon them. Do the guards throw themselves in the way of their more deadly rivals or strategically attempt to slow them down?

Has a deep multi-layered engine builder and asymmetric gameplay. Players start to explore the Ark and reveal randomly rooms. Each room provides different options and can be utilized differently. Players must learn to adapt on the go and make choices that best capitalize of the revealed rooms, building up their engine faster. Players also collect artifact cards and after 5 artifact cards, players can draw their mission card from a deck of 36 different mission cards. The first player that completes their mission, wins.&#10;&#10;At game start players will choose an alien faction to play with - each faction will feel different to play.&#10;Variance in setup and multiple player choices provides a puzzle of players to solve and build their engine as fast as they can. On each play the Ark is revealed differently &ndash; both the types of rooms and their positioning varies and players also get random mission cards. &#10;In addition to the competitive &ldquo;Awakening mode&rdquo;, the game features a competitive &ldquo;Fallout&rdquo; mode, solo mode and collaborative mode that can be played against a player or an automated opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you become Shaman, your decisions affect events, so your rivals will try to influence you by fair means or foul...&#10;&#10;Your aim is to score the most points by having treasures in your hut and natives in your reserve at the end of the fifth round. Treasures are the key: Each round you collect one from each island on which your tribe has a majority (or a minority, if other tribes are tied there). Cards let you move treasures, place natives on islands, bring them home, or move them between islands. In each round everyone plays one card face up in front of ANY player (including themselves), followed by another card, face down (also in front of anyone). Lastly, you may place one native on any played card &mdash; even a hidden card played by an opponent, if you are very bold! &mdash; to copy its effect for yourself. The background to each card is one of four colors, but in each round only cards of two colors will be resolved, affecting the players in front of whom they are played. The Shaman determines these colors by turning over one of two condition cards. If you are the Shaman, use your power to best effect; otherwise try to outguess the others or influence the Shaman. Remember the number of treasures in other players' huts and manage your natives carefully &ndash; a few points can make the difference!&#10;&#10;Scheming, double-guessing, and bluffing: Welcome to Costa Ruana!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a new concept game covering the whole North African campaign from 1940 to 1943.&#10;&#10;Developed on wooden blocks and cubes system, over an astonishing 87x64cm full laminated multicolor map-board, there's not any paper component, but the Manual.&#10;All the over 400 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;HISTORICAL BACKGROUND&#10;On June 10 1940, the Italian Fascist Leader Benito Mussolini was convinced that it was the right time to join the war on the German side before it  was over and Germany got all the glory.&#10;&#10;Fascist Italy was unprepared for a World War, but Mussolini thought the war would have only lasted for some weeks and that a few thousand Italian casualties would have given him some credibility at the future Peace Conference.&#10;&#10;However, as soon as Italian troops crossed the French border, they encountered  fierce resistance  from the determined French Transalpine Army.&#10;&#10;Even worse was to come when the Italian Army  crossed the Egyptian border to face a well trained and motivated British Desert Force; furthermore, the idea of invading Greece through the Balkans, was not as easy as it looked.&#10;&#10;It was only thanks to a major German commitment in the Mediterranean that operations swung in favor of the Axis and the name of Rommel became a legend. &#10;&#10;It was also said that, by having to provide aid to the Italians in the Balkans, Germany diverted manpower that was needed in Russia and hence sowed the seeds of the Axis defeat in the East.&#10;&#10;However, as soon as America was thrown into the war by the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the fate of the Axis was written in stone and defeat was only a matter of time.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN AFRIKA recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the African Theater Front from the Italian drive to Marsa Matruh in Summer 1940, until the collapse of the Italian Regime in Semptember 1943.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a game for two players, one controls the Western Allies and the other one controls the Axis Powers.&#10;Although based on history, players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War 2 in the Mediterranean Theater.&#10;&#10;RULES INTRODUCTION&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time.&#10;The first section is the BASIC GAME RULES which introduces the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;Then the ADVANCED GAME RULES provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.&#10;Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, OPTIONAL RULES can be added as desired.&#10;The Optional Rules include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, Parachute Assaults&hellip;&#10;&#10;SCALE&#10;A hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 Km) across.&#10;A turn is 1 month long.&#10;A full strength counter represents 300 planes, 300 Tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the type unit, equipment and nationality.&#10;&#10;FOG OF WAR&#10;The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).&#10;&#10;Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian&#10;Genre: Operational, Strategic&#10;Turns: Turn-Based&#10;Complexity: Basic to Advanced, depending on which rules are used and on Scenario Lenght&#10;Period: World War II&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;With over 240 units counters and 200 different resource points of various color, players can enjoy hours of fun by playing one of the ten BIA scenarios, one of the four 7-turn BIE scenarios (in cobination with BITE and BITW) or the gargantuan 1939 CAMPAIGN.&#10;&#10;1940 Operation Compass, November 1940 - March 1941&#10;1941 Operation Exporter, June - July 1941&#10;1941 Middle- East Uprising, May - September 1941&#10;1941 Operation Marita-Merkur, April - June 1941&#10;1941 The Desert Fox, March - July 1941&#10;1942 Tobruk, June - October 1942&#10;1942  El Alamein, October 1942 - February 1943&#10;&#10;NAVAL BATTLES &#10;

    "Description": "In Tiki, you are a divinity on Manami Island and you love all the delicious fruits that grow there. You prefer nothing more than influencing the living tribes of the island to share their gifts with you. Unfortunately, you aren't the only one. Another divinity shares your passion for these fruits, which leaves you only one choice &mdash; you need to show him your power in order to get more fruits than he does before the end of the fruit season.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the nine village tiles and place them in a 3x3 square with some space between each tile. Players then take turns until the fruit supply exhausted or one of them collects four fruits. On a turn, a player creates a new totem (by placing one of their totem tokens on an empty village tile) or moves a totem that has one of their tokens on top. When you move a totem, you must move the entire totem orthogonally as many spaces as the number of tokens in it. As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.&#10;&#10;When a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has four fruit, they win. If the fruit supply is empty, the game ends and whoever has the most fruit wins; in the event of a tie, continue to play until one player would win (or lose) a fruit to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Once you've played a few times, start using the Shaman rule. The second player places a Shaman between two villages before their first move, and no totem can be moved between these two villages. When a village with value 0 is influenced, the owner of the topmost token can move the Shaman to a new location, if desired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Keytown is a game for two to five players lasting approximately 60 to 75 minutes. Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.&#10;&#10;In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.&#10;&#10;Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes. Rules and components are in English and German.&#10;&#10;Keytown is Richard Breese's third game in the key series.&#10;&#10;",

OST simulates, through an easily-learned game system, small unit engagements on the Eastern Front during 1941-42.&#10;&#10;Two players contest each scenario using counters representing the soldiers, guns, and vehicles that fought these desperate battles. On each turn play goes back and forth between the sides as Impulse Points are spent to enable a player's forces to act. When the battle is over, casualty and victory points are tallied and a victor is declared.&#10;&#10;Infantry target other soft units and attack using their Firepower value against the target&rsquo;s Defense value.  The attack can be modified by Leadership, support weapons and terrain effects. And when things get intense, Assault moves into enemy hexes result in deadly Close Combat.  Dice rolls are made using the Infantry Combat Table and results are implemented.  Attacking armored vehicles requires a roll to Hit the vehicle at range.  If a Hit is scored, the Firepower value of the attacker&rsquo;s gun is used against the target&rsquo;s front or flank Defense value.  Dice rolls are made using the Vehicle Combat Table and results are enforced. Vehicles may also use their HE Firepower value and secondary armaments directly against soft targets using the Infantry Combat Table.&#10;&#10;Old School Tactical (OST) Vol I is the game that started the Old School Tactical train rolling. With its huge maps, straightforward play, and realistic feel, the game was an instant hit. So much of a hit that it sold out.

    "Description": "In May, 1940, World War II took a turn that will change history forever&mdash;the German Army invaded France through the neutral countries of Belgium and Netherlands and thus avoiding the fearsome Maginot Line. The French Army, supposedly the best army of the time, felt far from any threat. Against all expectations, the neutral nations were quickly overrun, and the British Expeditionary Corps was forced to be evacuated, almost miraculously, from the channel port of Dunkirk. France capitulated in two months.&#10;&#10;This game recreates those events and allows players to reproduce, at a tactical level, the most famous battles of the &ldquo;Blitzkrieg&rdquo;. Based on the &ldquo;A las Barricadas&rdquo; game system, with new rules added to simulate to this historical period, France 1940 promises many enjoyable hours of fierce game play involving infantry, tanks, artillery, and aircraft from all the armies that took part in this campaign.&#10;&#10;&#10;Compass Games - Military Simulations: La Bataille de France 1940&#10;&#10;La Bataille de France 1940 recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the Blitzkrieg on the Western Front. at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.&#10;&#10;La Bataille de France 1940 represents the jump of the War Storm Series from the Spanish Civil War into World War 2. Based on the system originally used in A las Barricadas!, the first game in the War Storm Series, La Bataille de France 1940incorporates new and adapted rules for the World War 2 era. The War Storm Series promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict.&#10;&#10;The War Storm Series&#10;&#10;The War Storm Series is a game series designed to simulate combined arms company level combat. Each game in the series has numerous scenarios allowing players to simulate a number of company or battalion level combats.&#10;&#10;All War Storm Series games are of moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions, include create improved positions, entrench, replace officers, road-blocks, clear wire, units in Reaction, double time movement, load-upload, minefields, fortifications, rubble, barbed wire, dragoon teeth, anti-tank ditch and pontoon bridges. The various units include leaders, infantry, political commissars, priests, MMGs, mortars, artillery, AT guns, vehicles, armored vehicles, tanks, aircraft close support squadrons, aircraft bombardment squadrons, and even cavalry.&#10;&#10;War Storm Series games are based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is company level with units representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action. Turns are divided into the following phases:&#10;&#10;Command Phase&#10;    Initiative Phase&#10;    Activation Phase&#10;    Marker Removal Phase&#10;&#10;The game uses isomorphic maps, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other map. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios.

The player whose animal was taken away, receives a protection card, which temporarily protects against further attacks by his fellow players.&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    Coloretto Amazonas: Erweiterung&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Animals in Espionage is a quick game for two players in which each player is the director of their own spy agency. Each round, players attempt to discreetly recruit one of the six animal agents, while also trying to send a secret spy to their opponent. Players alternate rounds in which they split a hand of agents into two groups, and their opponent then chooses which group of agents they want to recruit first. After all the agents have been divided between the players, players simultaneously guess the agent their opponent was trying to secretly recruit throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Players score points by carefully collecting their assigned recruit, sending their secret spy to their opponent, and correctly guessing their opponent's secret recruit. The player who scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As well as the normal terrain features you'd expect (clear, woods, hills, rivers, roads), the map features different kinds of roads, varying elevations, differing slopes on the hex edges, and differing levels of human habitation (buildings that might get in the way).&#10;&#10;There are several different kinds of units - not just infantry, cavalry, and artillery, but different types of them. About 8 different kinds of artillery and infantry, with varying levels of performance. Units have a morale rating, which determines how much fire they can face before likely becoming demoralized, and some units are green. Units have varying amounts of troops in them, and the scale is small enough that some units can be deployed to take up 2 hexes when marching or in line formation. (One unit is big enough to take up THREE hexes when fully deployed!)&#10;&#10;The level of detail is at first staggering, but once you've invested the time to learn the rules, the game flows by very rapidly. However, this is NOT a quick game! This is something you devote a weekend or two to, and a big table.&#10;&#10;(user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Get ready to sharpen thy Shovel! Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels  is a 1-4 player side-scrolling, miniatures board game based on the popular video game Shovel Knight by Yacht Club Games. Players will venture into a dangerous dungeon filled with enemies and traps themed to one of the infamous members from the Order of No-Quarter to compete against rival Knights for treasure.  Whichever player has the most treasure at the end of the dungeon is the winner!&#10;&#10;In  Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels , treasure is earned by rolling dice to defeat enemies, digging up the scattered dirt piles, and finding gold dropped by other players!. As players advance through the dungeon, they're likely to find powerful one-shot items called Relics as well as a friendly merchant named Chester who's willing to exchange some powerful equipment for some of your treasure. When defeated by enemies or falling into deadly spiked pits, players will drop half of their treasure, allowing the other rival players to come by and collect it. Don&rsquo;t worry though, if a player&rsquo;s Knight has been defeated, they spawn back into the game in the following round! Though a player&rsquo;s Knight may be able to wound enemies, they cannot hurt another rival Knight as it is against their chivalrous code (or shall we say...shovelrous code?) The code of shovelry says nothing about pushing each other around, however, as Knights may knock each other into deadly spiked pits, enemies, or otherwise disadvantageous positions!&#10;&#10;Not only will enemies and Knights be moving, but the dungeon itself will too. Like a level you'd see in a classic video game side-scrolling segment, the dungeon will constantly move along with or without you, so make sure to keep up! Each round, the leftmost tile will fall off while a new tile moves on from the rightmost side of the board, and any enemies, treasure, or Knights are then defeated and removed from the board! Once players have dealt with the minions and lethal terrain, they will  face off against a boss from the Order of No-Quarter as the final challenge of the dungeon. Bosses from the Order of No-Quarter are controlled by their own unique AI Deck,  randomizing their attacks for an unforgettable fight. Each time damage is done to the boss players will gain gold, but each time the boss damage them they'll lose gold. Whoever has the most treasure by the end of the fight is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Company&iacute;s Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&#10;&#10;1812 is a medium length game. Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about three hours to complete a game.&#10;&#10;Novices or more deliberate players might add a few hours to that time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Right Fierce &amp; Terrible simulates the battle in 1340 between English King Edward III and a French fleet assembled to carry King Philip VI&rsquo;s invasion across the English Channel. It was the first major battle of the Hundred Years War, and although it was a naval encounter &ndash; the English fleet attacked their French adversaries in the estuary before Bruges &ndash; it was decided by sword, hammer and arrow. Confined to cog and barge, retreat was not an option for marines in this desperate fight. Despite being outnumbered and in foreign waters, the English fleet annihilated its adversary. Edward captured nearly all his rival&rsquo;s ships and slew a horde of soldiers and mariners that day, boasting that bodies were washing onto Flemish beaches for days.&#10;&#10;Designed by Jeremy White, this is an unusual game. Players &ldquo;build&rdquo; the battlefield as they go. By navigating their squadrons of galleys, nefs and cogs through the estuary they create the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; upon which the knights and men-at-arms will vie for supremacy. Success hinges on the ability to deliver marines and archers against weak points, or in giving your opponent no choice but to hit your fleet where it is strongest. The English will have the longbow and a high freeboard, as well as the benefit of the wind gauge in many scenarios, but if played smartly the French will manage to offset those advantages, applying his weight of numbers irresistibly against the English king&rsquo;s bid to rule France. Scenarios treat the variety of questions that puzzle historians about this battle, and since the game is not complex and plays under three hours, it offers a chance to explore many angles of historical interpretation.&#10;&#10;Right Fierce &amp; Terrible has one 22 by 34 inch map, oversized die cut counters, accessible rules with extensive illustrated examples of play, and seven scenarios with set-up diagrams for a quick start. Regardless of the scenario played, however, casualties will be horrendous, and there are tough decisions to make. Archery, ramming, grappling and melee are the tools of conquest here. The battle is likely to ebb and flow, squadrons can be captured, liberated, and captured again. Leaders, including King Edward, can also be captured and liberated, or killed by a stray arrow, or if nabbed, executed on the spot. Would Edward&rsquo;s demise have spared Flanders and France one hundred years of war? Knights can perform acts of heroism to avert disaster, but at great cost to themselves. Each fleet&rsquo;s morale will gradually deteriorate as the battle grows more desperate&hellip;until at last, one fleet finally breaks and the day is won!&#10;&#10;",

So there are blue green fish, pink yellow fish, purple purple fish. The parents are in the same colors, some male, some female. So, for example, to collect the blue green baby fish, you need a blue male and green female, or a blue female and green male. Any used cards go to the discard, which gets shuffled round and feed back into the reef. The cost of cards depends on their position on the reef, and there is a rule for flowing cards through past your boats.&#10;&#10;The Reef is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A frightening virus, Virus Q, is spreading in the major cities of the planet. Infected people and animals change rapidly, becoming horrible bloodthirsty and almost unstoppable creatures. Our only hope is to find the zero patient and the place where everything originated. There, perhaps, we can find an antidote and return the hope to the dying humanity.&#10;&#10;But not everyone agrees. There are those who want to take advantage of the chaos and terror in order to gain power and establish a new form of government, trying to maneuver and control the monsters generated by the virus. A cure would ruin their plans forever.&#10;&#10;The virus was created in a secret military lab, in a space that's practically inaccessible. Inside, Virus Q spread for the first time, accidentally, maybe; the creatures that now inhabit the Lab are difficult even to imagine...&#10;&#10;In the innovative lab crawler game Virus, players are the team that infiltrates the Lab looking for the antidote to Virus Q. They will collect the few and fragmentary bits of information scattered in the laboratory, avoiding or fighting the monsters that populate it.&#10;&#10;The map generation and the movement/placement of monsters depends on the player actions with a semi-automatic mechanism controlling what takes place where. The fighting requires some dexterity elements as well as players must plan their tactics by combining their shooting power with available movement, achieving successes by rolling cubes.&#10;&#10;Also, the game takes place in real time!&#10;&#10;In sum, you can play Virus cooperatively, semi-cooperatively or competitively. The &quot;infiltrator&quot; option makes the game even more exciting and unpredictable!&#10;&#10;",

The starter set also includes a rulebook, and everything needed to play.  These sets were produced in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games, and are set in the Deadlands game world of the wild west (but there are other themes that use the same disc mechanism).&#10;&#10;This game uses full-color illustrated discs to represent the cowboys, supernatural beings, buildings, and other accessories used in the game.  The discs are used to wage gunfights and large-scale western battles.  The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.&#10;&#10;",

Now revamped, expanded, and improved.&#10;&#10;Better Dead Than Zed sweeps you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Who you are when the outbreak occurs is just as important as where you are. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for awhile, you won't be able to tell the humans from the zombies until maybe it's too late. Because it's all happening to you just like it would on Day One.&#10;&#10;Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you'll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days?&#10;&#10;Then what?&#10;&#10;All Things Zombie takes you to where no other zombie game has before. Yes, it starts on the first day of the outbreak, but then let's you continue your life building your very own future. It's a game where every detail has been covered, as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you, then hunt them down and take back what's yours.&#10;&#10;On the way there you'll find out that maybe your most dangerous enemies aren't the zombies, but maybe your neighbors or sometimes your friends. All Things Zombie can be played solo, cooperatively with everyone on the same side, or competitively with everyone against one another. All Things Zombie can be played as a one up game or part of an ongoing campaign.&#10;&#10;But it doesn't matter which way you play it, as the goal of All Things Zombie is to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player takes the four dice, and other players mark off 1-3 spaces on flags.&#10;&#10;On a turn, roll the four dice up to three times, re-rolling dice as you wish. The dice show five colors (that match the flags and the colored rings on the target) and an arrow. For each arrow, you can assign it to a color that you rolled, then mark off a space on the central target. With two arrows, one blue, and one red, for example, you can mark off two blue spaces, two red spaces, or one blue and one red space. Once you've marked off all the spaces in a colored ring, any additional &quot;hits&quot; on that color cause your opponents to lose spectators &mdash; because you're clearly far more awesome than they are!&#10;&#10;If you roll two or more dice of the same color, you can mark off an equal number of spaces on the flag of that color; when you mark off the final space in the corner of a flag, you receive that flag's bonus, such as marking off any two spaces, or taking a token that lets you change a die to the face of your choice, or taking a different token that allows you not to lose spectators during a turn of your choice.&#10;&#10;If you roll four arrows, all opponents lose four spectators, and if you roll four different colors, you use the special power of your role, such as forcing others to use only three dice for a round or adding a green or blue circle to opponents' targets.&#10;&#10;If you lose all of your spectators, you're out of the game. If you're the last archer in the game, you win! Alternatively, if you've marked off all the spaces on your target and you have the most spectators, you win.&#10;&#10;",

Kit Carson was given command of the US forces, and his mission was to find the Comanche and Kiowa winter camps and eliminate this threat to the settlers that were moving into and through this area of the Texas panhandle.&#10;&#10;Adobe Walls shares many similarities with Little Bighorn.  The battle features a famous US leader in Kit Carson, attacking a large Indian camp along a river with a much smaller US force. He is also temporarily separated from the pack train, and the size of the Indian force was greatly underestimated.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Battle of Adobe Walls&quot; adds a new weapon to the series, the Mountain Howitzer. Although short in range it was a very powerful weapon and it had a huge psychological impact on the Indian warriors who faced it.&#10;&#10;The game features:&#10;&#10;&bull;     Kit Carson and Chief Dohausen&#10;&bull;     Mountain Howitzers&#10;&bull;     Comanches and Kiowas&#10;&bull;     Infantry, Cavalry, and Scouts&#10;&bull;     2 separate Indian camps&#10; Game scale&#10;Each combat unit represents:&#10; - one US Cavalry company&#10; - approximately 100 Indians&#10; - individual leader&#10;Each hex equals 1/4 mile across.&#10;Each game turn represents 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;This wargame is part of a series: The Battle of Rosebud Creek, The Battle of the Little Bighorn, and The Battle of Adobe Walls, November 25, 1864.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Gallipoli, 1915: Churchill's Greatest Gamble&quot;, realistically covers the first three days of the campaign, a time of wild maneuver, of decisive attacks parried by the timely arrival of reinforcements, and the onset of trench warfare. Speed - but not reckless haste - is the key to success.&#10;&#10;On 25th April 1915, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, launched a hastily assembled force of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops against the Turkish defenses on the Gallipoli peninsula. Their goal was to capture the forts that guarded the Dardanelles. With that achieved, the British and French Fleets would sail to Constantinople, topple the Ottoman government, and open up a supply line to Russia. However, defending the beaches was an equal number of Turkish divisions, hardened in the recent Balkan Wars, led by well-trained Turkish officers, supported by advisors from the German General Staff.&#10;&#10;An hour before dawn, in complete silence, the Anzacs rowed ashore at Ari Burnu, a place later to be famous as Anzac Cove. The Royal Navy had landed them in the wrong place! Huge dirt cliffs and scrub-choked washouts confronted them, rather than a beach and low dunes. Nevertheless inland they went, overrunning the Turkish pickets, only to become hopelessly confused by the night landing, jigsaw terrain, and inexperience. Several miles inland, a gifted Turkish Officer, Mustafa Kemal, was reviewing his regiment after night maneuvers above Ari Burnu. Kemal's quick and furious counter-attack saved the day for the Ottomans, and set him on the path to become the founder of modern Turkey. Further south, at Cape Helles, the Lancashire Fusiliers won six Victoria Crosses - before breakfast - as they ripped through the barbed wire on the beach. The invaders never reached even their first day's objectives, although the Turks only avoided defeat by a hair's breadth. With a different plan, they might have thrown the invaders back into the sea.&#10;&#10;The map scale is 400 metres per hex and covers the entire peninsula from north of Anzac Cove to Cape Helles, based on the 1922 British Ordnance Survey (i.e. from Anzac to Helles, including all the forts in between). Players can choose to land at the historical beaches, or create their own plans.&#10;&#10;This wargame system emphasizes command and control. Players command by Brigade and Regiment. To be successful, a player must plan for the eventual exhaustion of their troops, rotating them out of line to rest and recover stragglers. The result is an accurate modeling of the tempo of these battles. Infantry combat is ranged rifle and MG fire, culminating in close assault. Artillery is powerful but ultimately limited. Shrapnel from the standard field guns is deadly against troops in the open, but only the rare howitzers firing high-angle HE can deal with trenches.  Daylight turns are two hours, night turns are four hours.&#10;&#10;",

The tricky part, however, is that if your opponent has a pawn in this area when you cover it, you must lose one of your pawns elsewhere on the board, replacing it with the opponent's pawn!&#10;&#10;If you connect two opposing sides with your C-tiles, you win. Alternatively, if your opponent can't play, you also win!&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player assigned to a clan, although possibly they will be a saboteur for the other clan. Starting from the mine card in the center of play, you take turns laying down tunnel cards to build outward from the mine toward the four corner cards, only one of which is the exit. In addition to building new tunnels, you'll play cards to give yourself equipment, place monsters in front of others, discover who's actually on your clan, and reveal the exit before trudging all the way there. As soon as you leave the mine, you reveal your true identity, with any gold you have going toward your clan's total. As soon as all members of a clan have left, the game ends, and whichever clan has the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;",

Schmid under the title Dance of the Witches, this is essentially Pachisi but so that the playing pieces' identities are hidden, and after a while the game gets pretty chaotic with each player trying desperately to remember which of the witches belong to them and not help opponents or hinder themselves by mistake - it's even possible to drive opposing pieces home by driving them into your own base by mistake, in which case they will instantly teleport to the correct one. Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.&#10;&#10;Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and the Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, and various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 &ndash; 4 hours.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s New in the Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;Fields of Fire Volume I Deluxe Edition is a completely improved edition of Fields of Fire Volume I. Based on the past 15 years of feedback, hundreds of hours of playtesting, and long discussions with the design team, the Deluxe Edition presents Ben Hull&rsquo;s masterpiece of tactical infantry command in a way that is accessible to the modern gamer while retaining all of the deep complexity that veteran players have grown to love over the years.&#10;&#10;New features Include:&#10;&#10;- A Rewritten series rulebook. The Deluxe Edition comes with a rewritten third edition ruleset, packed with examples, diagrams and clarifying notes while maintaining continuity with the second edition rules. Series Developers Andrew Stead and Colin Parsons have worked to eliminate ambiguities and edge cases throughout, creating a much-improved reference manual for play.&#10;&#10;- A Starter Guide. While Fields of Fire has a reputation for being difficult to learn, the Starter Guide makes it easy. Each chapter in the Starter Guide incrementally introduces new rules through training exercises that teach you the basics of infantry combat. Later exercises act as advanced guides on setting up for air assaults and making the best use of supporting vehicles.&#10;&#10;- A Full Starter Mission. A stand-alone mission tailored towards easing new company commanders into the full game. This mission can be played repeatedly with a variety of simplified rules to allow you to adjust to the full historical campaigns.&#10;&#10;- Four Fully Redesigned Mission Books. Using the much-improved format from Fields of Fire: The Bulge Campaign, the Normandy, Heartbreak Ridge, Naktong River and Vietnam campaigns are presented in a clarified and expanded manner.&#10;&#10;- Over 200 updated counters plus various additional reference markers and new units.&#10;  &#10;- New elevation cards to enhance the Heartbreak Ridge campaign.&#10;&#10;- A completely new set of redesigned player aids including new charts and air assault planning cards.&#10;&#10;This game is based on four actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry (Regiment) in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The 9th infantry are known as the &quot;Manchus&quot; for their service in the Boxer Rebellion. Their motto is &ldquo;Keep Up the Fire.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

He loved sweets so much that he wanted to eat the best sweet in the heaven, and to do that he climbed up a ladder made from shrimp. Just at the moment he reached heaven, the god of thunder met him while patrolling. The god of thunder was pissed because no mortal human was allowed to intrude the sacred heaven. A flash and thunder hit poor Sweet Nose, who fell from the ladder like a meteor and dissolved into a pile of black powder when he hit the ground, transforming into tiny insects &mdash; the ants.&#10;&#10;To avoid being hit by thunder and becoming the successor of the Sweet Nose legend, you had better not eat too many sweets. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy those delicious sweets in the city &mdash; but if you enter specific stores on the street, you might need to run from the thunder of heaven...&#10;&#10;Sweet Nose is a game of exciting interaction. You try to eat the most types of candy by trading with others, but the sweetness of each candy differs for each player, so to keep yourself from being the one who eats too many sweets, you need to be careful when trading and observe the reaction of other players. What's more, different shops provide different surprises, so you also need to take those shops' candies into consideration. On a turn, you can do one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Trade with friend: Trade one of your candies with another player, with each player placing the candy they receive on their mouth board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Trade with market: Trade one of your candies with the market in the middle of table, placing your candy in the market and one of the market candies on your trading dish board.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever eats the most sweets loses, and the winner is the one who eats the fewest sweets.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Kunst&quot; contains historical events related to art, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to use your guides to move clients up and down the mountain safely before the storm arrives. Each turn, you are limited in the number of climbers you can move. Guides can move clients farther, but your clients outnumber your guides. An event chit is drawn that must be either purchased out of a limited amount of Prestige Points or it goes on the Storm Track, hastening the arrival of the storm. The storm phase decreases movement and increases the difficulty of managing the clients.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for clients that reach the summit and live to return to base camp.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;As the owner of an exotic travel company that specializes in extreme sporting activities, you provide clients with a way to reach the top of the world, Mt. Everest. Unfortunately, several other competing agencies have opened up, each with the goal of becoming the most prestigious and successful travel company.&#10;&#10;You control the guides and clients attempting a dangerous ascent to the summit of Everest as a deadly storm approaches. The more clients that reach the summit and live to tell the tale, the greater your company's prestige and fortune. Can you triumph over a Disaster on Everest?&#10;&#10;Control the movement of your guides and climbers as they navigate the treacherous ridges, ascend the technically-challenging Hillary Step, and strive to reach the &quot;top of the world!&quot; Maximize the use of your guides' special abilities to safely escort your clients as the storm approaches. Manage the events on the mountain or lose your well-paying important clients to the inevitable disasters that await.&#10;&#10;Advanced and optional game rules add client traits and unique travel company abilities.&#10;&#10;Followed up and expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Disaster on K2 &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game of first lines and last words.&#10;&#10;Ex Libris has been a firm favourite with book lovers, and readers and writers, since Oxford Games first devised and published the game in 1991.&#10;&#10;Ex Libris is a subtle, yet highly entertaining game of bluff that will challenge your literary acumen and test your writing skills as you attempt to compose fake, but plausible, first or last lines for genuine English novels.&#10;&#10;One hundred authors representing widely different writing styles are featured in Ex Libris &ndash; from Charles Dickens to Harold Robbins, from Jane Austen to Barbara Cartland.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round one player, taking a turn as the reader, picks a card and reads it out loud. The other players then have each to write a plausible opening or closing sentence to the work in an attempt to bluff fellow players into believing his or her &lsquo;script&rsquo; to be the genuine one. These are all handed in to the reader, who has meanwhile written down the genuine sentence (given on the back of the card). The genuine and fake are shuffled together, and then each sentence is read out. Each player votes for the sentence he/she believes is the real one.  Players win a point for each vote cast for his or her entry (while further points are won if you manage to identify the genuine sentence). The reader receives a point if no one manages to identify the authentic sentence.&#10;&#10;Players try to both:&#10;&#10;&#10;     guess the correct 1st or last line to a novel&#10;     write a fake 1st or last line to a novel and trick other players into thinking it is real&#10;&#10;&#10;Points are scored for making correct guesses and for tricking other players. The actual 1st/last lines for novels such as the following are included:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Moby Dick&#10;     Pride and Prejudice&#10;     Jude the Obscure&#10;     Zuleika Dobson&#10;     The Spy Who Loved Me&#10;     The House at Pooh Corner&#10;&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Liebrary&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the APL website:&#10;&#10;Spain&rsquo;s colony of Cuba had attracted American expansionist desires since at least the 1850s. By the end of the century, the American &ldquo;Yellow Press&rdquo; had made attempts by Cuban revolutionaries to overthrow Spanish colonial rule a leading news story. American public opinion demanded that Spain grant independence to Cuba.&#10;&#10;When the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded in Havana harbor, President McKinley could no longer resist the tide of public sentiment. The U.S. government demanded that Spain withdraw from Cuba, and the U.S. Navy initiated a blockade of Cuban ports on 21 April 1898.&#10;&#10;For the sake of honor, Spain declared war on 23 April and dispatched an ill-equipped and completely outclassed fleet to the Caribbean. In two smashing naval victories the U.S. Navy defeated the Spanish fleets in the Philippines and the Caribbean. The U.S. Army seized Santiago de Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Manila.&#10;&#10;The fighting ended in less than four months, but the diplomats needed eight more to reach a peace agreement. The Spanish Cortes, unable to accept either its loss of Great Power status or that of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, rejected the treaty. The Queen Regent overruled their action to prevent further consequences. The &ldquo;Disaster of &rsquo;98&rdquo; crushed Spanish national pride and helped undermine Spanish democracy and constitutionalism.&#10;&#10;For quite different reasons the U.S. people and government were divided over the treaty. They questioned annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Many did not want to give up their isolationism. The war served notice that the U.S. was now a Great Power. The twentieth century would become one of American world influence.&#10;&#10;1898: The Spanish American War includes 22 scenarios. Of these, 15 are playable with the game pieces and maps provided in the game. The other seven require one or more pieces from other Great War at Sea titles. Two campaign scenarios allow players to play out the entire war at sea.&#10;&#10;The operational map covers the area around Cuba and Puerto Rico where the war&rsquo;s most important campaign took place. The game includes the full Spanish and American fleets of 1898, plus a number of American warships of the early 20th century.&#10;&#10;",

As the commander of an army regiment, U.S. or German, you'll control platoon-sized elements of infantry, armor, artillery, air and support units, each represented by a playing card. Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.&#10;&#10;Sold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.&#10;&#10;Starters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.&#10;&#10;",

Players will represent different paths for Fate, and will try to shape the destiny of those Houses to best suit their goals.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 6 or 9 turns, and at every turn each player has the opportunity to hide one (and sometimes more) cards under the board in front of him (this is called &quot;influencing&quot; the Houses and it's like a hidden bet on the house, trying to get control over it) and to play cards for their effects (Major Arcana cannot be hidden but have stronger effects). Playing cards will impact, among other things, the ranking of the Houses in terms of prestige. To optimize point scoring, a good player will try to gain influence over &quot;winning&quot; houses without wasting too many cards for acheiving that, and/or to influence Houses in the lower positions with little effort. Experienced players will learn how to deceive their opponents about their real intentions.&#10;&#10;Skill, bluffing, intuition and reading your opponent&rsquo;s moves are all skills required to gain victory.&#10;&#10;Arcanum is the first board game by the world acclaimed Tarot publisher Lo Scarabeo, and includes a complete tarot deck: a &quot;family friendly&quot; version of the Initiatory Tarot of the Golden Dawn featuring wondrous illustrations by the artist Patrizio Evangelisti.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bone to Pick is a thrilling, fast paced semi-cooperative party game with multiple game modes. Battle against the undead in a Quick or Campaign game!&#10;And if you want to &quot;raise the bar&quot; - try the Epic mode.&#10;&#10;1668. The world as we knew it is gone. Millions of roaming undead have taken over most of 17th century Europe. You and a ragged band of survivors discovered an abandoned haven, a ghostly city with crumbling stone walls. You are few, low on supplies and an undead horde is drawing closer. You have to make your stand here it seems. Kill the abominations, gather their trophies, but also beware of your treacherous companions, or you will not survive the onslaught.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need the Weapon Decks and the Undead Deck for the Base Game. Before starting the game, draw 10 Undead Cards randomly; without knowing their order or strength; to create the Undead Deck and each player receives their own Weapon Deck of 12 cards.Each player places their card face down and turn them simultaneously.&#10;&#10;The combined scores will tell whether you&rsquo;ve lost the battle&hellip;&#10;...or vanquished the enemy! The player who played the strongest Weapon Card can keep the defeated Undead Card as a trophy.&#10;&#10;If your Haven has survived the onslaught, the next step is to sum up the strength of the remaining Weapon Cards and to add the value of the defeated Undead Cards Trophy Points player by player. The player with the highest score will become&#10;the LEGEND.&#10;&#10;If you have lost and your Haven was razed to the ground, sum up the strength of the remaining Weapon Cards. The player with the highest score will become&#10;the SCAPEGOAT.&#10;&#10;Campaign Mode enables players to fight the Undead in four waves, where each wave tis stronger than the previous one.&#10;Players can upgrade their weapons after each wave and the best defenders will also gain extra rewards. At the end, if the Haven is still standing, the summed up scores of the four waves will determine the winner.&#10;&#10;The game can be played up to 12 players with 2 core box.&#10;&#10;-description from artist&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;",
