If they can't beat it with a higher card, or are able to utilize a Power Card, then they must take that Viral Load and add it to their own Viral Load. The next round starts with the player who played the last card (except when Contagion&trade; is played).&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner until all cards in the center pile are exhausted and the game ends when the first person plays their last card. All players then count the total number of cards in their Viral Loads and in their hand (if any are remaining).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take to the seas Pirate Captains! The merchants are over burdened with goods and money and need your assistance to relieve them of their troubles. But be leery! The King's navy is on the lookout for the Jolly Roger. Get your loot, sell it, and be the one with the most wealth at the end of the season by any means necessary!&#10;&#10;Scourge of the High Seas is played over 5 rounds where players will move their ship to attack merchants, islands and the navy in order to gain supplies to sell at market in trade for money. Once sold, bury the money and treasure to keep it safe for the end of the game. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;FEATURES&#10;&#10;     3-6 players&#10;     90-120 Minute Playtime&#10;     200+ Pieces and Tokens&#10;     Deck of treasure cards&#10;&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Three to six players can set sail on the ocean to try and gain the most money. Players will search out merchant ships or royal held islands and plunder them for supplies, treasure and money. With the supplies, the players can deliver them to nearby markets for selling to further increase their money. However, a captain's fortune is not safe until they can successfully bury it on the hidden island. Do not hold onto too much loot or another player may decide you are an easier way to grow their fortune.&#10;&#10;Each player will have crew tokens to assign positions on their ship board in secret. When all players have made their assignments, everyone reveals their choices and whoever has the most speed will move first. Crew assignments may depend on many factors including wind direction, nearby targets to attack, other players and the navy ships out on patrol.&#10;&#10;Each round the merchants and navy move around on trade routes, while the King's islands produce more supplies to be sold at market. Each market has its own demands for the four different types of supplies and it changes as player's sell their ill-gotten goods. In addition, every round has shifting winds making every decision in every round impactful.&#10;&#10;Will you go for the island that has a bunch of one resource in hopes the market demand is high? Or will you risk confrontation with the navy to steal from the merchant ships? Perhaps that other pirate ship is too encumbered by its own fortunes and is ripe for the taking. The choice is yours and each game has a different starting layout giving unending variety.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It takes something that a lot of people find intimidating and lonely&mdash;creative writing&mdash;and tries to make it lighthearted, fun, and just a little competitive. (Maybe more than a little for some of us.)&#10;&#10;In Tall Tales, your group will write an original story together. Players each write their own scenes and submit them to the group in the hope that their scene will be chosen for the group&rsquo;s tale. A player wins by scoring the most points, which players score by having other players vote for their scenes and also by voting for the scenes that are popular with other players.&#10;&#10;Tall Tales begins with a warm-up called the Quest Round in which players begin to imagine the world they're building together. After the Quest Round, the game plays out over three Scene Rounds. Players in the Scene Rounds each draft a scene for the tale and then anonymously vote on which of the scenes best meets the criteria for the round. The scene with the most votes becomes part of the tale in each Scene Round until your group has a final, three-part tale.&#10;&#10;At the end of Round 3, players should count up their point tokens. The player with the most points wins the game. The winner of the game reads the completed tale aloud to the group, and all players live happily ever after.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thalassophobia: A deathly fear of the ocean&rsquo;s depths, and for good reason. You are a diver exploring an underwater grotto when your oxygen tank springs a leak. With only six minutes of air left in your tank, can you navigate this oceanic labyrinth and return to the surface in time?&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Gather all Blinks together into a single cluster. They should appear as murky, dark-blue waters. To begin, long-press a single Blink to turn it into a Diver. Now the clock is ticking, and the game has begun!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;When you begin a game, one of your Blinks will turn white, representing your current position on the board. Your air tank, represented by the number of lights on your Blink, has enough air to last for 6 minutes.&#10;&#10;The player&rsquo;s air tank counts down from 6 minutes to 1&#10;&#10;Any Blink adjacent to your current position will be visible, showing either open water or entangling seaweed.&#10;&#10;The player can see the Blinks immediately adjacent, but the rest are murky&#10;&#10;Move to an adjacent open water Blink by clicking it. When you do so, new Blinks will be revealed, and the Blinks you are no longer adjacent to will begin to fade into murky darkness.&#10;&#10;By moving their position, the player lights more of their surroundings&#10;&#10;As you explore, you may see a glimmer of light either in open water or on some seaweed - move onto that space to ascend towards the surface.&#10;&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that these chances are fleeting, and can only be spotted if a space is visible, so it&rsquo;s best to explore as much and as quickly as possible. If you find yourself trapped, you can always rearrange your Blinks to find a way out.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;Your goal is to get all the way to the surface and avoid drowning, which requires you to ascend a total of 6 times. Make it all the way to the surface within 6 minutes, and you win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rocks Off is a trivia game about Rock and Metal music, spanning more than five decades, brought to life with the combined knowledge of the staff of the German webmagazine www.powermetal.de.&#10;&#10;The game reduces trivia to the core: questions, answers, victory points. Each card contains three questions in three different levels of difficulty, sometimes plus a bonus question about song lyrics. The questions on a card always are about three different bands, musicians or events, so players being confronted with a question about a band they don&rsquo;t like won&rsquo;t be punished thrice.&#10;&#10;In the two-player-variant, players get a four cards each. The first player asks the questions of his first card starting with the lowest difficulty. If answered correctly, the second question is also read and the same for the third question. The answering player is awarded victory point cards for each question answered correctly based on the difficulty level, then the opponent reads his card. The game continues until all eight cards have been played. The player with the most victory points after these eight to twenty-four question have been asked wins the game.&#10;&#10;In the multiplayer variant each player gets one trivia card. Questions are read and tried to answer in turn, first the easiest level of difficulty, then the second and finally the third. Whoever answers a question correctly first receives a victory point card according to the difficulty level of the question. After all questions have been read and victory points have been awarded, the player with the most victory points is declared winner. In case of a tie, all song lyrics questions are asked providing a bonus round after which the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It contains:&#10;&#10;     The complete rules for fighting naval battles, including the use of aircraft, submersibles and coastal defences.&#10;     Detailed background notes on the progression of naval warfare through WWII.&#10;     28 historic scenarios, covering every theatre over the span of the whole war.&#10;     Exhaustive fleet lists for all the major belligerents, providing game statistics for hundreds of unique ships, submarines, aircraft and MTBs.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Victory at Sea: Royal Navy Submarines &amp; MTB sections&#10;&#10;Submarines: Designed for use in North European and Mediterranean waters, the S-class was manoeuvrable with a noted ability to crash dive extremely quickly. Combined with a large salvo of torpedoes, this was a successful design of pre-war years that was soon updated and put back into production.&#10;&#10;MTBs: The Fairmile A was designed from the outset to use prefabricated components that could be produced by small businesses such as furniture manufacturers, which would then be assembled at shipyards. Capable of 25 knots, it mounted a 3-pounder gun and a pair of .303 machine guns, as well as Depth Charge.&#10;&#10;Designed with the form of a destroyer&rsquo;s hull, the Fairmile B (like its predecessor, the Fairmile A) was intended primarily as a submarine-chaser, and so was fitted with Depth Charge. Manufactured in large numbers, the Fairmile B was also famously used on the raid on St. Nazaire.&#10;&#10;Capable of 26 knots, the Fairmile C was a motor gun boat, mounting two 2-pounders and eight machine guns of various calibres. It was mainly used for close escort duties and some clandestine missions.&#10;&#10;Nicknamed &lsquo;Dog Boat,&rsquo; the Fairmile D was highly adaptable and could be fitted with a range of armament that meant it could act as both motor gun and torpedo boat. Some were used by the Royal Air Force for long range rescue of downed airmen.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;3 S-Class Submarines&#10;4 Fairmile MTB Sections (A,B,C &amp; D)&#10;Ship Cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a famed mercenary seeking to establish your medieval empire, the prophecy has been commoner's talk for a while now: &ldquo;Of dragon scales gather up 10, and so become the ruler of men!&rdquo; But your arrival in the desolate lands has presented two hardships. Firstly, dragons don&rsquo;t give up their scales willingly. And second, you&rsquo;re not the only one who&rsquo;s heard the prophecy.&#10;&#10;Game play begins with card drafting as players create a unique hand to battle dragons and each other. Play continues in a series of rounds until 1 player wins by ending a round with 10 dragon scales or being the only player with at least 1 health token remaining.&#10;&#10;Dragon scales are gained by contributing strength to defeat a dragon, looting from the dragon, or stealing from other players (if you kill another player you gain all of their dragon scales).&#10;&#10;Each round has 3 phases.&#10;Phase 1: (every round)&#10;Players simultaneously play cards from their hand face-down. All cards are then revealed and resolved in a predetermined hierarchy (cards of the same hierarchy resolve clockwise from the dragon). &#10;Phase 2: (triggered only by specific phase 1 cards)&#10;A repeat of phase 1, however only players who have used specific cards during phase 1 can participate.&#10;Phase 3: (every round)&#10;Dragon combat and loot distribution. Players combine their strength in an attempt to defeat the dragon. The dragon player draws the top 3 cards from the dragon deck selecting one to play against all other players. The dragon card increases or decreases the dragon's base strength, often adding targeted abilities*. If the dragon is defeated, all contributing players take dragon scales. If undefeated, all players take 1 damage from the dragon. Looters acquire loot (dragon scales or items) from the dragon irrespective of the outcome.&#10;&#10;All non-core cards are discarded before and he role of dragon then shifts one player to the left (their mercenary becomes untargetable for the following round). A new round will then begin, rounds continue in this manner until a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;&#10;    In a round with 2 or 3 players, the dragon becomes automated. In this case the top card of the dragon deck is chosen and targeted abilities affect all players.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unique game elements include a mix of card-drafting, simultaneous-play, semi-cooperative and competitive tactics, and playing as both the dragon and dragon attacker (in different rounds).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This game challenges you on a mission to save India's states from global warming!&#10;&#10;Each card of Mission Emission represents a state or union territory of India. These cards have 6 environment related stats (called Missions) like Forest cover, Air Quality, Population Density, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The active player chooses a Mission/category and plays a card. &#10;     After each player has played a card from their hand in turn order, the player whose card has the highest stat of the chosen Mission wins a Point Card of that Mission.&#10;     Point Cards have victory points mentioned on them, and the player with the most points wins at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The fun lies in the Point Cards&mdash;the Point Cards opened later in the game are worth more points, so you may choose to save your best cards for later rounds. But be careful, the Point Cards may run out faster than you think! To add to the fun, some Point Cards are worth negative points, making this a competitive game which will leave you planning, plotting, sacrificing cards, and biting your nails right till the end!&#10;&#10;The game rulebook also comes with 2 more alternative sets of rules, and many more on the official website www.nightingame.com, so you can play a new variation every time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The fire dragons are sleeping. The giants of winter, lurking. The fall is precious and is vital to plan your actions wisely.&#10;&#10;Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime, you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to winning by carefully choosing your actions.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile, place one dwarf in a tile, or move one dwarf by one tile).&#10;&#10;Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.&#10;&#10;When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not yet played that round make their last turn and then the game ends. The points are calculated and the winner is whoever has more points.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note:  This edition also contains the special class meeples from Dwar7s Fall: Royal Decrees; the Guardian, the Warrior, and the King. It does not include the Scenario or Royal Decree cards.&#10;&#10;",

Its crew used their skill in disguising the appearance of the vessel to aid its encounters or avoid enemy warships. The journey of the raider Atlantis lasted for over 600 days and traveled over 100,000 miles.&#10;&#10;Follows the 100,000 mile journey of the German &quot;auxiliary cruiser&quot; Atlantis, a &quot;merchant raider&quot; capable of changing its shaped and configuration as well as its flags.  Atlantis is probably the most successful merchant raider of all times when combining total tonnage sunk and how long it forced the Royal Navy to chase it; plus, it captured documents of strategic importance that actually impacted the war.  The &quot;adventure&quot; sounds like something from a movie, and in fact, did inspire one from which our title comes.

More eyes should mean more points, but every 15 minutes you need to remove a card from play. When you find an item, it is scored and can not be scored again. As a reward, you may take a card that was removed from play back, and restart your 15 minute timer.&#10;&#10;&#10;We're hitting the road again in Cow, Tiger, Santa Claus with the Co-Op rules card. This was a planned stretch goal that didn't make it. Instead of competing to be the first to find all three items, you are working as a group to get as many as possible before the clock resets your items.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This kit allows each player to start with a blank tile that can be played on any open square during their turn at any time during the game.&#10;&#10;The ACQUIRE Wild Tile Kit includes six (6) blank tiles and an instruction booklet. Tiles are from actual ACQUIRE games that have been painted to hide the designations. The instruction booklet is printed on yellow card stock for maximum durability and readability.&#10;&#10;The Wild Tile Variant allows each player to start the game with that one &quot;key&quot; tile that they may need at one point in the game. It increases the ability to create mergers and helps to alleviate frustration when a player has nothing but &quot;bad&quot; tiles and is unable to maintain a foothold in the game. Some games, with the luck of the draw, a player may never need their Wild Tile.&#10;&#10;Included with this Wild Tile Kit are Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE, which were designed to help eliminate the one-sided games that can occur during the regular game play in ACQUIRE.&#10;&#10;(The Wild Tile Variant is an idea conceived by Allan Wright)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game consists of collecting animals that belong to the same family and accumulate the most points according to the way they are played.&#10;&#10;The deck consists in 38 cards (36 native animals and 2 rules cards).&#10;&#10;Each card includes the name of the species, the family it belongs, the number of members of that family and the points it's worth.&#10;&#10;How to collect points? There are 3 ways:&#10;1. Reuniting an incomplete family, you obtain the sum of the points of the cards played.&#10;2. Reuniting a complete family on the board, on different turns, you obtain the sum of the points of the cards + points indicated on the bonus card.&#10;3. Reuniting a complete family in one turn, you obtain double points (from played cards + bonus)&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player has 5 cards, on each turn there are two phases:&#10;1. Draw a card from the deck or discard pile and play a family (complete or incomplete).&#10;2a. Say it's the end of the turn turn.&#10;2b. Or the player can discard a card from the hand, then asking to opponent if he has a card that can be used to complete a family: if he does, he must give it to the player; if he doesn't, the player loses the discarded card.&#10;&#10;At the start of the next turn, each player starts draw to complete a hand of 5 cards and start again until the deck is depleted.&#10;&#10;",
