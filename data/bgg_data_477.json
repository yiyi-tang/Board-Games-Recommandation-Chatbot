Two, three or four people can play.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Action takes place on a board with traditional checker-squares on it, separated so that red squares touch red squares at diagonal corners and similarly, white squares touch white squares at diagonal corners.  Moves by players are made diagonally.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The object of the game is to capture opponents' men by leap-frogging over them until the checkers of only one player remain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It will be noted that there is a big square area in the center of the board.  Wings extend in four directions giving the playing area the shape of a cross.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;CHECK-O is a direct descendant of the ancient game of Checkers, devised over 5,000 years ago by the Egyptian Pharoahs (sic), so history tells us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When the Roman soldiers conquered Egypt, they took home many souvenirs of their exploits in North Africa.  Among these was the game of Checkers.  Even in ancient times, moves were made in the same way - diagonally across the board - and each player faced his opponent with twelve men.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;CHECK-O, though similar to Checkers, is faster-moving and gives more opportunity for strategy.  This is especially true in CHECK-O DOUBLES when each player must out-plan and out-think three opponents who are coming towards him from three different directions.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The players start with a small whale boat that is placed inside an individual&rsquo;s factory ship. Each player places one&rsquo;s own factory ship at an individual start space at the edge of one&rsquo;s own quadrant. One of the whales is placed on one the four spaces in the center of the gameboard. Players, in turn, move their factory ships according to the number indicated on the spinner. If spinner points to a picture of a whale, then the whale moves according the number on its spinner. A player must separate the whale boat from the factory ship when the whale and the factory ship are in the same quadrant. Whale boats have their own spinner and they move slower that do the factory ships. When the whale boat and the whale are on the same space, the whale has been harpooned and the player scores a point for killing the whale. The whale boat must be moved back into the factory boat and another whale is brought into play. The last whale brought into play is white and it is worth two points. The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll the dice and move on a board to various colored spaces and attempt to answer corresponding questions.  The questions are directed at educating and testing children's knowledge on various safety issues such as water safety, strangers, bicycle/vehicle safety, etc.  When a player answers correctly, he receives a black velcro piece representing a jail bar that is affixed to the player's card.  When the player has accumulated sufficient jail bars to lock up &quot;Wacko Weasel&quot; and &quot;Pud Possum&quot; (pictured on the cards), he wins.  A player may also be sent to a &quot;Danger Zone&quot; space which requires the additional answering of a question or other penalizing action.&#10;&#10;The game has an interesting feature which allows children to play even when there is not an adult available--a cassette tape which has a voice reading questions and answers than can be used instead of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragons, &quot;The Family Game of Frenzy,&quot; is a family-style card game where up to eight players simultaneously attempt to get rid of their deck by playing their cards to sequentially build &quot;dragons.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game's core mechanic is a type of simultaneous, speed-based card play similar to that used in solitaire.  Players have five card slots in front of them, from which they play cards into the center of the table onto piles which comprise dragons made up of first a tail, then the numbers 1-10, and then a head.  When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.  Players may play on any dragon stack in the center, which leads to a great deal of frenzy as players try to monitor their own play stacks, keep an eye on the multiple dragon piles that are constantly growing, and try to avoid allowing other players to gain an advantage in building.&#10;&#10;Optional rules introduce complexity in scoring, the color sequencing of dragons, battles between players for simultaneous card play, and two-headed or two-tailed dragons.  A notable feature of the game is its giant fold-out play mat which includes markings for card play and card slots.&#10;&#10;",

The time for diplomacy has long since passed. The time for advanced warmongering is upon us.&#10;&#10;COMMAND CARDS:&#10;&#10;One of the biggest differences from the classic game is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, nuclear, and diplomat. These fill a number of roles with the most basic function being to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided dice rather than the typical six-sided, but perhaps the most important function of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of cards of various types. The addition of these cards, and in particular the addition of the Advanced Tech command deck, has a huge effect upon the gaming dynamics. With the addition of these cards the board is opened up making no position impregnable and no attack a certainty. With these cards in use, the game is more fluid with gaming positions and strategies needing to be constantly shifted&#10;&#10;RULE VARIATIONS:&#10;&#10;The Advanced Tech cards are designed for use as command cards alongside the original sets provided with the standard game. No additional commander token has been provided as it is suggested that the Advanced Tech cards be used in place of the Diplomat cards. If preferred, the Advanced Tech cards can be used in conjunction with additional tokens, representative of an additional commander, therefore allowing the use of all five of the original commanders as well.&#10;&#10;Advanced Tech 2nd Edition&#10;&#10;Released in its original form in the summer of 2007, this twenty card expansion deck was then re-released in January 2008 sporting some new wording and improved graphics. Like our other decks, the Advanced Tech Command Deck is designed to be used alongside the original game and can either be used in place of an existing command deck of the players choice or with the use of additional command tokens available from our online store.&#10;Second edition adds +1 Landmine and subtracts the one Subliminal Orders&#10;&#10;- Landmine (Cost 1 to be played at beginning of turn before any attacks): This card allows the playing player to draw a land territory card which they then place secretly in front of them. The next time an opponent attacks the territory shown, that player loses Mods equal to half of a D6 dice roll.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Risk 2210 A.D.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This contains 24 squares representing all ways to divide a square into four equal triangles (with short edges along the square's diagonals) and color the triangles with 3 colors.&#10;&#10;Wade E. Philpott sold a cardboard set of squares, including rules for several games and puzzles, beginning in 1966. Kadon distributed it beginning in 1982 and started producing an acrylic version in 1989.&#10;&#10;The second edition Kadon rulebook (dated 1991) contains rules for 4 games, plus variants. The first three were originally designed by Philpott, although they have been changed slightly over the years; Closure was not in the original set and was presumably designed by Kate Jones.&#10;&#10;The games are:&#10;&#10;Multimatch. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 gameboard. Edges must match and the first piece placed on a border of the board determines the color of that border. Last player wins.&#10;&#10;Bingo. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 grid, attempting to be the first to create a row of 5.&#10;&#10;Outmatched. Players divide the tiles equally (face-down) and then race to assemble their group into a rectangle, with tile edges matching.&#10;&#10;Closure. The tiles are assembled into a random (but edge-matching) group. Players take turns &quot;closing&quot; one of the 3 colors by moving as few tiles as possible. Closing a color requires leaving no exposed edges of that color. Moves may not separate any tiles from the group.&#10;&#10;",

The school fish move like pieces in Chinese checkers and the sharks move like kings in chess, capturing fish in the same fashion. The sharks win if they can eliminate the school, but a shark is also immobilized if at any time there are no adjacent fish. The school wins by immobilizing both sharks.&#10;&#10;This can also be played with multiple boards allowing each player to play as the school on one board and the sharks on the other.

There are two ways to capture the opponents soldiers, by custodian and by intervention. Custodian capturing is accomplished by ending one of your soldiers movement next to an opponent's while having one of your own on the opposite side as well. To capture by intervention you move one of your soldiers directly between two opposing soldiers and then capture both soldiers on each side. The edge of the board can be used to complete any line of three, capturing an opponent piece near the edge by either custodian or intervention.  The game is played until one opponent has no legal moves, which he then loses. A player also loses if he is reduced to two or less soldiers.&#10;&#10;Hosted for online play by SuperDuperGames.ORG, where it is known as &quot;Mak-Yek&quot;.&#10;&#10;",
