    "Description": "Rozpr&aacute;vkari is a card game based on fairy tales created by Slovak writer an folclorist Pavol Dob&scaron;insk&yacute;. The game aims at sparking the interest in Slovak folklore and literature in younger generations by using various fairy tale references in form of a flavor text or illustrations on the playing cards. The game itself can be used as an amusing educational tool, as the scoring mechanism is supposed to make younger players practice basic mathemataical operations.&#10;&#10;The game represents the fight between good and evil. The folklore villains decided to steal all the stories in which they have lost their fight. Players try to defeat these villains and rescue the stolen fairy tales. The goal is to collect all parts of as much fairy tales as possible, using 'wish' cards and 'doucat' tokens.&#10;&#10;The game was crowdfunded in 2017.&#10;&#10;",

As with the base game, good play involves being aware of your own strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of your opponent.&#10;&#10;The eight battles in this set are:&#10;&#10;First St. Albans (22 May 1455)&#10;Blore Heath (22 September 1459)&#10;Mortimer's Cross (3 February 1461)&#10;Towton (29 March 1461)&#10;Edgecote Moor (26 July 1469)&#10;Barnet (14 April 1471)&#10;Tewkesbury (4 May 1471)&#10;Stoke Field (16 June 1487)&#10;&#10;",

Germany, as anticipated, marched through Belgium and the rest is history. Although the French Army fought in many battles, the scenarios in this expansion focus on their most famous campaign &ndash; Verdun. The Battle of Verdun lasted from February to December 1916, and is a testament to the strength and fortitude of the French armed forces.&#10;&#10;The French Army expansion presents 12 scenarios from this famous battle. The box includes a rule and scenario book, 2 special personnel and terrain summary sheets, 3 punchboards of double-sided terrain tiles, tokens and markers, and a complete French force of plastic poilus.&#10;&#10;The French force consists of 48 French infantry, 3 French bombers, 3 French machine gun teams (each with one machine gun and 4 crew), and 3 French mortar teams (each with one mortar and 4 crew).&#10;&#10;There are also 14 French special personnel figures, such as engineers, flame-throwers, light machine gunners, and spotters. These special personnel figures add new rules to the core game. When a special personnel figure is added to a unit, this allows that unit to modify its normal actions according to the type of special personnel figure you have attached to it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185; (KoPlus) is an abstract game themed on far future Earth, where players compete to capture a space being known as 'KoPlus', which are Cosmic Fireflies.&#10;&#10;A simple game played on a modular board, where you play a tile to capture the most points. However, the game gets crunchy with the rules forcing you to play the 2 tiles alternatively, and failing to connect your tiles would grant you devastating penalty points.&#10;&#10;Meeting some conditions may grant you a powerful &quot;consecutive play&quot;. When to launch the move is also a tough decision.&#10;&#10;The game board is modular, and changes according to the number of players: 2 player is 3x3, 3 player is 3x4, and 4 player is 4x4 board pieces.&#10;&#10;The name KoPlus comes from the two game pieces, pentominos in a cup shape that looks like the sound 'Ko' in katakana (&#227;&#130;&#179;), and a plus shape (+). Put them together and you get KoPlus!&#10;&#10;The players take turns placing their pieces, connected to any pieces on a side. One player places in &#227;&#130;&#179; + &#227;&#130;&#179; + order, the next places in + &#227;&#130;&#179; + &#227;&#130;&#179; order, and so on. At the end of the game, if a player has been able to connect their own pieces together well, they get bonus points. But having their pieces scattered gets them negative points.&#10;&#10;As the game progesses, players try to place their pieces to cover the scoring squares on the board. Maximum scoring is nine points in a turn, and players must make legal moves even if they won't score. The game ends when no more legal moves are open.&#10;&#10;There is an extra move available when a player hits 20, 40 and 60 points scored. They get a right to have an extra move immediately. This not only increases their scoring opportunities, it can also help them break out of a difficult position.&#10;&#10;The game is a mix of planning and opportunity, and has been very popular in Japan after its release at the Tokyo Game Market in Spring 2017. Game design is by GameNOWA and production design is by SukiGames. The game designer originally styled the game name in Romaji as 'COPULAS', but settled on KoPlus as a better name.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#156;&#170;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#144;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#229;&#145;&#189;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#141;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;2&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#184;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#185;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#232;&#173;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#173;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#186;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#231;&#182;&#154;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 'Barbers!', you and a partner face the Sunday rush as new barbers - giving customers all the cuts and shaves they need while preventing the pesky old barber of the neighborhood from stealing customers from right under your nose!&#10;&#10;'Barbers!' is a dice-drafting, action selection game for 1 or 2 players. You and your partner play barbers, running a hair salon. There are three chairs in your salon, and a queue outside your shop!&#10;&#10;Each chair is represented by a card, which has spaces to place cubes. The spaces designate the services for haircuts, sides and shaves. A deck of cards represents the customers. Each customer is unique, requiring different services - for example, a customer may need a haircut and side trim, another might need only a shave. Each of these service requirements are denoted by haircut, sides and shave icons on the customer cards. For the customer in a chair, you render these services by placing cubes on the cube placement spaces on the chair the customer is in. Each turn, if the chairs are unoccupied, a customer from the queue moves into a chair, and the queue is refilled to 3 customers from the customers deck.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game, each player alternates taking turns. On their turn, a player rolls three dice, chooses one of the dice and takes an action associated with the dice score. These actions let you render the three different types of services i.e. hair, sides or shave. The second player then chooses one of the remaining two dice, and takes the associated action. The third die is for the Old Barber action - he is the shrewd old barber from the neighborhood. His actions almost always are meant to steal customers from you. He has many tricks up his sleeve for that - from offering free tea and coffee to chatting up customers to eventually lure them away from your salon! The players can counter him by taking 'Customer Preservation Actions' instead of the service actions - these can be buying tea for the customers themselves or by taking the help of a local goon to keep the Old Barber at bay! The players need to plan their actions carefully lest the die left for the Old Barber lets him steal a high- value customer!&#10;&#10;Players score points by &lsquo;completing customers&rsquo; i.e. by rendering all the required services. The customers claimed by the Old Barber through his actions earns him points. Sometimes, the players may need to work together to complete a customer to free up the chairs and move the queue forward - else the Old Barber may steal them!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins! If the Old Barber has most points, he wins.&#10;&#10;In the solo game, the Old Barber challenges you to a &lsquo;hair-off&rsquo; or a hair-cutting duel in your own shop - and he plays as the second player. The rules remain the same with some slight changes.&#10;&#10;Barbers! was created for the 2017 Mint Tin Design Contest, where it stood 7th in Best Overall Design category from 37 entries, and 2nd in Best Theme!&#10;&#10;",

Starting with a low startup capital they try to spend their money as efficiently as possible. Invest more into your company to get market advantages, or save your money to invest in more/better shares. The big amount of shares all investment companies buy and sell causes fluctuations in the stock market, but be aware! When players start to dump their shares, it could cause The Big Crash! Which player will handle the market the best and will earn the most money?&#10;&#10;It's now possible to buy any stock you want (up to 3 per round) and sell any stock you want, so you will have more control. The bidding system is still present, but this time you will bid for turn order. Also the market shifts on the amount of stocks sold or bought.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Khublai is by far a larger than life character both metaphorically and physically. A giant of a man, boisterous, and a hero of this people, he is the quintessential Mongolian wrestler; powerful, more agile, and faster than he should be. Khublai&rsquo;s weight and size prevents him from jumping very high. In game terms, this is represented by his inability to use the Leap command along with ignoring effects that move him to a jumping position on his actions, making him a huge and static target. He overcomes this hindrance with a powerful effect that allows him to ignore the first point of damage dealt to him each turn. This ability to ignore low damage and his utmost mastery of wrestling techniques, makes him a terror at close range. He controls the board with cards like Unmovable Block and Giant of Bokh. Khublai is a mountain that will crush any opponent that gets within his melee range. Horse Spirit, Ultimate Mekh, and Massive Chop are great options for overcoming his inability to leap with their small burst of speed. Learning how to overcome his inability to leap by playing powerful actions such as these that close the distance between him and his opponent is pivotal to winning with the Mongolian giant.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Wattana is small in stature and quiet, but under her serious and brooding demeanor exists an inextinguishable fiery champion. Her bone-crunching Muay Thai techniques are debilitating to the extreme. Her rigorous discipline and training unlocked some her inner phoenix, making her chi surrounding her appear as burning flames. She has very little movement options, and even the Command on her fighter ability encourages her to remain in place. That said, a simple Priority Bonus 2 with a fighter who makes use of hard style attacks is a huge threat, as it compensates for the main flaw of low priority values that come from heavy attacks. Moreover, her access to Chi Actions gives her some zoning control. Her two blasts, Flaming Strike and Phoenix Wings, are frustrating thanks to their Drain effect. Plummeting Elbow is a complete denier, in particular with damage boosting moves or modes. Twin Rising Uppercut is very unique with the ability to make two powerful attacks in a row, serving as the perfect response to weaker blocks. Her mode Art of Eight Limbs is great for building some power dice while also remaining steadfast.&#10;&#10;The Khublai vs Wattana fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions. The Brutal technique from the Hard style is a simple technique composed of slow attacks with very high damage output. Use Shattering Strike to set up for a follow-up that is guaranteed to cancel cowardly blocks. The Lock technique from the Wrestle style includes grapple attacks equipped with Trash effects that destroy the opponent&rsquo;s hand. This technique also compliments Severina&rsquo;s hand denial game. Just swap it out with one of the other wrestle techniques from the Turbo set to generate a deadly hand destruction deck.&#10;&#10;",

With his unparalleled ability to control the tactical situation in the HexaDome, he&rsquo;ll be able to adapt and rise victorious against any enemy.&#10;&#10;Valkyrie, Hannibal&rsquo;s impressive bodyguard, has proved herself more than capable to face HexaDome veterans the size of Maximus. Her terrifying battle cry can freeze the bravest hearts, and no one is safe when she wields her halberd.&#10;&#10;Laxmee, the unpredictable Masai hacker, will show new ways to use combat protocols with her military grade hacker device. Summoning programs like Masai Labions summon the rain, she can both help her teammates or hinder her opponents.&#10;&#10;Se&ntilde;or Massacre, the incorrigible masked luchador, has overflown all audimeters with his irreverent loquacity and his spectacular fighting style. His enemies learn the bad way that his tongue is sharper than his katanas.&#10;&#10;The two new States this expansion adds to the game allow new strategies in the HexaDome. Stunned enemies will lose successes in their rolls, while Focused allies will be able to increase their rolls to improve their chances of success.&#10;&#10;Whether together, or combined with previous Characters to build their own teams taking advantage of new synergies, these mercenaries will add a new range of possibilities that no Aristeia! player will want to let go.&#10;&#10;Soldiers of Fortune is not a full game. Need a copy of Aristeia! to play.&#10;&#10;",

You both want to have a set of 5 dice and make sure to pick a character from the set of cards. You are going to pick a new card in each round, but before a new round starts you must act out or do whatever your character card tells you to do! Next, you are going to start rolling your dice until someone gets a 4-of-a-kind. Once someone gets the number, they can knock down one of the bug food cards. The first player to knock over the required number of cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PORT-EN-BESSIN, NORMANDY, 7 June 1944: Port-en-Bessin was a little fishing harbor west of Arromanches in Normandy, it was situated between two landing zones, Omaha Beach the American sector, and Gold Beach the XXXth British Corps sector. The 47th Royal Marine Commando came ashore east of Arromanches and progressed toward Port-en-Bessin; at night the Commando stopped a few kilometers from the objective. On 7 June the British launched the attack with fighter bombers support; about forty men were killed to capture the harbor's western side. On 8 June British commandos liberated Port-en-Bessin and linked up with Americans from the 29th I.D.&#10;Welcome to ATS Port-en-Bessin! Even some of our vaunted tactical-level gaming compatriots may not realize that a house-to-house battle took place as part of the Normandy Invasion. The place was Port-en-Bessin, a small but important fishing town that was to be the objective for the 47 (RM) Commandos ... an amazing group of soldiers that would suffer heavy casualties in the operation. One source put it this way, &quot; About two miles outside Port-en-Bessin, you'll reach a wooded hill with a grassy crown covered with orchids called Mont Cavalier. It was here that the surviving men of 47 RM Commando spent the night of D-Day, the twin peaks of the Eastern and Western features brooding ominously on the horizon. They had supplemented their weapons with German Schmeissers and Spandaus, captured in firefights along the way.&#10;On the morning of June 7, they had got safely through the outer defences and headed into the port when disaster struck. While clambering up the steep slopes of the Western feature, one of their troops was caught out by withering fire from two German Flak ships, which were unexpectedly moored in the harbour. Eleven men were killed, 17 wounded and one &ndash; George Amos &ndash; captured. Meanwhile, back on Mont Cavalier, the unit's rear HQ was overrun.&#10;By the evening of June 7, the Commando was in a desperate position: isolated and under constant threat of counterattack from numerically superior enemy forces; low on ammunition, depleted by heavy casualties and exhausted after two days' fighting with no more than two hours' sleep. And still those impregnable features loomed. &quot;&#10;To make things easy for you to get YOUR boots on the ground, a complete set of a set ofcombat counters is provided -- and a mission that will test your tactical-level mettle! OWNERSHIP OF THE ATS RULEBOOK 2014 plus standard small and large system markers is required to play.&#10;Just bring your ATS Rulebook 2014 and system markers and you are ready to control every ... building to water's edge.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heromaniacs: A 2-Bit Dungeon Adventure Card Game (3rd Edition)  is a standalone light-hearted fantasy themed dungeon crawling card game for 2-4 players. The goal is very simple: be the first player to get from Level 1 of the dungeon all the way up to and out of Level 5. To do that, players must gain enough Experience (EXP) to advance through the various levels. To gain EXP, players must defeat monsters. To defeat monsters, players need to recruit Heroes.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. During a player's turn, that player takes one of the following actions: 1) Recruit a Hero, 2) Attack a monster, or 3) Level Up. RECRUIT: To recruit a Hero, the player chooses any number of Heroes from the available pool whose total Strength is 10 or less and adds them to his or her hand, OR a player may choose a Hero card, flip it to the opposite side, and recruit the Hero on the flipped side. ATTACK: To Attack a Monster, the player chooses a monster in play to attack, and then deploys at least one (1) Hero  to that monster. If the total Strength all of the Heroes deployed to that monster is greater than the level of the monster, the monster is defeat and the player collects that monster. If the total Strength of the Heroes deployed to the monster is equal to the monster's level, the monster is defeated, the player collects it, and the player can take an additional action during the turn. LEVEL UP: To Level Up, a player must cash-in a monster in his collected pile whose level (which also serves as EXP once the monster had been collected) is greater than or equal to the EXP requirement of the Dungeon Level that player is currently on. After a player has taken all actions for the turn, play passes to the player on the left.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this way until one player on Level 5 of the Dungeon gains enough EXP to escape. The first player to exit the dungeon, wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
