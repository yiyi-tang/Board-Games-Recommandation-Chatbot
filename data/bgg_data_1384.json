    "Description": "In Revolutions, you will relive the political conflicts and major societal choices of the 19th century, in France. You will embody the supporters of an ideology. You will fight and negotiate to win over an electorate, ensure the support of the media and the benevolence of the clergy.&#10;&#10;On the benches of the assembly or on the barricades, you will define the bases of a new society!&#10;&#10;The game lasts 6 rounds maximum. Each round consists of 5 phases.&#10;PHASE 1: SUPPLY. Players receive ACTION CARDS.&#10;PHASE 2: DIPLOMACY AND BETTING. Players plot, negotiate, promise... They then secretly place their action cards on the &quot;Stakes&quot; areas (NOTABLES, SONGS, CLERGY, PEASANTS (from turn 2), WRITTEN PRESS (from turn 3), WORKERS (from round 3), SOCIAL TENSIONS).&#10;PHASE 3: RESOLUTIONS. The bets are resolved. They allow players to gain votes in the CHAMBER or forces in the CIVIL WAR. Players can also modify the SOCIAL TENSIONS to trigger or counter an insurrection.&#10;PHASE 4: STATE MODIFICATION. Players join forces and compete to modify the STATE by taking LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS (Palais Bourbon) or by succeeding in a revolution :&#10;&#10;&#10;     Modify the Form of the State &#10;     Change the National Representation &#10;     Overthrow the executive (faction takes control of the EXECUTIVE)&#10;     Modify rights and freedoms&#10;     Modify SOCIAL TENSIONS: if the marker reaches 15, the phase ends immediately and an insurrection begins.&#10;&#10;&#10;PHASE 5: VICTORY POINT COUNT - PV. Each player is awarded victory points according to his faction's objectives. If a player reaches a score of &quot;50&quot;, he wins the game. Otherwise, at the end of the 6th round, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game requires four Rivals: in case you are only 2 or 3 players, the game itself will manage the other Rivals according to special &rdquo;AI rules&rdquo;. In this way, players may leave and join during the game: the &rdquo;AI&rdquo; will manage a team while they are gone.&#10;&#10;The base rules of the game are simple, but choices can be tricky. A round consists of all Rivals playing their matches simultaneously. Each Rival has to play two cards (a blue and an orange card) on a team in any other match than their own: but each team can only hold one card. A blue card gives scoring chances to both your team and the team you play it on, and an orange card gives scoring chances to both your opponent and the opponent you play it on. As the game progresses, more rules are added that have the Rivals affect their cards with &rdquo;success points&rdquo; that are assembled by winning games.&#10;&#10;The game has all the licenses required, so the teams, logos, and arenas are picked from the real world (teams like Malm&ouml; FF, IFK G&ouml;teborg etc). No knowledge of football is required, but the game is highly competitive as it requires you to win as many matches as you can &ndash; and subsequently have other Rivals preferrably lose their games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This wargame was designed by O&rsquo;Farell &amp; Robinson and printed by Hely&rsquo;s of Dublin in the 1940s (most likely the early 1940s). It may very well be a prototype. The game was first owned by a Dublin printer in the 1940s and remained within the same family until 2022.&#10;&#10;Similar to some other wargames of the era, the objective is to capture the enemy&rsquo;s GHQ using a variety of combat units while defending your own GHQ. In WARCHESS the units are comprised of infantry, tanks, artillery, forts (which remain stationary once placed), trucks, and trains. The latter two allow you to move eligible units a greater distance. WARCHESS is played on a game board showing a map of Western Europe with square &ldquo;hexes&rdquo; created using a vertical and horizontal grid.&#10;&#10;Contemporary games to this include Dennis Wheatley&rsquo;s Invasion (1938) and Campaign (1935) by Wills &amp; Hepworth Ltd. Campaign would be the most similar in play, with WARCHESS being more complicated due to the availability of more unit types.&#10;&#10;",

Play alone or up to six players, choose between the six protagonists of the Luxastra Fist Season: each of them has its own tableu, cards, powers... and every one is unique!&#10;&#10;In this cooperative adventure game, you move around the city of Fatumastra together with your allies. You will need to find the dreaded Portal of Corialus to defeat one of the many bosses included in the box. To do so, you move tile by tile, facing many obstacles, traps, and enemies and you use your cards to attack, defend, assist your allies and try to pass as many trials as you can. You must be fast: each turn, the enemy Menace might increase... and when it reaches 20 the game is over! Try not to do it too fast, though: being too tired makes you vulnerable, and even one fallen hero will mark the end of your adventure.&#10;&#10;May the Raven King be with you!&#10;&#10;&#10;Dal tavolo alla Rete e ritorno!

Scegliete tra i sei Personaggi Giocanti della Prima Serie di Luxastra: ognuno di loro ha la sua plancia, i suoi poteri, il suo mazzo, e tutti quanti sono assolutamente unici ed iconici.&#10;&#10;Usate le vostre carte per attaccare, difendervi, curare i vostri alleati e volgere i combattimenti a vostro favore. Ma non dimenticate che le vostre forze non sono infinite, e che restare senza energie durante il combattimento potrebbe rendervi la vita difficile, visto che non potete fermarvi.&#10;&#10;Ad ogni turno, dovrete cercare di farvi strada per la citt&agrave; Fatumastra, sempre di corsa tra le sue vie labirintiche. Tra vicoli ciechi, orde di nemici sul piede di guerra, artefatti nascosti nei luoghi pi&ugrave; imprevedibili, mentre la Minaccia continua a crescere e la mano invisibile del Fato cala su di voi.&#10;&#10;Non c&rsquo;&egrave; tempo da perdere! Perch&eacute; una volta che la Minaccia raggiunger&agrave; il valore massimo, il destino di tutta Delphes sar&agrave; segnato, e voi non potete permetterlo. Radunate i vostri amici, sedetevi al tavolo da gioco e accettate la sfida.&#10;&#10;Che il Re Corvo vegli su di voi.&#10;&#10;",

If the treasures do not seem sufficiently precious, one can try to get an unknown treasure of another player by skillful deduction. The other players have the chance to react - but they are not forced to. If the other players react, one has to tax their reaction: Are they trying to trick you into awakening the dragon or is there a treasure hidden underneath their tile? A suspenseful atmosphere evolves while players try to trick each other.&#10;&#10;Everybody wants to leave the mine, but nobody dares to, because another player might have more treasures. The player who assesses the other players and the situation in the mine best, will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Steam Battalions is a non-collectible, customized deck XCG, or Expandable Card Battle Game featuring stunning Steampunk &amp; Dieselpunk art in which 2 players face-off against each other, each using a customized deck they create from their own Starter Deck at the beginning of the game. Each Starter Deck contains the same specific 68 cards, from which each player customizes their own deck down to 40 cards plus 3 &quot;deck-diving&quot; Armory Cards, as outlined in the Steam Battalions rulebook.&#10;&#10;THE STORY:&#10;&#10;In an alternate past, the great wars of the early 20th century are waging high above the clouds and across the mud-filled trenches of Europe. The armies of the World's Superpowers battle for supremacy with elite units forged in brass, iron and steel in a technological arms race powered by diesel and steam. You &amp; your opponent create, customize &amp; command your own elite Steam Battalions of Deck-Dueling Steampunk &amp; Dieselpunk Dirigibles, Airships &amp; Superheroes &amp; send them into battle equipped with powerful Upgrades &amp; Tech in the quest for Victory!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;&#10;Steam Battalions is a fast-paced, 1-vs-1 Customized-Deck Dueling Steampunk Card Battle Game for ages 12 &amp; up that takes approximately 30-45 minutes to play. The objective is to be the first player to get 7 victory points (defeating 7 of your opponent&rsquo;s units), or if your opponent has no units to move out from their trench, whichever comes first.&#10;&#10;Players customize their deck, choosing their own balance of the five card types in the game; Unit Cards to send into battle with their own unique abilities &amp; upgrade lines, Tech Cards to grant them special abilities, Power Cards to enable their attacks &amp; Medic Baloon Cards to repair damage during combat. Both players also start with three &quot;Armory&quot; Cards that allow them to search their deck for a desired card at key moments during the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay employs streamlined card combat mechanics with a unique twist on these special &quot;deck-diving&quot; Armory cards that deepens the strategy in ways unique from other card battle games. In Steam Battalions, you can only receive &amp; play &quot;Armory&quot; cards after you lose one of your units. This prevents either player from gaining an insurmountable lead during early gameplay &amp; opens up new strategic choices you won't find in other games.&#10;&#10;Unique game mechanics are designed to reduce the 'grinding' of most deck-dueling games while accelerating the pace of turns, combat, customization, upgrades, card-drawing &amp; strategy.&#10;&#10;&#10;     NOTE : Each player requires their own deck to play, so the game is sold as a complete two-player set of two starter decks. For even further customization, experienced players can purchase additional starter decks &amp; may add cards from as many additional starter decks as they wish, subject to the deck customization rules outlined in the Steam Battalions Rulebook (free for download at link below).&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Don't let the reef get too crowded or you fail and the reef falls to decay.&#10;&#10;In Something Fishy, a solo mostly abstract game, the player takes the position of Reef King. The job that is placed on each King is to maintain a balance of fishes. Fish tokens are drawn randomly, two each turn. The player will roll three dice to indicate where the tokens may be placed. The player take two of the rolled dice, add them together, forming a number of an area to place the token. &#10;Each area of the reef, has 1-2 numbers that correspond to it, providing an overlap for each number, so each area has two groups of numbers for placement, kind of like a Venn diagram with &quot;lanes&quot; that hold three fish each, and an area consisting of two lanes that overlap to the left and right groups of numbers as well. &#10;If,  after the two fish tokens are placed, each area is checked for three or more fishes of the same color; those fish tokens are taken off the board and placed to the side, making more room for others &quot;arriving&quot;. If,  after 24 turns and the reef areas have not been overran by having three fish in one lane, you win. If,  after checking for full lanes, and removal of the threes that are duplicates, a lane is still full with three tokens,  you lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In this expansion, you will find new Company cards and Capitalists, new abilities, Manager tokens, variable Capital discs, a set of components for a fifth player, and new Agents for two-player and single-player games. All of this exists within beautiful industrial buildings and structures from the epoch of Art Deco, Constructivism, and Bauhaus.&#10;&#10;Interbellum is designed for players who are already familiar with Furnace. The expansion is best played if all of its elements are added to the base game, but if you don&rsquo;t feel up to it, you can get to know it piece by piece.&#10;&#10;",

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.&#10;&#10;At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.&#10;&#10;Die Legenden von Andor: Big Box includes the Legends of Andor base game, the New Heroes expansion that allows for games with up to six players, a promo &quot;Wolf Warrior&quot; hero, and additional legends and variants on top of those in the base game.&#10;&#10;",

Missions are resolved by rolling combinations of custom dice. A diverse team of Shadow Runners gives you access to more combinations of dice, and your upgrades add even more dice to your pool. Take on smaller missions to earn creds. Then, put those right back into more experienced runners, and better gear. Once you think you've got what it takes, send your runners out to attempt to collect one final score. If you fail, don't worry, your doc-wagon contracts will keep your runners in the game.

Shipmates come in all shapes and sizes. Some are skilled pilots, while others specialize in hand-to-hand combat or ship repair. Some are even bounty hunters. But life is not always so black and white. Sometimes under the right circumstances, the criminal can join the crew, bringing their own set of unique skills to a peculiar, yet accepting, new family.&#10;&#10;Mega Mini Space Cowboys is a fast-playing 1-4 player strategy game of set collection with exclusive dice and modular mapping. Each turn, roll six dice, each engraved with six symbols: Move, Nano Med Kit, Bounty, Passenger, Crates, or Cattle. Over three consecutive throws, choose what to keep or discard. You can also recruit crewmates from the passengers you meet, or occasionally even the criminals that you track for bounties.&#10;&#10;Hey spacer - do you have the moxie to make big Moolings?

    "Description": "After years of quasi-peace since 2016, the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist armies that Russia supported and built-up launched another attack with the aim of seizing more territory. It was hoped to occupy the city of Kharkov and Dnipro but even more modest gains would have political and military value, in addi-tion, further destabilize the Ukrainian government.&#10;Both sides had similar military strength with 35,000 front line troops manning the fortified front lines. The DPA and LNR, 914 AFVs, 720 artillery guns, 202 rocket artillery between the two pro-Russian forces. Each had around 200 tanks. Among these were at least 2100 Russian forces to assist. However, Putin also had placed elements from the 3rd Motorized Division along the northern border from its 20th Army and the 150th Division not far near the Crimea. The 150th was quite strong with two tank regiments and two mechanized infantry regiments. Either or both, if used, would be a decisive in seizing more Ukrainian territory.&#10;The Ukrainian forces were capable and equal in most aspects, especially their elite units that proved their worth in 2014 and 2015. The front lines were vintage WW1 with trench lines and fortified areas along the main avenues of approach. Many of the Ukrainian units were mainly reinforced battalion strength de-spite their regimental or brigade designation. In fact, many &quot;bri-gades&quot; only had one or two battalions.&#10;While they had many more AFVs, many needed refitting or repaired as with much of their equipment. The one new weapon was the American Javelin AT. Ukraine had 47 launchers and 360 missiles which could be used against armor and structures. They also had 12 Turkish Bayraktar UAV for reconnaissance.&#10;As in previous battles, both fought with tenacity and the tipping point was always whether the Russians would send in their units, which they did in 2014, 2015. The other potential was whether the Americans also send in help from Poland.&#10;With both sides facing each other since 2016 in a quasi-peace, both the DPA and LNR forces had built up and trained their forces with Russian aid. The Ukrainians also built up forces and created a fortified line along main avenues of advance. Finally, sometime in 2020, Putin decided to try to get a larger section of the Ukraine in 2021. The offensive would be limited.&#10;&#10;Designed by Perry Moore in 2020, this game seems prophetic on the battle of Kharkiv in Feb to May 2022. along with the use of Javelins and supply issues for the Russian army.&#10;&#10;",
