    "Description": "By the spring of 1862, the Union Army of the Tennessee, under Gen. Grant, had captured most of that state and was gathering at Pittsburg Landing to link with Gen. Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio and then move on to capture the vital Confederate railroad junction of Corinth, Mississippi. Confederate troops, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, were, however, gathering outside Corinth to strike a blow at Grant&rsquo;s army before Buell could arrive.&#10;&#10;&quot;Shiloh: Bloody April 1862 (Designer's Edition)&quot; is a two-player wargame simulating the bloody clash of arms that occurred around Shiloh Church on 6-7 April 1862. As the Confederate player, you must try to crush Grant&rsquo;s unsuspecting army on the first day or be crushed yourself by the overwhelming force of Grant and Buell&rsquo;s combined armies. As the Union player, you must hold onto Pittsburg Landing at all costs, until Buell&rsquo;s troops arrive to shift the balance in your favor.&#10;&#10;The Designer's Edition restores some changes from the S&amp;T edition to the original rules. For example, in the S&amp;T edition, the Hornets' Nest encompasses a half dozen hexes. In the Designer's Edition it is only one hex, as it should be. There are several other similar changes going back to the designer's original intent. Additional changes include the map, counters, and CRT.&#10;&#10;",

The details and the nineteenth-century style allow players to immerse themselves in a romantic atmosphere, bringing them back to the era of the origins of mountaineering.&#10;The rules of the game, on the other hand, have been revisited and are introduced by a story, with the aim of making the game not only fun but also educational.&#10;&#10;It is a kind of goose game with 80 stages. &#10;At each stage the player can be favored or penalized by the rules of the game: she/he can stop, proceed or even retreat.&#10;&#10;",

The dice are not weighted, they roll perfectly fairly.&#10;&#10;The secret lies in their unusual numbers.&#10;&#10;Non-transitive dice set discovered by Dr. James Grime of Cambridge University. This set has ten dice, two each of five different colors. When rolled singly, green tends to beat red, red tends to beat yellow, yellow tends to beat blue, and blue tends to beat purple. So you might think green is the best die and purple is the worst. But here is the twist: purple beats green, so there is no best! Even stranger, with two of each color (ten dice total), the order of which color beats which reverses direction. The set of ten includes color instructions and a cloth bag.&#10;&#10;",

Kennedy&#10;&#10;The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 seems almost like &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo; now, as we approach it being  60 years after the event. Yet, it marks one of the two or three times the world literally stood on the brink of total annihilation. But the dramatic side of our nature always focuses on the ultimately bad outcome&mdash;nuclear devastation on a global scale. When things got hot in Cuba, professional military planners on both sides were preparing for a very different kind of war&mdash;an &ldquo;old fashioned&rdquo; kind (mostly) with conventional air, land, and naval units struggling for local supremacy.  What if that had happened?&#10;&#10;We Are All Mortal gives players a chance to work on both aspects of the confrontation. Full-sized playing cards are used to simulate the diplomatic, intelligence, and pre-invasion deployments of combat forces, and determination of random events once war breaks out (if it does.)&#10;&#10;There is a &ldquo;Pre-war&rdquo; phase of card play, unit placement, preparation, recon, and diplomacy. It is possible that the game will end without serious shots being exchanged, and players must jockey for position to &ldquo;win&rdquo; the game right there.  But, if the &ldquo;historical result&rdquo; does not take place, then things shift to a shooting war&mdash;but a limited, conventional war. Unit activation by chit-draw keeps things fluid, and both players work for a tactical victory, keeping one eye on the U.N.&mdash;who might stop the fighting before your side wants that to happen&mdash;and another eye watching the &ldquo;Doomsday Clock,&rdquo; because if a full nuclear war breaks out, both sides lose.  Players walk a tightrope as they compete for both Military Victory Points and Diplomatic Victory Points, even after the shooting starts. There are special rules for B-52 strikes, tactical nukes, and Fidel Castro, with optional rules for Special Forces units.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS&#10;233 playing pieces&#10;Mounted map &#10;64 cards &#10;12 pages of rules plus charts&#10;&#10;-description from artist&#10;&#10;",

So year by year the race is being continued against the law and Factions. Even enormous barricades put across main routes didn't stop that madness. Racers quickly found new methods and tricks. Imagine that each supervising Faction is equipped with giant machines: Bulldozers and Transporters. Their only purpose is to wipe this terrain off from all racers. But why not to use their roofs to jump over the barricades and move on? These days all suffer from shortage of oil. So it quickly turned out that Factions willingly accept oil bribes and can help your small car jump over the barricade. However it worked short. Soon all racers have been continuously bribing the Factions and using them even against you. The bribe is the bribe. The Faction doesn't care for whom it works. So, prepare for high adrenaline. You will compete with 3 other racers and 4 Factions that will be your friends as long as you fuel them up. And then will go to your competitor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But watch out there are a pair of pesky Brussel Sprouts hiding in the deck - have 1 of them at the end of the game and you will instantly lose, but get a pair and you will instantly win at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;As you land on spaces you'll be able to do different actions which include; sneaking a peak at another player's present cards, swapping your present cards with another player, gaining a present from the central present card deck or if you land and win on &quot;pull a cracker&quot; you can select a new card from the central deck and choose whether you keep it or pass it on to another player, which can be helpful when you've picked a bad present card or are looking to get rid of a pesky Brussel Sprout card. When everyone's card slots are filled the game ends and each player reveals their present haul.&#10;&#10;The game is definitely one to get you into the festive spirit as you may land on a challenge to sing a Christmas song or wear the Christmas crown, but don't worry you can introduce some house rules if bursting into song isn't your thing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You're thinking, &quot;Should I increase Turbo-Boast?...Do I want to draft?...maybe I'll just play it safe for now and not risk spin!&quot;&#10;  All of these options and more face a skilled race car driver many times every lap. RAMPRES Racing Simulation one of all these features and more including pit stops, setting up your own car's ability to accelerate, handle, and brake, and worst of all, crashes! Every factor of real racing can be found in this fantastic, life-like racing simulation by RAMPRES.&#10; In this racing simulation, if your decisions and timing are the best of that race, you'll be sitting in the Winner's Circle!&#10;&#10;A full-featured Indy-style racing simulation board game that features:&#10;  &#10; 6 Accurately molded indy-type racing cars&#10; 1 High-speed racecourse on a multicolor game board (18&quot;x24&quot;)&#10; 24 Pit Stop Cards&#10; 24 Chance Cards&#10; 2 Dice&#10; 6 Color-coded Pit Markers&#10; 1 Official RAMPRES Racing Simulation scoring pad&#10; 1 Official Rampres Racing Qualification Chart&#10;   Comprehensive Rule and Racing Guide&#10;&#10; Preparation:  Spend the allotted Factor Points on resources such as Acceleration, Handling, and Breaking. &#10; Either roll or race for qualification.   Decide the number of laps you gonna race. And fill in the information on the Scoring Pad.&#10;&#10; Head out on the Banked oval and when the checkered flag drops, it's pedal to the metal! &#10;   The lead player goes first each round. Carefully plot out your move, with each 10mph of speed equating to one space on the board. Make sure to allow room to maneuver around traffic otherwise you crash... maybe use some advanced breaking, or turbo to zip in and out of traffic.  There are 2 places on the track that offer you the option to draw  &quot;Chance&quot; cards which are mostly biased towards good results but contain a few bad...&#10;  The system contains a rather detailed (but easy to master) drafting system that increases the more cars that are in a line drafting around the Oval. &#10;  The first one across the finish the set # of laps on the current round is the winner.  &#10; Pit stops also require careful planning and you draw a card to see what happened while you pitted.&#10;&#10;Championship Point Series Battles, Advanced qualifications (with real calculated speed results), Turbo Boost, Hot shoes, and the ability to change the car setup in the pit round out a full-featured simulation racing game that can be played in an evening.&#10;&#10;You are ready to race!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the 19th century, the elevation of the Chicago area was just a few feet higher than the shoreline of Lake Michigan. For many years, there was little or no naturally occurring drainage from the city surface, and this lack of drainage caused unpleasant living conditions. Standing water harbored pathogens that caused numerous epidemics including typhoid fever and dysentery, culminating in the 1854 outbreak of cholera that killed six percent of the city's population. The crisis forced the city to take the drainage problem seriously. In 1856, engineer Ellis S. Chesbrough drafted a plan for the installation of a citywide sewerage system and submitted it to the city council, which adopted the plan.&#10;&#10;However, due to the minimal elevation above the lake, the sewer could not be built underground and had to be built at street level. The city council then decided to implement a radical idea: Prevented from digging down, they instead decreed the buildings of the city would be raised to allow the new sewer system to be hidden under the new street level. Representing one of the four companies that were created to tackle the problem of raising the buildings of Chicago, it's up to you to gather resources, take on the most attractive projects, and help solve the sanitation crisis of the city.&#10;&#10;On your turn in Raising Chicago, you place a tile on a resource slot associated with one of five building projects, then claim the resource you covered. After all players have placed tiles, each project is evaluated. The winning player pays resources to complete the project, claims the project reward, then places all of their tiles associated with that project as levels underneath the building onto a space on the board. Players earn points for placing buildings cleverly, doing the most work in a ward, and meeting the demands of council people.&#10;&#10;Only the most successful player will win, so play strategically to prove you can raise buildings the best in Raising Chicago!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aliens have been invading Earth for a long, long time.In the grand scheme of things, it&rsquo;s no surprise really; the Thorathians, a proud race of militaristic extraterrestrials, have been conquering planets all over the galaxy for thousands of years. Earth has been a bit of a pesky one for them, however. Turns out humans are pretty resilient, and the presence of super-powered individuals has made the planet almost more trouble than it's worth for the invaders. Almost...&#10;But the Thorathian armies aren&rsquo;t the only presence in the cosmos that has its eyes set on Earth. Ineffable forces stir in the far corners of the galaxy, finding themselves drawn towards our planet&rsquo;s bright and chaotic inhabitants. There have been a few shining moments in our timeline (such as the creation and inevitable destruction of the sentient A.I., Omnitron) that have earned the attention of beings far beyond our comprehension.&#10;&#10;The Cosmic Threats Expansion is a massive addition to the total amount of content for Freedom Five, adding 2 new playable Heroes to master, 3 new terrifying Mastermind to face, and a host of Villains, Scenario Comic Books, Mystery Envelopes, extra cards, and more&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rin Jankae sat in his command chair, his thoughts hidden behind his impenetrable black eyes and his steepled, long white fingers. He was trying to decide for himself if today was the day that the Romulans entered the war.&#10;&#10;Released in June 2005, this Captain&rsquo;s Log issue supports Star Fleet Battles and Federation &amp; Empire. Shield of the Federation by Randy O. Green is a story of the Day of the Eagle, the day the Romulans entered the General War. Can the cruiser Groton and destroyer Genghis hold off the Romulans and be the shield of the Federation? &ldquo;Lawfare&rdquo; provides some humor in the issue. &ldquo;Aces and Eights&rdquo; takes place nearly a month after the Day of the Eagle and focuses on the destroyer Halsey.&#10;&#10;In addition to the story, History includes deck plans for the Romulan SkyHawk, class histories for the Federation battle frigate and Klingon F6, and a history of the Federation bomber program.&#10;&#10;As is usual, Communications informs readers about the company&rsquo;s activities. The company hired two new people, thus helping spread out the workload. Captain&rsquo;s Log #30 and SFB Module F1 have after-action reports. The company laid out its plans for new print releases and metal miniatures for the coming year. There are questions and answers about Starlist, which makes it easy for players to contact other players. The Input Guide has guidelines for how not to submit scenarios, ships, and fiction. Admiral Growler answers SFB questions. There is a discussion about some proposals and a call for Rangers. More &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions get answered. There is an interview with Ken Burnside. There are two pages of filk songs. Finally, there are the Star Fleet Awards.&#10;&#10;This issue includes seven scenarios for Star Fleet Battles. SL234, The Shield of the Federation, and SL235, Aces and Eights, are based on the two stories in the issue. Set during the Early Years, SL236, Web of Curiosity, involves an encounter between the Tholians and Klingons. SL237, Follies of Second-Hand Goods, pits Orions against Jindarians. An Omega scenario, SL238, An Intruding Situation, has the first covert attempt of the Andromedans to take over the Drex. SL239, Further Intrusions, has an Andromedan-controlled Drex dreadnought attacking a Drex battlecruiser and three gunboats. SL240, Riposte at Anporlax, is a classic matchup of the Federation and Klingons.&#10;&#10;Database articles include battlegroups designed with local forces. There is an article on the moray eel. Admiral&rsquo;s Game is updated to allow for ships described since 1999. There is an excerpt of a partial X-refit rule from SFB Module X1R. Rule. There are new rules for creating F&amp;E battle groups in SFB and for advanced ground combat in SFB. There is a guide for converting captured Andromedan ships to fit in the fleets of the Galactic Powers, and vice versa. The final article is an example of how energy balancing works when the ship is damaged.&#10;&#10;The Tactics section has primers for the Sharkhunters and Alunda. There are over two pages of term papers, along with another half-page with encore term papers.&#10;&#10;The Venues section covers Star Fleet Command, SFB On-Line, playing by email, Galactic Conquest (with an article by Howard Bampton introducing a new Andromedan War campaign, Star Fleet Warlord, GURPS Prime Directive, and Star Fleet Battle Force.&#10;&#10;Federation &amp; Empire has a rule from Strategic Operations on Survey Ships. There are four pages of tactical notes. Finally, there are rules and rulings.&#10;&#10;New ships and gunboats are added for Star Fleet Battles. The Federation gets its battle frigate carrier, battle frigate scout, battle frigate escort, and battle drone frigate; Klingons gain the F6B battle frigate, F6J penal battle frigate, F6S battle frigate scout, and F6E battle frigate escort; the Romulans get the JayHawk battle frigate; the Kzintis get their battle frigate. The Klingons and Federation each gain their fast destroyers. The new gunboats are recovery PFRs and survey PFQs. Other ships are &ldquo;anarchist&rdquo; ships including a Romulan Intruder, Kzinti Conquistador, and two Andromedan-captured ships: a Gorn battlecruiser and a Lyran heavy cruiser.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the start, there is a maximum of two men on one boat.&#10;&#10;After determining the starting player using a dice roll, the starting player then throws a dice to decide the number of moves, clockwise or anticlockwise, any one of his men on the boat may move.

If the boat pulled to shore contains the player's own man, then he puts that man on the island and pulls the boat out again.

To receive the value of a scoring roll the scoring dice must be rolled on one roll.&#10;&#10;Three Pairs: 1250 points&#10;Four of a Kind: 1500 points&#10;Five of a Kind: 2500 points&#10;Six of a Kind: 3500 points&#10;A single 5: 50 points&#10;A single 1: 100 points&#10;Three 2's: 200 points&#10;Three 3's: 300 points&#10;Three 4's: 400 points&#10;Three 5's: 500 points&#10;Three 6's: 600 points&#10;Three 1's: 1000 points&#10;Four 1's: 2000 points&#10;Five 1's: 3000 points&#10;Six 1's 4000 points&#10;One each of each Kind: 5000 points&#10;A red 1, a yellow 2, a green 3, a blue 4, an orange 5, and a purple 6: 10,000 points&#10;&#10;Getting in the Game&#10;A player must score at least 500 points in one turn, which may consist of several rolls, to get in the game. If a player does not score at least 500 points in a turn, then the dice are passed to the next player to take a turn, and wait until their next turn to try again and get in the game. The 500 or more points necessary to begin are counted towards the 10,000 points goal.&#10;&#10;Playing&#10;&#10;The First Roll of a Turn&#10;Player rolls all six dice to begin a turn.  If one or more scoring dice are rolled, then at least  one set of scoring dice must be set aside before rolling the remaining dice.&#10;&#10;Keep It or Roll Again?&#10;A player may stop after any roll which scores points, keep the points and pass the dice to the next player.  Or, a player may roll the remaining dice in an attempt to increase a score, but risks losing the total of the entire turn if no scoring dice are rolled.&#10;If all dice in a turn score points, then a player may continue the turn by rolling all six dice again, but if no scoring dice are rolled, then the player loses all points for that turn.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;If a player reaches or exceeds 10,000 points, then all other players get one more turn in an attempt to beat the leading scorer's points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deep within the mountain a heart of iron beats. Slowly pumping molten ore through its iron veins. Shadows pray with frozen hands before the glowing stream. The iron god awoken. The iron law unbound.&#10;&#10;Iron Mountain is a bleak and unforgiving game about fragile hopes better left behind. Players take on the roles of outcasts condemned to slave away their existence in an underground mine. Time and toil have reduced them to mere shadows flickering through winding tunnels and empty caves. But now the iron law that binds them has begun to loosen its grip. As they set out to reclaim their past lives and escape the mountain, hope quickly turns to despair. For what does it mean to be free in a world of shackles? And what becomes of a shadow once it steps outside and into the light?&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of turns until all shadows have either escaped the iron mountain or become lost. Players control multiple shadows, exploring the mountain by placing cave tiles, discovering items, and crafting iron artefacts. Every action causes tremors, and shadows are constantly trying to avoid triggering collapses and other disastrous events along the tremor track. The shadows must hurry to craft their artefacts and find the shaft of light before the mountain comes crashing down upon them. As they enter the shaft of light, players burn the shadow standees in a candle, hoping against hope that something better awaits them on the other side.&#10;&#10;Iron Mountain is the second installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope. The trilogy began with Tower of Silence and will end with Pesta.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have you ever wanted to skip to the part of the evening when everyone starts revealing the hilariously weird things they&rsquo;ve thought and done?&#10;&#10;The game consists of 300 question cards that were carefully devised to help you uncover the hilarious inner thoughts, secrets and stories that your friends never even knew they were keeping from you.&#10;&#10;The game dice guides you to ask other players personal questions that you think that they might say yes to - if they say yes you win points. So the game has an infinite-combinations-dynamic of revealing both what a person has thought, felt or done, but also what the asker thinks that they might have thought, felt or done.&#10;&#10;Philosophically the creators of Cards of Candour believe that &quot;we are all weird, now it&rsquo;s time to share.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

In winter, they plan to seize territories and erect buildings, in the spring they receive policy tokens and participate in trading in neutral lands, in the summer they receive income and buy troops, and in the fall they harvest crops and use tokens of neutral military leaders. In addition, one of five military maneuvers is performed in each phase.&#10;&#10;The main goal is to complete certain missions and get victory points for them. &#10;At the end of six moves, the participants count the points and determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players discover what happens once the soldiers under their command move ... Off the Line.&#10;&#10;Off the Line is a wargame of low-to-moderate complexity that depicts man-to-man combat during World War II. Each combat unit represents a single soldier. Games are won through the completion of mission objectives such as the control of locations on the map board, exiting soldiers from the map through specific points, or the simple elimination of enemy soldiers. Although players are open to maneuver their forces as they wish, they&rsquo;ll soon find that traditional tactics for units at the game&rsquo;s scale are the best bet to achieve goals and to keep their forces intact.&#10;&#10;Game play is managed through the use of a shared deck of action cards, each of which is used to determine how many soldiers might be activated during a turn, the resolution of random outcomes such as combat and morale checks, and random events. Being able to manage limited resources is a key to victory.&#10;&#10;Each soldier is individually named and rated for morale (which determines a soldier&rsquo;s effectiveness under fire), melee, weapon, and in some instances, command. Terrain is represented through the use of twelve geomorphic map panels that can create hundreds of different battlefield configurations.&#10;&#10;This initial game includes forces for the United States and Germany facing off through twelve individual scenarios, plus instructions on how to create your own. Plans are in place to add additional nationalities, more maps, and lots more scenarios!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Playable options for the &ldquo;Big Bad&rdquo; they&rsquo;re saving us from include a pandemic, dictators, monsters, aliens and more. But while the portal to the past was open, the villains of American history &ndash; from Benedict Arnold to Bull Connor &ndash; have come back to stop the presidents and ensure America&rsquo;s downfall. The battle for our country is on!&#10;&#10;Publisher&#226;&#128;&#153;s product page&#10;&#10;The core of the game is 24 presidents, divided up evenly among the players. At the beginning of the game, you select a Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America. Every turn, you draw five cards out of your deck and play them. Each president has a presidential power based on that president&rsquo;s actual strengths (such as popularity, party building or policy leadership). Presidents can also join forces to attack villains together, or recruit new cards into your deck. You can add to your deck cards that represent support from other presidents (hello, Millard Fillmore!), constitutional provisions that give powers to the presidency, and other forces from American history. These support cards interact with keywords on your presidents and other game factors, giving you tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The players use their attacks to capture 12 villains from American history. Then it&rsquo;s time for the Final Showdown with the Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America, represented by a set of threat cards. The rules for the Final Showdown are different for each Big Bad &ndash; fighting off a pandemic and fighting off monsters require different tactics! If the Big Bad defeats your presidents, it wins; if you defeat it first, the player with the most captured villains and Big Bad threat cards wins. So there&rsquo;s pressure to be capturing villains for the whole game, but victory still hangs on that Final Showdown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
