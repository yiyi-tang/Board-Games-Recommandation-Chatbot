When you land on a fire space, an inertia fire engine is pushed, and it speeds around the board: if it stops next to you, the fireman gets to put on two items.  First dressed wins.  No thought required.  The pieces are pretty decent to look at.&#10;&#10;",

A plastic mouse attached to a small doughnut shaped piece of plastic is slid onto the top of the metal rod and positioned to commence each round.&#10;&#10;The spinner is used to designate 'wild' cards and to keep track of scores and round number. Players are dealt 5 cards; these are made of thick cardstock and are numbered 1-12, with 4 of each number. The mouse is nudged and set on its way. Players attempt to get as many of the same cards as they can by drawing &amp; passing before the mouse reaches the spinner base. Only 5 cards may be held at any time.&#10;&#10;When the mouse reaches the spinner below, cards are compared.  The segment which is occupied by the nose of the mouse becomes 'wild', so players can use cards of this number to enhance their hand.  The winner of the hand is the player with the highest number of identical cards, or the holder of the best cards if 2 or more players have an identical number of similar cards.&#10;&#10;After 12 rounds of play, the WINNER is the player who has won the most hands.&#10;&#10;",

The game is a small work of art and came in deluxe and budget versions (as far as I can tell). While the budget version has player pieces represented by small wooden tokens and a material play mat, the deluxe version has small, lead figures of cricketers in various poses, and a mounted board.&#10;&#10;All in all a lovely little game in the small field of cricket board games.&#10;&#10;Note: This game was published circa 1931 for the first time and was designed by Charles Goodall, the great grandson of the founder of playing card company, Goodall &amp; Sons. The game was published by De La Rue following its purchase in 1922 of Goodall &amp; Sons.&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses one card and places it face down in front of him. The first player calls out either &quot;Tall bird!&quot; or &quot;Short bird!&quot; That sets the criterion for the round. Each player then places the card he chose on the board, and the players determine who has the tallest or shortest bird, depending on which was called. The winning player gets an &quot;egg,&quot; one of the cardboard counters used to keep score. Each player then draws a new card.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in the same way to the next player to the left, and cards are played on top of each player's existing cards on the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card is drawn. The player with the most eggs wins.&#10;&#10;This game is marked as &quot;Piatnik Item No. 328,&quot; and probably was originally published in German in Austria.

    "Description": "Operation Weser&uuml;bung: The Invasion of Norway covers the German invasion of Norway in 1940 during World War II. The game covers all aspects of the invasion, including land, naval, and air operations as well as the British and French involvement.&#10;&#10;Operation Weser&uuml;bung is a two-player or three-player game, with one player taking the Germans and the other player or players taking Norway and Great Britain/France. The game is regimental scale with each hex representing approximately 20-25 kilometers with turns representing four days. The combat system is roll-to-hit and the entire game system is based on the system from World War II in the West. This game is also a preview of what the system for World War II in the West: Ultimate Edition will look like when it is published in late 2007. Turn phases include the Air Phase, the Naval Phase, the Combat Phase, the Movement Phase, and the End Phase. The game includes everything from air interception to naval-air combat, from parachute drops to amphibious assaults. While the game strives to be an accurate simulation, the level of enjoyment and ease of play is also a priority.&#10;&#10;The game is a medium to low complexity and should be easy to learn relatively quickly. The game can take approximately 5-8 hours to complete.&#10;&#10;Operation Weser&uuml;bung contains approximately 225 mounted counters in easy-to-cut strips. All historical land and naval units are represented in the game and individually identified. Divisional leaders are also included as well as an Admiral. All ships larger than a destroyer are individually identified and included, and air units are divided into counters representing a few squadrons of each type of aircraft. The Germans can call on the Messerschmitt Bf109 E, Messerschmitt Bf110 C, Junkers 87, Heinkel 111, and Junkers 52 during the game, while the Allies have a few Gloster Gladiators, Fairey Swordfish, Vickers Wellingtons, Capronis, and Hawker Hurricanes to try to stop the invasion.

    "Description": "A proprietary card game based on the standard social card game known in books as &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; but more popularly as &quot;Bulls**t.&quot; It was created by a college business professor in Alva, Okla., in the early 1990s and marketed by his startup company.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 72 cards in 14 denominations. Each denomination, numbered 1 to 14, depicts a leisure activity, such as &quot;Golfing&quot; or &quot;Shopping.&quot; As in &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; the object is to shed all your cards. Players announce in turn that they are discarding a certain number of cards in a certain denomination, always having the option to bluff. The other players can challenge. Anyone losing a challenge must take all the discards.&#10;&#10;Unlike &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; the game requires players in turn to play cards in the same denomination rather than increasing denominations. (In other words, if Player 1 plays &quot;Hunting&quot; cards and goes unchallenged, the Player 2 must either play &quot;Hunting&quot; cards or pass.) The denomination changes after a challenge -- or if all players pass, at which point the discard pile is retired and started anew. The game also includes a denomination of wild cards (1, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;), and one denomination (13, &quot;Fooling Around&quot;) that can only be played as part of a bluff.&#10;&#10;Once a player sheds all his cards, he scores the point total of all cards remaining in his opponents' hands. The game ends at 100 points. The game also offers rules for couples to play in partnerships.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll a special six-sided die that has three sides showing a black cup, and the other three sides showing a dot that is either red, green or yellow. If it shows a colored dot, the player has to remove a cup of the corresponding color. If it shows a black cup, the player can remove a cup of any color. The player who causes the white cup to fall loses, and has to rebuild the pyramid for the next game.&#10;&#10;The Glass Tower Game (Daiso) is a similar game with the same sort of components but the opposite objective - players roll the die and then stack cups according to the die roll. On a roll of 1 to 4, the player has to stack a cup of the corresponding colour - no action if there are no more cups of that colour. On a roll of 5, the player can stack a cup of any colour, and on a six, the player does not need to stack any cup). The player who puts the last cup on top of the stack wins. Four different structures can be made with the cups, to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

For over 50 years, historians have debated what could have happened if a number of events had ended differently. Ted Nomura and Ben Dunn of Antarctic Press have created a fictional world where several key events delayed the allies' victory. Fitting within the broader scope of the Families of Altered Wars fictional time line, Luftwaffe 1946 and Kamikaze 1946 describe WW II in the air from the view of pilots on all sides in the conflict.&#10;&#10;What follows is just a brief overview of the circumstances that led to World War II continuing another year, giving the Luftwaffe and their counterparts in Japan a second chance. A chance to overcome their numerical weaknesses and training deficiencies through technology and the courage of their pilots.

Some squares instruct you to draw a bonus card, which will also give or take away points, grant another turn or deny your next turn, you may even draw the &quot;Engaged&quot; card.&#10;&#10;At two different points on the board, the girls' path and the boys' path diverge. Girls, may then land on a square that says, for instance, &quot;Break heel dancing.

    "Description": "Vilajet is a Hungarian game about the Turkish-Hungarian Wars set in the medieval times. Unfortunately it is only Hungarian language, but easily translated into English.&#10; The game map represents about 100x100 km territory near Lake Balaton, and shows little villages, towns and cities. In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.&#10; The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.&#10; Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the &quot;battle&quot; map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)&#10;&#10;The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.&#10;&#10;Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.&#10;&#10;This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.&#10;&#10;",

Most mechanics use single die rolls with situational modifiers to speed play.&#10;&#10;Rules are 20 pages, and cover the usual fire, movement, and morale rules.  Army lists and scenarios will be posted on the Web site:&#10;&#10;http://www.freewebs.com/tommiatkins/&#10;&#10;More info from the Web site:&#10;&#10;World War 2 is a incredibly well supported area as regards wargame rules...... for skirmish or company level rules.&#10;&#10;What's out there for Brigade and above? Spearhead? (Rolls around on floor in stitches, gasp! gasp!) Yeah there is a set of rules that reflects reality! Oooh yes please!&#10;&#10;What's actually needed, is a set of rules that reflects the kind of decisions that a commander at this level takes.&#10;&#10;Is their command attacking or defending, are they dispersed or concentrated? What is the units strengths and weaknesses? The penetration ability of a Sherman easy eight vs a PzKpfw IV's rear plate is NOT on his mind.&#10;&#10;That his light tank battalion are probing towards the objective supported by a Elite mechanized infantry battalion will be.&#10;&#10;SCHWERPUNKT&#10;&#10;Schwerepunkte is different to any WW2 miniatures rules in this respect. It takes you to the Divisional HQ and asks you to make the kind of decisions that will spell victory or defeat. Dice are involved, good equipment will help, but it's YOUR actions that will carry or lose the day.&#10;&#10;The usual tommiatkins &quot;one roll of a D6&quot; settles combat, players will be in command of Infantry, Engineers, Artillery, Armour, Signallers,(get those unused radio cars out)and Military police etc. Anti-Aircraft fulfills its true role instead of being &quot;another Anti-tank&quot; unit.&#10;&#10;Schwerpunkt will allow 6 players to fight Arnhem with every unit involved in a full day with time to get totally hammered on cheap red wine afterwards.  Two players can do Arras 1940 to a conclusion in 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;So, If your fed up with rolling a hundred dice in FOW, and knowing that if you roll higher than your opponent then you've won, keep your eyes open for Schwerpunkt.&#10;&#10;So what do we have?&#10;&#10;Heres whats in already:&#10;1) Minefields&#10;2) Signals&#10;3) Military Police &amp; Kommisar's&#10;4) Night Fighting&#10;5) Squadron level air support, Air recon and AAA&#10;6) Harrassing artillery fire &amp; on-call fire missions&#10;7) Bridging and demolition&#10;8) Detached company support units&#10;9) Ambushes approach and surprise fire&#10;10) Combined arms supporting&#10;11) Engineers&#10;12) Formation's (I.E: Concentrated/Dispersed/All Round defense/ Deploying)&#10;13) Airborne assault and Marines&#10;14) Real Reconnaissance&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game conceived by Kreeda, and is the third part of the Ramayana series. In the Indian epic - the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English.

The closer you are to supplies, the more you can do- unfortunately you can&rsquo;t win by sitting in a supply depot.&#10;A turn is played in operations. Players alternate operating with a force and Leader of their choosing, trying to outmaneuver their opponents and lever them out of commanding positions, opening up strategic objectives. Beware; although you may be only a mile or so from your objective, stretched supply lines, bands of guerrilla fighters and incompetent Generals can force a sudden retreat, undoing careful planning.&#10;&#10;The board is divided into supply areas (color coded) that can change due to territorial acquisitions. While the British begin with excellent supplies near Lake Ontario, the loss of Fort George can mean restricted movement in your own heartland. If the Americans lose Fort Schlosser, the British will have a free hand marching to Black Rock or Buffalo, causing the Americans to retire in shame from the Canadian side.&#10;&#10;Battles, Skirmishes, and guerrilla activity not only leads to the loss of men, but of confidence, and an army that loses hope will degenerate into an armed mob, incapable of organized action. Both sides were determined during this campaign, so battles tended to be hard fought, and cause high casualties, even among the Generals.&#10;&#10;The Scale&#10;&#10;The Niagara region in not a huge one. An army could march from the top to the bottom in two days (in peacetime).We use two day turns, which allows for the tiniest of actions and moves to be of significance. As far as troop scale is concerned all units used in play are called Detachments, which represent between 100-200 men. Thus the British 100th&#10;regiment (roughly 600 men) is composed of four detachments.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Second Ediiton Notes&#10;&#10;With the end of the 2nd. world war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.&#10;&#10;The Americans along with the British began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and began a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first course occurs when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops.&#10;&#10;The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with 3 small tactical bombs known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.&#10;&#10;In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb explodes over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.&#10;In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korps. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in deep Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&#10;&#10;Luftwaffe 46 is a jet fighter game set in the world of Hotwar, where the war doesn&rsquo;t end in 1945 but continues as Germany launches its other jet plane projects and fights the allies in dogfights.
