    "Description": "Krash Karts is a table top game in which players race to a finish line that's ever changing. This is because you design the very track you're racing on, while you're racing on it. How it comes together is up to those playing, and manipulating the track to your advantage or against your opponent's advantage plays a large factor in determining the victor. You can even design your own short-cut.&#10;&#10;Coupled with this unique game mechanic, players during the race also gain items, such as the Booster, which lets you jet ahead of the competition; The Dodge Ball, which whacks your friends and slows them down; The Squirrel, which creates a roadblock forcing players to change course; Or the Bomb which decimates the track and all on it. Some items are left right on the track to benefit or to hinder your friends, and other items can even be used to defend yourself, making each game unique and strategic.&#10;&#10;Changes from Mad Rush Rally (Source: Sean McDonald on Krashin&#039; Karts)&#10;&#10;Krash Karts resolves some strategic issues players had with the game where lagging behind intentionally during the race was one of the better strategies. This has been fixed by giving the last player better chances to get better items, but have less control over how the track lays out. Further, the Track has been reduced to 3 lanes, rather then the 4 of Mad Rush Rally, but players are allowed to occupy the same space now. The track has also now been laid out in a staggered pattern ala Formula D, rather than a grid, and also now accompanies a max of 6 players, rather then 4. Further, the rally car pieces have been changed to go-karts, and items can now be used not only offensively, but defensively.&#10;&#10;",

Powered by Lucca comics &amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published. For more information:&#10;giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com&#10;www.luccacomicsandgames.com&#10;&#10;In The Gang, players try to play cards to capture gang members &ndash; with both gangs at risk of being captured. To set up each of the three cities in the game, draw five gangster cards at random, then place them in a row in numerical order (with a range of 1-80). Even and odd cards belong to different gangs and are color-coded. Each player has a hand of four gangster cards and a random special action card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player chooses one gangster and one city card/one special card, then they reveal them simultaneously. Players place cards in ascending order from lowest to highest. If a gangster was played with a city card, it's placed in that city in the proper numerical spot; if it was played with a special card, it can be placed in any city, with the special card being placed in the same city before or after the gangster. If the card you placed is one of two gangsters surrounding at least two gangsters of the other color, then you capture the surrounded gangsters and remove them from play. Special cards let you play on the end of a row, switch a gangster from even to odd (or vice versa), or move a gangster from one row to another.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, players discard their special card (if it hasn't been played), then receive a new hand of four gangsters and a special card. Any rows with fewer than five cards are filled to five cards. The game continues until not enough cards remain to fill players' hands and the rows; when this happens, the game ends immediately and players count the revolvers on the gangsters they've captured. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Here are the differences from Khet:&#10;&#10;     In Khet, the laser is always moving orthogonally.  In Laser Battle, the laser must be bounced at the proper angle off pieces which can be rotated to 16 different angles (22&frac12;&deg; increments: 0&deg;, 22&frac12;&deg;, 45&deg;, and so forth), which reflects the laser orthogonally and/or diagonally, at the players' discretion (or error!).&#10;     In Khet, the laser is fired from the walls of the game board.  In Laser Battle, the laser is being fired by a unit, which you may rotate for very surprising victory.&#10;     In Khet, each player must fire the laser after her move.  In Laser Battle, firing the laser is optional, allowing both sloppier play and stealthier play.&#10;     Khet has a fixed game board (and a moveable / roteable mirrored second-floor with the Khet 3D: Tower of Kadesh expansion).  The board in Laser Battle is modular (single-floor), allowing for numerous configurations.&#10;     A Laser Battle set comes with extra headdresses for the pieces so you can buy a second identical set, and play with up to four players.  Also, it is available in two color schemes, which could allow for an eight-player laser frenzy!&#10;     There are only three types of pieces in Laser Battle.  Khet has four types in the basic game, and a fifth (Khet: Eye of Horus Beam Splitter) in an expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Tower has 6 light sensors &ndash; and when hit by the laser it flashes red lights and makes an explosion sound, which signals the end of a game.&#10;&#10;This game was the subject of a lawsuit in which the designer of Khet: The Laser Game brought suit against MGA Entertainment and the court found Laser Battle as infringing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Round the World is a real-time card game played simultaneously. The players are travel agents creating &quot;trips&quot; around the world for their customers. Each &quot;flight card&quot; shows two continents (each continent has its own color): a &quot;departure&quot; and a &quot;destination&quot; connected by an airplane/arrow. You try to get rid of your own 30-card deck within a period of exactly five minutes by creating &quot;trips&quot; card by card with matching colors from card to card until the trip is complete and can be &quot;booked&quot; (saved for scoring).&#10;&#10;All players play at the same time, everybody to their own speed and rhythm. Holding your deck in one hand, you draw the top card as your sole &quot;hand card&quot; and add it to the ones you already placed in front of you to create &quot;trips&quot; &mdash; or you put it under the deck again. When you add a card, you may pick up the card from the other end of the trip and continue using this as your &quot;hand card&quot;. You may also add cards to your opponents' trips and take cards (you desperately need) from them. All cards not &quot;booked&quot; (i.e., still in the deck or in incomplete trips) score against you, so if you empty your deck too soon, your opponents are able to lengthen your trips without completing them...&#10;&#10;A game consists of two rounds of five minutes, plus two simple scoring phases. The focus of the game is on your perfect timing within the five minutes, keep an eye on cards with landmarks (better for scoring!), and on your opponents &quot;offers&quot;. There are variants included shifting the focus and making the game more challenging.&#10;&#10;",

Fly High is a quick-playing memory game of flying high and low and pushing the luck to score the most points.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, you lay out a 3x3 grid of cards face down which are valued 10-60 (jumping up by tens). On your turn, you roll dice to determine a minimum number of cards you must turn face up. Now try to fly high by finding the right cards to go up in ascending order. If you flip a card that has the same value or lower, then all cards are turned face down again and it is the next player's turn. Try to push your luck and flip more cards than the dice tells you, and maybe you can even earn a set of three cards of the same color for bonus points.&#10;&#10;When you score, you remove cards, then fill the gaps in the grid. When the deck runs out, the game ends, and whoever has earned the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players will race to the top of the galactic corporate ladder.&#10;&#10;Each player uses their spaceship token to hyper jump around the section of space to make their mark in the most powerful corporation in the galaxy.  The section of space is comprised of 80 cards setup in an 8 x 10 grid. When a player lands on an unexplored card, they flip it over to reveal what is there. Before the game begins, each player is given 5 Career Goal cards they must complete.&#10;&#10;The progression of game play is divided into Fiscal Periods and each fiscal period is done in steps:&#10;Step 1. Solar Jellies Move and Spawn&#10;Step 2. Players receive their budgets&#10;Step 3. Players spend 1 photon to File Paperwork to the corporation.&#10;Step 4. Players choose ** to do an action or enter a coordinate on their dual dials. Then, dials are revealed. Actions happen before movements.&#10;Step 5. Players repeat by Filing Paperwork and moving/doing actions (Step 3-4) until all players run out of Photons or choose not to File Paperwork.&#10;&#10;Players File Paperwork in order to complete Career Goals that allow them to influence five departments. When a player completes a goal, they flip that card over next to their Player Board and put in the appropriate amount of influence cards to the Department Heads Board.&#10;&#10;The players use what they find as they reveal the section of space (grid of cards) to fulfill career goal conditions:&#10;1. Destroy 1 space pirate&#10;2. Upgrade your spaceship to level 3 (if you have 2 of this goal, the second goal is completed by upgrading to a level 4)&#10;3. Find 2 relics (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need 1 relic for each Career Goal card)&#10;4. Give 3 photons to the Accounting Department&#10;5. Destroy 5 Space Jellies (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need to destroy 2 more Space Jellies for each Career Goal card)&#10;&#10;When one player completes their fifth and final Career Goal, a vote is triggered. The player that completes their final Career Goal stops playing and all other players are allowed to spend their remaining Photons for that fiscal period (unless they also complete their final career goal, at which point they stop as well).&#10;&#10;Each of the five department piles of influence cards are shuffled separately.  One card is drawn from each department pile.  A player wins by having a majority (3 out of 5 departments) of their cards drawn.  If no hard majority exists, the player who gets 2 soft majorities (2 out of 5 departments, twice) wins.  The player with the most votes wins the job of Galactic CEO!&#10;&#10;",

The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.&#10;It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.&#10;A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.&#10;Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Race for the Summit is a rock climbing card game where 2-6 players challenge a towering rock spire and attempt to be the first to reach the top. Choose from 8 different climbers, each with their own preferences for the various hold types on the spire, as well as a unique special ability that can only be used once per game.&#10;&#10;Climb conservatively and hope your opponents take too many chances or be aggressive and risk a fall of your own.  You must compete for position with your opponents while at the same time trying to find the optimal route for your own ascent. Environment cards dictate conditions on the rock, while Action Cards can offer you more options through special climbing moves as well as adverse events that you'll need to overcome in your quest to win the Race for the Summit!&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of four copies each of ten pandas, numbered 1-10, and four Panda Law cards [High(6-10), Low(1-5), Even, Odd]. On your turn you will play one hidden panda face down, and one panda face up.  Your face up panda uses a special ability to do something -- steal a panda, change the Panda Law, or even gain bamboo!&#10;&#10;The Red Panda sits in the middle of the table, ready to award bamboo. If your turn starts and you can see four currently adorable pandas (by the Panda Law), scoring happens. You take the Red Panda card, and follow the instructions on the back. All hidden pandas are revealed, and everyone with at least two adorable pandas in play gets a bamboo. The player(s) with the most adorable pandas get a second bonus bamboo. Then, all adorable pandas are shuffled back into the deck (Other pandas remain). You choose a new Panda Law, and play continues. When someone gets to five bamboo, they win!&#10;&#10;Games last 5-15 minutes, and Adorable Pandaring can be played with 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chainmail is a medieval miniatures wargame created by Gary Gygax and fellow Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) member Jeff Perren, a hobby-shop owner with whom Gygax had become friendly. The game was first published in 1971 by Guidon Games. That first edition also included a fantasy supplement, and is one of the oldest sets of rules for fantasy miniature wargaming.&#10;&#10;In 1975, Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) acquired the rights to publish Chainmail and the game may have been the basis for the earliest Dungeons & Dragons game and campaigns (Dave Arneson, co-author of the original D&amp;D game, apparently disputes this). In the original boxed set of D&amp;D one is directed to Chainmail for the combat system but it offered an &quot;optional&quot; combat system involving 20 sided dice -- a system that eventually became the D&amp;D standard.&#10;&#10;Regardless of who you believe, the Chainmail fantasy supplement contained spells and monsters that reappeared in Dungeons & Dragons and most certainly influenced Gary Gygax and his thinking about Fantasy games in that era.&#10;&#10;",

The better the skeleton buried, the more you score!&#10;&#10;The first roll of a player's turn is the &quot;pre-op&quot; roll, with the player launching all 18 dice onto the table. The player then builds as complete a skeleton as he can with no gaps. For each subsequent &quot;post-op&quot; roll &ndash; if a player chooses to roll or is forced to roll &ndash; the player must first set aside a number of dice equal to the number of rolls already made: one die for the first post-op roll, two more dice for the second post-op roll, and so on.&#10;&#10;The player must add at least one die to the skeleton after each roll. If a player can't place a bone correctly, he must add an incorrect bone in the wrong location, e.g., a foot on the end of the spine.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player has a gravestone showing, the player can choose to end his turn, scoring for his skeleton. Each complete section (arm, leg or thorax) is worth five points, with each incomplete section worth one point per die in it. Each incorrectly placed die costs the player five points. If a player's skeleton wears a hat (which naturally goes only on top of the skull), double the score for that round. If a player has no gravestone and cannot pay for another reroll, he ends his turn scoring nothing.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 100 points (or some other agreed upon total) wins Rolling Bones.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In HELP!, you don't want to be stuck unable to play a card or unable to help a neighbor play.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds that alternate in clockwise and counter-clockwise order. The deck of cards is numbered 1-11, with more of the higher cards than lower ones; four types of special cards are also included in the deck. Deal each player a hand of four cards, then create a space next to the deck that can hold up to six cards.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the lowest card in hand plays that card next to the deck, then refills their hand. Each player in turn plays a higher card, and when the sixth card is played in the row, discard all six cards, with the next player then playing whatever card they want. If you can't play on a turn, ask the previous player whether they have a card you can play; if they do, the two of you exchange cards, then you play. You can play special cards &mdash; or pass them to or receive them from a neighbor &mdash; to get you out of a jam:&#10;&#10;&#10;    X is a joker that can be inserted in the middle of a row or at the end, and it counts as one higher than whatever card it's next to.&#10;    Switch allows you to replace a card in the row with a different card from your hand as long as the row is still in ascending order.&#10;    Zap removes the last card in the row.&#10;    No!, which is placed in front of you, serves as your play for the turn and also skips your next turn; additionally, you are skipped when a neighbor needs help.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you can't play a card and a neighbor can't help you, then the round ends and each other player scores 1 point. Alternatively, if you can't play and everyone else has a No! in front of them, which prevents them from helping, the round ends and you score 1 point because they failed you in that moment. Keep playing rounds until one or more players have 3 points and win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.&#10;The basic turn goes like this:&#10;First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.&#10;Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.&#10;Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.&#10;Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.&#10;In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).&#10;Spy vs Spy is not be to be confused with Spion & Spion, an entirely different game by the same publisher and credited to Alex Randolph .&#10;&#10;",

There are intriguing elements to the game; Molasar starts with twelve servants but actually has to &quot;eat&quot; one per turn, reducing his options in terms of blocking the searchers. Combat is handled by the attacked searcher nominating another searcher to play a combat card, which is compared against Molasar's; the loser is forced to &quot;retreat&quot; by the difference in values. If the searcher wins, they pick up a bonus (non-combat) card. All the searchers have (minor) special powers and Molasar has a number of one-off special cards he can play in trying to delay them.&#10;&#10;You can think of it, almost, as a very early, much simpler version of Lord of the Rings - except that in this one, one of the players gets to be Sauron!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 1952 game Stadium Checkers was the most complex and the liveliest version of this gravity-based, logic-puzzle race game. A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.&#10;&#10;A player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.&#10;&#10;According to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.&#10;&#10;This game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.&#10;&#10;Variants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pollyanna is a race/pursuit game published by Parker Brothers between 1915 and 1967.  During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled &quot;The Great Home Game,&quot; &quot;The Glad Game,&quot; or &quot;Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game.&quot; In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.&#10;&#10;The game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.&#10;&#10;Pollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnouts&mdash;short semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "San Gimignano uses large hex tiles as a board, each showing three areas with one of four different colors.  A start set of tiles are laid such that no color touches itself on an adjacent tile.  Through the game, tiles are added to the board by the players with this same restriction.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you add a marker to claim one of the colored spots on the board; up to two markers can be placed on a space.  When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections. The game ends when no more towers can be placed or when someone manages to place all 10 of their towers.  The player with the most placed towers wins.&#10;&#10;Tile placement and marker placement are both critical, as is where to place your tower so that you don't shut off further growth options.  It is possible to end up with a bunch of uselessly placed markers once all four colors will not be available to any of them.  The game nicely comes with English and German rules.&#10;&#10;A note about the unusual material of the &quot;towers&quot; can be found in a Geeklist thread:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/42582/item/944057?commentid=1098046#comment1098046&#10;&#10;",

If a player makes three in a row, he or she can capture one of the opponent's pieces.&#10;     Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving the pieces to adjacent nodes. Again, whenever a player forms three in a row, one of the opponent's pieces may be captured.&#10;     When one player is down to just three pieces, the remaining pieces may &quot;fly&quot; to anywhere on the board (not just adjacent nodes).&#10;&#10;&#10;You win when you reduce your opponent to two pieces, or when he or she can't move.&#10;&#10;Two possible boards exist.&#10;One has three concentric squares marked with the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked and also the adjacent corners linked. This is known as &quot;small board Twelve Men's Morris&quot;.&#10;&#10;The other board has four concentric squares marked, and similar to Nine Men's Morris, has only the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked.

    "Description": "Perfume sites are testing on monkeys everywhere, and you and your friends aren't going to stand by so some celebrity can smell like a million bucks. But while navigating through the lab to get back to the monkeys, one of your friends knocks over a beaker of The Competitive Edge. Due to the current side effect, everyone is now under the impression that this is a competition and whomever frees the most monkeys wins.&#10;&#10;Monkeys Need Love Too is a fast paced, action card game where you compete to free as many monkeys as possible while at the same time preventing your opponents from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Game play is divided into two phases. In the main phase, Flinging Poo, players take turns around the table. A player's turn starts off by drawing your hand to reload back up to 5 cards. If you draw banana cards, they are set aside and you keep drawing. Next the player has the option to play one monkey card and one action card.  Afterwards they must feed their monkeys using the bananas they have stored. If a monkey can't be fed, he/she is discarded. And lastly, the player may discard any cards out of their hand in the hopes of drawing better ones or more bananas next turn.&#10;&#10;The game is over when some plays the action card &quot;No Coco, No!!&quot;.  If successful, this ends the Flinging Poo phase and triggers the To the Trees phase. Everyone must now draw for their end fate. Do they escape?  Must they sacrifice some of their monkeys to do so? Do they find new monkeys while on the way out? In the end, the person who freed the most monkeys without being caught is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the publisher's website :)&#10;&#10;Soft Underbelly: Italy, 1943 (SU) [...] is an intermediate-complexity, two-player wargame simulating that historic World War II campaign. It may also be used to explore the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; inherent in the situation had the German high command chosen to react to the Allied landings in a much different manner: making that effort&rsquo;s defeat Berlin&rsquo;s main strategic goal for late 1943 (Operation Wacht am Tiber). The design therefore combines factual historical detail with studied counter-factual analysis to present players with a situation that will be familiar to most of them, while at the same time allowing for an easy and seamless transition into the less certain realm of alternative history.&#10;&#10;Each extra-large-hex on the 34x22&rdquo; mapsheet equals 11 miles (18 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents between two and 15 days, depending on the exact time of year of each one. That is, as the autumn weather worsens, and attrition and the inevitable declines in soldier morale and force-robustness take their tolls, each game turn comes to represent a longer period of time. That approach allows for the smooth building into the system of what would otherwise be burdensome factors of weather, ground conditions, operational tempo, etc. Every ground unit represents a division or division-equivalent (176 large-size NATO-style).&#10;&#10;The game uses the well-liked system originally created by Ben Knight for Victory in Normandy. There are approximately 14,500 words in the rules. A complete game of SU generally takes from four to five hours to complete, and it&rsquo;s suitable for solitaire play. Rules cover such things as: Allied end-run second invasions, Luftwaffe seaport raids, reinforcements, withdrawals, paratroop drops, naval gun support, both sides&rsquo; army and corps organizational schemes, German tactical superiority, tactical and strategic airpower and much more. The turn sequence is as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;I. Allied Player Turn&#10;&#10;A. Allied Reinforcement Phase&#10;&#10;B. Allied Command Point Expenditure Phase&#10;&#10;II. German Player Turn&#10;&#10;A. German Reinforcement Phase&#10;&#10;B. German Command Point Expenditure Phase&#10;&#10;Magazine: World at War #15&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally published in one of GW's magazines in June 2000, these are revised rules for using titans (combat mechs) in an &quot;Epic 40,000&quot; SF-miniatures battle. However, although they occasionally refer to the Epic 40K rules, this is only if you want to use the titans with infantry or tanks in combined armies. By themselves, these rules constitute a playable game pitting titans against titans (an &quot;Epic 40K Lite,&quot; if you will). The concepts and mechanisms will be familiar to anyone who has played any of GW's miniatures games.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained by damaging and destroying enemy titans, as well as by meeting the objectives of the chosen scenario. The player with the most VPs when the battle is decided is the winner. Playing time is completely arbitrary and will depend on the base point costs of the armies and the scenario being played.&#10;&#10;The rules WERE available on GW's Web site as a free downloadable PDF. However, the PDF doesn't include the objective cards that were printed on the back of the magazine where the rules first appeared, so unless this is fixed, players who have only the PDF will be limited to basic straight-ahead attack scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are separated according to color into four piles from which each player may draw five cards of any color. Each player plays one card per turn face down in a pile in the order of last player to first player according to their place on the track. When all have played a card, they're turned over and dealt with in the order played. Depending on the color of the card, one of the pawns moves forward or backwards &mdash; fourth place is red, third is blue, etc. &mdash; so each player must foresee where his character will be in the race at the time his card is used.&#10;&#10;",

Advisors use up the easy, sensible solutions and force Kim Jong-un into ridiculous extremes of problem solving, and while making themselves as troublesome as possible they must be acting as helpful and servile as possible, pleasing the Leader while frustrating him.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with the draw of a Policy Card that one player reads aloud. The Policy Card describes a threat to North Korea which upon which Kim Jong-un must render a decision. After each advisor has suggested their own unique solution to the issue at hand, Kim must come up with his own completely novel answer to prove he's smarter than everyone in the room and always knows best. And this, of course, is the correct answer.&#10;&#10;The advisors clap with delight over this display of wisdom, whether they like it or not, and then take turns extrapolating Kim&rsquo;s solution to make it grander and grander. Kim then insults each offering for suggesting that it improves on his wisest of decisions.&#10;&#10;Throughout the round Kim continually issues demerits to punish advisors for infractions real and imagined. Demerits have no hard mechanical function in the game but enable Kim Jong-un to harass the other players and create more fun.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, Kim Jong-un awards the Policy Card to whomever pleased him the most for whatever reason. That player becomes the new Kim Jong-un and a new round begins. At the end of the game players read grim factoids off the backs of the Policy Cards they've won, letting them know about the horrors in the real Hermit Kingdom.  This is a simple, fun game which tries to use the play of the game to lay bare the real world human rights abuses in North Korea.&#10;&#10;",

But no sooner has your ship landed than others show up to capture the most valuable things for themselves. What's more, the island is stricken by evil curses...and then there is also the kraken &mdash; which is both a blessing and a curse at the same time.&#10;&#10;In 7Seas, you want to use cards in hand to capture those on the table, but if you can't grab something, then you'll end up leaving goods for others to grab.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 40 cards in four suits (gold, rum, crystals, and curses); each card shows a strength value (1-10) and a booty value (from 7 to -7). Each player has a ship that starts at the beginning of the track, and a game lasts until a player reaches 7, 11, or 14 on the track, depending on the length of the game desired. To set up a round, deal 4 cards face up as a display, deal each player 8 or 11 cards depending on the player count, then place 3 or 4 cards aside as a special booty pile.&#10;&#10;On a turn, play one card from your hand. If a card in the display has the same strength as this card, you collect both cards. If instead two or more cards sum to the value of your played card, you collect those smaller cards and your played card. If you play a non-cursed 1, you can collect a 10 in the display (along with your 1), assuming no 1s are present. If you play the kraken (the cursed 1), then you can take all of the cards in the display along with the kraken &mdash; but the kraken is -7 points, so it better be worth it! If you can't collect a card, then you add your card to the display. If you ever clear all the cards in the display, then you steal one card, either from an opponent's collection or from the booty pile, looking those cards over and choosing your prize.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been played &mdash; and cards are played in two cycles of eight cards in a two-player game &mdash; players score points depending on what they've collected:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The player with the most cards moves their ship one space.&#10;    The player with the most gold coins moves one space.&#10;    The player with the pirate lady or pirate king (respectively the 1 crystal and 1 rum) moves one space.&#10;    The player with the highest booty total &mdash; that is, the sum of the highest card in each suit &mdash; moves two spaces.&#10;&#10;&#10;Continue playing rounds until someone moves their ship to the finish line.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take charge of your clan from the Scottish high country. In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.&#10;&#10;You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).&#10;&#10;Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.&#10;&#10;After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.&#10;&#10;The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;",
