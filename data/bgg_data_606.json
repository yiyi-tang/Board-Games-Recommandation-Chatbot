    "Description": "This game is not related to the classic dice game Yatzy (better-known as Yahtzee).&#10;&#10;The game consists of an 8 x 8 grid in a vertical frame, similar to Connect Four but only accessible from one side. The players roll four dice and insert four chips into the board with symbols corresponding to the results (the symbols are hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). Whoever gets three or more of the same symbols in a row may score, but a player may choose not to score yet. The more symbols in a row, the more points are scored. When all players have scored four times or when the frame is full, the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is great to read the 260 eco-event cards and consider if they have already happened or are still likely to since the game was published in 1993&#10;&#10;",

For example, a spectacular scandal in a government-run service will make all voters slightly more positive towards privatization, which will benefit parties on the &quot;Free Market&quot; side of that scale. Likewise, a huge oil spill would be beneficial for the greenish parties.&#10;&#10;Positioning yourself on different scales gives you points with the different demographic groups: the young/old, the men/women, the educated/uneducated, the rural/urban and the working/non-working. You can't win them all, so concentrate on your niche and keep a watchful eye on your ideological neighbors.&#10;&#10;If parties move in the same direction on some issue, they strengthen their relation; if they move apart, they weaken their relation (if they have one). A strong relation means an alliance, and alliances are crucial as voters first choose which alliance that suits them best, and then which party within that alliance. A lonely extreme party has a small chance of presenting a complete and appealing policy package, while a large and stable alliance will harvest many voters. On the other hand, sacrificing your party identity to suit your allies might also mean losing your core voters to the more radical parties.&#10;&#10;The game is thus cooperative/competitive; take one for the team, but make sure you're not doing all the work in keeping together - don't forget to grab a bunch of voters for yourself!&#10;&#10;",

Unlike Go-Moku, the goal is to get as many strings of three as possible, rather than to be the first to get a string.&#10;&#10;Game play begins with the players deciding which of them will play X and which will play O. Then the fifteen X/O dice are rolled, and whichever player's symbol came up more goes first. Players alternate placing the dice with their symbols until either time runs out or there are no more dice left. This does mean that one player may get more turns than the other. This confers a substantial advantage to the first player, which the rules suggest can be balanced out by playing multiple games.&#10;&#10;The final layout is scored, generally by counting the number of sets of three for each player, though the board also contains special double- and triple-score squares as well as some squares preprinted with X or O.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

A Bigfoot, the Wolfman, the Yeti, the Chupacabra, Loch Ness, the Mummy, a Skeleton, a Zombie, Frankenstein, and a Vampire were genetically designed in a lab. Once these monsters were born, they were trained in the habitat from the tales to become the perfect fighting machine. Monsters VS.

    "Description": "Tiki Rummy is an easy-to-learn card game with a Tiki theme.&#10;&#10;In this game you act as the leader of a Polynesian tribe collecting resources for your people. As the leader you'll play runs and sets of resource cards from your hand to score points. If you are the first player to play all of the cards in your hand, you will also score points for the resource cards the other players were unable to play. The player with the most points over several hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;What makes Tiki Rummy so fun to play are the powerful Tiki cards in the deck. You can call upon the Tiki to help you... or the Tiki can be used to cause trouble for your opponents!&#10;&#10;This game is travel-friendly and it is easily playable at your favorite bar, backyard BBQ, Tiki lounge, or wherever! The colorful cards have great lounge appeal... there is a good chance that when you start playing Tiki Rummy people will stop by your table and ask, &quot;Whatcha doin'?&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "UNSUNG WORKHORSES&#10;&#10;MechWarriors receive all the glory; aerospace fighter pilots a close second; vehicles are considered the workhorses of any military; infantry are even given their day in the sun in the minds of the common citizen. But no battle could be waged, nor won, without the mammoth apparatus of support vehicles that feed the war machines of the Great Houses. From cargo trucks to tank airships, airborne MASH to communication satellites, armored transport rails to coastal patrol boats, hauler exoskeletons to LoaderMechs, even hover and wheeled police cruisers or civilian vehicles conscripted into the military: the support vehicle is the true backbone of any military machine. Built using the construction rules found in Combat Equipment, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: Vehicle Annex provides a never-before-seen look at the support vehicles behind the militaries of every faction, as well as a slice of every day life in the BattleTech universe. From tracked land-trains to police cruisers, Luxury VTOLs to Fix-wing passenger planes, satellites, super-heavy naval surface ships, IndustrialMechs and more: the gamut of the BattleTech universe, fully illustrated for the first time.&#10;&#10;",

By taking centuries old machines and upgrading both their physical as well as technological capabilities, Vicore almost single handedly started a revolution that provided a cheap means to bring 'new' BattleMechs to the field commanders desperate for more assets.&#10;&#10;Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: Project Phoenix provides descriptions, game statistics and illustrations for twenty-nine classic BattleMechs that have been upgraded both in appearance and technology. Also, for the first time in any technical readout, additional illustrations representing all the variants for every design in the book are also included.

This game board looks somewhat similar but is not electronicall controlled. There are fielders out in the field and there are depressions throughout the field. When the pitched ball is hit is rolls into ares that let the player know if a hit or an out has occured. There are places to put runners who are on base. There is a depression in the infield which creates mostly automatic outs.&#10;&#10;",

It assigns figures factors by a process of measurement and judgment to reflect the capabilities depicted by the pieces themselves.  Figures are moved as individuals; no special stands or formations are required.  Play takes place on boards comprised of hexagons or squares; a list of terrain features and effects is provided.  The system is best suited for skirmishes involving 10 to 200 figures.  Any number of players can participate either as teams or in a free-for-all.  There is no need for referees.  The length of play and the area needed for play depend on the number of figures and players involved; a battle between two players' armies of 50 figures apiece would easily fit on a card table and probably last 2 to 4 hours.&#10;&#10;",

The game allows players to command approximately a division each.  Individual bases represent regiments (approximately 250-500 men).  The ground scale is 1&quot; = 50 yds., regimental bases are 3&quot;x1.5&quot; in size.  Each turn represents 15-30 minutes of time.  The authors use 10mm miniatures, but any size figures can be used as long as the base size is maintained.&#10;&#10;During each turn, each brigade, division and corps HQ throws a six-sided die for activation.  Players then draw cards one by one from a deck composed of black and red cards from 1-6 plus a single joker.  Each time a card matching the dice result thrown by the HQ is drawn, elements of that HQ can activate for movement, fire, etc.  HQ's can exchange dice with the HQ above or below it, in order to seize the initiative.  When the joker is drawn, the turn ends.&#10;&#10;Each stand fires by adding its attack factor to a d10 roll; hits are caused by equalling or exceeding the target's defense factor varies with unit type and terrain.  Regiments have 3 step losses.:  when a unit takes one hit, it fires at half strength (factors are not modified, but any odd die roll is an automatic miss); on a second hit, fire is at half strength and units may fire only on black cards; on the third hit, the unit is eliminated.  Long range fire cannot cause hits, only morale checks.&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s a new program of reconnaissance flights to extremely dangerous sectors. To survive you&rsquo;ll need to pass a special training that allows you to do more actions in the same time. But as you probably assumed by now, nothing is as easy as it seems.&#10;&#10;The expansion to the extraordinary cooperative game Space Alert brings even greater challenges for experienced teams. You don&rsquo;t have to worry though, this expansion is interesting even for teams that don&rsquo;t win against the most difficult of enemies from the basic game so often.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Ypres salient, a 6 mile (10 km) jut into German held territory, was established after the First battle of Ypres in the autumn of 1914. The position was tentative being surrounded by German forces on three sides.  As a result, the Allies started to dig-in forming defensive trenches.  The Germans followed suit starting the race to the sea that culminated in long trench lines that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1915, the German command was ready to launch an offensive to force the capitulation of the salient.  In an attempt to overcome the unexpected stalemate of trench warfare the German command decided on the use of chlorine gas to pry open a section of the Ypres salient and conclusively cut the salient off.&#10;&#10;French Algerians, Territorials, Canadians and British were holding the salient unaware of what was to come.&#10;&#10;Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres is a rule book that is used in conjunction with a standard Memoir '44 board and components to recreate the 2nd Battle of Ypres during the Great War. Players take turns moving their units and launching offensives in order to capture objectives or to force the surrender of the opponents forces.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the infamous gas attack and the German offensive.&#10;&#10;Requires a Memoir '44 basic set and the Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres rule book to play.&#10;&#10;(Memoir '44 is a registered trademark of Days of Wonder, Inc.)&#10;&#10;",

However, direct involvement in the different regions of the world is kept to a minimum.  The two Superpowers are involved in a Proxy War: influencing the world without direct involvement.  Each Superpower will use their political clout to alter the Political Tilt or Political Value of a region.  For instance, the US might have a strong position in the Middle East.  The USSR may choose to reduce the Political Value of that region, making it less attractive to Uncle Sam.  Or the USSR may change the Political Tilt of that region so that it is more favorable to the Soviet Agenda.  By advancing global agendas, the two Superpowers gain or lose favor in a region depending on the local politics.  Through all the politicking, random global events will alter the world political view causing both Superpowers to adjust individual political manipulations in order to achieve global superiority.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Kingdoms. The game where you must build your evil empire before other demon lords can build theirs.&#10;Kingdoms is a very social game that encourages interaction between players and is best suited for 4 players although 2 players can still have a lot of fun. If you like building up your strength while causing you opponents a lot of trouble then this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 1000 gold, 1000 resources and a blueprint of their kingdom which shows the buildings they need to construct in order to win the game. To construct buildings you need money, resources and minions.&#10;&#10;The rules of play are simple. Each turn a player draws a card and performs an action such as constructing a building, buying resources from the bank, or sending a cat with fleas into a rival kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each turn you are faced with the choice of building up your kingdom or ruining someone else's. Be wary of players forming secret alliances.&#10; However its not all about being mean to each other, the card pool contains a lot of nasty surpises too. Watch out for Demonic health Inspectors, drunken Aunties and your new &lsquo;uncles&rsquo; dropping by, and various unpleasant diseases coming your way.&#10;&#10;Then there are your Minions. Everybody needs minions, it&rsquo;s just a pity they are an unpredictable and fickle lot. Minions construct your buildings for you and generally moan a lot of the time. &lsquo;We are bored!&rsquo; they cry so you build them a den of iniquity. They are still not happy. &lsquo;We are lonely!&rsquo; so you build them a House of ill repute. They are never satisfied. Good job you can smite a few now and again to keep them in line&#10;&#10;Mess with you opponents plans. Tempt their minions to your kingdom or infect them with a plague or even send in a serial killer to thin the herd.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Death or Glory - What&rsquo;s it all about?&#10;&#10;These rules are one of the first historical projects to come out of Spartan Games. The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.&#10;&#10;The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.&#10;&#10;The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.&#10;&#10;This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.&#10;&#10;The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.&#10;&#10;",
