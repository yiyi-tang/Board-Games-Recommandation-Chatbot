    "Description": "In the sleepy English countryside, life continues undisturbed as it has for centuries. It is up to you to travel to every corner of this land, bearing the promise of modernisation, accommodating the oddly specific demands of the locals, and ushering in the age of steam.&#10;&#10;In Village Rails, you will be criss-crossing the fields of England with railway lines, connecting villages together, and navigating the complex and ever-changing demands of rural communities. Connect stations and farmsteads to your local network while placing your railway signals and sidings ever so carefully. Meet the exacting standards of cantankerous locals planning strangely specific trips, and weigh their demands against your limited funding. There is much to balance in this tricky tableau-building card game of locomotives and local motives.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadge: &#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Andor: The Family Fantasy Game, a.k.a. Andor Junior, each player chooses one of four heroes &mdash; magician, warrior, archer, or dwarf &mdash; before beginning their quest to rescue the wolf cubs lost in the dwarven mine. However, before beginning the search for the wolf cubs, the heroes must first complete the tasks given to them by Mart, the old bridge guard. Only after you have solved all of the bridge guard's tasks will he let you cross the bridge to the dwarven mines where you believe the wolf cubs are hiding. But watch out! While you are on your way, the sly dragon is getting closer to the castle Rietburg. Should it arrive at the castle before the heroes have completed their tasks and saved the wolf cubs, then all is lost, and you lose the game. If you find all the wolf cubs before the dragon reaches Reitburg, you win!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to Legends of Andor, with each game offering new challenges, which you must master together before the dragon reaches Rietburg.&#10;&#10;",

The game challenges players to step into the role of a medieval king and rule feudal Europe by building castles, taxing subjects, expanding territories, and engaging in battle. This in-depth game of strategy and conquest offers serious gamers a premium gameplay experience. It features 4 separate armies and 7 unique starting kingdoms, each with its own strengths and abilities, plus Kings Orders cards that play an important role in strategy.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first player to control 7 crowns.  Each city under a player's control provides a crown and a mission card deck gives an opportunity to earn more crowns.&#10;&#10;While there's some similarities to other versions of Risk, the turns are quite different.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of orders they can take on their turn.  They secretly place two orders face down, and the first place starts by revealing an order.&#10;&#10;One order card type is to either tax a player's connected territories to gain income or to spend that income on siege weapons, archers, cavalry, infantry units, castles or crown cards.&#10;&#10;The other order card type is to expand a player's units into another territory or move units from one territory they own into another.&#10;&#10;There are also additional bonuses on some of the order cards.&#10;&#10;Battles for contested territories are fought with dice.  Non-infantry units are rolled for first by type and deal immediate damage after which all units roll with 3 dice for the attacker and 2 for the defender.&#10;&#10;Diplomacy, alliances, and backstabbing are inevitable.&#10;&#10;",

To do that, they invest their money in mines, mining rights and the latest technologies. The player who has the most valuable park at the end of the game is the Lord of Diamonds!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build a magnificent park with many (different) attractions. The game ends, when the first player completes his or her park. Then victory points are scored based on the contents of the parks, technology advancements and achievements gained during the game. The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Diamonds Club is played in turns until the end condition is met by the first player. Each turn is divided into different phases. In the first phase players take turns placing coins on a central board to gain several benefits: mines, ships and prospector rights to gain gemstones, technology advancements or wildlife park attractions for the own park.&#10;To gain the benefit of a square you have to place one coin plus the sum of all vertical and horizontal placed coins. So as the players take turns, the available benefits grow more and more expensive.&#10;Once every player has passed, the players may change a combination of ship, prospector rights and mine into as many gemstones as the lowest value on all of the counters depicts.&#10;In the final phase the players can buy new attractions for their park using the earned gemstones.&#10;&#10;As mentioned above, there are several achievements, for example to be the first player having 5 equal attractions, or a special combination of attractions. Those score later extra points for the player who won this. Also, there are several technologies, which could raise the value of woods in the park, increase the gemstone income of the player or increases the number of coins available each round for the player. On the higher levels those technologies also score additional points in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;",

What's more, these cities are separated from others by double-squiggly lines that represent spaces where a ferry can go. As with the Vexation expansion, in this edition each player has three colored rails, and on a ferry route up to two rails can be placed, whether both colored rails or one being colored and the other a normal black rail line that any player can use. A player can lay only one colored rail per turn, and they can claim both possible rail lines in a ferry space. A ferry space is not complete unless it contains two rail lines.&#10;&#10;",

As a leader of an ancient Mediterranean Power, each player will need to master all 3 roads to power in order to lead their civilization to dominance and victory.&#10;&#10;Mare Nostrum is all about the expansion of one's lands, the construction of new cities, and the dispatching of caravans to take advantage of rare commodities that can either be traded or exploited to build constructions and eventually wonders of the world.&#10;&#10;But diplomacy and trade are but one path to greatness. The expansion of your navy and armies can take what should be rightfully yours. Hiring great leaders will further expand your boundaries in quick time.&#10;&#10;Controlling a combined total of 4 Wonders and/or Leaders or being the first to build the Pyramids will assure victory. But there are many hurdles to overcome to achieve such heights.&#10;&#10;Mare Nostrum allows for up to 5 players and offers a basic and advanced game in which players can customise their starting civilisation. For a game of such scope, it is quite amazing to think that the game only requires 2 pages of rules.&#10;&#10;Mare Nostrum is a winner of the 2001 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An extra Treefrog game for Essen 2008.&#10;&#10;A relatively simple train game set in North America and involving shares and building railway lines with a few twists thrown in.&#10;&#10;Each player uses their investment cubes to bid for control of companies, (six in all). When you take control of a company you receive one share, which means that only one share per turn can be purchased. The cubes you bid with go into the company and allow it to build track. Each location has a value which determines how much profit you receive for connecting it. After companies have built as much track as they can players are paid the profit that each company they control has made this turn. Profit levels are reset for the following turn. Players get another set of cubes to bid with and then bid again for control of companies.&#10;&#10;Cash earned from shares is really victory points, it cannot be used to bid on future shares. As each player receives the same number of investment cubes each turn there is no positive feedback for owning the best shares.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five turns. At the end of the game each company will pay out an additional amount of profit to each share held. This level is determined by how many different regions a company is connected to, (it's a little more involved than that, and coloured cubes are moved around!).&#10;&#10;About Steel Driver, Martin Wallace states in the rulebook:  &quot;I&rsquo;ve had it in mind to develop and update the system used in Prairie Railroads to fix some of the rougher elements.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

If you flip a card of the same color as any face-up card, then you instead discard the newly revealed card and your turn ends with you getting nothing. Otherwise, you again face the same options: Collect a face-up card or reveal a new card.&#10;&#10;If on your turn you have three cards of the same value in hand, you can play this trio on the table for a guaranteed 10 points. The game ends either when someone reveals that they have all ten acts in hand or when the deck has been exhausted. You score only for the highest-valued act of each color, so either avoid taking duplicate colors or ditch them in trios. If you have all ten acts in hand, score a 10-point &quot;gala show&quot; bonus. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Editions of Circus Flohcati bear a player count of either 2-5 or 3-5, but they don't differ in the rules or nature of the components.&#10;&#10;",

The Red Dragon Inn 3 may be played alone or in combination with other versions of The Red Dragon Inn to allow games of up to 12 players!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wizgille the Tinkerer : Wizgille is a Gnomish Artificer. Her brilliance with gadgets is surpassed only by her enthusiasm for tinkering with them--often with disastrous results. When Wizgille tests a new device, watch out! It could do something impressive, or it could blow up in everyone's faces!&#10;&#10;&#10;The Good: Many of her creations are legendary among the Gnomish Inventors Guild and have been featured in Adventurer's Gazette.&#10;The Bad: She thinks that a crowded tavern is an appropriate place to test new prototypes.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Brewmaster Phrenk : Phrenk is a Troll Alchemist. His skill as a potionmaster is unmatched, but he's not above using his skills for the &quot;lowly&quot; art of creating specialty drinks for his friends. He is a laid-back, live-and-let-live kind of a guy. But don't make him angry, because he is, after all, a troll.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Good: He's more than capable of brewing enough healing potions to keep his companions on their feet.&#10;The Bad: He's just as capable of brewing enough drinks to knock them all back down.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kaylin the Renegade : Kaylin is a tiny Pixie Enchanter with a big chip on her shoulder. The whole cutesy pixie thing didn't suit her, so she left The Grove and set out on her own. Wulfric is a wolf who is neither tiny, nor has a chip on his shoulder. Between her magical skills and his brute strength, they are a match for any dungeon's monsters.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Good: Wulfric is a noble companion who always helps his friends.&#10;The Bad: Kaylin isn't always so noble.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Serena the Pious : Serena would have died if she hadn't been such a cute baby. The Paladins who found her could not bring themselves to slay her as they did the other Orcs in her village. Seeing no other option, they took her in and tried to raise her as one of their own. Even with her training, she is always at risk of succumbing to her chaotic Orcish instincts, so she must be ever-vigilant to stay on the righteous path.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Good: With her holy blade at her side, she lives to smite evil.&#10;The Bad: Carousing in a tavern isn't exactly the best way for Serena to stay on that righteous path...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seeland plays in the golden era of the Netherlands (17th century). In this time the province Seeland (Zeeland) gains ever more power, prosperity and significance. The object of the game is to expand and extract more land surface from the sea. Players live as a respected burgher in this time and take part in the land reclamation.&#10;&#10;The game board shows 3 main sections - the scoring track around the edge, a rondel where you gather seed tiles and windmill tiles, and the land area where you place and/or reveal tiles for scoring. Setup includes randomly placing &quot;island&quot; tiles on spaces designated in the land area. At the beginning of the game, you place one of your 4 windmill pawns in the special starting area indicated in approximately the center of the land area.&#10;&#10;The rondel uses a unique method for determining which tiles are available in the inner ring of the market. If you select a seed tile, (cabbage, rapeseed, or tulips) you must place it on an empty space adjacent to one of your windmill pawns. If you choose a windmill tile, you place it on an empty space adjacent to a space already containing a tile. All tiles have a victory point number (some are zero). When you surround a windmill, you total the adjacent tiles and score that amount on the track, if you have at least 2 types of seed amongst the adjacent tiles. If all tiles are of the same type, no points are scored. If all 3 types are present, add 5 points to the total.&#10;&#10;If you place a windmill next to one or more island tiles, you flip them over to reveal their type. They may be seeds or a farm. If you reveal a farm, you get a coin which can be used to take an immediate second turn.&#10;&#10;When either the supply of windmill tiles or of seed tiles is exhausted, the game will soon end. (The exact end time depends on the movement within the rondel.)&#10;&#10;If you are playing with the set of rules that allow for end game bonus points, score them, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

If you collect Pok&eacute;balls, you take either three different colors of Pok&eacute;balls or two Pok&eacute;balls of the same color (as long as four are available). If you catch a Pok&eacute;mon, you pay its cost in Pok&eacute;balls, then add it to your playing area. If you reserve a Pok&eacute;mon &mdash; in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it &mdash; you place it in front of you face down for later catching; this costs you a round, but you also get a Master Ball which you can later use as a Pok&eacute;ball of any color. Each Pok&eacute;mon you have caught gives you a permanent Pok&eacute;ball that you can use toward catching all future Pok&eacute;mon, meaning as you catch more Pok&eacute;mon, it becomes easier to catch the ones that are more expensive and worth more points.&#10;&#10;Differences from the original Splendor include:&#10;&#10;     At the end of your turn, you can evolve one of the Pok&eacute;mon in your collection if the next level of that Pok&eacute;mon is in the display and you have the required Pok&eacute;balls. More points for you, and another card in your Pok&eacute;dex...&#10;     There are two new decks of cards: Rare Pok&eacute;mon and Legendary Pok&eacute;mon. Only one of each is on display at a time, and they each provide 2 permanent Pok&eacute;balls instead of 1 when caught. Legendary Pok&eacute;mon are worth more points than Rare Pok&eacute;mon but require you to use a Master Ball in order to catch them.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player has 18 or more points in their collection, you complete the final round, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pit is an open-outcry commodity trading game. The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&#10;&#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.&#10;&#10;Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology.&#10;&#10;The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn. Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.&#10;&#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.&#10;&#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.&#10;&#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.&#10;&#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: &#10;&#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.&#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.&#10;     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game&#10;&#10;&#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.&#10;&#10;In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.&#10;&#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.&#10;&#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.&#10;&#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.&#10;&#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.&#10;&#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).&#10;&#10;",

Depending on where you place your tent, you might be able to snatch a nugget from another explorer &mdash; but sometimes you'll be left holding fool's gold while someone else uncovers a rich gold find...&#10;&#10;Carcassonne: Gold Rush is the second game of a new series titled &quot;Carcassonne Around the World&quot;, which was preceded by by Carcassonne: South Seas and followed later by Carcassonne: Amazonas.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "B-17: Queen of the Skies is a strategy game which re-creates the early bombing missions and aerial combat of the B-17 (F Model) bombers of the US Eighth Air Force over Europe between November 1942 and May 1943. Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.&#10;&#10;The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.&#10;&#10;B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player). If each player has their own copy of B-17, then they can fly their bomber while playing the same mission as part of the formation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The cost of victory is blood, the cost of defeat is everything.&quot; &ndash;The Empire at War&#10;&#10;Set amid the constant warfare of the Old World, Warhammer: Diskwars is a game of ferocious, fast-paced tabletop battles for two to four players. At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World. During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be &quot;pinning&quot; the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building. Additionally, whereas the original Diskwars was a collectible game, Warhammer: Diskwars has moved away from the blind buy model, and the Core Set includes everything you need to play the game: a host of terrain cards, objectives, command cards, and more than sixty disks for the game's four races.&#10;&#10;",

They are charged with gathering ore from the mines, purchasing weapon designs from the market and then using these resources to forge weapons for adventurers who will go on quests to fight back the ever-deepening darkness. If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.&#10;&#10;At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests. Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren't completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult. At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure.&#10;&#10;Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round. The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production. The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages. The final phase is the acquisition and management of quests, which are selected from a pool of available cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Royal Palace is primarily a game of majority. Each player has servants he will place appropriately on the nine parts of the palace. On his turn, a player will perform actions based on the number of servants available on each location. If he has, for example, three servants on the mint, he gets three pieces of gold. As a bonus, the player with the majority of servants on a location receives generally a bonus extra action.&#10;&#10;Some places allow you to add new servants or to move them from room to room. The purpose is to earn gold and royal seals and to use those to recruit the lofty noblemen waiting in the castle park. The latter will be the main source of victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Some noblemen benefits are that you can break the balance in the rooms of the palace and there are also cards with privileges, offering bonuses of the same nature that it is also possible to retain them in hand to score points.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As the Mummy piece consists of two parts (one on each side of the board) the tomb raiders on the other hand know the movements of the Mummy.&#10;&#10;They move their pieces via dice rolls and judging by the color of the tomb raiders treasure goal cards and their dice rolls, the Mummy player tries to deduce their position on the board, while they try to evade him.&#10;&#10;When the Mummy moves over a tomb raider, he is &quot;caught&quot; by the Mummy magnet, thrown into the dungeon and loses some life points. The mummy wins when it earns a certain number of life points, while the tomb raiders have to secure a certain amount of treasures. &#10;Ravensburger states that bluffing and memory also play a big part in this game.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 magnetic game board, 1 magnetic mummy figure (2 pieces), 4 magnetic treasure hunters (tomb raiders), 12 life points, 5 treasure hunter dice, 1 Mummy die, 23 mission cards, 2 cover tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Things are moving full speed ahead too, the possibilities are enormous because this is 1977, the year when lunar living becomes reality. The most enterprising companies have decided to sponsor teams of scientists, builders, publicists and freelance nightlife entertainers to set out to construct the best client base in the galaxy. On top of this out of the world chance, the Lunar Colonization Authority shall assign the capital of the Moon to the best of the projects that are presented, making the chance for an even juicier reward!&#10;&#10;In LUNA Capital, the players must optimally manage the elements of the game to build the best possible lunar settlement, and to make it worthy of becoming the capital of the entire off-planet colony. They will have a series of construction cards in a common &ldquo;market&rdquo;, and each of the players shall be tied to a number of project tiles. The players take turns drawing cards and the tiles that accompany them, and then place them in their personal playing area. The cards must be laid out in a maximum of three lines and must be placed so that they are always in ascending numerical value. Once the card has been placed, the tiles are then put on the spaces for them on the cards, in an attempt to group together the various projects in the most efficient way possible.&#10;&#10;The tiles show what projects are available, all of which are essential for the construction of the city worthy of the term. They include oxygen collectors, greenhouses, residential complexes and (of extreme importance) sales offices to sell apartments with the best views in the galaxy. Each of these categories scores according to how they are arranged within the personal area of each player. Whoever is able to best take advantage of their arrangement and placement shall become the mayor of LUNA Capital.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All you need is the book, a pencil, two six sided dice, and grid paper.&#10;&#10;You choose four character types from the classic classes (warrior, wizard, rogue, halfling, dwarf, barbarian, cleric, elf), equip them, and start adventuring in dungeons created by dice rolls and by your choices. When you enter a room, you generate its content on a series of random tables. You will meet monsters, fight them, hopefully defeat them (or decide that discretion is the better part of valor!), you'll manage your resources (healing, spells, life points, equipment), grab treasure, dodge traps, find clues, and even accept quests from the monsters you meet. Your characters can level up and become better at what they do, but it will not be easy.&#10;&#10;What the game is not:&#10;&#10;It is NOT a miniature game. You may use miniatures to remember your characters' marching order if you wish, but that's it.&#10;&#10;It is NOT a roleplaying game. You may run it as a simple cooperative, GM-less game if you want.&#10;&#10;It is not a game-book or a choose-your-own-adventure book. There is no prose to read or numbered sections to go to, even if we could do something like that in a supplement.&#10;&#10;Everybody at Ganesha is having great fun with 4AD. A couple of supplements are almost ready and will be available soon.&#10;&#10;The PDF is 90 pages with plenty of black and white illustration, plus a color cover and a flowchart.&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt random hands of 5-10 (depending on number of players) locomotives, which are essentially a stock portfolio; the rest of each color are placed in a pool.  On your turn, you can either increase the value of a single company by placing 1-5 locomotives from the remaining pool of that company, or you can trade one locomotive in your portfolio for one or two locomotives from the remaining pool in a company.&#10;&#10;The game board is a map of France, with cities worth anywhere from 1-4 points, and rural hexes worth 0.  Connecting to a city adds to a company's value.&#10;&#10;The game ends when Marseille is reached by a company, or when there is only one company with locomotives remaining in the pool.

    "Description": "Over its 250-year history, the British East India Company grew to become one of the most influential commercial and political organizations in the world. Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world's great nations, but its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.&#10;&#10;John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company's history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: Use the Company and the Company's trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...&#10;&#10;As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late Company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.&#10;&#10;Taking its inspiration from Phil Eklund's seminal Lords games, John Company offers Greed Incorporated by way of Republic of Rome &mdash; and with only sixty cards and multiple scenarios, John Company is one of the most accessible SMG offerings to date.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Edo, players represent daimyo in mid-second millennium Japan who are trying to serve their shogun by using their samurai to construct castles, markets and houses in Tokyo and surrounding areas.&#10;&#10;At the start of Edo &ndash; which won &quot;best evening-length game&quot; in the 2010 Hippodice Game Design competition under the name Altiplano &ndash; each player has five samurai tokens, seven houses, one market and three square action cards, each of which has four possible actions on it. One card, for example, allows a player to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collect rice (up to four bundles depending on the number of samurai applied to the action),&#10;    Collect $5 (per samurai),&#10;    Collect wood (up to four, with one samurai on the action and one in the forest for each wood you want), or&#10;    Build (up to two buildings, with two samurai on the card and one in the desired city, along with the required resources)&#10;&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players simultaneously choose which actions they want to take with their three cards and in which order, programming those actions on their player cards, similar to the planning phase in Dirk Henn's Wallenstein and Shogun. Players then take actions in turn order, moving samurai on the board as needed (paying $1 per space moved) in order to complete actions (to the forest for wood, the rice fields for rice, cities to build, and so on). Before a player can move samurai, however, he must use an action to place them on the game board; some actions allow free movement, and others allow a player to recruit additional samurai beyond the initial five.&#10;&#10;One other action allows you to recruit additional action cards from an array on the side of the game board, thereby giving you four (or more) cards from which to choose for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Building in cities costs resources and gives you points as well as money; as more players build in a city, the funds are split among all present, with those first in the city receiving a larger share. Players can also receive points or buy stone by dealing with a traveling merchant.&#10;&#10;Once at least one player has twelve points, the game finishes at the end of the round, with players scoring endgame bonuses for money in hand and other things. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Edo includes separate game boards for 2-3 players and for 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

They taught you the ways of culture, science, and warfare. They promised knowledge for any willing to learn. Come, Archon, guide your citizens to victory, under the watchful eyes of the Builders, our benefactors from beyond the skies above.&#10;&#10;In Origins: First Builders, you are an archon, guiding a population of freemen, influencing the construction of buildings and monuments, climbing the three mighty zodiac temples, and taking part in an arms race &mdash; all in an effort to leave the greatest mark on mankind's ancient history.&#10;&#10;You start the game with a city consisting of just two building tiles: the Agora tile and the Palace tile. As the game develops, your city will grow in both size and strength as you add new building tiles, each of which has a special ability that triggers when it is first added to a city and when closing a district. Your placement on the military track indicates the rewards you receive when you attack and your chances of becoming first player.&#10;&#10;Origins: First Builders is played over a number of rounds, with a round ending only after each player has passed. If a game end condition has not yet been triggered, the game continues with a new round. On your turn, you perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Visit an encounter site with your workers to gain resources and additional citizen or speaker dice, advance on the zodiac temple tracks (and potentially gain zodiac cards), and advance and attack on the military track.&#10;&#10;&bull; Close a district, gaining victory points (VPs) and possibly gold for matching a district card's building pattern, additional bonuses based on the buildings you activate, and additional VPs at the end of the game based on the value of the citizen die you use to close the district.&#10;&#10;&bull; Build a tower level to increase your endgame scoring based on the tower heights and the matching color dice you use to close your districts.&#10;&#10;&bull; Grow your population.&#10;&#10;&bull; Pass.&#10;&#10;The game finishes at the end of the round when one or more of the following conditions has been met:&#10;&#10;    At most three colors of tower disks are still in stock.&#10;    No gold remains above any district card.&#10;    No citizen die of the proper color can be added to the citizen offer.&#10;    A player has moved all three of their zodiac disks to the top space of each temple track.&#10;&#10;&#10;The temple area is divided into three tracks: the sea temple, the forest temple, and the mountain temple. You score points only for your two least-valued temples, and once all the points have been summed, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

Any player who has all the ingredients required for their recipe can cook it and collect popularity points.&#10;&#10;In addition, each player controls a chef equipped with their own &quot;chef power&quot;. Chef powers are asymmetrical and allow players to bend the rules in their favor. The base game of Rival Restaurants has twelve chefs, and additionally, at the beginning of the game, each player must choose a restaurant to play, with each restaurant having a unique level-up structure with rewards for reaching 3, 7, and 12 popularity points. Lastly, players can also choose to buy &quot;action cards&quot;, that is, development cards that are typically for one-time use.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The kingdom is shattered, its towns are divided, and its people are distrusting.  The newly crowned ruler, El Cascadero, seeks to reunite the land, but he can&rsquo;t do it alone. Thus, he appoints four ministers to visit the people and restore civil harmony. While the ministers are obligated to bring prosperity to the entire land, each of them also has one dedicated responsibility: Farming, Crafting, Mining, and Markets.  El Cascadero also records in his book the successes of his ministers&hellip;&#10;&#10;Cascadero is the next epic tile placement strategy game from acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia.  Ministers visit towns by placing their envoys adjacent to them; but towns are distrusting of single envoys, so newly placed envoys will only trigger town scoring when they are part of an established group or carry an official seal from El Cascadero himself. Towns with Royal Messengers at them or a history of envoy visits are even more valuable, as they willingly collaborate for even greater successes.&#10;&#10;Players must decide between two competing strategies: build long chains of their envoys to achieve synergies and objectives, or establish smaller, separate groups of envoys to trigger timely town scoring. Both will award victory points, yet your victory points will mean nothing if you don&rsquo;t also reach the end of your appointed success column.&#10;&#10;By triggering town scoring, you&rsquo;ll advance along that town&rsquo;s matching success column, gaining bonuses as you pass over them.  Bonuses include earning victory points, advancing further on any success column, claiming an official seal, repositioning an envoy, or even acquiring an additional turn. Through careful timing and clever plans, players can trigger a cascading combo of exciting bonuses that swing momentum in their favor.&#10;&#10;Cascadero provides a wealth of replayability through emergent player interaction, variable board and tile setups, and an advanced player mode featuring traveling heralds.  Yet the game will always end in one of two ways: when one player reaches fifty victory points or must place a tile but has no tiles left.  The players who reached the end of their appointed success column qualify for victory, and whoever among them has the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The problem, however, is that outlawing the &quot;manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors&quot; hasn't done anything to reduce the demand for booze! As a result, illegal stills dot the countryside and secret (or not-so-secret!) speakeasies are popping up all over in cities large and small.

With this much money at stake, organized crime is sure to take an interest.&#10;&#10;In Bootleggers, players take on the role of enterprising bosses seeking to make a name for themselves in the illegal alcohol trade at the height of the 1920's prohibition era. Deceit, lies, and alliances of convenience are the norm as players attempt to control distribution through money and corruption by muscling in on the competition, paying off the local law authorities, building underground speakeasies, and shipping trucks of &quot;hooch&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

These cards depict colored (one-color or rainbow) turtles and movement (1 or 2 steps forward, 1 step backwards; also, in case of some rainbow-colored turtle cards, moving the last turtle forward). When a turtle moves on a space where another turle is waiting, it is placed on the top of that turtle. When a turtle with other turtles on its back is moved, all the other turtles on top of it are carried with this turtle. The first turtle to reach the last field wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from Spielbox&#10;&#10;&quot;Ribbit&quot;, SimplyFun's 2007 reprint, has frogs instead of turtles.&#10;&#10;Schildkr&#195;&#182;tenrennen FAQ&#10;&#10;5 and up&#10;&#10;",

Once a building is purchased, it is replaced from the deck, and the central pool is a small subset of the deck, and is therefore different every game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has purchased his fourth building. After that round finishes, the player with the most points worth of buildings is the winner!&#10;&#10;At the heart of Harbour is a dynamic market mechanism. Each time a player purchases a building, the value of the resources they used drops, while the value of the other resources rise. You'll have to carefully time your purchases to take advantage of the ebb and flow of market prices, or be prepared to waste some resources!&#10;&#10;",

Marvel HeroScape is part of the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;Players can build many different battlefields by attaching and stacking terrain tiles of different sizes. The battlefield/scenario section includes 8 scenarios and 2 terrain layouts. Games can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card. Extra hits count as wounds (figures may have more than one wound).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;",

Each Foil Pack contains two cards and two dice that players can add to their Dice Masters Battle for Faer&ucirc;n collections.

Find your way around the burrows of the marmots because they can restrict you during tile placement. Scoring takes place depending on the players' selection of meadow tiles from a central game board. Whoever has the largest meadow during a scoring receives a hiking pin, and the first player to earn their second hiking pin during scoring wins.&#10;&#10;New puzzle challenges are guaranteed with 172 tiles in 49 shapes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.&#10;&#10;Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries. To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds. Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand. The player who wins that hand gains point, the loser loses the same amount of points.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to avoid capturing hearts at one (1) point apiece and (in the most commonly played version today) the queen of spades, at thirteen (13) points, the card on which the whole game pivots.  But to make it interesting, it is also possible to &quot;shoot the moon,&quot; taking all the hearts and the queen, a coup that gives 26 points to each of your opponents instead!&#10;&#10;",

Actions range from colonization, to naval movement, to battle, with most activity centered in and around Sicily and Sardinia/Corsica. Players may also purchase additional cards from their own custom decks, or from a set of neutral cards that either player may purchase. There are also Strategy cards that each player can purchase (one, max) that give the owning player some special advantage.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of several turns, up to a maximum of twelve. At the end of each turn, players resolve random events, collect income and score victory points. There are several paths to victory, ranging from simply having the highest score at the end of the game, to capturing the opposing player's capital.&#10;&#10;Inspired by A Few Acres of Snow, this game features several new elements, including navies, naval battles, cavalry superiority, mercenaries, field battles, sieges, manpower, strategy cards, random events, turn based scoring, bribery and tactical bonuses.&#10;&#10;The name of the game is based on a quote from a Carthaginian commander, who claimed at the outbreak of hostilities that the Carthaginian control of the seas was such that the Romans would not even dare wash their hands in the sea.&#10;&#10;",

Each pillar works together to create a unified and epic, sci-fi board game experience.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow cadets are close to completing your Akarios Institute pilot training when an unknown enemy attacks your home planet of Medellia. You must fight back with the war hero Captain Soma and her ship, the Sparrow. You will need to step out of your fighters to explore hostile worlds and ships, putting your cunning to the test as you seek new home for your civilization. Use your pilots' skills to complete the challenges you encounter in the limited time available. Manage your ship&rsquo;s resources as you explore new regions of space and embark on missions fighting to survive through the unknown. Even if you are out of resources you can continue exploring, but you risk starting your next encounter at a disadvantage. Your pilot's skills will grow as you test your grit against the enemies in Stars of Akarios. Upgrade you characters' unique abilities and skill trees, allowing you to customize your play experience.&#10;&#10;The 200 page scenario book unfolds as a &quot;choose-your-own-adventure.&quot; Each choice, success, and failure will shape your story.

The campaign starts with 4 available pilots and the others are unlocked through the choices you make. 10 pilot ships each come with their own set of abilities and class. The ship class will determine what type of upgrades the ship can equip. Equip a combination of upgrade and ability cards from over 55 weapon cards, 55 engine cards, 55 tech cards, many co-pilots, ship abilities, and pilot abilities.

For those who haven't played the classic fantasy adventure game Talisman, this means that on each turn, a player rolls a single six-sided die before moving his playing piece that number of spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise around the region (outer, middle, or inner) of the board it currently occupies. That player then draws a card or cards to see what he's encountered, pitting his heroic persona against foul enemies, dangerous locations, and fantastic strangers. And all the while, these intrepid heroes rise in power, as they work their way toward the ultimate goal at the center of the board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.&#10;&#10;The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &quot;Mother carrying small child&quot;, &quot;This is not your place, sir&quot;, or &quot;Under-the-counter goods&quot;. But they have to watch out for &quot;Closed for stocktaking&quot;, &quot;Delivery error&quot;, and for the black pawns &ndash; the speculators &ndash; standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags.&#10;&#10;On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemys&#197;&#130;awka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep &ndash; unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader. In this realistic game you really have to be savvy to get the goods.&#10;&#10;Are you brave enough to confront the everyday life of the 1980s?&#10;&#10;",

India stood at the center of this sprawling imperial network, and the currents of empire ran through its ports, tying the Far East with European markets and awarding the British virtual control of the vast wealth of the subcontinent. However, the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the empire was far from secure.&#10;&#10;Across the forests of Siberia and the steppes of Asia, the Russian Empire advanced at a rate exceeding even the pace of America's western pioneers. This expansionism by the world&rsquo;s largest nation loomed over British holdings in India, casting a longer shadow each year. In the buffer region of central Asia, surveyors, adventurers, industrialists and government agents crossed paths, all seeking to manipulate the byzantine local politics. There, in the shadow of the Pamir Mountains, the stage was set for a game that would define the limits of global power in the 19th century and the present day.&#10;&#10;In Pax Pamir, two to five players assume the role of Afghan tribal leaders navigating the winds of colonial power in &quot;The Great Game&quot;. If either the Russian, British Empire, or Afghan is able to achieve supremacy, the player with the most influence in that empire wins.&#10;&#10;",

You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played.&#10;&#10;If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players find treasures by digging at the dig site (draw pile of cards).  Sets of treasures are collected over the course of the game and players choose the best time to sell them to the museum.  Once a player sells a treasure set to the museum the value of that set is credited to the player, and is no longer subject to loss or theft.&#10;&#10;If a player finds any maps at the dig site, he can use them to explore an ancient pyramid where more treasures are hidden.  Players can trade their treasures with the local marketplace to increase the value of their collection.  If a player meets a thief at the dig site, he will use this thief to steal treasure from another player.  If a sandstorm hits, all players are affected and may lose some of their treasure.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game.&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;There are more differences that are non-substantive. (Art, points in LCBG multiplied by 5, etc.)&#10;&#10;",
