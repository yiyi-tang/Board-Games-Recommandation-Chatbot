The animals have a limited time to evacuate before each sanctuary is destroyed. Destinarc is the only safe place and they must evacuate there to escape the danger and help save other animals - their own kind or all kinds.&#10;&#10;You can play this game in two modes: competitive and co-operative.

Every two turns or so, a Warning card is pulled to show which board will disappear. You must move the animals off that board quickly before the board is removed along with everything on it. Be careful! The board you just landed on may go next! Or there may be no escape route left!&#10;&#10;In those dire situations, there is always hope when the animals work together to save one another.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Before being called summoners, they practice their mastery in combat, learning little by little about the infinite possibilities of each being that they will be able to call; these are the encounters that grow mages into future summoners.&#10;&#10;1 vs 1 mode expansion for Invocaci&#195;&#179;n Fronteras.&#10;&#10;Includes 2 promo cards:&#10;&#10;     Akari (41 - Air): Match your Reserve Mana to the player with the lowest Reserve Mana (minimum 1).&#10;     Azael (60 - Air/Earth/Water/Fire): Your Power is equal to the lowest Power at this time, multiplied by 3.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Medium difficulty for new and old summoners.&#10;&#10;In this game mode the summoners prepare a deck each. Then they fight normally but the cards they use are the ones they set aside for themselves. It is a practical way to learn the cards and they generate a dynamic reminiscent of TCG or CCG games.&#10;&#10;Although 1 vs 1 is recommended, it is just as functional for more players.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, players place their &ldquo;Cadets&rdquo; around the West Point campus to conduct training and face off in competitions. The goal is to become the Valedictorian by scoring the most points in the three pillars of the Academy (Academic, Military, Physical).&#10;&#10;Just like at the real West Point, players must carefully manage their Competitions (e.g., IOCT or Term End Exams) with their Training (e.g., studying or doing duties). Drawing Training cards doesn&rsquo;t score points, but players need Training cards to win Competitions. Remember that the most successful cadets play their cards well to graduate at the top of their class!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Karuta is a classic card game in which one person reads a line on a card from a classic poem, and the other two players must snatch or guard the open card that has the successive couplet.&#10;&#10;In this game, Meru Karuta, the cards have tricky Kanji, the Japanese characters that derive from Chinese. Kanji are often hard for experienced Japanese readers, and the game plays on that problem.&#10;&#10;Each Kanji in the game is some version of a word with '-meru'. So players only have to get to something-meru in order to identify the card in question. However, the kanji are so tricky, and the game gives no assistance to help the readers, so there is no expectation for anybody to read it correctly, not the reader nor the players. Everybody is just meant to make the best they can and hack through it without worrying too much about accuracy.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The motifs on the cards provide visual bullet points for people, objects, and locations that are central to the action, things that must be remembered in the correct order, with cards disappearing and new ones being added each round. Those who, as a narrator, manage to present their version of the story without errors will be rewarded accordingly.&#10;&#10;Fabula Rasa: Horror contains 30 cards that feature characters (Dracula, werewolf, zombie), objects (carriage, cape, torch), and locations (castle, village, sinister alley) that can be combined with either of the standalone games Fabula Rasa: Crime or Fabula Rasa: Seemannsgarn.&#10;&#10;",

You can roll the dice more if you'd like, and as long as you roll the right color, the gondoliere can continue to move forward.&#10;&#10;There is only one problem: There is always a traffic jam at the Rialto Bridge &mdash; and after that the gondoliere has to continue in one go until they reach their destination because otherwise they will be too late for new guests. Keep an eye on the opposing gondolieri as they can still profit from the remaining dice!&#10;&#10;",

Each side controls 1 to 4 WWII era tanks in a fast-paced skirmish game of tank-on-tank warfare. The game is over when one side loses their last tank or when a pre-determined objective has been met.&#10;&#10;This is a dice allocation game and each tank starts the game with 5 basic d6 and 1 special leader d6. These dice constitute the command decisions made by each tank and will determine which actions can be taken by that take in a give round as players allocate dice to activation spots.&#10;&#10;Tank commanders must be careful for as damage accumulates they can lose command dice temporarily or permanently representing the pressures and confusion of battle. Additionally, tanks will take physical damage disabling specific tank functions.&#10;&#10;As a tank commander you must gauge the risk/reward of confrontation. The initiative system creates a fog of war and uncertainty on when your enemy will move and what maneuvers they have in store.&#10;&#10;Button up your tank commanders, the enemy is in sight, now the mettle is tested and only the steadfast will emerge once the smoke of battle clears.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a collaborative, storytelling RPG about a Chinese-American family making their living by running a restaurant in one of America&rsquo;s Chinatowns, circa 1920. Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of members in the family, spanning three generations, who face threats of Jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and oppression by day.&#10;&#10;Players must balance the responsibility of running and maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the supernatural forces.&#10;&#10;A game session takes place over a number of days, alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. And the Game Moderator will out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Their success is determined by using Resilience slots from their characters to complete the tasks.&#10;&#10;Once the tasks have been completed to the best of the family&rsquo;s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant&rsquo;s slots.&#10;&#10;Prior to starting the morning scenes, each character must see how they&rsquo;re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters.&#10;&#10;Colored Mung cards are good dreams, black-and-white Mung cards are nightmares, and must be used to cover a trait on their Character sheet. Covered traits are unusable until the bad dream is removed via role-play. If a character is unable to remove the bad dream Mung cards that cover up all of the traits on their character sheet, then the character is turned into a Jiangshi, a vampire. The black-and-white Mung cards are flipped over to reveal new skills.&#10;&#10;To remove the Jiangshi from the restaurant the players have 10 seconds to write a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. If the group is able to complete the phrase in the 10 second period (GM keeps count) then the Jiangshi is immobilized and can be then healed through gameplay.&#10;&#10;The whole group of players (not including the Game Moderator) starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the 1st day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.&#10;&#10;",

A combat-centric member of the infamous Bleeding Moon, he excells in death, stealth and being prepared to deal with any situation. Being able to react fluidly counts massively when on missions, which makes this Shadows Crow the terrifying foe he is. His weapon of choice is the Kama: a short, sickle-like weapon that can slice and punch through the stoutest of armour. He loves it so much that he fights with one in each hand, and when in motion, they are a wall of slicing steel. He hides his identity behind a fearsome mask that stupefies his enemies for a second or two when they see it. They often realise - correctly - that this will be the last thing they see on this earth, and the hesitation is all he needs to strike first.&#10;&#10;Shinyuki is a combat model that will excel at putting Damage and Bleed Markers on your enemy models. The Slice Ki Feat is expensive, but the damage can be worth it as it often turns a hit into a kill with a whopping Bleed 3 Marker. The ability to get Melee Boost 2 can help if locked in a protracted combat as you can get that higher Melee Pool every turn. The best use of this model may be to finish off a wounded enemy and use the Escape Ki Feat to reposition for Camouflage and Distance from the enemy. This moderate rice cost melee toolbox opens a lot of options for Bleeding Moon players.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one miniature, 30mm base and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;",

With only their goal in mind, they endanger their own creation and set the world ablaze.&#10;&#10;Into an empty universe, players create a three-dimensional game world. The players acquire resources in order to conquer the territory of the other players with their forces. At the same time, their god can cast more powerful spells turn by turn and thus decisively influence the game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to defeat all of the opponents' units so that their god cannot return to the world. One's own tactics and the behavior of the opponents always give the game captivating twists and make the events unpredictable.&#10;&#10;The turn-based building system gives new players the opportunity to gradually familiarize themselves with it during their first game. But Creators Of The First Dawn also offers new challenges to experienced players. The basic rules can be supplemented with modifications to freely shape the level of complexity of the game and shift the tactical focus according to one's own wishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Capital Beltway is a fast way to transport goods around the U.S. capital... until the highway traffic gets out of control!&#10;&#10;Halloween and Washington DC are another pair of Age of Steam maps created by the highly regarded Age of Steam expansion designer Alban Viard. Together with a new edition of The Giant Maps, this pair of maps was released as part of his annual Age of Steam map set in 2021, available for purchase directly from the website of his publication firm: AVStudioGames.com.&#10;&#10;The Washington DC map (3-4 players), a revision of the expansion previously released on the reverse side of the Berlin Wall map in 2008, focuses on the Capital Beltway, I-495. While the interstate can allow for quick goods transportation, it also becomes increasingly clogged as the game progresses and eventually becomes nearly impassable. The rules are modified slightly from the original design, increasing the likelihood of &quot;Gridlocked&quot; interstate hexes earlier in the game.&#10;&#10;The Halloween map (1 player), a new entry for the Age of Steam system, is a solitaire-only puzzle wherein the player wins if they can remove all pumpkins from the map. Pumpkins are delivered only with the help of witches. The rules provide for three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, and Difficult. In addition to the map, the player must supply 12 orange cubes (pumpkins) to play.&#10;&#10;",

The King, whose dynasty built thousands of temples in South India, invites sculptors from across his empire to help build the temple tower. Each sculptor is expected to bring stones from their region to build the temple together with other sculptors. The sculptors are expected to use all stones available to build. The King also sets the reward objectives for every stone and sculpture placed on the temple tower.&#10;&#10;The sculptor can gain rewards incrementally when placing stones of other sculptors on the temple structure. When placing their own stones, the sculptor does get any reward points. But the sculptor does get points for pattern(s) created on the temple structure using their stone. Hence the objective for the sculptors would be to focus on building the temple structure with as many stones possible and creating patterns using their stone. It is important for the sculptor to ensure patterns are not created with stones of other sculptors.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the temple tower is completely built with stones and sculptures or when a sculptor is unable to perform any of the possible actions. The sculptor with most reward points is declared as the winner or the best.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Interplanetary, a board game invented by Art Widner, was shown for the first time to The Stranger Club in late 1942 and first played at Boskone III. It included elements of Auto Race and Monopoly and added complications such as planets moving in their orbits. The game took an enormous amount of time to play: 8 or 12 hours or even more.&#10;&#10;According to Widner: The reason it took so long is that it was a combination of a standard &lsquo;race&rsquo; game and Monopoly. One had to get to a planet and bring back a cargo in order to finance a trip to the next distant planet where a still more valuable cargo would be obtained, etc., out to Pluto, which harbored &lsquo;Immortality Dust,&rsquo; the game winner. The novel aspect was that the planets moved, making it difficult to land on one, plus such hazards as the &lsquo;negasphere&rsquo; (from E. E. Smith epics -- now known as a black hole) and pirates, to say nothing of falling into the sun, getting hit with space junk, etc.&#10;&#10;Years later, Bill Evans, Bob Pavlat, C. Stewart Metchette, and Ted White changed the rules enough to make it possible to play the game in an evening. It still didn't catch on.&#10;&#10;",

This starts the FUMBLE! where the remaining players scramble to get one of the WHITE balls (one player is left without).&#10;&#10;Once the balls have been claimed, players take their &quot;kicks&quot; by bouncing their ball off the playing surface into the cup. The white balls are worth 3 points (a field goal) and the orange ball is worth for 1 point (an extra point).&#10;&#10;Example: In a 4 player game, Player 1 gets 5 cards of a kind first and recovers the orange ball, scoring 6 points. Players 2 and 3 each recover a white ball. Player 4 misses out on the fumble. Player 1 then &quot;kicks&quot; the orange ball for an extra point and players 2 &amp; 3 get a chance to kick a field goal for 3 points.&#10;&#10;(In a round a player can earn a max of 7 points)&#10;The first player to get 21 points, wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this highly strategic board game, opposing teams must race to pocket their group of balls first, for a chance to end the game by pocketing the 8 ball for the win. Take advantage of unique movement mechanics such as shot selection, controlled positional play, dead ball extractions, tactical safety play, rebound doubles, combination shots and more. The game gets more and more intense as both players fight to control the board and edge closer to the 8 ball.&#10;&#10;The Game starts by dealing out the breaking cards to form the starting layout of the game. Two groups of balls (solid &amp; stripes) along with the White and 8 Balls. Once the first ball is pocketed (directed into 1 of the 6 pockets), that group of balls will be designated to that player for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to pocket all their balls and then pocket the 8 Ball wins. Winning the game is determined by players shot selection and tactical safety play.&#10;&#10;Balls can only move in straight lines, either Vertically, horizontally or diagonally along the board. Much like a queen piece in the game of chess. Always moving the white ball first, players choose which direction to move other balls and in addition have the option to move the white ball in preparation for their next shot. Using the dice, will help to determine how many moves a player possess and how they want to use them.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Overlord game mode is optional. With the contents of the expansion, you can continue to fight the game together. The new pensioner hunters can be freely combined with those of the basic game.&#10;&#10;In the future everything will be networked - including retirees. Their countless high-tech implants and prostheses form a gigantic computing network, in the depths of which an artificial pensioner intelligence - or R.I. for short - goes unnoticed. - grows up, who seeks revenge on the youth-mad society because of miserable care conditions and a lack of respect for old age. As an overlord, a player takes control of the masses of retirees and, equipped with numerous special skills, competes alone against a team of retired hunters.&#10;&#10;",
