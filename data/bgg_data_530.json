The comedic things that happen in the cartoon strip happen in this game from &quot;Bumping in to a Fat Lady&quot; which causes you to move back 2 spaces to &quot;Tripping over Carpets&quot;  which results in your being able to advance 3 spaces. This is a simple roll and move game from the late 1930's.&#10;&#10;Components for 1927 ed:&#10;16.25 x 16.5&quot; non-character specific game board&#10;5 die-cut thin cardboard full-color character playing pieces&#10;4-1/8 x 4-1/8&quot; separate spinner with large image of &quot;Kayo!&quot; &#10;set of character playing cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Happy Camper was inspired by John Conway's Game of Life. It can be played on any flat surface using any objects that can be arranged in a square grid.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two phase. In the first phase players start &quot;campsites&quot; with one &quot;camper&quot; (piece) each and then take turns adding one camper to their site and one to their opponent's. When all the campers have been used the second phase starts; the last player takes just one camper and places it in the opposing campsite. (The number of campers is odd; the rules suggest 11, 13, 15, or 17.)&#10;&#10;In the second phase players take turns removing a camper from their opponent's campsite and placing it in their own. The removed piece must have fewer than two or more than three neighbors, and must be placed in a space with exactly three neighbors.&#10;&#10;When neither player can move the game ends and the player with the high score wins. Three scoring variants are given: in the simplest each camper is worth one point, in the others the pieces have to have numbers on them (e.g. playing cards) which determine their point values. The numbered pieces can be used face-up or face-down, with players only able to look at them when they are moved.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Race to the moon and back as the United States of America and the Soviet Union compete for International prestige. The game starts in the late 1950's and spans 3 decades. It attempts to simulate the economy, the military, and the scientific community as they play crucial roles in the race to the moon. This is only a game but the events contained herein are real. You'll experience the frustrations of failure and the joys of success as we take you back in time into the Great Space Race.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game board depicts a track 30 spaces long. The object is to be the first player to get to the moon (space 30) and return back to Earth (space 1). The game also uses a deck of Launch Cards broken down into three groups reflecting events of the fifties, sixties, and seventies.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most reward money at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally an ancient Hindu game for children, Pulijudam is a two player strategy game free from elements of chance.  It is almost an abstract strategy game, but one of its alternative names, &quot;Lambs and Tigers&quot;, suggests the theme overlaid for children.&#10;&#10;Pulijudam is very similar to Bagh Chal and Fox and Geese - it is essentially a member of the Hnefatafl family of asymmetrical abstract games, although of very different origin.  One player uses three pieces representing tigers; the other player uses fifteen pieces representing lambs.  The initial placement of the three tigers is fixed.  The lamb player begins to place his fifteen lambs wherever they wish in the twenty remaining spaces on the board; neither side can move any pieces until all of that type have been placed.  Therefore the tigers may begin to move from the third turn while the lambs may only move from the fifteenth turn.&#10;&#10;Each piece may move to any vacant adjacent space on the board (effectively orthogonally).  Tigers may 'eat' lambs by jumping over an adjacent lamb into a vacant space beyond.&#10;&#10;The game is won when the tigers have captured all the lambs or the lambs have encircled the tigers preventing them from moving.&#10;&#10;",

This game is playable either as a 2-player or a 4-player game in two variations - an easier game with less options or more difficult (in a manner) with more options and restrictions on movement/opponent elimination.&#10;&#10;You basically roll two 6-sided dice and them can jump with one of your soldiers from the field numbered on either the first/second die to a field numbered on the second/first die.&#10;&#10;Example: you roll 2 and 6 and therefore you can jump from 2 to 6 or from 6 to 2 (you are not allowed to jump 2 to another 2 or 6 to another 6) if your soldier stands in a formation (2 soldiers on adjacent hexes). If you land on a square with your opponent, you eliminate him from the board. If your soldier stands as a single unit, he can only jump onto an adjacent hex (providing appropriate numbers have been rolled).&#10;&#10;There is also one general per side which can jump on any appropriately numbered hex even if he does not stand in a formation. He also has 2 (or just 1 in case of 4 players) &quot;Home hexes&quot; where no soldier can attack him unless all other soldiers of the general's side are dead already.&#10;&#10;When the enemy general is removed from game, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game there is an inner area which is used for elimination. The outer area is a no-fighting zone (cover).&#10;&#10;",

Either she adds a part to the caterpillar or she takes a petal of the color indicated on the dice. A flower is completed when all of the petals are of the same color or when they are all of different colors. Instead of taking a new petal, a player may also choose to move one from one flower to another.&#10;&#10;There is a minimum strategy to use in this game, so it's great for kids who love flowers.

    "Description": "Legens of the Track - 1,500 Metres&#10;&#10;Legends is our third simulation of the classic track event. First came The Metric Mile, much played both solo and as a multi-play and postal game. Legends is an 'eye-in-the-sky' game, the user is 'looking down' on the track with no more involvement than rolling the dice, consulting the Charts and keeping the Race Control Sheet up-dated. A few years ago Legends could not have been published, the demand was all for 'involvement' games, where the user's input had a definite effect on the outcome. The Sport of Kings, with its many small decisions all affecting the final outcome, is typical of that genre.&#10;&#10;The brief for Legends was for a non-involvement ATG simulation with races playable in 10-12 minutes, accurate as far as any mixed-era simulation can be, providing enough detail and stats. (split and final times) to keep the hard-core replay gamer happy and with a system that needed a minimum of book-keeping. With a simple but effective Track Display, one hundred ATG athletes who will run their races in the way they usually ran them in real life (but with ability to change race 'plans' if you wish) with times geared to 2007 standards, pace-makers, 'fast' and normal tracks, weather effects, race 'quality' effects and fitness levels.&#10;&#10;Legends will be an ideal vehicle for solo campaigns, enough 'going on' to keep the interest at a high level, fun to run races, and the chance to run a full season incorporating Grand Prix meetings, Olympics (or World Championships), world-record attempts and with a few minor meetings flung in to keep the mix flexible.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They have decided to organize a contest and send their naughty little house elves into an old mine to retrieve the magical golden egg of Eddenburg. The 1st elf to return to the Mine Entrance with the golden egg wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The hen that lays the golden eggs is protected by a giant and his body guards (a family of rock-hard ugly trolls). The giant and his bodyguards have been living in this same little mine shaft for over 300 years. Now as you can imagine the mine is really disgusting, there are germs everywhere, and not only germs but super germs. These super germs can cause diarrhea in house elves. As you can imagine it is hard for an elf to ride in the mine carts and sneak around quietly without their Pepto Bismo.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As far as combat the trolls certainly have an advantage over the elves in strength, but they are stupid and sometimes completely forget who they are and what they are. They begin to waddle and walk around in circles mumbling to themselves. If these trolls had a brain they would be really dangerous.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Another interesting aspect of trolls is that when they see an elf they drool, and when I say drool I really mean drool. Because of this it is really difficult for an elf to sneak around because they are tracking mucus around on the bottoms of their boots, not to mention it is really slippery. On the positive side when a troll captures a house elf and drools all over it, it can become very slippery and sometimes&#10;it can squirm and slip free.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Two other techniques house elves have learned that are effective against trolls. First, trolls can't stand elves that squeak and second, trolls are particularly self conscious when elves flash them.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Panzer Grenadier: Secret Weapons is a 64-page book supplement to the popular Panzer Grenadier series, looking at some of these laboratory products &mdash; all of which existed at least on the drawing board, and many of which actually saw service.&#10;&#10;Origins Award winning author John R. Phythyon Jr. tells of odd programs like Germany's super-heavy tanks &mdash; vehicles like the 180-ton Maus tank and the equally huge Tiger III. None of those actually saw combat, but the world's first anti-tank guided missile, the German X7, apparently did.&#10;&#10;Britain's huge tanks are also covered, with the slow and heavy Tortoise and the slow and heavy Black Prince. And there's the awesome Centurion, a design so solid it remains in service in some of the world's armies more than six decades later.&#10;&#10;Plus we have flying machines. There are German Fl.282 helicopters (in three versions), Fa.223 helicopters (also in three versions) and the huge Fa.284 helicopter. Plus the P.1003 tilt-rotor aircraft, ancestor of the modern-day Osprey. Finally, German jets make an appearance to lend close support, including the Me.1099 attack plane fitted with a 55mm automatic cannon.&#10;&#10;And there's more. The Americans get their Sikorsky R4 reconnaissance helicopter, while the Japanese receive the Ka-1 autogyro. For every Panzer Grenadier fan who's asked for weird science, this is exactly what you've wanted.&#10;&#10;",

For the three player game the third player dons the mantle of China. The four player game is based on WWII and each player controls either Japan, USSR, the Western Allies or the Axis Powers.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to grab a set number of economic 'points' and thus, dominate your opponents.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Solo card game using a regular deck of cards. Based on the Failure of the Spanish Armada to invade England in 1588. The Armada had 122 Ships. The English 66. The English sank 2 Spanish Ships and were able to disperse the Armada. The dispersed Armada drifted into the North Sea and had to circle around Ireland in treacherous weather to return home. On the journey home 39 transports foundered or ran aground.&quot;&#10;&#10;The deck is split into two halves, the red half (Spanish Armada) and the black half (English Squadrons). Each turn has two phases, a Straggler Phase and an Engagement Phase. The player must use his English raider ships to disperse Spanish stragglers, which are then placed in the player's Victory Pile. The victory conditions set the level of success or failure based on the number of cards in the Victory Pile after the Spanish Armada Deck has been exhausted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'Housing Drive' is a board game published by Pepys Games of London in the 1940's.&#10; 2-6 players race to complete a housing estate using the least government subsidy possible. Houses are built by, first, obtaining a &quot;Licence to Build&quot; and then blue, red and green counters, representing respectively Units of Labour, Units of Material and Units of Power.Players may trade counters to complete their housing estates. Each player is provided with a Playing Board representing a Housing Estate and indicating positions for the various pieces used during the game.&#10;&#10;In the 1940's this was a topical subject for a board game as the British government was replacing housing stock destroyed by the Luftwaffe and also trying to provide more 'Homes fit for heroes'&#10;&#10;The game is notable for the quality of its components - metal dice, counters, coins, good quality wooden houses and Playing Boards - at a time when rationing was still in place and raw materials were at a premium.&#10;&#10;At some time the box was enlarged, and the rules were subsequently enlarged from 2 to 3 pages. Parts of some rules were rewritten, and explanations of some rules expanded. Two new paragraphs were added at the end. One was headed, &quot;Housing Drive, Shorter Version&quot;. The other was headed &quot;Housing Drive, Simplified Version&quot;, described as &quot;a simple game for young children.&quot;&#10;&#10;A player who completes the game and has no Government Subsidy debited against him/her is the winner. If two players qualify, the one who has built the most houses wins. If all players have Government Subsidies debited against them, then &quot;the player whose Government Subsidy per House is the lowest is the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;Incidentally, the front of the game describes it as being for 2 to 8 players, although the rules and pieces are clearly for 2 to 6 players (e.g. there are only 6 playing boards). At some time a red sticker was placed on the enlarged box correcting the error.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the Confederates is to capture certain import areas including if possible such cities as Baltimore and Washington.&#10;&#10;The game itself uses a classic block game system. Strategic level play takes place on a point to point map of the Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside. Once combat is joined players will switch their counters to a battle board to conduct the tactical level combat.

The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.&#10;&#10;The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:&#10;&#10;-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.&#10;-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.&#10;-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.&#10;-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "StrataCards is a unique set of playing cards that let you play poker like a game of solitaire or with a group. Each deck contains 52 cards and 2 &quot;jokers&quot;, but instead of typical front and back faces, each side has multiple card faces printed on it. For this Texas Hold'em deck, the fronts show 2 card faces, and the backs show 3 card faces.&#10;&#10;The front of each card represents your two hole cards, and their value relative to other starting hands. There are also example flops labeled &quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, and &quot;The Nuts&quot;, and their value relative to other possible flops. Text descriptions include a standard name and a popular nickname for the hole cards, and the common slang for your made hands and draws.&#10;&#10;The back of each card represents three cards that would be a great flop for the starting hand on the front. The idea is that without looking at the front of the card, you can deduce a range of hole cards that might be on the front just by looking at the flop cards on the back. Turn and River cards are displayed by placing one card under another so that only one new card face is showing.&#10;&#10;This connection between the cards on the front and back lets you play and learn the game by yourself, or practice your hand reading skills in a game with others. Key points of the system are: starting hands and their values before and after the flop, learning the lingo that the professionals use to describe their hands, and good practice spotting bad beats, missed draws, pure bluffs, and the stone cold nuts.&#10;&#10;Game variations you can play with this deck include: Texas Holdem, Greek Holdem, Heads-Up Holdem Solitaire, Multi-Way Holdem Solitaire, Holdem Flash Cards, and Blind Man's Bluff.&#10;&#10;",

The first player places his playing piece on the starting space for ducks, if he has a duck, or on the starting space for cats, if he has a cat.  He then spins the big umbrella and moves his playing piece counterclockwise to the next space of the color indicated on the spinner.&#10;&#10;Cats can only move to spaces under umbrellas and ducks can only move to the rainy spaces.  For example, if a player who has a cat playing piece spins red, he can move forward, in this turn, only if the next red space is under an umbrella.  If it is not, he cannot move at all and must wait until his next turn.&#10;&#10;Play passes to the left, and players advance whenever they spin the color of a space to which they are allowed to move.  Whenever a player spins the color that matches the color on his playing piece, he may spin again.  A player must spin the correct color to land on Finish.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach Finish is the Winner.&#10;&#10;",

When it doesn't capture a piece, it merely moves as a Rook.&#10;&#10;The Arrow is the equivalent of the cannon but operates on the diagonals&#10;&#10;The board is played with a 'river'&#10;&#10;As a compromise with Chinese Chess, the Eurasian King may not cross the river.

    "Description": "Essentially, the objective of the game is to be the first player/team in a race to move all game pieces around the track and into a home path, while impeding the progress of the opposing players/team through strategic interference. Players move around the board, using cards dealt to them. Cards are clearly marked with alternate uses, increasing the available play options. A key component is that play pieces can be coupled, allowing the top player to take control of his opponent&rsquo;s play piece(s). Other forms of interaction include trading, uncoupling, switching control, and sending an opponent back to start again.&#10;&#10;",
