    "Description": "It's the dawn of the Livonian Crusade, and Estonia is being conquered by several nations. The Danish forces of Valdemar the Great are arriving from the West. The Crusaders, led by Bishop Albert, are crossing the borders from the South. Vsevolod, Prince of Novgorod, is attacking from the East. There's only one hope for Estonians: Lembitu, the leader, who is brave enough to fight against all the conquerors.&#10;&#10;Lembitu is a co-operative board game inspired by the events of the Livonian Crusade in Estonia. Players are in the role of generals, fighting against conquerers and initiating rebellions. Actions can be used for movement, fighting or uprisings &mdash; but as each player has only a limited number of actions, they must plan carefully. The direction and speed of enemy movement is decided by dice, but the enemy's ultimate goal is to reach Paide. If they don't reach it within a fixed amount of turns, the players win.&#10;&#10;",

The battle was fought from October 23-26 1944 as the US returned to the Philippines, landing on the island of Leyte. The US Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy fought a series of actions that collectively have been recorded as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The historical result was a decisive defeat of the Imperial Navy, virtually eliminating it as a viable force for the remainder of the war. For the US Navy, it was a victory that was almost squandered due to command problems.&#10;&#10;Each game turn is six hours; there are three day turns and one night turn for each calendar day. Each sea hex is approximately 25 nautical miles across. The game map is used for all Task Force movement and movement by air units. Two tactical displays are included, one for naval surface engagements and one for air attacks.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a number of units in his army, which is set depending on the faction they are playing. We call this combination of units a &ldquo;Combat Sword&quot;. Four factions are available for players:  Union of Terra, Centauri Brotherhood, Heimdall Industries and Ascaryan Infestation.&#10;&#10;Game pieces represent the units of troops and vehicles in each army. Pieces have two sides, &quot;Front&quot; (Illustration and Health marker) and &quot;Back&quot; (Name, Attributes and Skills). Some units grant X &quot;Command Points&quot; at the beginning of each player turn, and all units require a number of &quot;Command Points&quot; to be used that turn (which is known as &ldquo;Activating &rdquo; the unit). When all command points are spent, the opponent&rsquo;s turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are &ldquo;Move&rdquo;, &ldquo;Embark/disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use active skills&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units.

As a pirate captain, either as a full pirate with no allegiances or one with an allegiance to England, France, Spain, or the Netherlands, you control the fate of your pirate band while attempting to win the game by accumulating fame, infamy, and popularity. You do this through acquiring new ships to be part of your pirate fleet, attacking merchant ships (piracy), raiding ports, and trading booty seized in attacks on ships and ports for gold. There are also 1-4 &quot;AI&quot; pirates who have their own motivations and desire for fame/infamy and booty!&#10;&#10;The game consists of a map of the Caribbean with the famous ports of the era marked on it. These will have their own defense and trade values which are unique to each game played. The five players bid take a historical pirate card, which will have a unique ability and, for AI players, rules for how it behaves. Players secretly vote for an action and then carry out those actions: Piracy, Raiding ports, Building new ships, Trading.&#10;&#10;The game is especially suitable for solitaire play, and has optional rules to accommodate a fifth player, if required.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Defending England during the Battle of Britain.&#10;&#10;Tally-Ho! is a book-based solitaire air war game that puts you into the role of a Sector Controller during the Battle of Britain in the Summer of 1940. You direct Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons as you struggle to protect England from attack by incoming raids by the Luftwaffe &ndash; and in one mission, by the Italians. There are too many raiders, however, and too few RAF aircraft, yet you have one major advantage &ndash; England&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chain Home&rdquo; radar network.&#10;&#10;Fifteen individual missions are included in this book-based game. Each mission relates to one of the key aerial engagements of the Battle of Britain. Most missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. This is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war, but rather an entertaining educational tool that allows you to experience the story of the conflict through strategic decision-making set against a backdrop of the real history of the Battle of Britain &ndash; as if you were there.&#10;&#10;Tally-Ho! is designed for experienced and novice war gamers alike. It is quick and easy to play yet deeply challenging. Though dice do play a role, the outcome of each mission rests on your shoulders. Where you deploy your fighters, what orders you give, and what tactics you employ are the critical factors that determine the outcome of each mission. You decide which enemy squadrons to engage and how to prioritize each as you struggle with radio communications and the fog of war.&#10;&#10;Most of the time, you cannot stop the Luftwaffe. Bombs will fall. Airfields will be strafed. Convoys at sea will suffer. Your performance in each mission will affect the setup of subsequent missions by reducing or increasing the number of aircraft available to fly on each side. If you direct your squadrons skillfully, you might prevail and save England.&#10;&#10;The game is available on Amazon at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMSP4MXM/&#10;&#10;A boxed set of game assets is available through Blue Panther, which includes an add-on EXPANSION GAME called Operation Seel&ouml;we, is at:&#10;https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/tallyho&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When all ten goods are either stolen (and hidden away) or recovered by the police, the winner is the player who has stolen/recovered the most.&#10;&#10;A fairly straightforward roll and move game, but the pieces and quality of build makes this a better than normal game of this type.

The first team to get round the board once wins.&#10;&#10;Each team randomly draws three category tiles and arranges them on the board according to how knowledgeable they think they are in this particular area.

If they answer the question from their first category correctly, they score one point, two for the second, and three for the third. After a round has been completed (i.e. each team has been asked three questions), the category tiles are redrawn.&#10;&#10;Each team also has 3 switches on the board that they can activate once per round. One is labelled with a &quot;Z&quot;, the other two are labelled with a &quot;B&quot;. The &quot;Z&quot; switch allows a team to swap one of their categories with another team. The &quot;B&quot; switch allows a team to challenge the active team. If the active team can't answer their question but the challenging team can, they earn extra points (one if they used the switch after the question was asked, and three if they used it before even knowing the question). If the challenging team answers incorrectly, they lose one point.&#10;&#10;Main differences to the standard Bezzerwizzer game:&#10;&#10;- smaller, travel-friendly box, board and components&#10;- 1200 questions (instead of 5000)&#10;- 12 categories (instead of 20; multiple categories from the standard game were combined into one category)&#10;- each player/team gets three questions per round (instead of 4)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War for America: The American Revolution, 1775-1782 is a strategic game based on the events during the American Revolution. It is a 2 player game that shows how the conflict, which began as a &lsquo;civil war&rsquo; turned into a World conflict with a Great Britain that was greatly isolated. It features a new &lsquo;Action Pulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;Initiative System&rsquo; that keeps every turn of variable length and new. Game design by Gilbert Collins.&#10;&#10;The Colonial player must build a &lsquo;Continental Army&rsquo; to battle with the British in order to prevent any sister colony from being overrun. This is going to take time and he must &lsquo;hold on&rsquo; and try to defeat a major British force, to impress the old enemies of Great Britain.&#10;&#10;The game is played at the Grand Strategic level and each strength point equals 1,000 men or less. Players will assemble forces to seize control of colonies and regions. When French recognition is achieved, during 1778, an entire new dimension is added to the conflict. France, Spain and the Netherlands will bring fleets into the waters of North America and the Caribbean, challenging Britain&rsquo;s mastery of the seas.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the popular &lsquo;point to point&rsquo; movement system but more carefully modelling the geography of North America. This is done by enhancing the movement of armies along the important water shed basins. Armies are not destroyed in single combat as many past games have shown, but will demonstrate realistic casualty figures with prevalent retreat and disruption results.&#10;&#10;War for America attempts to show the conflict from the British perspective and how a &lsquo;rebellion&rsquo; turned into a World War. Great Britain is alone, without allies, but the Colonies don&rsquo;t have it easy either. Despite their inexperience and individual identities, they must come together to create and maintain a Continental army. This is a &lsquo;large game&rsquo; but also contains a shorter scenario starting in 1778, taking about half the time to play.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;        Complexity: Medium&#10;        Time Scale: Seasonal turns (6 turns per year)&#10;        Map Scale: Area point-to-point map&#10;        Unit Scale: 1,000 men per strength point, individual capital ships, and leaders&#10;        Players: 2&#10;        Solitaire: Medium/High&#10;        Playing Time: 8 hours (15+ hours for Campaign Game)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        2 Map sheets&#10;        2.5 Countersheets of 9/16&quot; and 5/8&quot; unit-counters (432 counters total)&#10;        6 Player Aid Cards&#10;        1 Sequence of Play Card&#10;        2 Army Organization Displays&#10;        1 Setup Card&#10;        51 Action Cards&#10;        1 Rulebook&#10;        1 Playbook&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Moscow&quot; is a two-player World War II wargame covering the advance of Army Group Center, Autumn 1941. It is a simulation of the campaign by the Germans to capture Moscow from the Soviets from October until January 1941. This wargame&rsquo;s system is a progeny of the foregoing &quot;Leningrad&quot; wargame published by Decision Games (2010) with some slight differences (such as the stacking limit). Players whom are familiar with the &quot;Leningrad&quot; wargame will be able to play this wargame with only a perusal of these rules where they are specifically relevant to &quot;Moscow&quot;. Each hex represents 30 miles with each unit representing a division and in some cases brigades.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #317&#10;&#10;",

Be the first to reach the enemy headquarters or control more territories than your opponent.&#10;&#10;On your turn in Toy Battle, you either draw two toy troops or place a troop on the board and apply its effect. When a place a troop, you can place it on an empty base, a base that you control, a base that the enemy controls with a lower-valued troop than the one you're placing, or the enemy's headquarters; however, in all cases you must place on a location that has a continuous path to your own headquarters through bases that you occupy, that is, that have your troop on top. If you occupy bases that form a continuous path around a region, you claim the medals within this region. (You don't lose these medals if the enemy later occupies one of these bases.)&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as you occupy your opponent's headquarters or win the required number of medals based on the current game board. If a player cannot draw or place a troop, the game ends, and whoever has the most medals wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The challenges are chosen randomly, and the players can score points in all of these games. After the predetermined number of challenges &ndash; five for a 45-50 minute game, ten for a 75-90 minute game, fifteen for a 100-120 minute game &ndash; has been played, the player/team with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Can be combined with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Schlag den Raab: Das Spiel&#10;    Schlag den Raab: Das 2.

If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap&quot;, is a two-player, intermediate-complexity simulation of the fighting in eastern North Korea in late 1950 in which the Chinese attacked the United Nation&rsquo;s X Corps as it approached the Yalu River. One of the more famous incidents of the campaign was the US Marine Corps 1st Division fighting its way out of an envelopment at the Chosin Reservoir. Chosin, designed by Joseph Miranda, covers the entire campaign using the same game system as Gauntlet, which appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics 190. The two games are compatible, and the Strategic Scenario included in this issue provides instructions, as well as extra units, to create a combined Chosin/Gauntlet game of the entire Chinese offensive of 1950. Players can also use the Chosin rules and charts to update Gauntlet.&#10;&#10;Each game turn equals one day. Each hex represents 2.5 miles (four kilometers). Units of maneuver are mostly UN regiments and brigades of 1,500 to 5,000 men, while each Communist divisional counter represents about 6,000 to 24,000 men. Each air UN unit represents 30 to 50 sorties. There are 280 NATO-style, small-size (half-inch) counters, including errata-fix replacements for Gauntlet.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover: naval gunfire support, aerial combat operations, air transport, aerial supply, naval supply and troop transport, limited intelligence, bridge destruction and repair, fog of war, meeting engagements, organizational integrity, entrenchments, partisans, special forces, combat engineers, and the possibility of atomic warfare. The short scenario will take two experienced players about four to six hours to complete.&#10;&#10;Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #257  Jul/Aug 2009.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2.5 mile / 4 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Chosin rules booklet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours&#10;&#10;",

It is an operational wargame recreating on the battalion level the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon in June 1941. This game has been built around two basic situations: the historical invasion and a hypothetical one, covering the chance of German intervention. In both cases it remains a two player wargame with each player alternately moving his pieces and resolving combat in succession. Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.&#10;&#10;Drive on Damascus uses a peculiar hexagon grid game map in which only the central dot of each hex is depicted.&#10;British forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.&#10;&#10;This wargame can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).&#10;&#10;Published 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     Syria, 1941&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 23 x 32&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)&#10;Player will have to provide one 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

Beautiful, glowing swarms of fireflies may be released only from the highest towering platforms in the city during the upcoming summer solstice. Six different guilds reside in the city, and they will do everything possible to build their own tree as high as possible in each district. As chief of your district, each round you decide which guild you want to support in your part of the city as you want to lure the spectators to your show on festival day and to send as many brightly-glowing fireflies to freedom as possible.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the guilds are represented by a deck of 108 cards, with each of the six guilds appearing 18 times. To set up, deal three cards face up to each player, grouping those cards in columns by color. Lay out five cards face up to form the market. Place the game-ending firefly festival card twenty cards up from the bottom of the deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes all the cards of one color from the market or one card of each color that appears only once in the market; they then add these cards to their collection. If you already have cards of that color, you place the new cards upward in a column so that everyone can see how many cards you have; if you don't have this color, place cards of the new color to the left or right of your current columns. Then refill the market. When the firefly festival card is revealed, end the game after each player has taken the same number of cards.&#10;&#10;To score, look at each column of cards in your collection and compare the number of cards in it to the number of cards in the columns to the left and right. (For the columns on the outer edge of your collection, you compare their height to the height of your neighbor's closest column and the adjoining column in your collection.) For each column, if it's at least as tall as each column adjacent to it, you score points equal to the number of cards in that column. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Two cards are shown at a time. Who will be the first to think of a movie set In the Future that Contains Foreshadowing? If you come up with a name that players agree satisfies both cards, you win the oldest of the two cards, and a new card is added. So now the challenge might be to find a title that Contains Foreshadowing and has a Dance Sequence. And so on. If everyone is stumped you add a third card, and they must find a title that satisfies two of the three cards. Six to ten points (cards) are needed to win, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players choose which of the four racetracks will be used for the game. Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.&#10;&#10;Eight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.&#10;&#10;After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.&#10;When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds. The winners win what the losers lost. That makes Across the Board unique among horse racing games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The story of the Picrocholine Wars is one of the most well-known passages of the novel Gargantua, written by Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais in 1534. Using a brawl between shepherds and millers as a pretext, Picrochole, King of Lerne, declared war on Gargantua's father, Grandgousier. A model of the enlightened monarch of the Renaissance, Grandgousier attempted to avert war by all means. But Picrochole, taking this as a sign of Grandgousier's weakness, invaded his neighbor's kingdom. Grandgousier calls upon his son, and Gargantua, at the head of an army of his loyal companions, inflicts a humiliating defeat on Picrochole, who flees on the back of a donkey.&#10;&#10;The Picrocholine Wars simulates this celebrated episode of French literature through a fun and simple wargame. Players will find and discover in this game all of the events that gave the novel parodying the chivalric tomes of the era its charms: the giant Gargantua, of course, and his friends Gymnast and Fr&egrave;re Jean, but also the cheating Picrochole and his lieutenants.&#10;&#10;Though it has its &quot;rabelaisien&quot; side, The Picrocholine Wars is a balanced game in which each camp has its own distinct strengths and during which players will have to adopt the role of both the attacker and the defender. The Picrocholine Wars combines gaming pleasure with culture and history, and is ideal for initiating new players into wargaming.&#10;&#10;",

The wooden hunters have colored hats to denote their hunting clubs. There is also a wooden hare and a wooden bush.&#10;&#10;The hare is placed in the center of the hexagonally shaped board, and the hunters around the edges. &#10;The board is eleven spaces across, from one point of the hexagon to its opposite, so none of the hunters&#10;start very close to the hare. Each player draws a club card, denoting which color hunters are his own. This&#10;is kept secret from the other players. The first player then rolls the dice and the game begins.&#10;&#10;The 6-side dice are labeled Blank, 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4. If a 2,3 are rolled, for example, the player whose turn it is decides whether that means he moves two hunters up to three spaces each, or three hunters up to two spaces each. For one movement point, a hunter can either move one space directly forward (they all have little rifles which should point to one space at all times - that's the only direction they can shoot or move) or it can rotate 60 degrees. A player can move a hunter of any color he chooses - no one knows which hunters are whose, and since the object is to shoot all the opponents' hunters and not your own, you don't necessarily want to move your own, anyway. Except maybe to throw the others off track about which color is yours ...&#10;&#10;When all movement is done, check to see if any hunter is aiming at the hare. If so, roll the dice again, this time adding the numbers together to see how far a shot goes. If you get blank, blank, a gun blows up (remove a hunter). If you shoot far enough to hit the hare exactly, it blithely moves out of the way instead of being hit. If you roll the exact distance between two hunters, they shoot each other (if both aiming at the hare -- otherwise, only the one not aiming at the hare is shot) - remove the hunters. If you roll a number greater than the distance between two hunters, one of them dies - take your pick.&#10;&#10;",

Your fellow guild members look to you for leadership after fleeing the devastation, and you feel the incredible weight of that responsibility. Your beloved guild is a shadow of its former glory and despair threatens to overwhelm you. But you are determined and begin to plan your strategy to reclaim your homeland.&#10;&#10;In Alynthia&rsquo;s cooperative mode, a horde of Dragons has just destroyed the cities of Alynthia and built deadly Nests atop their ruins. You are among the survivors who have united to free Alynthia from the Dragons, so you take your turns simultaneously. You must band together to retake the land by defeating all Nests before the end of round 5. Don&rsquo;t wait too long - starting in round 2, if you don&rsquo;t defeat at least 1 Nest per round, Alynthia will fall.&#10;&#10;In the competitive mode, it has been years since Alynthia was first decimated by the Dragons. They still roam the land, but they are fewer in number and much less deadly. The time has come to turn your attention to other matters. You are competing against your fellow guild leaders to become the new leader of Alynthia, so you take your turns individually. To win, have the most Renown by the end of round 5, securing the support of the people.&#10;&#10;Whether you like working together, fighting your friends, or playing alone, Alynthia lets you play the way you want while seamlessly transitioning between modes. The diverse set of abilities and guilds plus a semi-modular board also ensures that each game will be different. Build outposts, slay dragons, and conquer the land as you seek to win the hearts of the people and lead them on the path to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Take command of the included 120 highly detailed sculpted miniatures and battle to save the world, but be careful, players who fight by your side in one round may be at your throat in the next, because in V-Wars, the virus is always spreading.&#10;&#10;V-Wars begins as a co-operative game, but shifts as players reveal themselves to be vampires or the virus takes hold in infected players and forces them to change sides mid-game.&#10;&#10;In V-Wars, the vampires are trying to infiltrate the world's governments, taking over human cities while simultaneously attempting to sway public sympathy to recognize them as victims of a viral outbreak, not just cold-blooded killers. Meanwhile, the humans are trying to stem the vampire tide, fighting back against their covert attacks and outright rebellions.&#10;&#10;The vampires win immediately when they've reached a balance of city control and public sympathy to a point where their Victory marker and Sympathy markers reach each other on the Vampire Victory track or, alternatively, engage in a holding action long enough to exhaust all Player cards. Humans win by placing six cities under Martial Law in different regions of the world or if the vampires' Sympathy tokens are reduced to zero on the Vampire Victory track.&#10;&#10;",

The US First Army commenced the new offensive on 26 September, but formidable German defenses stalled the operation within four days. The drive resumed after a few days of reorganization, this time supported by over 300 tanks and 500 aircraft. Steady progress was made until the attackers encountered the depth of the Argonne, one of the densest forests in France. It would be a tough slog until the Americans broke into the open.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map&#10;&bull;    100 die-cut counters&#10;&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;Skills:&#10;&bull;    Level: Division&#10;&bull;    Hex:  .25 miles (.402 km)&#10;&#10;",

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.&#10;&#10;1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.&#10;&#10;2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.&#10;&#10;Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn is a Dark Fantasy strategic and tactical wargame. Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.&#10;&#10;Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to have all 4 things (booze, snax, smokes, and dope) in their stash and play a SUMMON card at the Altar wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each dumpster is different, and some more dangerous. Digging deeper can yield more rewards, but it&rsquo;s also askin&rsquo; for trouble. This town is lousy with cops, and the nefarious garbage critters known as Trashlings are waiting in the shadows to swipe your beautiful junk. Even your fellow street urchins might just get wasted and jump you if your stash is lookin&rsquo; a little too tempting. If you run out of HP, you're dead. Players must carefully manage their turns and constantly be on the move (and on their guard) as they booze, scrap, panhandle, and race to be the first to summon the TRASH LORD (peace be upon him).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the Decision Games web site:)&#10;&#10;Luftwaffe is an update of the classic Avalon Hill game covering the US strategic bombing campaign over Europe in World War II. As the US commander, your mission is to eliminate key German industrial complexes. You select the targets, direct the bombers, and plan a strategy intended to keep the Luftwaffe off-balance. As the German commander, the entire arsenal of German aircraft is at your disposal against the finest in Allied designs. Turns are quarterly, with German reinforcements keyed to that player's production choices. Units are wings and squadrons, and they're rated by type, sub-type, firepower, maneuverability and endurance. There are rules for radar, electronic warfare, variable production strategies, aces, target complexes, critical industries and diversion of forces to support the ground war. Beyond that, the original, classic game system remains essentially sound and hasn't otherwise been changed much. Most of the upgrade was in adding in additional rules, revising the order of battle, and adding more deployment and industrial options.&#10;&#10;The reverse side of the units now represents a condition of loss of effectiveness, rather than loss of material strength. That's due to a combination of factors: damage to aircraft, an infusion of novice pilots, or to veteran crews suffering combat fatigue. Historically, pilot training and morale were critical factors, and the game now shows that. Replacement points represent not only new aircraft but also logistical support, rest and relaxation time for aircrews, all of which are used to restore fatigued units to good morale. Fatigued units count the same as veterans for stacking on the assumption that a shot up or novice unit would be more difficult to coordinate in the air.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle are much the same as in the original game, though the German player now has to plan ahead if he wants to get jets. We added a US P-61 unit. While P-61s were historically used mostly as night fighters, the USAAF based two groups in France and used them as intruders, so they can be useful in attacking German airbases. The Americans also get a &quot;Droop-Snoot&quot; P-38. They were P-38s that had their guns replaced with a bombardier and were used as light bombers. While only a small number were built, they were effective as bomber-leaders, so they're included in this edition.&#10;&#10;The German player can now increase his ability to stack by expending fuel points, representing training pilots in large-unit formation tactics. The US player doesn't need to do that, since they had a much bigger training base as well as unlimited fuel. Since the Germans now get additional oil, owing to a more historic evaluation of the Ploesti fields, they can maintain an effective fighter defense as long as they can preserve that reserve of fuel.&#10;&#10;There are also other new targets on the map, such as the Germans' power generation grid. In the original game the US player had to bomb all the targets on the map to win. Given the way the victory point system now works, the Americans need bomb about four out of the five major target systems to win, thereby duplicating the historic result.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are the dashing adventurer Maxx Delver, currently exploring the long-hidden Temple of the Sun. The temple is filled to the brim with trinkets and traps, but you're most interested in the four royal jewels said to lie within.&#10;&#10;The temple you&rsquo;re raiding is shaped like a closed loop (i.e., a donut), and the top card represents your physical location within it. On each turn, you &quot;move&quot; through the temple, always forward, by moving cards from the top to the bottom of the deck. You can choose to explore (use a number card in either the top of the deck or second-from-the-top to move as many cards as its value from the top of the deck to the bottom), look around (turn over two top cards IF the top card is currently not revealed), mark a path (place the top card from the deck in a reserve pile, IF it is a number card), or return to a marked path (return a card from the reserve pile to the top of the deck).  Exploring and landing on a treasure makes you LOOT it, both adding to your score and thinning the deck to increase the density of traps (face-up court cards)! If exploration ever results in wandering into a trap, it's game over. You win once you get all four jewels and land on the exit.&#10;&#10;Loot the Loop is a solo adventure game playable in-hand with a deck of regular playing cards, inspired by other in-hand games such as Maiden's Quest and Palm Island, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From publisher:&#10;VOID is an exciting miniature tabletop battle system for 2 or more players. The game is set in a universe where the human home worlds of Viridia, Ironglass and Prime battle for colonies in the farthest reach of the galaxy. A fourth power, VASA, is the policing body of panhumanic space. It protects the interstellar space lanes and attempts to arbitrate between the ambitious and imperialistic home worlds. With the recent emergence of the alien Koralon race it remains to be seen whether humanity can put aside its petty rivalries and avoid falling victim to this new threat. &#10;VOID is a fast paced skirmish game, with the emphasis placed on enjoyable free flowing game play. It uses a unit-by-unit activation system that encourages strategic use of supporting troops, and prevents the game from becoming mired in hour-long turns. The game mechanics are clear and concise, allowing you to fight games ranging from very small skirmishes with only a few miniatures, to massive battles using hundreds of miniatures. Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.&#10;&#10;The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.&#10;&#10;A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID. The models are manufactured in lead-free white metal and polyester resin. The range includes basic troops for the armies, support figures and characters, and larger kits such as the Tiger APC, a huge four-legged walking vehicle.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented By Void 2.0&#10;&#10;",

Players earn fame by recruiting the town's citizens to complete tasks, construct new buildings, and hunt tentacles!&#10;&#10;You and the other players take turns recruiting citizens to build the town, all while defending your new home from the tentacle threat. New citizens can complete a task or build a building for you. The more buildings you have in a district, the more profitable some tasks become &mdash; AND the player with the most buildings in each district earns extra fame when the game ends.&#10;&#10;Tentacle Town is divided into three districts: the market, the foundry, and the docks. Each district has its own tasks to be completed, from forging harpoons in the foundry to butchering food at the docks. The rewards for some tasks get better when there are more citizens are in the district, which means the new citizen you just recruited will benefit the other players, too! Likewise, the rewards for some tasks improve when there are more buildings to the district &mdash; but for these tasks, only you benefit from your own buildings. You may also pay the citizens of Tentacle Town overtime to complete additional tasks, assuming you have coins to spend.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they roll the danger die to see if the tentacles attack, stay quiet, or if more tentacles emerge from the depths. The more citizens in a district, the more likely the tentacles are to attack! When tentacles attack, they may destroy buildings, kill citizens, or cause the workers to flee to a safer district! This is your chance to be a hero and defend the district, provided you have some harpoons handy! Defeat a tentacle, and you'll not only earn a bit of fame and haul in some fresh calamari, too!&#10;&#10;When the influx of new citizens runs out, the game is over and the person with the most fame becomes the mayor of Tentacle Town and wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Since you're a god you decide whether to send defeated cards to the Heaven discard tray or the Hell discard tray. The scale tracks how many defeated enemies have been sent to Heaven or Hell. Tip the scales and open the gates of Hell or Heaven. When the gates of Heaven are open, you can more easily summon angels from The Beyond to fight for you. The same is true for Hell and demons.&#10;&#10;Before playing, each player selects two god powers and factions. God powers are special abilities that break the rules and factions are the cards that make up each player's deck, such as vampires, knights, wolves, merchants, farmers, giants, shepherds, or thieves.&#10;&#10;",
