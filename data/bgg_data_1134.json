    "Description": "&quot;Taiyo, the life energy that passes through all living beings. Flowing through the body, it allows the daily tasks of a farmer to be completed swiftly, and the strikes of a warrior to be strong and just. The Sohei are said to be able to use their Taiyo to levitate above the trees. Meanwhile, we sages of the Great Temple can move an object through the fabric of the world, breaking the teachings of time and being.The Great Masters use their power to help the people, and seek enlightenment.&#10;&#10;But I fear others will use it to oppress, and kill.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;- Sage Yamasakura of the Great Temple.&#10;&#10;A Skirmish miniatures game for 2 to 4 players, Taiy&#197;&#141; Dynasties takes place in an alternate history Feudal Japan where humans never existed and beastmen took their place. As a third great war looms over the nation of Hanani, Taiy&#197;&#141;, the magical life force that flows through all things, has been harnessed by the clans and warriors of the land. As tensions grow between the Wafuto Imperial Army and the oppressed Atsuda clans, warlords and vagrant ronin alike seek to unlock the mysterious powers of Taiy&#197;&#141;, and turn the tides of battle in their favour.&#10;&#10;This box includes everything you need to play a two person game; Taiy&#197;&#141; Dynasties is a skirmish-scale wargame, and uses very few models - keeping everything quick and easy, from the painting to the playing.&#10;&#10;Rules and resources for the game are presented on cards, all included in the box, and decisive actions are decided through simple six-sided dice rolls. Coins are used to add resource management mechanics to the game, and lend the game a degree of tactical depth that can keep even the most competitive wargamers coming back for more.&#10;&#10;Players can choose their warbands from the unique clans and factions of Hanani, and with their forces they will wage war for land, riches and honour. With the clash of katanas, the whistling of arrows and the incantations of ancient magic, ancestral enemies settle age-old grudges and new rivalries are born among new recruits in glorious moments.&#10;&#10;The land of Hanani is torn apart by the War of the Falling Petal, and all must choose a side; Ally yourself with the  Wafuto Imperial Army and crush your enemy with superior steel, or take up arms with the Atusda Vanguard and defend the holy sites of your ancestors with guerrilla tactics. Take the vows of the Akira yakuza, and cut deals and establish yourself within the crime syndicates operating right under the shogunate's nose. Meanwhile, the Reputan Trade Federation is open to those of a mercenary leaning, who would seek riches and treasures on the high seas, indifferent to the ideologies driving the War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But the emperor will be weakened if the number of cards in the hand is less than three. So in this game it is important to keep replenishing your hand moderately, by drawing from a common deck where enemy and ally cards are mixed.&#10;&#10;A player cannot take an enemy's card into their hand, so it must be discarded if drawn. Otherwise, you can freely add your own country or affiliation card to your hand or put it into play. Also, cards placed on the battlefield can be drawn like a deck, and if it is not the enemy's country, it is added to the hand.&#10;&#10;A player will play tactically and try to bluff their opponent, and reduce the enemy's hand, forcing their emperor into defeat.&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

They can meld sets, and also meld runs in the same suit. They also discard a card from their hands at the end of their turn. As in 500 Rummy, the discards are overlapped and any number of cards can be taken from the pile instead of from the draw deck.&#10;&#10;However, things are not so simple. For example, if Caesar debases the currency, any gold cards that have been melded are removed from play. This will prevent every 3-card meld with a gold card from scoring.&#10;&#10;The other three Caesar cards require additional interesting thought-processes throughout each round of play -- and there is no telling which will appear, or when!&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 100 points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They will now be able to do both... and you guessed it... with the same deck of cards. While playing KABURA you will no longer need two versions of your deck, the deck you have online will be the same deck you have in your hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Both had to give up to part of their lives to build a brand new future where they are the only masters of their destiny.&#10;&#10;Fiddler left her native Ariadna after a clash with the authorities because of her strong activism. She sought shelter in a nomadic trade mission that offered her asylum in exchange for her engineering skills. There, she was able to transform her physical appearance and switch gender, but soon afterwards she felt the need to go further and take her modifications to a whole new level. Fiddler found in Aristeia! the best way to finance the physical changes that made her a lethal fighter on the sand.&#10;&#10;Thanks to her Jackbots, Fiddler is a DPS with a touch of control that can be used both offensively (causing damage) and defensively (making it difficult to access the scoring zones).&#10;&#10;Gaia is originally from Varuna. From a very early age, Gaia showed off her skills in robotics that led her to be a model student during her formative years. No one was surprised when she was the elected candidate to enjoy a scholarship in NeoTerra. Quite soon afterwards, she managed to draw the attention of the high spheres, who invited her to fight in Aristeia.&#10;&#10;Gaia is a controller support that offers her team unprecedented mobility. She can also control her Enemies, hindering or nullifying their ability to move through her Gorgoneions.&#10;&#10;In addition, this expansion brings a totally new mechanics for the Controllers and their Minions, their robotic devices that allow them to take their skills to the new level.

For all player counts the setup is identical. There is a four by four grid of tiles with the divers on the four center spots and the sharks on the outside. For the basic game only the four sharks in the corners are hungry (hungry side face up). In turn order players place cards to either move the divers, the sharks or the shark cage. The cards come in four color variants - on each side of the grid only cards of the same color can be played. In the beginning you can place any color on any side. Later on, if a color is already present at one side, cards of the same color must be played on that side. If the third card is placed on a side, the sharks on that side attack. Unless a player is protected by a shark cage or by playing a harpoon as a reaction, the shark succeeds. If this is the first successful attack, the diver tile is flipped. If it is already flipped, this player loses and all the other players - and the sharks - win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players are buying fish at auction, storing them in their warehouses, and then selling them to local restaurants.&#10;&#10;On each turn, one player rolls four dice, corresponding to the four types of fish in the game, and places some or all of these up for auction. In real-time, the other players bid an amount of money they would pay for these fish. The auctioneer can choose to accept the highest bid or pay that bid themselves. Money from the auction is paid to either the auctioneer or the highest bidder, and can be paid by fixed value money cards, bartered with fish, or both. If the money card(s) paid from one player to another player are larger than the bid, no change is provided.&#10;&#10;In each game, five restaurants are available for selling fish to. These are double sided and chosen randomly each game. Any players who gained fish from an auction in a turn are able to sell fish to the restaurants. Each player has a number of &quot;employee cubes&quot; used to track the amount of each type of fish in their warehouses, and when selling to a restaurant, one of these employees is removed from the warehouse and used to mark the income the player will receive from the restaurant at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game will end when a predetermined number of employee cubes have been placed on a restaurant. The player with the most money wins, and this is a combination of the money cards in hand, fish remaining in warehouses, and income received from the restaurants.&#10;&#10;The designer's family lives in Matsuyama, a city with some ports including Mitsuhama, and the painting on the cover of the box is one of the port made by his grandfather.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the &lsquo;War to end all wars&rsquo;, there came another war. And it was not as static as the first. Before and during World War 2 many nations and individuals invented or exploited new tactics and ideas, that even culminated in a range of specialist forces within the specialist forces. Marines and airborne infantry were known concepts, and often from within these groups of soldiers new tactical formations emerged to perform what we now call Special Operations.&#10;HBG is proud to present the Special Operations Forces &copy; Expansion. Special Operations Forces were small sized units not suitable for capturing land zones. Instead their small size and unique training made them specialists in raiding operations and sabotage. They were versatile in ways of damaging enemy supply lines, facilities, fighting partisans and even occasional assassinations of high profile enemy personalities as well as spearheading large scale amphibious attacks. This type of warfare often meant certain death if caught.&#10;This expansion enables you to take control of your nation&rsquo;s special forces, often entering at the historical date of formation, and maneuver them behind enemy lines to wreak havoc or pave the way for your troops on the front. But remember, the risky nature of the operations can have them eliminated before they can fullfill their mission. It is time; &ldquo;Nunc aut nunquam!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Troopers: Lost Station is a tactical level futuristic combat solo/co-op game pitting advanced Soldiers against alien-like creatures attacking in swarms. In a solo game, the player controls all Soldiers while the game system controls the Geno forces; in a two-player game, the control of every Soldier is distributed evenly among players. Optional rules allow an additional player to take control of the Genos for an even higher challenge for the Soldiers player(s).&#10;&#10;Four categories of Soldiers are available including the average Privates, the higher-skilled Sergeant, and two specialized units: the Gunner wielding a Heavy Machinegun and the Pyro with his Flamer. Additional equipment such as hand grenades and motion detector-based sights are also available.&#10;&#10;Geno opponents exist in only one category. They only have melee attacks, but they make up for it with overwhelming numbers and high speed.&#10;&#10;The board is made of square tiles chosen randomly and added to the game as the Soldiers progress in the complex overrun by the Genos. Many of these tiles include special conditions such as various hazards, temporarily blocked paths or even Geno ambushes, but also random items like additional ammo or body armor and other equipment to increase the odds of your Soldiers' survival.&#10;&#10;The game ends when surviving Soldiers reach the Exit tile. If all Soldiers get killed by the Genos, the player(s) lose(s).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The time then allowed for each decision is determined by drawing a time card. Random events are rolled for before each discussion.&#10;&#10;After all decisions are recorded someone goes through something like a paragraph-based game using the decisions, random events, and luck points (which were accumulated earlier). This eventually leads to a result paragraph which tells the participants how they did. A similar but simpler process is used to resolve how each player did on their personal agenda.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are provided:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Executives at Ford in 1968 planning a new small car model.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Executives at an imaginary technology company in 1992 planning a new CD-ROM drive.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;These dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.&#10;&#10;Aviary expansions&#10;&#10;Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled!&#10;&#10;Automa deck for solo players&#10;&#10;The 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points.&#10;&#10;You will play against a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself.&#10;&#10;The automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration&#10;&#10;The automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!&#10;&#10;",

(That&rsquo;s how cats meow in Turkish) is a &quot;Fishing Card Game&quot; for 2-4 players (4-player games can also be played in partnership) in which, cat breeders compete against each other by breeding the most kittens, preferably purebreds.&#10;&#10;In alternating turns, the players breed cats and put them in front of themselves making a stack.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to collect as many pairs as possible. Players are only able to see the topmost cat in their stack, so they must try to remember which cats they have already paired. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Miyav! was in 2019 54-Card Game Design Contest and the results as follows:&#10;&#10;Best Graphic Design: 2nd Place&#10;Best Cooperative Game: 3rd Place&#10;Best Artwork: 3rd Place&#10;Best 2 Player Game: 4th Place&#10;Best Overall Game: 6th Place&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You&rsquo;ve settled into the new world. There are countless islands to explore and treasures to seek in these uncharted waters. Go out there and make your fortune, but beware, you&rsquo;re not the only one out there seeking their fortune. Pirates are scouring the waters looking to claim what you&rsquo;ve found, sea creatures lurk in the deep ready to devour you, and your fellow privateers could either help you, or steal your booty for their own purpose. These are lawless and dangerous waters, and you must be prepared for anything. Will you find the treasure you seek, or will you meet your doom? Adventure awaits!&#10;&#10;Each player takes a turn to explore into new tiles, sail through existing tiles, or remain on their current tile and try to get as much treasure as they can. They can find treasure on islands, while diving, after defeating pirates or sea creatures, or even by attacking other players! When players draw a tile while exploring, they place it in any free space adjacent to their ship and move there immediately. There are five special types of tiles that can be drawn: Islands (where you'll find the majority of your treasure), Diving Locations (you need a diving bell to access them), Pirates (the scourge of the seven seas), Sea Creatures (mythical beasts wanting to destroy your ship and eat your crew), and Shops (places to upgrade your ship and crew). The first player to get to 100 treasure in their stash wins the game!&#10;&#10;Buried Treasure is a world building, open world sandbox game that is built as the players take their turn. Instead of using a standard playing board, players build the game board by drawing tiles when they explore the world. If the tiles are ever used up, players can still sail throughout the map trying to find more treasure on islands, by diving, and attacking pirates/sea creatures/other players. Outfitting your ship and crew allows you to specialize your ship to be better at attacking, exploring, defense, or speed. We've also added in storms which can rip parts off of your ship and throw you and other players in range of the storm off course. You never know what to expect when you play this game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Most of the cards in the deck are number cards that go from 1 to 19. Starting with a hand of three cards, each turn you play a card, and based on the orientation you play it in the next player has to play either a higher or lower number. If you play two consecutive numbers you can decide which orientation the next player has to use. If it's your turn and you can't play a card you get one point, and at two points you win the game.&#10;&#10;There are also three &quot;Stair Lover&quot; cards with special powers. Each player gets one randomly at the start of the game. The Dark Stairs can always be played, which means you can't win while you're holding them, but the Ghost Story Teller card allows you to give the Dark Stairs to your opponent. The Glico Man lets you swap the most recently played stairs with the first ones played in the round. Finally, the Old Person card lets you ignore the effects of a pair of consecutive cards if one of them is a &quot;slope&quot; card with a red border.&#10;&#10;Can you outwit your opponent on the stairs?&#10;&#10;The game also includes a Stair Encyclopedia with details of the stairs photographed for the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Nearby choristers can immediately pick up his chanting, increasing the effect.&#10;&#10;On an individual level, the Choir of Nightmares is composed of rather weak units, but they strengthen and support their allies thanks to their blasphemous prayers.&#10;&#10;Well used, their effects can change the tide of a battle, yet the choirmaster needs protection &ndash; without him, it&rsquo;s impossible to chant.

Now check the conversion percentage of the team to see how many hits become runs: roll a percentage die (two ten sided dice of different colors, one of them for the  tens digits, the other for the single digits) for each hit and if the roll is equal or below the percentage factor, it become a run, otherwise not.&#10;&#10;Repeat the procedure for the opposing team and you'll have the final result for the game.

Each player has a hand of twelve cards and tries to work towards a winning hand. Hands are formed based on the sequence of red and black cards in your hand, so you can't freely rearrange the order of your cards. The other catch is that you draw cards two at a time, insert them next to each other, and always discard two adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring follows this rule: a set is a sequence of N cards starting from one edge of your held cards, followed by the same number N cards of the other color. You may only use one set to calculate your score. If the leftover cards not in the set would form a set on their own then the point value of your hand is half the number of leftovers; otherwise it's the full number of leftover cards.&#10;&#10;Points are to be avoided. You can go out if you have four or fewer points in your hand. When someone goes out, players compare hands and the player with more points is the loser, and takes points equal to the difference in points with a bonus for a perfect hand (0 points) or undercut (where the person who went out had the worse hand). The first player to collect nine points loses the game.&#10;&#10;-- user summary&#10;&#10;",
