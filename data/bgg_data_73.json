    "Description": "(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;You are now back in time-12th through 17th century Japan, to be exact. Your objective: the exalted title of &quot;Shogun&quot;. As &quot;Shogun&quot;, you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.&#10;&#10;Samurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. &#10;These clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. &#10;Using formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.&#10;&#10;Concept of Play &#10;Each player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal &quot;fief&quot; or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy&shy; to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.&#10;&#10;Many Games in One &#10;An excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert. And for the really hard-core power-politics fanatics, special rules create a nearly &quot;perpetual&quot; game representing tho true ebb and flow of Japanese feudal confilct. &#10;Samurai includes a variety of playing aids to make learning and playing the game truly an effortless task. The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the &quot;Shogun&quot; struggles.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan. The aim of the game is to gain the title &quot;Shogun&quot; by game end. To become Shogun, the player has to gain control of two out of four Imperial Articles scattered across the mapboard. These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.&#10;&#10;Playing pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops. Additional troops may be added through offices, other provinces, castles, etc.&#10;&#10;",

Both games use the same rules and share many game pieces, but each has a separate full size map.&#10;&#10;2ND EDITION&#10;France &rsquo;40 2nd Edition is a major upgrade to the original game. The rules for Extended Movement, Combat, Advance After Combat, Breakthrough Combat, and Determined Defense have been updated so they are more in line with the recent games in the 19XX series (such as Stalingrad &rsquo;42 and Salerno &rsquo;43). A new scenario has been included designed by Mark Merritt that combines both maps.&#10;&#10;In addition, many new units have been added and some old units modified to provide a more accurate order of battle for both Sickle Cut and Dynamo. A few minor cities, some roads, and a fortified hex were added to the Dynamo map.&#10;&#10;And most importantly, both scenarios have been sent through the playtest cycle again to make sure they are better balanced than they were in the first edition.&#10;&#10;This game has long been one of my favorites due to the exciting situation and short playing time. I&rsquo;m really pleased with this 2nd Edition and excited about the new features it has.&#10;&#10;- Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Sickle Cut: Guderian's Drive to the ChannelThis game covers the crucial week in May 1940 when the German army broke the French line on the Meuse and raced to the sea at Abbeville. The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition? And, if they can, will they be able to break out from the bridgeheads and advance across the map while threatened by Allied reinforcements pouring in from the north and south?&#10;&#10;Dynamo: Retreat to Victory&#10;&#10;This game covers the British withdrawal to Dunkirk and the evacuation. The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?&#10; The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale. Special rules include: Allied Heavy Tanks, DeGaulle, Rommel, Hitler's Halt Order, and French Command Paralysis. Note that the two maps may be linked together for players to study the entire period from May 13th to June 3rd, and the second edition does include a combined game scenario, found in the Playbook.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     1 day per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     4 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Divisions, Brigades, Regiments, and Battalions&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;    2 Paper Maps (each 32&quot; x 44&quot;)&#10;    2 Countersheets&#10;    24 Page Rulebook&#10;    16 Page Playbook&#10;    2 Identical Player Aid Cards&#10;    2 Setup Cards&#10;    Two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Simonitch&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;(from GMT website and BGG user)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bismarck recreates the British hunt for the German battleship, Bismarck, in 1941.  Players are operating blind and are attempting to find (in the case of the British) or avoid (as for the Germans) each other, as the locations of each player's ships are hidden from each other.  Searches are conducted &agrave; la Battleship by calling out target locations that search planes or ships can 'see'.&#10;If and when the British successfully intercept the Germans, play can then be conducted in a fashion similar to miniatures, with counters laid out on a large space (the floor), and which then maneuver and fire at enemy ships.&#10;&#10;In greater detail;&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.&#10;&#10;The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to the game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out co-ordinates to locate their opponent.&#10;&#10;There are two players, German and British. The British player has the task of placing the Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.&#10;Each turn the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), search for enemy units, and possibly engage in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the heavy cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;Eventually, British heavy units, such as the battle cruiser Hood, may be vectored into the same square as the German task force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the aircraft carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.&#10;&#10;The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties into the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German aircraft carrier, Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.&#10;&#10;Second edition changes included:&#10;&#10;     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a hexagonal overlay;  &#10;     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; &#10;     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by more complex rules.&#10;     packaging was modified; the second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The gods atop Mt. Olympus also called their warriors to defend them. During this war of the gods, a mass of warriors died, and their souls were sealed in a jar.&#10;&#10;And now they are waiting for you to release them.&#10;&#10;In the deck-building game Kanzume Goddess, you will be one of the Gods of mythology. Each God in the game has its own special powers which players can use to their benefit. Players will purchase cards from the center of the table to add to their decks. They will use these cards to purchase more cards and to do battle with the other players. These cards can be used to damage other players, to gain more cards, to draw more cards from your deck, and to protect yourself from damage. The last player with energy left is the last God standing and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Kanzume Goddess can be played as an individual match with 2-6 players or as a team match if you play with 4 or 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

The spy secretly chooses one of the destinations, and flips to the chosen country's page in the handbook. Each detective is given three informant cards, and in turn each detective must play an informant to get information about the spy's secret destination. The spy must find the relevant information in the handbook and answer truthfully. The informants may provide information on various aspects such as population, industry, religion, history, economy, and so on. After a detective has played an informant, the detective must also eliminate one of the destinations on the table.&#10;&#10;At any time, the detectives can decide to guess on the spy's destination. If they guess correctly, the detectives win the round; otherwise the spy wins. The spy also wins if the detectives run out of informant cards, so the detectives must manage their resources well and not spend too much time or else the spy will manage to get away. The first side to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;No prior geographic knowledge is needed to play. Since Destination X is a team-based game, it can be played in groups of any number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Definitely not for the hardcore wargamer, Dogfight is a light version of WWI air combat. The Germans and Americans each get 6 biplanes divided into 2 squadrons of 3 planes each. Each squadron gets a hand of combat maneuver cards and players move one plane from each squadron engaging and evading each other. For each plane shot down you receive an ace token that entitles you to hold a larger hand of cards. Anti-Aircraft guns guard each home squadron and the lucky flyer has the opportunity to strafe the enemies planes on the ground. A great introductory wargame with easy to learn rules.&#10;&#10;",

One player, called the Patriot Player, controls the forces and destiny of the rebellious Americans; the other, the Crown Player, seeks to bring the rebels to their senses.  The exact Victory Conditions of the game may vary depending on which historical events the players choose to re-enact.&#10;&#10;Many aspects of warfare have been abstracted to focus squarely on issues of supply: protecting, moving, capturing, and effectively using it to further your goals and frustrate those of your opponent.  Supplies come in two flavors, and are represented on-board by wooden cubes.  Food Supply is expended to move your units, and War Supply to fight.&#10;&#10;There is no hidden information, other than what your opponent intends to do, but flexible movement rules allow for considerable bluffing and misdirection.  The game rewards boldness but also punishes the slightest error-- that is, if your opponent is clever enough to capitalize on it.&#10;&#10;",

Players must follow suit if possible.  The higher end of the domino led determines the suit for that round. If a player cannot follow suit, they can play any domino.  The trick is won by the highest trump in the trick, or if it contains no trump, by the highest domino of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.&#10;&#10;Scoring for a round is one point per trick (7 tricks) plus the &quot;count&quot;. The &quot;count&quot; is determined by dominoes taken that add up to 5 (0-5, 1-4, 2-3) or 10 (6-4, 5-5). They are worth 5 or ten points respectively, giving a total maximum score of 42, and the name of the game.&#10;&#10;A match is seven hands, or marks.

The other side defends with fighters, trying to claw for altitude and intercept the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game employs a side-view of the air battle, in which the forces maneuver vertically and end-to-end along the path of the raid. Players must gain height, exploit the Sun and cloud for advantage, and mass or divide their formations to stop the enemy. If you fail, the enemy bombers will rain down bombs on men and ships below.

With your Captain card to guide you, put together the best team you can from names across all 30 NHL teams. Every card features the stars of the NHL in high-resolution action shots. Can you light the lamp enough times to win the game?&#10;&#10;Compete for the best attackers, the best defenders, the best skills, and the best maneuver cards. Each card you add to your team will build upon the strategy you have chosen. Soon your team will act like a well-oiled machine and you&rsquo;ll be ready to take a shot on goal. If you can beat the goalie, you score a point! The player who scores the most points wins. Games typically end with &quot;hockey scores&quot; like 4-3.&#10;&#10;When you take a shot on goal, the action is tense. Before you reveal all of the tricks up your sleeve, there is a chance for defenders to interfere with your attack. The more defenders that get in your way, the harder it will be to score. After the defenders (if any) have been revealed, you play out your hand. That&rsquo;s right! The defenders won&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s crashing the net until after they have coordinated their defense. Now that you know what you&rsquo;re up against, play your cards and see if your strategy and players were good enough to overcome the defenses and the goalie. If it is, you score!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Normans, and their successors, had a large impact on history. Normans, from Nortmann (northman), were originally Viking raiders that settled in what would now be northern France. Normans gained territory as far away as southern Italy and Sicily, and modern day Syria. They were Crusaders, they were Kings, they were princes, and they were scoundrels. They began as raiders from the north that fought on foot and transformed themselves into Dukes, Kings, and princes that fought from horseback.&#10;&#10;How many games include a battle with a Papal army? Very few, so Norman Conquests visits Italy and the Norman Count of Apulia fighting with, and capturing, the Pope. Stretching the definition to include the Norwegian King Harald (III) Hardrada (undoubtedly a northman) and his invasion of England allows us to include all three battles for the throne of England in 1066, including the most famous Norman William the Conqueror and his invasion of England. Next we catch up with two sons of William I, the Duke of Normandy and the King of England, feuding over his lands years after his death. We end with the Baron&rsquo;s War between William I&rsquo;s great-great-great-grandson Henry III and his barons who were led by Simon de Montfort.&#10;&#10;The battles include:&#10;&#10;    Civitate 18 June 1053 &ndash; Normans from Sicily and southern Italy clash with the Pope and allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fulford 20 September 1066 &ndash; Norwegians (Vikings) come to lay claim to the English throne. Saxon nobles raise their levy and give battle in northern England.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Stamford Bridge 25 September 1066 &ndash; Saxon King Harold II hurries north and catches the Norwegian invaders with their pants down.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hastings 14 October 1066 &ndash; Saxon King Harold II hears of the Norman invasion of England and rushes south. Facing off with William, Duke of Normandy, on a hill in the south of England, Harold learns that arrows are pointy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Tinchebrai 28 September 1106 &ndash; Lacking primogenitor, two of William&rsquo;s children battle over his legacy. King Henry I of England and Robert, Duke of Normandy, face off in Normandy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Lewes 14 May 1264 &ndash; King Henry III, great-great-grandson of Henry I, and a coalition of his Barons clash over Baronial rights.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Evesham 4 August 1265 &ndash; Edward (later Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots) fights Simon de Monfort to free his father King Henry III.&#10;&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 to 5 hours&#10;Map Scale: about 110 yards per hex&#10;Unit Scale: about 250 men&#10;Number of Players: 1-2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;        Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; Maps (2 back-printed)&#10;        Two 1/4 Sheets of 9/16&quot; Counters&#10;        Three Player Aid Cards&#10;        One Rules Manual&#10;        One Battle Book&#10;        Two 10-sided Dice &#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Ralph Shelton&#10;Developer: Jason Lindsay&#10;Counter Art: Mike Lemick and Charlie Kibler&#10;Map Art: Charlie Kibler&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Munchkin Conan is a 168-card core set in the Munchkin family of games, with 101 Doors and 67 Treasures. Unlike other core sets, it lacks unique card backs, instead using the standard card back from Munchkin. The included Munchkin-head d6 is yellow with dark red print.&#10;&#10;In Munchkin Conan, Robert E. Howard's epic hero gets the full Munchkin treatment. Play a Cimmerian Warrior or a Stygian Wizard! Wield the Sword of the Phoenix and poison your foes with Black Lotus! Slay Thoth-Amon's minions, Pict raiders, and abominable monsters, and hear the lamentations of their women! On many of the cards, the publisher provides context by including relevant quotes from Howard's work.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Conan has a new type of card &ndash; birthright &ndash; and the mechanisms are similar to that of classes and races in that you can have only one in play at a time; you may discard a birthright at any time but may play one only on your turn or when you first get it. The Munchkin Conan core set comes with two birthrights: &quot;Noble&quot;, which allows you to have an extra Comrade (see below), and &quot;Barbarian&quot;, which allows you to ignore all &quot;Usable By&quot; and &quot;Not Usable By&quot; restrictions on items. There is no birthright analogue to &quot;Super Munchkin&quot; or &quot;Half-Breed&quot;.&#10;&#10;Speaking of races and classes, the races in Munchkin Conan are &quot;Kushite&quot;, &quot;Zamoran&quot;, &quot;Cimmerian&quot;, and &quot;Stygian&quot;; when playing a blender game, they are all considered to be human unless the other sets have non-human races. The classes are &quot;Cleric&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Wizard&quot;, and are identical to the fantasy Munchkin classes with the same names.&#10;&#10;The Munchkin Conan hireling is called a Comrade. Comrades fall in the same class as the Hirelings, Minions, Mooks, Sidekicks, etc. that come with other flavors of Munchkin. Each Comrade is associated with a class or birthright, and gives you some of the advantages of that class/birthright. Comrades can carry an item for you, even some that you can't legally use yourself, and their gender matters. They also have the standard Hireling ability to sacrifice themselves to give you an automatic escape when running away.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever wears the Crown of Command will hold power over all of the land.&#10;&#10;Decades ago, a powerful wizard sealed the Crown of Command behind the Portal of Power to prevent evil forces from obtaining it. Only those who possess one of the legendary Talismans may pass through this Portal to reach the Crown. Over the years, five of the Talismans have disappeared. Enemy forces now seek to find them in order to seize the Crown of Command for themselves. Brave heroes that you are, you have banded together to go on a quest to retrieve all five Talismans and thereby stop the evil power behind these enemy forces from ruling the world. This task won't be easy as finding each Talisman is an epic adventure in itself. However, if you work together using everyone's abilities and helping one another when you can, you will surely succeed.&#10;&#10;In Talisman - Legendary Tales, the players must work together as an adventure party to recover the five legendary Talismans that have been lost. During each adventure, the party endeavors to recover one of the lost Talismans. The adventures must be played in order. You may repeat adventures, and you may play one or more adventures in a game session.&#10;&#10;Over the course of this story, you will travel across a wondrous land and have exciting adventures in which you must make important decisions and defend yourself against cruel enemies. As an adventure party, you succeed in each adventure once you have completed the final task and have recovered the Talisman. Be careful: You have only a limited amount of time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Multi-Man Publishing web site:)&#10;&#10;Tide at Sunrise continues the philosophy that began with A Victory Lost. Using tried and true mechanics but with some major twists, Tide at Sunrise will be a major test of player skill that is rarely seen in the wargaming hobby. Here, the base system is little more than the tried and true game from SPI called Napoleon at Waterloo. But not all is at it seems.&#10;&#10;Here is the sequence of play:&#10;&#10;Japanese Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Naval Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Replacement and Recovery&#10;&#10;Russian Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Colonel Akashi Secret Operations Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation Phase&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Supply and Recovery Phase&#10;&#10;After the completion of both Player Turns, victory points are determined and, if the Japanese have not won a sudden death win, play continues to the next turn.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on two aspects of the actual event. Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.&#10;&#10;Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map&#10;    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters&#10;    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters&#10;    * 16 page full color rulebook&#10;&#10;Game summary:&#10;&#10;* Playtime: 3-5 hours&#10;    * Complexity: Simple&#10;    * Solitaire rating: excellent&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)&#10;    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units&#10;    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda&#10;    * Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Golem Arcana is a digitally enhanced miniatures board game focused on armies of magical Golems, the Knights who master them, and the Ancient Ones they call upon for supernatural support. Though the Golem Arcana game mechanics are deep and sophisticated, the game moves quickly and remains accessible to a wide audience due to the TDI stylus and mobile app managing all of the mechanics and record keeping. Players create armies including Golems, Knights, Ancient Ones, and Relics, seeking a combination of attributes and abilities to suit their individual play styles or tactical preferences. While the Golems and Relics are represented by physical game pieces and cards, the Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones are digital units supplied through the app.&#10;&#10;The Golems are your basic units, the body of the army itself. Relics are special equipment and constructs that can be carried into battle to help change the tide of war. A Golem Knight or Blood Knight is assigned to a specific Golem to customize its attributes or abilities through passive or active Knight abilities. Ancient Ones are assigned to the army as a whole, and provide powerful Blessings, Curses, and Miracles when the player &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; mana. Players stage their selected armies on the game map formed by the terrain tiles, and engage in one of a number of possible scenarios, including Last Man Standing, King of the Hill, and Victory Points/Missions. Using a turn-based Action Point system, players maneuver their Golems, call down blessings and curses, and assault the enemy until one player emerges victorious!&#10;&#10;The Golem Arcana app, which is a free download, is pre-loaded with a starting set of digital units including several Ancient Ones, Blood Knights, and Golem Knights. Additional Knights and Ancient Ones will be available for purchase to further expand and customize the player's army options. The app also supports up to eight players in a single game on one device through included multiplayer scenarios and a Scenario Creator that lets you generate your own. Additional figures from expansions are needed to play with more than two.&#10;&#10;In addition to the Base Game Set and Golem Arcana app, there are several expansions which will enhance a player&rsquo;s strategy by introducing new golems for more varied army building, as well as allowing new tactical and performance options through Relic cards, game tokens, and additional terrain tiles.&#10;&#10;",

They do this by attempting to be the most successful at both bringing people into the city as well as campaigning for the citizens' approval. Whoever best balances these two goals will win the election.&#10;&#10;There are seven offices within City Hall. These offices deal with a different aspect of building the city or campaigning, such as the Tax Assessor, Surveyor, or Zoning Board. In a round, each player will get to activate one of these offices. However, just because you activate an office doesn't mean you will get to use it. The other players will have an opportunity to use their influence to steal control of the office away from you. Keeping it will require countering with your own influence. However, you can instead let another player control that office this round and add their influence to your own, giving you a leg up on controlling things later on.&#10;&#10;In using these offices, players will buy land and build properties to create attractive neighborhoods that will bring the most people into the city &ndash; or they might place a factory next to an opponent's housing complex to drive people out. They will also tax their constituents to raise funds (with the option of sacrificing popularity to tax at higher rates), buy and sell influence to the Lobbyist, and campaign to increase their approval level.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the citizens of the city will vote based on which player brought them in and that player's approval level. Special interest groups will also collect votes for players based on certain goals, such as Wall Street backing the player with the most money. Whichever player has the most votes on election day will become Mayor of New York and appoint his or her opponents to the Sanitation Department.&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios introduce encounters and conflict, which are resolved through passing a test or making a choice. The consequences advance the storyline and drive a unique experience as part of the story changes based on each outcome. Failing a test could have dire results such as receiving one of several types of debilitating Afflictions. Many Scenarios will also present players with a moral dilemma where a decision could aid their cause, but not without sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Opposing the players is one of three selectable Villains. Beings of myth and legend, the Villains have their own host of deadly servants to face in combat. Developing flexible tactics and teamwork among players will be crucial as there are over 30 different enemies, each with their own special ability. You must band together with your friends if you hope to survive.&#10;&#10;",

Fontenoy is a tight test between the greatest captain of the war - Maurice de Saxe, commanding French forces behind defensive works against the inexperienced Duke of Cumberland commanding a mixed group of Allied troops.&#10;&#10;Aside from the classic, historical battle in which the Allies try to breach the French defenses, variants will allow players to explore options which allow the Allies to outflank the French, add more forces to both sides, and even take away the French defenses for a straight-up contest on the plains of Flanders.&#10;&#10;Fontenoy retains all of the aspects of the previous games of the series set in the Seven Years War.  The scale is 100 yards per hex and 20 minute game turns, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries at the scale of 1 strength point equals 100 foot soldiers, 50 horsemen, or 2 cannon.&#10;&#10;Also included is the Battle of Melle, 9 July, 1745.  This is a complete battle with a small number of counters per side, played out on a half size map.  Melle is a rare meeting engagement and is a swirling, chaotic battle as each side seeks to obtain their objectives before night falls.  Melle is a quick game, ideal for BAR beginners or for those who want to play out a full battle in one sitting.&#10;&#10;Microbadge: &#10;&#10;",

Well, to be honest the landscape holds a few donkeys, too, and while donkeys can help carry all that gold, they'll also eat into your savings if you aren't careful.&#10;&#10;Gold! consists of a 60-card deck, with cards in six colors; each color has gold cards valued 3-8 and a few donkeys worth -2. Each player starts the game with a different-colored donkey, then two cards are removed from play and five cards laid out face-up. On a turn, a player must do one of the following three actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Take the lowest valued card on display, with donkeys always being worth less than gold, and add it to his tableau.&#10;&bull; Exchange one gold card from his tableau for a lower-valued gold card.&#10;&bull; Exchange a donkey from his tableau for a gold card of any value.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player collects three cards of the same color, he must score it. First, though, he can pilfer a card in a color not present in his tableau from an opponent.&#10;&#10;When the last face-up card is claimed, five new cards are revealed. Once the final set of five cards is claimed, players compare their totals in each of the six colors; whoever has the highest total in a color scores the highest gold card of that color. Players then sum the cards in their score piles, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

In Mesozooic, it's your job as the director to plan and construct a zoo that will surpass any others. Fill your zoo with a variety of crowd-pleasing features: wow your visitors with towering dinosaur enclosures, entertain them with prehistoric attractions, and let them travel around the zoo in style on a network of monorails.&#10;&#10;Over the course of three rounds, players draft the most desirable features into their hand, piece their zoo together in real-time, and score each layout to see who has created the best zoo.&#10;&#10;After drafting your favorite features, you&rsquo;ll have to organize them in your zoo&mdash;but things won&rsquo;t always go as planned! Race against time by frantically sliding the cards one at a time to match up features and optimize your zoo&rsquo;s layout. Complete dinosaur enclosures, connect monorail tracks, and maintain your attractions to score points. The zoo with the best layout will score the most points!&#10;&#10;When drafting cards, you can choose to customize your zoo however you like. Choose from attractions, monorails, dinosaur enclosures, or topiary.&#10;&#10;Guests will be dazzled by the larger-than-life attractions at your zoo. Pterodactyls soar through the aviary, dinosaur eggs hatch in the nursery, and underwater creatures swim through the bright blue waters of the aquarium. Your zoo can include any or all of these attractions! To keep things running smoothly, attractions need to be regularly maintained. In order to score attractions in your zoo, you must keep a maintenance truck next to the attraction.&#10;&#10;While visiting your zoo, guests will need to get around. Hopping on the monorail will quickly transport your guests to other corners of the park. In order to be effective, the monorail&rsquo;s route must be connected. If you can continue the track, each connection will score points for your zoo.&#10;&#10;The highlight of the zoo is, of course, the dinosaurs themselves! Let guests come face to face with these creatures from another age. Create the perfect environment for gentle herbivores or powerful carnivores, each in their own enclosure. Each completed enclosure will score points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning and quick thinking can give you the edge. Astonish guests with the amazing creatures from a land before time.

    "Description": "The Queen of Hearts has summoned Alice to rebuild Wonderland, which has been devastated by an invasion of Nothing, which is devouring the dreams of all in the land &mdash; but the Queen has mistakenly summoned whole armies of Alices! Dozens of Alices abound, and now they're taking sides and forming teams to see who can put the land back together best.&#10;&#10;In Alicematic Heroes, you take charge of one of these teams, and you'll have a handful of Alices to use in your efforts. Alices come in five colors, with each player having a set of player boards in these five colors. On a turn, you first summon an Alice to your kingdom, playing that card from your hand onto the player board of the same color, but only if you can pay the cost in dream power; each Alice has a cost, and you must have at least this many dream cards (yellow) or be able to make up the difference by paying dream tokens. If you can, you immediately use the power &mdash; or Megalomania &mdash; of that Alice; if you can't, choose another card or lay an Alice face down as a commoner. Playing a commoner doesn't cost anything, lets you draw another card, and builds up the power of one of your five colors, but you don't get a Megalomania bonus and your turn ends immediately.&#10;&#10;If you played an Alice, you can then invade a territory in the playing area, which is composed of modular hex tiles. To conquer the territory, you need enough military power (red cards) or supplemental military (red) tokens, and if the territory is not on a hex where you occupy a city, you must have enough food (green cards) or food tokens to reach that space. If you conquer it, you receive a bonus based on the territory's color: military, food or dream tokens; Alice cards; or points. If you conquer a city, you score points and now have a foothold on that hex.&#10;&#10;If you lack enough military and food, you can still place the territory under attack and finish it off on a later turn, but another player can potentially conquer it in the meantime.&#10;&#10;Mystic forests cannot be conquered until they're surrounded by player-controlled territories, and only the player(s) with the most controlled surrounding territories can then capture the forest, which has a toughness and point value equal to the number of surrounding territories.&#10;&#10;The game ends after fourteen rounds, then players score points for having the most or secondmost territories controlled in each hex and for having the most Alices in any of the five colors. Players can also score points for Alice Megalomania effects, and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Tiger Leader, you're in command of a German Kampfgruppe of tanks, armored cars, trucks, halftracks and supporting infantry. Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.&#10;&#10;Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts. The scheduled campaigns include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Invasion of Poland 1939&#10;    The Battle for France 1940&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1941&#10;    The Invasion of Russia 1941&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1942&#10;    The Fight for Italy 1943&#10;    The Fight for Russia 1943&#10;    The Days of D-Day 1944&#10;    The Final Days in Berlin 1945&#10;&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.&#10;&#10;During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;",

Carefully plan your moves and try to control your opponents' moves. On your turn, play a card, place three students, and advance mother nature a certain number of steps across the islands. The island on which mother nature lands is evaluated, and whoever controls it can erect one of their own towers, possibly taking control from an opponent. Additionally, adjacent islands controlled by the same player can merge with that one.&#10;&#10;The game ends if only three islands remain, if the students run out, or if a player builds all of their towers. At this point, the player who built the most towers wins.&#10;&#10;With three different game modes, including team play, Eriantys always offers different and interesting games.

The very interesting and variable game play guarantees long term fun and entertainment.&#10;&#10;Players will be able to use, among other things, more than 600 cardboard game pieces !&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a real-time, roll-and-write game, where the frantic action around the table mimics the kick-arse fighting action in the game-world! Set in the world of Vengeance and designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi, Noralie Lubbers and Gordon Calleja, Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a stand-along game that transforms the fast-paced dice puzzles of the original Vengeance into roll-and-write mechanics where you&rsquo;re building combos, striking off enemies and scoring points for an action-packed, brain-teasing fighting game that&rsquo;s easy to learn and hard to master.&#10;&#10;The aim of Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is to infiltrate a gang den, carve your way through it&rsquo;s rooms and killing the Boss, while completing side objectives printed on the dens themselves.&#10;&#10;The game is split into three parts: planning, fighting and montage. In the planning phase players roll and re-roll 4 dice in real time, aiming to roll a combination of dice that match an ability they wish to trigger in the upcoming, fight phase. Assigning dice to an ability allows players to fill their hand back to 4 dice from a large, common pool and repeat the process as quickly as they can manage.&#10;&#10;Once the dice pool is depleted, the fighting proper begins. Here players take a set of dice assigned to an ability and execute that ability, moving their piece through rooms full of enemies, and crossing them out when they are hit with the multitude of available abilities. Finally, players heal and upgrade their characters, bring new abilities and items into play to help them on their road to vengeance.&#10;&#10;Vengeance: Roll and Fight comes in two boxes: Episode 1 and Episode 2. Both episodes are stand-alone games with the same rules, but with entirely different content: different heroes, dens, bosses, abilities and items.  Each episode accommodates up to 4 players so combining the two increases the player count from 1-4 to 1-8! Content in both Episodes can be switched like-for-like as you choose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Bucket King 3D, a new version of Stefan Dorra's The Bucket King, players lay down sets of animal cards to try to knock over every other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to defend your own buckets and attack those of others &mdash; and if you knock out a bucket low in someone's pyramid, you might cause a cascade that takes out even more!&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player either plays cards or loses buckets; the game is played in rounds with a new round starting after anyone loses one or more buckets. At the start of each round, the active player chooses 1-3 cards in hand of the same color/animal, lays them face up in front of himself, announces their sum, then draws one card to add to his hand (regardless of how many he played). Each subsequent player must lay down 1-3 cards of the same suit as the initial player with a higher sum than previously announced or else lose a bucket. (If play circles the table to the round's start player, he can add 1-3 new cards to those previously played, then announce the sum of all cards in front of him.)&#10;&#10;When a player cannot or chooses not to defend his pyramid by playing cards, he removes one bucket of that card color from his pyramid by pushing, flicking or poking it with only one finger. (If he doesn't have a bucket of the required color, he removes a bucket of his choice.) This player then starts a new round after everyone has cleared their played cards.&#10;&#10;In a two- to four-player game, the game ends when a player loses his last bucket; in a five- to six-player game, a player who loses his last bucket is out of the game, and the game ends when only three players have buckets still in play. Whoever has the most buckets remaining in his pyramid wins.&#10;&#10;Bucket King 3D includes 2 variants for experience players: &#10;(1)Play with the Special &quot;One&quot;!&#10;Whenever a player lays down a 1 while playing cards of the appropriate color, he can also play one other card of any color, adding the value of that card (and any others played) to his sum; he then draws two cards (one as normal, plus another card for the bonus card played) to end his turn. For example, if the required suit is blue, he may play a blue 1, with a red 4 as the additional card, announce his sum as &quot;Five&quot;, then draw two cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;If he plays two 1s, then he may play two additional cards of any color and draw three cards at the end of his turn. A player can lay down at most five cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Play with the Backfiring Discard!&#10;This variant is played with all the basic rules, but the direction of play may change during the game!&#10;When the active player plays cards to attack on his turn, the direction of the play is reversed if he plays an additional card of the same colour onto the discard pile. He draws cards as normal for the cards he has played in front of himself, but he does not draw any card for the additional card he has played.&#10;For example, a player has played a Blue 4. The next player plays a Blue 5 in front of himself and discards a Blue 2. Then he draws only 1 card. The direction changes now and play continues with the previous player.&#10;You may play both variants (1) and (2) in the same game! For example, a player may play a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and the direction of play remains unchanged. But if he plays a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and discards a Blue 2 (variant 2), the game continues in the reverse direction.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the bustling market of Kairo, traders build their stalls and try to entice customers with attractive goods, with each customer bringing money that the trader can then use to expand that stall or establish new stalls.&#10;&#10;To set up Kairo, players first take turns placing three colored stalls (out of six) on the game board. They also take three stall cards (which highlight one or more sections on the game board) and one coin of each of the six colors. Five colored customers start at particular locations on the game board, with the sixth customer placed to the side. On a turn, a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draws two cards (face-up or face-down stall cards or market barker cards).&#10;    Moves a customer to a stall of that customer's color.&#10;    Plays a stall card; then builds a new stall, expands an existing stall, or moves a blocked-off stall.&#10;&#10;&#10;The active player can choose to move any customer, and that customer will move to the closest stall (measured on orthogonal paths) of the same color. Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &quot;call&quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall. If the active player owns the visited stall, he receives one coin of the stall's color for each tile in that stall; if not, the active player receives a one coin commission while the owner receives the normal payout. This customer is then swapped with the customer off the board.&#10;&#10;When building a new stall, a player cannot place it in the same region as another stall of the same color. Regulations! Restaurants must be placed in an area designated for them, while all other stalls must go in the market area. When expanding an existing stall, the player must pay one coin of the same color for each tile in the enlarged stall. By expanding, you can earn more coins when customers visit, create longer paths to opponents' stalls, reserve area in which to expand further, and (most importantly) earn victory points. You score VPs each time you expand, and if your stall is the largest (or tied for the largest) of that color, you'll take one or two medals that provide a VP bonus.&#10;&#10;Once the expansions run low in one or two colors, players can only build or expand. Once everyone has finished building, the game ends, with players earning VPs for the medals and money they have in hand. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've just found a mine filled with precious energy crystals! Precisely those you use for your daily magic. The problem here is that you've also stumbled onto a horde of monsters! And to make things even worse, three other cities seem to have discovered the existence of your mine as well. As they rush into danger to mine the precious crystals, you have no choice but to join in the fray...&#10;&#10;Age of Towers brings the exciting gameplay of your favorite tower defense games onto the tabletop! Playable either solo or with up to four players, Age of Towers sees you and your opponents competing to defend your cities against the oncoming wave of monsters by constructing defenses, placing traps, and funneling those beasts towards your opponents' cities!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each turn has three phases: night, dawn, and day. During night, the event card is applied and monsters progress on your path (with each type having a different movement value). Two more monsters (or your boss) appear on your path. During dawn, the towers can attack one monster of a particular type on one of the four adjacent spaces, or the boss. During day, each player can choose one action from the four available, then they can take one more action, whether the same or different.&#10;&#10;Each monster type has a movement value (1-3 spaces) and maybe a special ability; all core box monsters have 2 life points. The boss, who is not a monster, is harder to kill as it has 10 life points; when a player successfully kills it, the game ends. Each time a monster or a boss leaves your path to reach your city, you lose a number of city guards equal to their movement value. You begin at 15, and even if you lose your last one, you don't lose the game; you will just earn fewer victory points than other players.&#10;&#10;After the game end, each player adds their victory points from three sources: Number of remaining city guards, amount of damage to your boss, and achievements (which are drawn randomly at the beginning of the game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For two hundred years, war waged back and forth across the border between England and Scotland. By 1482, the unfortunate town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, once the richest port town in Scotland, had changed hands thirteen times. By the time Henry VIII ascended the throne of England in 1509, the fifty-mile-wide stretch of rolling hills and stunning vistas that straddle the border had seen decades of hardship and atrocity.&#10;&#10;Yet still the hardy families living on these frontier lands persevered. Unable to count on crops surviving until the harvest, they subsisted primarily on the livestock they could shepherd in the fields near their homesteads. When supplies ran low, raiding to steal what they needed from their neighbors was often the answer. Raids were often carefully planned operations with several border families uniting to steal livestock from a common foe in the dead of night. Cattle and sheep were the likely targets, often with hundreds of these creatures being stolen in a single raid. The reiver&rsquo;s goal was to herd their quarry to safety before the retaliatory &ldquo;hot trod&rdquo; pursuit could catch up and force an engagement.&#10;&#10;To combat this constant hostility, England and Scotland established the system of March Law. Each nation divided its border lands into an East, Middle, and West March with each of these six territories administered by a Warden responsible for keeping the peace. The Wardens were drawn from the most powerful families on the Borders, clans of great renown that could put upwards of a thousand men in the saddle in times of need. The March Law would have succeeded too, but for the fact that these same great families were usually the ones best equipped and most inclined to raid their neighbors.&#10;&#10;In Border Reivers, each player rules over one of the Marches as leader of one of the six major riding families of the border: Grey, Fenwick, Dacre, Maxwell, Kerr, or Hume. Your goal is to increase the wealth and fame of your clan throughout the reigns of Henry and Elizabeth to end the century as the most famous Border Reiver of all time. Players gain VPs from successful combats, amassing large herds of livestock, and by elevating their Notoriety above the other players in the regions of the map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Syrian player starts with a very strong force, but must attack at the right places and rely on rapid breakthrough across the Golan Heights in order to seize the objectives. Time is against the Syrians, with not only the Israeli reserves arriving, but also as the SAM barrier gets reduced and the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force grows. The Syrians must strike hard and fast, then fight to hold on to their gains.&#10;&#10;Both players have a degree of variable setup that allows enhanced replay value, but still keeps the historical flavor. A historical setup is also provided for those that wish to more closely follow history.&#10;&#10;In Golan '73, the FAB series meets modern warfare and now YOU are in command to fight one of the greatest tank battles ever fought.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Using the basic system pioneered in Ave Caesar, this racing game casts the players as race car drivers.  Players use cards to move their cars forward a number of spaces, however the tracks often have 'choke' points where few cars can race side-by-side (not unlike Kramer&#039;s Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix system).  The track is constructed from three double-sided half-boards, which can be combined in a number of different ways for easier and harder tracks.  For the advanced game, each player's movement cards can be divided different ways, depending on the strategy that he wishes to employ for the given track.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Behind the fa&ccedil;ade of the great Gotham City lies an active underworld of criminal activity. In Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game, you'll play as one of Gotham City's greatest villains &ndash; The Joker, The Penguin, Killer Croc, or Two-Face &mdash; and lead your gang of henchmen to try to become the King of Crime in Gotham City! But beware, as your hold on the city increases, so does the chance of your plans being foiled by Gotham's protector &ndash; Batman!&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect resources of information, money and threat; threat is used to exert your rule over blocks in Gotham City, and control of blocks allows you to collect income on these blocks of either information or money. Money is used for leveling and to hire henchmen who will help you rule city blocks and fight better against other villains and Batman. Information is used for leveling and moving your villain and henchmen through the city blocks. Leveling works as follows: Each villain has a combat dial with ten levels. Each click of the dial shows a requirement that you will need to advance to the next level: information, money, henchmen, or blocks controlled. The first player to reach level 10 with his villain wins. On every even number level, players will acquire special abilities unique to their villain.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player will play a Criminal Plot card which will either produce an income for the ruler of a certain block or trigger the Bat Signal, which calls in Batman! When Batman moves into a block with a Villain, a fight occurs using the two custom Batman dice included with the game. If Batman wins, the villain and his henchmen must flee to their hideout and Batman restores order in that block of Gotham City; if the villain wins, they have defeated Batman (for the time being) and Batman returns to the Batcave, increasing his combat effectiveness as he plans for the next encounter.&#10;&#10;",

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Finn vs. Jake, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes. Jake's corn-themed deck features creatures from the episode such as the powerful Husker Knights, the intimidating Legion of Earlings, the heroic Archer Dan and many more! Finn's &quot;Blue Plains&quot; deck features creatures from the episode such as the wise Ancient Scholar, the aptly named Cool Dog, and the most fearsome critter of all &ndash; The Pig!&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

As a group of magistrates you must work together to ensure your province doesn&rsquo;t displease him, which would result with you losing your position&mdash;and your possibly your head.&#10;Follow the emperor&rsquo;s Edict, complete his preferred Monuments, and plan carefully to make sure you all stay off the chopping block!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
