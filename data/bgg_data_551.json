Encompassing both colonial actions and conflicts between technologically advanced powers, they are intended for those who wish to recreate the lesser-known conflicts of the period, for which specifically tailored rules sets are often not available. They are designed as a framework that is easily modified to fit the specific situation being recreated. Alternately, these rules are good for those who wish to play battalion-level games that move quickly...Toward this end, any consistent basing system can be used, with the number of figures on a base left to the individual.&quot;&#10;&#10;System focuses on fatigue instead of casualties as has measurements intended for 15mm games.&#10;&#10;",

Through strategic card play and and tactical pegging, each player attempts to avoid Collisions, Oil Spills and Spin Outs while trying to force his opponent into them.  By crossing over the inside lane before each turn in the track, a player can shorten the overall distance from 121 holes -- as in traditional Cribbage -- to 107 holes.  By taking advantage of the powerful &quot;Slipstream&quot;, a trailing player can change the face of a game in a single hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Back Cover&#10;The scope of wargaming is almost boundless.  Wargamers can create simulations of the simplest encounter or the grandest strategy.  Armoured warfare in miniature has a special appeal.&#10;The model tank wargamer can take advantage of the superb range of miniature model tanks available and the many books detailing modern weaponry to recreate this style of fighting that was born on the Somme in 1916 and came of age in 1940.  Perfect scale models and accurate rules combine to produce an almost faultless simulation of tank warfare - all that is missing is the clatter of tracks, the roar of engines and the crump of shellfire.&#10;This book lays the complete groundwork on the subject.  It explains how to use the many different armoured fighting vehicles, their guns, caliber, missile weight, range, angle of impact, thickness of armour; and does the same for anti-tank weapons.  It provides essential information on communications, mines, infantry co-operation, aircraft and armoured operations, and battlefields; it also provides practical information on how to assemble armoured forces in miniature and table-top terrains over which they can battle.&#10;The authors are well known veteran wargamers.  Donald Featherstone served with the Royal Tank Regiment in North Africa and Italy during World War II; his associate, Keith Robinson, is an adviser to one of the main manufacturers of model fighting vehicles for wargamers.&#10;Together they have clearly and simply brought this modern style of warfare to the table-top battlefield and provide technical and tactical advice against a fascinating background of wargaming narrative with ten historical scenarios spanning the lifetime of the tank, from an armoured car action in 1914 to the Middle East conflicts of recent history.&#10;&#10;",

Suitable for any scale miniatures from 2mm right up to 28mm (including 6mm, 10mm, 15mm and 20mm) and no re-basing is required.&#10;&#10;The rules come as a 140-page A4-sized perfect bound book with over 60 full colour pictures that illustrate how to play the game. These feature real miniatures as you see them on the gaming table. You also get a double-sided A4-sized quick reference sheet.&#10;&#10;The game can be played at one of three levels: 1 base = 1 Platoon (the scale the game was designed for), 1 base = 1 Squad or Individual Vehicle, or 1 miniature = 1 Soldier or Vehicle. The ground scale is 1cm = 20m or 1cm = 10m respectively. One turn represents up to 30 minutes of real-life action.&#10;&#10;Main Features&#10;The main features of the game include:&#10;-command system that emphasizes the fog of war in a simple but effective manner &#10;-the same mechanism for casualty resolution throughout &#10;-rules for infantry, armour, reconnaissance, artillery, aircraft and future technology &#10;-examples of play using colour pictures of miniatures &quot;in-action&quot; to illustrate the game &#10;-minimal set-up time - simply assemble your forces and play &#10;unique points system that allows for unequal forces but an equal chance of victory &#10;-41 well presented army lists covering the miniatures of 15 different manufacturers &#10;-11 scenarios for simulating combined-arms warfare of the future &#10;-suitable for solo, two-player &amp; multi-player games at home, at the club, or in the garden! &#10;-one double-sided quick reference sheet included &#10;-no supplements - all you need to play in one book&#10;&#10;Future War Commander Skirmish!&#10;The book includes four pages of rules and three army lists to allow you to play at the skirmish level using individual figures.

    "Description": "HardBall Wars is the &ldquo;brother&rdquo; to our football game, GridIron Wars. While I was designing GridIron Wars, an idea popped into my head&#10;regarding a similar method to resolve a baseball game. After putting the idea to paper and mailing it to a couple of trusted friends,&#10;HardBall Wars was born. HardBall Wars is simple enough for a child to learn, but robust enough to satisfy even the most veteran of baseball gamer.&#10;&#10;Many may wonder, why a baseball game? Aren&rsquo;t there plenty of good ones already on the market? In short, the answer is yes. There are many&#10;fantastic baseball games on the market. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;m really not re-inventing the wheel. You&rsquo;ll never hear me tout the game as&#10;better or more realistic than any other game currently on the market.&#10;&#10;However, having said that, I do feel like this game stands up well against any other baseball game in terms of what is truly most important,&#10;the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo;. My testers and I have had an absolute blast playing the game. The unique batter-pitcher interface, combined with the X-&#10;Factor deck, makes the game unique and in my humble opinion very fun to play.&#10;&#10;My philosophy with Downey Games has always been to price games as low as possible, making the games accessible to all. Most current baseball&#10;board games sell in the $50-$60 range. While that is reasonable to most, it does make it an expensive proposition to purchase multiple&#10;seasons or teams. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;ve purposely designed the game with a cost factor in mind. For that same $50 or $60 you&rsquo;ll be able&#10;to purchase multiple seasons of HardBall Wars. Also unlike other games, we strive to rate nearly every player who stepped foot on the field&#10;of play.&#10;&#10;HardBall Wars is based upon a modified log5 method. That may not mean much to some, but using this method allows the pitcher and batter to&#10;&quot;Interact&quot; on every at-bat. Rather than a 50/50 model or a generic pitcher grade, with HardBall Wars you'll see the difference between&#10;pitchers and batters and their impact on the at-bat in a very visual way. You'll also immediately see the difference in righty/lefty&#10;matchups at the plate.&#10;&#10;Fielding is not neglected in HardBall Wars. You'll see the difference between the gold glove shortstop and the lead gloved fielder not only&#10;in terms of errors committed but also the ability to turn hits into outs.&#10;&#10;The most unique aspect of HardBall Wars is our introduction of the X-Factor Deck. And often times it can generate a lot of excitement.&#10;&#10;Within the X-Factor deck just about anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen in a baseball game can take place. From run downs, appeals, dropped third&#10;strikes, rain delays, rain outs, ejections, brawls to even the extremely bizarre like the now famous Pine Tar incident&mdash;all are possible&#10;within the X-Factor Deck.&#10;&#10;The deck is far more than just a Rare Play mechanism. There are many conditional events within the deck and even some very mundane plays.&#10;&#10;The X-Factor deck simulates the events that happen in real life that as a tabletop gamer you don&rsquo;t often see in your own gaming. One can see&#10;something out of the ordinary in almost every baseball game in real life. And we have brought that to the tabletop through the use of the X&#10;-Factor Deck.&#10;&#10;With HardBall Wars, the decisions as a manager are all yours. You decide when to steal bases. You decide when to Hit and Run or Sacrifice&#10;the runner to the next base. You'll make the call when to intentionally walk the opposition&rsquo;s slugger, or when to bring the infield in to&#10;cut down a runner at the plate. You'll make the call as when to attempt a squeeze bunt or play for the big inning. You'll make the call to&#10;bring in the lefty specialist to face the opposing left hand slugger, or stick with your right hand throwing starter. With HardBall Wars, you&#10;may even be ejected from the game! Nearly every situation that faces a major league skipper is replicated in the game.&#10;&#10;The printed game features game charts printed in full-color, the season of your choice, 3 dice, a die-cut X-Factor deck also printed in full color, score sheets all packaged in a sturdy game box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Haunted Destinies is an identity mystery game set on the Scottish moors.  At the start of the game, one player is secretly assigned the role of Opener, but no one - not event the player who is the Opener - knows who the Opener is.  The Opener card, and other attribute cards, are distributed to the players in destiny piles.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, your destiny, and the destiny of the other players, will gradually be revealed. The Opener is destined to break the walls that keep past, present future, the dead, and the living separate. If you discover that you are The Opener, your goal is to complete the opening ritual by killing all of the other players. If you are not The Opener, your goal is to bind him or her and stop the opening ritual.&#10;&#10;If you die and the game is not over, you become a ghost. Ghosts can only win if a Haunting card that gives them a win condition is in play. What are Haunting cards and how do they work? You add Haunting cards to your destiny pile when you are haunted by ghosts or if you fail a destiny search. A Haunting card comes into play when another player probes your destiny pile and finds a Haunting card.&#10;&#10;Haunted Destinies uses a tiled board system similar to Betrayal at the House on the Hill, but each tile edge indicates the minimum number of movement points need to leave through that edge.  Some tiles have an &quot;X&quot;, indicating that you can not leave that way.  This tile setup creates interesting, semi-solid maze-like boards that are different each game.&#10;&#10;Haunted Destinies is a game for three to six players. It uses a custom set of board tiles, three custom card decks, a black six sided die, and a white six sided die. You can download the custom parts and the rules at http://www.invisible-city.com/play/499/haunted-destinies. A four-player game takes about 60 minutes to play. Since it deals with ritual sacrifice and murder, Haunted Destinies is appropriate for ages 16 and up.&#10;&#10;",

Each card shows six incredible names of animals, each of them belonging to one of these species: mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, butterflies, and impossums. Only the first five species are &quot;regular&quot; species. The impossums are fake animals (impossible animals). Their sole purpose is to provide suggestions for bluffing. Bluffing is important for winning - and for having fun!&#10;One game is about guessing to what species an animal belongs. As the animal names must be read aloud, it is good exercice for kids to read and pronounce.&#10;The other two games are different in depth and demand. There are alphabetical and morphemic rules for putting down cards. For example: &#10;You can put down a card only if &#10;- either it shows the name of an animal of the particular category that fits alphabetically (= starting with the same letter as the reference animal or with its first letter following or coming before that letter), or if&#10;- a part of the name of an animal is identical with a part of the name of the reference animal (example: &quot;blue-and-gold-fusilier&quot;, a fish, thus matches with &quot;blue-crowned motmot&quot;, a bird). If it belongs to the same species, you can put down a further card, if it belongs to another category you just switch the species.&#10;If both is not possible, you can try some bluffing. The cards are played face down.&#10;You must pronounce the name of the animal when putting your card down. Each card put down can be controlled. When your bluffing is detected, you get malus points. When you habe put your cards down &quot;regularly&quot;, however, the one who has controlled gets malus points. Chances are good not to be detected when bluffing: all animal names (more than 1250) are very strange indeed, so its not obvious, when you invent a name on your own or use an impossum. Unless you blush... [end of publisher's text]&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Wars Adventures is a series of novel-driven set-piece adventure games marketed for direct to home sales by Scholastic, Inc. and Lucas Books / Lucasfilms LTD. The game is generally structured along the lines of the 1970s-1980s era &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; (CYOA) novels, except using pregenerated heroic characters from the Star Wars universe, more linear story lines and an &quot;adventure points&quot; scoring system. Players risk losing points for making poor decisions and for bad die rolls, but unlike most earlier CYOA books, seldom (if ever) risk character death. While the adventures are designed for solo play, the adventure points system allows for competitive, partnership or cooperative play by several players.&#10;&#10;Characters have different RPG-like attributes (name, life-form, allegiance, charm, knowledge, navigation, power, skill, stealth, strength, weaponry and talents). Devices and Powers that the characters might use are rated for accuracy in different circumstances. Similarly, Vehicles are rated by type, speed, distance, stealth and weaponry. Combinations of these attributes are used along with d10 or d20 rolls to determine &quot;adventure numbers&quot; during decisions and confrontations that, in turn, affect both the direction of the storyline and the adventure points score.&#10;&#10;Star Wars Adventures is packaged in a plastic carrying case shaped like a flattened Clone Trooper helmet. The base game includes a membership card, adventure poster, d10, d20, character cards, power cards, device cards, vehicle cards, an adventure guide, notebook, point pad, adventure novel and game book. Expansions include additional cards of all types, posters, novels, magazines and game books. Modules in the series are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Hunt the Sun Runner (Ryder Windham, 2002) -- This module is set in the period between Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. A ghost ship is on a crash course with a helpless planet. First you must find it. Then you must stop it.&#10;&#10;",

Join forces with Merlin in mastering mystical mental powers of ESP. It's fun and easy to play. The game comes complete with:&#10;&#10;&quot;A long-lasting, attractive, vinyl game board, 18 specially designed mystic image cards and easy-to-follow multiple game instructions.&quot;&#10;&#10;No designer is actually credited in the rules or anywhere else.

Since while checking the motifs and colours, there could suddenly be more or less.&#10;&#10;The game contains 14 number cards that are laid out on the table. Each number card has three numbers on it. For each round, four motif or search cards are turned up. Players look at the search cards, which may show colours or symbols, then count the number of matching colours and symbols on the motif cards. When they think they've got the number right, they take one number card from the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;The numbers are checked, and everyone who has a correct number cards scores a point. The number cards go back into the middle of the table and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;If the cards turned up are only search cards, then the result is zero - and there are number cards with zero on them, so those are the ones people try to grab. If only motif cards are turned up, another set of cards is turned up.&#10;&#10;There is a variation for 2 to 4 children aged 6 and up, with fewer number cards, placed the other way up so that there is only one number showing. In this version, the search cards and motif cards are separated and only one search card is turned up each round.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of a plastic tile board and 100 various tiles each with a letter and point assigned to it on each side. The game has five different variations of play. In Game One: The grid begins empty except for the word LOOKEE spelled out in the center. Using at least one letter on the board each player must take turns making their own word (with the 7 tiles they began with) using at least one pre-existing tile.Each turn must be finished within 30 seconds. These words could be spelled forward, backward, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player scores points for all the letters on their new word. After each turn, the player who went replenishes back to seven tiles. The player with the most points after the grid is filled is the winner. Game Two: First player to reach 100 points wins. In this game, the entire tile board is filled with letters at random. The first player tries to locate a word in any direction, and receives the added points for that word. The tiles used are then flipped over creating a new board every turn. The next player goes and so on. Only 30 seconds per turn. Game Three: Same as game two except additional option. Look for letter groupings that can be rearranged to form words. E.G. T,C,R,U,K can be TRUCK. First to 100 points wins. Game Four: Play solitaire by setting up the board as in Game One. Score as many points as possible in a given time period. Game Five: By using another game board, a duplicates version could be played by using identical letters and setting a time limit.&#10;&#10;",
