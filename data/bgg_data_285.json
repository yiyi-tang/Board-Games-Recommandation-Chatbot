    "Description": "This expansion set for Groo: The Game adds 55 cards to the 60 cards that came with the initial deck.  The new cards allow the game to go to 6 players instead of the 4 proposed by the base game.&#10;&#10;The expansion adds no new card types, but doubling the number of available cards makes the game much easier to play.  In the original game, especially with 4 players, the late game could sometimes stall as there weren't enough resources for the players to drive to a win.  The additional cards prevent this stall and add many options to the game.  They also bring in almost every iconic Groo character, event, and location.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Groo: The Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.&#10;&#10;The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.&#10;&#10;Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.&#10;&#10;The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.&#10;&#10;Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.&#10;&#10;The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.&#10;&#10;",

Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&quot;Sekt&quot;) or soda (&quot;Selters&quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.&#10;On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). &#10;Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.&#10;If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).&#10;If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.&#10;There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.&#10;&#10;The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?&#10;&#10;The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).&#10;&#10;",

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.&#10;&#10;The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.&#10;&#10;Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.&#10;&#10;Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.  The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.&#10;&#10;This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.&#10;&#10;",

Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an unusual two-player strategy game.  The board consists of five columns, within each of which a &quot;man&quot; moves back and forth.  The men are moved by both players.  At the ends of each column are the players' goals (one end belongs to one player, the other end to his opponent).  Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.  First player to reach 15 points wins.&#10;   The spaces within the columns are numbered in seemingly random fashion, except for the centre row, which is all numbered 4.  The game starts with all men in the centre.  One player calls out a number from 1 to 5.  His opponent then moves a man that number of spaces in either direction (no back-and-forthing allowed).  The number on the space onto which the man lands gives the move for the next man --and this mechanism applies throughout the game, so the only random element is the initial call of 1 to 5.&#10;   Each player moves three different men, then his opponent does the same (the first man he moves cannot be the last one you moved), and so on.  Every time a man reaches a goal (by exact count), a point is scored and the man teleports back to the centre.  To complicate matters slightly, there are two &quot;safe spaces&quot; in each column, those on one side of the centre belonging to one player, those on the other to his opponent.  A player may not move more than two men onto safe spaces at once.  You cannot move a man from your opponent's safe spaces, so this is used to constrain the opponent's possible moves.&#10;   A software version of this would be very interesting, particularly if the board could be randomised...&#10;&#10;",

One player represents the Bogeyman, a superhuman maniacal mass murderer, and the other takes the part of the collection of victims he intends to murder. Movement of the 14 characters including a Bus Driver, Whiz Kid, Football Player, Surfer, BMOC, Biker, ROTC, Psych Major, Cheerleader, Jockette, Preppie, Valley Girl, Ingenue takes place on the map. The victims try to stay alive as long as possible.

One player takes the role of the Bogeyman; other players take the roles of only a few of the victims.

    "Description": "The object of this game is to score Sets and Runs of cards and trying to go out first. First to score 50 wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).&#10;&#10;Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.&#10;&#10;The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!&#10;&#10;",

On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.&#10;&#10;Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.  Big box with lots of fairly nice bits, however.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Flipop board consists of a 5x5 grid of spaces.  In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.&#10;&#10;",

Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.&#10;&#10;Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.  A small number of cards have special powers on them, further changing the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Global Chess is pure chess with 64 squares, traditional pieces and traditional moves. The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.&#10;&#10;Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.&#10;&#10;The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.&#10;&#10;The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.&#10;&#10;The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card-flicking card game in which a target card depicting some tasty fish is placed on the table and players attempt to flick (actually, according to the rules, this is a wrist-toss rather than a finger-flick) cards depicting dolphins as close to the target as possible - the twisting motion of the flicked cards is supposed to represent the playful antics of the dolphins. A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a &quot;4&quot; card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Suddenly there was a tremendous explosion and I was instantly drenched in a cascade of cold water. Paralyzed for what seemed an eternity, I watched dark figures of men darting wildly about...our own accompanying infantry diving for cover. What was happening? Then realization hit me like a slap in the face...the water tins on the back of the Mk III had been hit. As I grabbed for the hatch, I was already giving the order to the gunner to traverse the turret. &ldquo;Schnell.&rdquo; One comprehensive glance had taken it all in and fear all but overwhelmed me. Not 50 yards away, a slowly-rising wisp of white smoke gave away the position of the 45mm anti-tank gun pointed straight at the panzer, pointed...so it seemed anyway, straight between my eyes. &ldquo;Hard Right!&rdquo; Beyond it were supporting Russian infantry&mdash;all too visible now behind their chattering small arms fire and the louder, staccato hammering of a supporting heavy machine gun. &ldquo;CLANG&rdquo; The tank shuddered with the reverberation of a direct hit against the front of the revolving turret. The added 30mm of frontal armour had saved them this time. Now quickly before they can reload...&rdquo;Fire.&rdquo; &#10;&#10;This is CROSS OF IRON...a gripping game of tactical combat on the Russian Front. Following in the footsteps of its amazingly successful predecessor, CROSS OF IRON comes replete with an entirely restructured armour and artillery system, which does for armour combat what its predecessor, SQUAD LEADER, did for infantry actions. In fact, the first thing the game instructs you to do is throw away your old artillery and armour counters to make way for their expanded revised counterparts. Each AFV now has three separate MG factors, turret position differentiation, &ldquo;button up&rdquo; penalties and advantages, target size differentiation, varying amour modifiers and much more. CROSS OF IRON again utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 8 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The 36-page rulebook starts in where the SQUAD LEADER rules left off...at section 63 and continues on to section 103. An expanded Campaign Game enables players to simulate virtually any action of their choosing with a vastly enlarged counter mix encompassing virtually every AFV which saw action in WWII...from the diminutive BT5 to the mammoth King Tiger.&#10;&#10;CROSS OF IRON is more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER, it provides a system which can be used to portray any Eastern Front action. Be forewarned! CROSS OF IRON is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered SQUAD LEADER.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each game you get:&#10;&#10;     520 double-printed &frac12;&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that made up the combatants of the Eastern Front.&#10;     576 double-printed &#226;&#133;&#157;&quot; vehicular and artillery counters encompassing the entire OB of the war in Russia.&#10;     An additional 8&quot; &times; 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard section increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types.&#10;     Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rule booklet.&#10;     Scenario Cards for game situations 13-20.&#10;     Two expanded Quick Reference Data Cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;New features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        Rockets&#10;&#10;        Infantry Guns&#10;&#10;        Range Effects on Penetration&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Paratroop Drops&#10;&#10;        Burning AFVs&#10;&#10;        Reverse Movement&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Armour Leaders&#10;&#10;        Ammo Depletion&#10;&#10;        Rumanians&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Target Acquisition&#10;&#10;        Intensive Fire&#10;&#10;        Height Advantage&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Molotov Cocktails&#10;&#10;        Stukas&#10;&#10;        Anti-Tank Magnetic Mines&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        SS&#10;&#10;        Marsh, Gullies &amp; Forest-Roads&#10;&#10;        Prisoners&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Bore Sighting&#10;&#10;        AT Rifles&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Armoured Cars&#10;&#10;        Volksgrenadiers &amp; Conscripts&#10;&#10;        &hellip; and much, much more&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Cavalry&#10;&#10;        Snipers&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Partisans&#10;&#10;        Fire &amp; Weather Effects&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Anti-Aircraft Guns&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;        Critical Hits&#10;&#10;        &#10;&#10;        &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Ownership of SQUAD LEADER is necessary to play this game.&#10;&#10;",

The credits they used to purchase the cards go into the pot.  After everyone had their chance to improve their hands (or had quit the round by folding), they reveal their improved 5-card hands and the player with the best hand (according to standard poker rules) takes all of the pot.

Each player is given two figures and stands for each of his ships, allowing him to see his old position while figuring his next movement (the extra ships are in play only during that ship's movement) - optional rules allow play with single figures. Each ship has a &quot;fighter display&quot; for tracking status. Weapons include a variety of lasers; the advanced rules add the paralyzer &quot;glue&quot; gun; resource rules also cover bombs, rockets, and missiles. Data is provided for four fighters plus non-combatants. The rulebook also provides Mission Builder random mission and campaign rules, a pilot development system, and a brief introduction to lunar terrain.&#10;&#10;Boxed set includes:&#10;&#10;80-page, 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; rules booklet&#10;    Quick Start/Frequently Asked Questions sheet&#10;    4 Ship Display sheets&#10;    Assembly Instructions sheet (for the flight stands)&#10;    Example Engagement pamphlet&#10;    two template sheets&#10;    blister pack containing 2x Wardog and 2 x Moondragon ship miniatures (manufactured by Rafm)&#10;    ziploc bag containing 2 6-sided dice and 36 red and blue plastic disks (tokens)&#10;    4 unassembled flight stands&#10;        four 3&quot; x 3&quot; x 1.5&quot; varnished wooden blocks (bases)&#10;        four telescoping antennae&#10;        40 plastic 3D joints&#10;&#10;Tactical.

One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?&#10;&#10;To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.&#10;&#10;To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.&#10;&#10;The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.&#10;&#10;When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to enclose a square so that you have more fence pieces surrounding it than any other player.

The game ends when no more plays are available.  The winner is the player or team with the most stones on the board.&#10;&#10;The basic grid size of the board is 8x8 squares.&#10;&#10;",

Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&#10;&#10;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&#10;&#10;",

In the &quot;cool phase,&quot; players draw and discard cards in turn order, with the stipulation that the discarded card must be higher in value than the one drawn. This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you are the leader of a project team in a bookbinding shop. Together with your team (your cards) you try to handle the mountain of incoming job. There are small orders, which are relatively easy to fill but yield only small profit, and big orders, for which a great deal of work must be done. Big jobs also bring big profits, however. The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&quot;&#10;-From English rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Each Cybernetic Attachment card functions as a body part, 1 unit of Cyber-Power (like the power sources from the base game, Gaia,Alien,Chemical,Radiation,Fire,Electricity), and 2 points of Armor!

Unbeknownst to you, your life is about to change. You curse the postman, as the remains of the shattered letterbox (splinters and all) litter the hall carpet, and a chill Monday-morning breeze whistles through your dressing gown and up the ample trouser of your well-worn pajamas. But this concerns you not, for ripping open the letter reveals a simple house brick with a piece of paper wrapped around it, and a small yellow sticky note attached to the red clay top. The sticky label reads:&#10;&#10;&quot;THROW ME THROUGH YOUR FRONT WINDOW&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Stepping out into the blank a.m. you tut loudly at the myriad gnomes in next door&rsquo;s garden before launching the plain building component, with fullest force, through the ornate Georgian bay window &lsquo;pon abode&rsquo;s frontage. Screaming with blue murder and foulest language, you first run into your house, and then emerge again a second later bellowing: &ldquo;what b*****d did that?&rdquo; You look to your left and, thence, to your right in vain hope of catching sight of the vandalistic culprit. Cursing under your breath, you return again to your home and gently close the door.&#10;&#10;The house brick silently mocks you, your moral outrage, and your &lsquo;Mr. Bunny&rsquo; slippers, lying as it does on one of its long sides &ndash; the attached paper is crumpled, but intact. Sweaty-palmed, you pull the note away from its stony guardian and flatten the creased message before reading:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;My dear nephew,&#10;Please forgive my indirectness (and the fact that you may not actually be my nephew) but I have been told (by the giant clams that live on my face) that I have so many relatives that it is nigh on impossible to remember all of your names; so I shall (instead) resort to the simple nomenclature &lsquo;nephew&rsquo;. My mind is not what it used to be &ndash; indeed, it used to be a liver &ndash; that being said, I address you as one of the potential beneficiaries of my capacious legacy! &ldquo;Your capacious legacy?&rdquo; I hear you cry &ndash; Yes! You will, with a bit of luck, by this time next week, be quite incredibly and most-certainly indecently wealthy. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; I hear you retort. The answer is very simple &ndash; you will attend my funeral this coming Friday and, once the merriment and festivity has subsided, you will kill everyone else in the house. That&rsquo;s all &ndash; nothing complicated. The last person alive in the building when Monday (and my tall solicitor) comes will inherit my vast fortune, my enormous financial holdings, and my capacious legacy!&#10;&#10;Best Wishes&#10;Great Uncle Sir Hesketh Goodbody Three-Choirs Overcoat (Deceased)&#10;&#10;PS.

No blue jeans.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;You stand amazed &ndash; Fate has saved you the last slice of Viennetta and stands poised to either offer it lovingly for consumption, or ram it in your face until you weep like a pansied fop. Are you up to the challenge?&#10;&#10;Summary (in plain English): The object is to be the last player left in the game with life counters, while all the other players have lost theirs.&#10;&#10;Download the cards and rules for free from www.surprisedstaregames.co.uk&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game about weathermen where the object is to predict the correct weather. Doing this correctly moves&#10;a frog up a ladder -- the player with the highest frog at game end is the winner. Play revolves around 36 weather cards which have different weather symbols; 1, 2 or 3 white or black clouds. The board is a 4x4 grid with pictures of different houses along the vertical and horizontal planes, the higher the house, the better the initial weather. The game starts with weather tiles being randomly placed face down onto the grid. The tiles stay that way for much of the game, which means Donnerwetter has a memory element. The idea is to place your prediction marker and trying to change the weather tiles to match. The rest of the game is spent moving and laying tiles with limited intelligence, trying to get your predictions to come right.&#10;&#10;Designed for ages  Ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reichzeichen (Smoke Signals) is a set collecting memory game.  There are two types of square cards - &quot;narrow smoke&quot; and &quot;wide smoke&quot;. On the reverse side of the wide smoke cards are various landscapes. The narrow smoke cards contain horizons (end caps, think El Caballero)and clouds. A stream of nine cards is placed rising up from a fire;  the narrow smoke cards are always face down, the wide smoke cards are first shown to everyone and then placed face down.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you point to one of the wide smoke cards from spaces 4-9 (not the first three next to the fire) and claim what it is.  If correct, you take it and keep going until you miss.  The smoke raisings (?? don't know what this means!) the smoke raisings????....) with each card taken and new cards are added to the bottom.  Alternatively you can take a narrow card.  If it is a horizon, you take it and your turn ends.  If a cloud, the rain gets closer and this paces the game.  You need horizons to score so you will take this action often.&#10;&#10;You score by creating complete landscapes.  Each wide smoke card gets 5 points, narrow smoke cards get 1, and there are bonuses for special collections of landscape cards.  The game uses money simply, making you pay the previous player if you take the card they incorrectly identified. In close games the money at the end can be influential.&#10;&#10;",
