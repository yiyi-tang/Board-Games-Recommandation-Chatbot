    "Description": "Shut the Lines is a simple but very interesting dice game for 2 to 4 players. The game requires a big deal of mental arithmetic and the ability to think strategically. The goal of the game is to cover as many number rows on the game plan with the playing chips  of your colour as possible. The players roll dice, calculate and try to cover the fields of the rows with their playing chips. You only get a point if you can cover a complete number row. The one who has the most points in the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a cooperative game where the goal is to finish the chosen scenario with every character alive (at least with 1 hit point left).&#10;&#10;Before playing, you must chose a scenario (there's also an option for custom game) by putting together 4 square pieces to make a square board and using tokens which will be used to accomplish the quest of the scenario.&#10;&#10;The goal of a scenario can be to find specific tiles or kill a specific enemy for example.&#10;&#10;On each colored emplacement of the board you put a tile face down. Tiles can be enemies, quest items, gold or bonuses. There also are shop tiles.&#10;&#10;Each player chose a character between Ruel, Evangeline, Yugo or Tristepin and take the corresponding card and figurine. Each card shows the character's hit points, inventory space, which dice they use to attack and defend (4, 6 or 8 faces). Each character also has a different set of tokens which represent which actions they can do.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence is players play first, then monsters.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, each player secretly choose their 3 actions at the same time, then they reveal the 3 actions together.&#10;&#10;Turn order is always the same : Ruel plays first, then it's Tristepin, Evangeline and Yugo last.&#10;&#10;Every player plays one action in this order until everyone has played their 3 actions.&#10;&#10;Actions are : &#10;- movement : When a character arrives on a quarter of the board, all the tiles of that quarter are turned face up.&#10;&#10;- hand to hand or bow attack : to attack, the player rolls the corresponding dice as shown on their character's card. If it's higher than the monster's armor, the player wins and the monster tile is discarded and the player earns money.&#10;&#10;- spell : only yugo has the spell action which he can use to teleport.&#10;&#10;- gift an item to someone (so they can heal or to have more room in the inventory)&#10;&#10;When everyone has played their 3 actions it's the monsters' turn: Each player has a monster color, randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Each player moves and makes an attack with the monster which is on a tile the color he has.&#10;&#10;Monsters always attack in the same way. Monsters who are on a red tile attacks Tristepin, yellow attack Ruel, green attack Evangeline and Blue attack Yugo.&#10;&#10;Monsters attack the same way the players do. If the monsters are successful, the player attacked loses hit points on their character's card.&#10;&#10;The game continue this way until the scenario goal is reached (all the players win) or until one of the players has no more hit point (all the players lose).&#10;&#10;&quot;Choose your favorite character and make a team ready to fight the terrible Bouftous.&#10;Together, Tristepin, Yugo, Evangelyne and Ruel will overcome thrilling quests!&#10;Your missions? Find Ruel's lost Kamas, avoid Miss Moches' kisses or hunt Bouftous. If you need a better equipement, visit Kabrok the shoppkeeper.&#10;&quot;Wakfu, le jeu d'aventure&quot; is a cooperative game where all the players fight, win together and share the loot.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "North Korea is Best Korea is a medium-weight strategy eurogame in which players portray prominent Generals in the Great Leader's regime.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will be improving the country's logistical, industrial, propaganda and defense infrastructure, as well as undertaking special and secret projects and dealing with unexpected events and the actions of the Imperialists enemy. All those actions will earn the player the Great Leader's favor, which having the most of, is by itself the game's sole victory condition. But the Great Leader's favor can also be spent to obtain resources, so the players must carefully measure when and how much to bank on that political capital.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts North Korea and is divided by geographical regions, One distinctive mechanism of the game is the elaborate use of shared resources within the country, meaning that, in a turn, a player must activate a whole region, paying the activation cost of all buildings there, regardless of which player they belong to. The player may also use the power and railway networks, built by any player, to pay those costs, and that would result in them gaining the favor of the Great Leader.&#10;The international aspect is also an involved semi-cooperative system of several intertwined elements, ranging from smuggling arms and workers to other rogue countries, buildings defenses against Imperialist's air attacks, up to the dreaded nuclear project. This military aspect is equally important as the economic one, since it often carries punishing results and a number of losing conditions.&#10;&#10;With its abstracted mechanisms and the graphical use of the actual idealistic aesthetic of the North Korean regime's propaganda, the game manages to remain suitable for younger audiences. Adults, nonetheless, will recognize in the bizarre cartoony card images the sharp contrast with the known realities of the country.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This is the time in which great men can show their value and fools their weakness.&#10;&#10;In a tight 1 vs 1, players will challenge each other, turn after turn, in wrestling control of the map and its resources. To win, a player needs either 5 aligned pieces at the end of any round or having acquired more fame at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The goals above are pursued using actions - represented on double faced cards - that require specific combinations of resources, therefore making placement on the map critical.&#10;Actions with greater impact need more resources, leading players to increase the quantity they control. To this purpose, player can use centuriae, camps and forts, each with their own strength and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s important to foresee your opponent&rsquo;s moves and plans while advancing yours, since available actions change each turn: when a player takes an action, the used one leaves place to the one on the rear of the card.&#10;A main characteristic of Frumentaria is replayability, granted by the layout of the map, which is different in every game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

First you have to visit the local surf shop and get yourself a great surfboard. Now the surfing fun can begin. The players try to qualify for surf contests which take place from time to time. The contest is then be held between the players who qualified for it. Special contest cards are used for this. Trying to win a contest is action-packed and thrilling for everyone involved. The player who won the most contests at the end of the game is the winner. But beware! Sometimes there are riptides or even a shark appears in the clear blue waters. Then you have to leave the water again. But you can prepare yourself. Put a lifeguard station on your beach so that dangerous ripcurrents can not harm you any more. Or engage with the local fishermen to catch the shark out of your waters. There are many more special effects that may happen. Some jellyfish might help you, or you can take some extra surfing training. But beware of the tropical thunderstorms which sometimes hit this paradise island! There is a lot to experience during your summer vacation - maybe even a summer romance might happen to you if you are lucky! Enjoy the summer with BlueGetaway!&#10;&#10;BlueGetaway is a picture based card game and is not related to any specific language. It is suited for families and parties as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

During the first (astronomer) part of the game, players will be travelling across the Earth in order to complete celestial observations. This way, navigation knowledge (NK) is gathered for the space race endgame. The second (astronaut) part will use knowledge points to tackle technical and navigational obstacles. By efficiently using the on-board lunar telescope, sextant and gyroscope, players will push their luck with their newly acquired and cunning abilities. As an astronomer, players will explore different cultural settings and discover anthropological links with astronomy.&#10;&#10;1 ASTRONOMER&#10;While the time keeps on ticking and the celestial bodies keep on shifting positions, players scan the world for clues and means to finish some objectives in order to be the best prepared astronaut at the space race.&#10;Different scientific discoveries will unlock powers of astronomical instruments to shape time and space to your favour. The evolution of astronomical instruments marks new possibilities in obtaining the ultimate skill to reach for the Moon.&#10;During the astronomy part of the game the best and only the most necessary choices need to be made. The optimal strategy with the right cultural ability needs to be exploited to gain the perfect timing to leap ahead.&#10;&#10;2 ASTRONAUT&#10;Once players are ready to push their luck, they will shape the future of Earthlings. Whether it is a trip to the Moon a half a century ago, or in the near future, the knowledge of the stars will guide each player towards another world. The investments in past observations and the acquired abilities before launch will help to mark your fate as the best or worst astronavigator.&#10;You need to anticipate moves of other players and take the necessary, yet minimal, risk at the right time! The first able to master all the spaceflight techniques to the Moon and back is likely to become the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Los Angeles is a standalone co-op game set in the universe of UnderWorld. This game brings with it a whole new single player/co-op game mode, introducing threat decks and battle scenarios to challenge the players, providing a gaming experience for the players that is entirely different from versus duels. Players could easily jump into a game of Los Angeles without having to have played any of the previous releases of UnderWorld.&#10;&#10;In this game, the once prosperous Los Angeles has entered into a crisis. Players will lead their secret society to deal with all kinds of dangerous missions--from saving civilians, maintaining order to resolving a series of supernatural events, fighting against monsters from the void and criminals who are taking advantage of the chaos, and finally face against a god from an alien world who just awoke from slumber, along with the true villain who has been orchestrating the chaos from behind the scenes. This expansion brings with it a main story line made up of four chapters for the players to experience the whole campaign in its entirety. Furthermore, the numerous side quests/hidden scenarios, multiple difficulty levels, accumulative honor points with an upgrade system for the secret society ensures replay-ability. Finally, this expansion also comes with a quick challenge mode, players could ignore the story and duel against the AI as if it was a versus mode between two players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from

    "Description": "In many countries it is dangerous to be a Christian and they must meet in secret. The government sees them as a major threat and has engaged the secret service. As Secret Service agents conduct house searches, patrol and guard the border, Christians try to smuggle Bibles and do their best to spread the gospel. Who can you trust?&#10;&#10;The game if playable for groups of 2-20 players. It is suitable for large groups of 10 to 20 players as a group game and for 2-9 players in the form of a card game! Including an accessible conversation starter from Open Doors about prosecution.&#10;&#10;CARDGAME 2-9 players&#10;In the card game for 2-9 players, every player receives a (hidden) role card that decides whether he's in team &quot;believers&quot; or &quot;secret agents&quot;. Players also get 3-5 character cards, depending on the amount of players. There are &quot;believers&quot; and &quot;secret agents&quot; among those cards, these are the cards people will try to collect. Most of the other cards are action cards that may help people achieve their goals, like viewing another players role card, forcing other players to discard, grab a specific card from the discard pile or even change your role card with another player to switch teams.&#10;&#10;Players will need to make sure that all of the cards in their hand fit their role card to win. When a player only has character cards fitting its role, he wins for the amount of card +2 bonus points. Teammates will be awarded the amount of cards MINUS the character cards fitting their role, making it a valid strategy as well not to collect those cards and actively trying to help their teammates. Players can also collect as many cards from the other team and try to switch to that team. All in all, a rather quick and dynamic card game for 2-9 players.&#10;&#10;GROUP GAME 10-20 players&#10;When playing with 10-20 players, it is a role playing game. There's a game leader who hands every player a character card and. The group is basically divided in two (equally strong) teams of believers and secret agents. The game is played in 7 &quot;nights&quot; where every player will close their eyes until they want to perform an action. All players can only choose one action to perform. In general the believers can choose one of two options: either smuggle bibles or try to convert agents. The secret agents can try to stop both. The game leader registers the amount of players for each action. Believers are successful if they gain a majority over the secret agents &quot;defending&quot; and option. Converting secret agents can be a strong strategy because not only it may &quot;create&quot; a new believer, but also reduces the amount of secret agents. However, it is not without dangers: if the secret agents have a majority guarding against that action, it may result in a believer being arrested.&#10;&#10;Some of the believers and secret agents have special abilities that may help their teams successfully achieve their goals. Like a detective (secret agent) who can try to arrest believers and a lawyer (believer) who can exonerate them or characters that can gather and communicate extra information. Other special characters make the game even more dynamic, like a &quot;traitor&quot; (starting as a believer but automatically switching to the secret agents after 3 rounds are played) and its &quot;researcher&quot; mirror character (starting as secret agent and becoming a believer after 3 rounds).&#10;&#10;Believers win if they successfully smuggle bibles 4 out of 7 rounds or if they convert all secret agents. Secret agents win if they prevent the smuggling of bibles 4 times or if they arrest all believers. &#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To play the games all you need are Six-sided dice (D6), ideally 1D12 although you could use 2D6, your own models, terrain to represent the landscape of your battlefield and a ruler.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Before starting the first turn, each player draws 5 cards. They are not  allowed to draw more than 5 cards during each turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 3 phases. &#10;Market phase : Every turn, each player has to buy cards from the market, starting  with the first player. All bought cards from the market are put in the discard. &#10;Hero phase : During this phase, each player, starting with the first player, has to  activate one or two heroes on the board. 2 actions are available (one more action if you have the corresponding card in hands). &#10;Zombies phase :&#10;During this phase, each player moves his zombies on the board, starting with the first player. Each zombie move straight away to its motion value.&#10;&#10;Zombies are not affected by other zombies even if they  are enemies. If there is a zombie finishing his movement in the same tile as  another zombie, put it on the next tile. Sometimes a zombie will meet  an hero. Stop the zombie in the adjacent tile to the hero and this  one is wounded equal to the strength of the zombie. ALL heroes are affected by ALL zombies. This means that your heroes can be wounded by your own zombies!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In reality some of these ships never left the design stage, some were scrapped and some were turned into aircraft carriers to avoid wasting the hulls.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes additional hypothetical ships for Great Britain, Germany, The United States of America and the Empire of Japan.  &#10;Because some of the proposed ships were monsters I have introduced both a new gun calibre (colour) and a new Armour Colour; in both cases Black. &#10;It represents 16&rdquo; to 18&rdquo; guns planned for these monsters and the proposed uber levels of armour some of them were to have.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In each district there are some important places identified (divided into categories, e.g. Art or Spiritual Life) represented by tokens. The winner is the player who first collects a certain number of tokens of a certain type.&#10;&#10;An online knowledge platform is integrated into the game. On each of the elements (board tiles, tokens) there are QR codes, which link to pages with descriptions of districts and places in the game. The platform was prepared under the supervision of the Jagiellonian University staff. In the game there are also cards with important events from the history of the city, which introduce minor modifications to the game (e.g. give extra traffic to the player).&#10;&#10;The game is not available for sale. It was distributed for free at promotional events and is available in city libraries.&#10;&#10;",

Whilst the mechanisms are very different to my other rules sets the idea of making them as fast and fun as possible remain the same, even though missile armed warships are by their nature immensely complicated&#10;&#10;I am making this set of rules FREE. 2 reasons for this.&#10;&#10;&#10;     1st I am using them as an introduction to my other rules sets which are all a lot of fun to play and very cheap to buy!  So download for nothing and if they peak your interest check out my other rules sets  put &quot;Dawn Gaming&quot; in the search bar and see what you like, many of them have a free sampler and I cover a number of interesting periods in history.&#10;&#10;&#10;I am not going to go into great detail about these rules.... they are free!  Just download the whole set.&#10;&#10;&#10;     And the 2nd reason is that they are not exhaustive, I have put stats in for a number of Soviet and US ships subs and aircraft but this is certainly not an exhaustive set of data.  &#10;&#10;&#10;If people like the game I may do additional data sets (for free) but you can probably knock your own up anyway.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer / publisher&#10;&#10;",
