    "Description": "Charlie Murray Grant is the third generation, son of Charles Stewart, and he too has inherited a passion for the wargame hobby. Charlie, with his own 20mm World War Two armies, has developed his late grandfather's rules, added to them and provided a play sheet and instructions for refighting one of the original scenarios. In addition Charlie has added six chapters which were not in the original publication but which appeared in the Mecanno Magazine. In his own words &quot;Battle has stood the test of time and with new content and play sheets it provides an excellent set of rules for up to company level actions&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brigadier General&#10;&#10;An element based World War II miniatures solo wargame with a d6 based system, Regiment &amp; Brigade level battles.&#10;Think of yourself as a Colonel or Brigadier General and that your concern is not so much what individual weapons or tactics a unit has but what its function is within your command.&#10;&#10;It is assumed that you are a solo wargamer and that most of the terms in our book will already be familiar to you. Our goal with Brigadier General was to provide a fun and simple game with the ability to cover battles both real and imagined from 1931 to 1958. This is not a complicated game to produce historical results, but rather a simple game with a World War II setting . Remember when reading as well playing our game, to look upon them from the viewpoint of a solo wargamer.&#10;&#10;We do not define ground &amp; time scales in our games, instead we opt for what feels right on the table. Brigadier General uses blocks of troops which we call elements vice individual soldiers. Normally elements of troops in Brigadier General equate to a military company or depending on the game/scenario sometimes a battalion. However they can be scaled to suit any battle. Given the constraints in game, each player force would approximate a brigade, combat command or regimental team, hence our game&rsquo;s name.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Balance of Power are a set of horse and musket rules that allow players to fight battles with multiple corps per side in a reasonable amount of time.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is 15 minutes, &#10;     each infantry unit approx 1000 men, &#10;     each cavalry unit approx 500 and &#10;     each artillery unit 12 guns. &#10;&#10;&#10;The rules emphasise easy to play game mechanics at the unit level so that a large number of units can be fielded.&#10;&#10;Corps and army level morale as well as command and control rules mean that players are concentrating on what their major formations are doing as opposed to the finer details of what each individual unit is up to. Units themselves are defined by their troop quality giving them a &lsquo;combat value&rsquo; that is used to calculate the effects of their fire, melee and how much punishment they can take before they break and flee.&#10;&#10;Balance of Power allows players to fight battles from the French Revolution through to the 1870&rsquo;s. They keep the detail and enjoyment of fighting with lots of units on table by making the actual game mechanics of combat and firing simple enough so that there is little or no need to refer to charts and tables. Players will find that historical tactics, bombardment, support, reserves and combined arms all go towards achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The base game rules are quickly learned and a few players a side can cope with the largest battles. This allows battles to be fought through to a conclusion which makes them ideal for campaign games.&#10;&#10;The aim of the rules is to give players time to develop plans, manoeuvre, conduct preparatory bombardments, all of which sees battles unfold in a historical manner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each individual player has asymmetric abilities on venture cards drawn from the deck that can develop over time. Teams compete to assist customers from the deck. Successfully assisted customers can be used to: 1. build their team's deck, 2. develop individual ventures, or 3. score. Rules for odd-number of players and solo-play are included.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is a 21st century modern setting, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer technologies that have become ubiquitous. Players on a team cooperate. Teams may choose to cooperate and negotiate, and assist customers (semi-cooperative) leading to lively group discussion and dynamics. The game uses simple math and card melds to determine who successfully assists customers.&#10;&#10;There are three mutually-exclusive competing objectives: 1. to develop your team's deck, 2. to develop individual player's venture and 3. to score customers. Teams compete to assist customers and then the team has to chose how to use that customer card towards the three key objectives.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If the problem is solved, the player who contributed the most gets the card, which will be worth one point in the final count, which will attribute the victory to the player who has been able to solve the greatest number of problems.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A terrible beast is slaying scores of innocents, and particularly relishes in targeting young women and children. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, 1764, the Bishop of Mende proclaims the Beast a scourge sent by God to punish the people for their wicked ways. The people are commanded&#10;to pray and repent, but this only serves to increase terror across the region and stoke the flames of superstition.  and organize an effective response to the situation. The story of The Beast is immediately spun into one of the first sensationalized and most influential media crazes. Captivating imaginations across France, Europe and beyond, the rising number of &ldquo;unnatural deaths&rdquo; increases the demand for publications such as the Courrier d&rsquo;Avignon. All the while the beast remains unchecked.&#10;&#10;Players enter the scene in January 1765, where they take on the role of hunters in pursuit of the Beast. Some have come for holy reasons, believing they combat the Devil&rsquo;s manifestations on Earth. Others are driven by altruistic motives, hoping to save more innocents from being slaughtered by the menace. There are&#10;those with less honorable reasons too, obsessed with seeking fame and fortune in slaying the Beast. And a diabolical few have more sinister motives, hoping to use the events as a smokescreen for their own personal vendettas and dark deeds. Veteran hunters also flock to the area just for sport, as this is a hunt for the ages! If they hope to succeed, players will need to curry favor with one of the four estates, through whose generosity they will gain superiority on the hunt. And with luck on their side, they might finally bring an end to The Beast of G&eacute;vaudan&rsquo;s reign of terror!&#10;&#10;The game themes  and mechanics revolve  around the following:&#10;&#10;the Mystery of the Beast: A Novel Mechanic where the Nature of the Beast can be one of 24 options, which players try to discover during the game to prepare for the Final Hunt!&#10;&#10;Spinning Narratives: Dealing with the Four Estates and secret patrons to spin the public opinion of what the Nature of the Beast is&hellip; and gain Influence above your rivals!&#10;&#10;Deception and Secret Agendas: There are numerous ways to gain the most Influence and win the game&hellip; tactics and strategy are key to being triumphant!&#10;&#10;Psychological Trauma and Animal Companions: The use of Fear and Trauma mechanics to help players also appreciate the terror people faced in those dark times&hellip; and that one&rsquo;s faithful hound or trusty steed was all the treatment that existed back then!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The UFAG C.I was a two&ndash;seat biplane that served the Austrian Air Service in many roles. First released in April 1918 and intended to update or replace earlier observation airplanes, its excellent speed and handling saw the UFAG C.I used for everything from escorting observation airplanes to ground attack to light bombing. The fastest two-seater produced by the Central Powers, its Hungarian manufacturer could not keep up with demands and only about 170 had been delivered when the war ended.&#10;&#10;UFAG C.I (161&ndash;37)&#10;In an attempt to improve UFAG&rsquo;s firepower against enemy fighters, a second forward&ndash;firing machine gun was experimentally added to this airplane. This model has special cards to reflect the upgrade.&#10;&#10;UFAG C.I (Flik 62/S)&#10;Flik 62 was originally a divisional observation unit, formed in Trentino, Italy. It was turned into a ground attack unit, and renamed Flik 62/S, when it was equipped with the UFAG C.I.&#10;&#10;UFAG C.I (161&ndash;138)&#10;As a high&ndash;performing 2&ndash;seater, available in limited numbers, the UFAG C.I was often reserved for the best available crews. This model has special cards to reflect that.&#10;&#10;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Breguet 14 was one of the best all&ndash;round Allied two&ndash;seaters of the war, produced in large quantities for both recon and light bombing. Constructed largely of duraluminum and welded steel tubing, the airplane was light, sturdy, and very fast, with many features that were revolutionary for the day. It was the most common French two&ndash;seater in 1918 and was also used by USA and Belgium. This aircraft was widely used for both day and night bombing in the last year of the war. About 8000 were built before the war ended.&#10;&#10;Breguet BR.14 B2 (Escadrille Br 111)&#10;Breguet 14s were assigned to Escadrille 111 in October 1917. During the war, the unit scored 15 victories. This model includes cards for optional armament and crew skills.&#10;&#10;Breguet BR.14 B2 (Audinot/Hellouin De C&eacute;nival)&#10;Audinot and Hellouin de C&eacute;nival flew several bombing missions of Escadrille BR 127 from November 1917. They were shot down by enemy fighters during a daring mission, on March 28, 1918.&#10;&#10;Breguet BR.14 A2 (Stanley/Folger)&#10;Gilbert Stanley and H.T. Folger belonged to the 96th Squadron, that operated from June 12, 1918 to the end of the war engaging in daring bombing missions across the front.&#10;&#10;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As well as bringing the events and spirit of the Reformation closer to the body and bringing it to life, the game provides an excellent team building and community experience, and can therefore be an excellent tool for communication and networking.&#10;&#10;The cards contain information on one side of the question and the question itself, and the answer on the other side, with details of the sources. The cards also indicate the degree of difficulty of the question, with three grades to distinguish between the more well-known, the more difficult, and the abstract. Logistore can be played in pairs or groups, with a trained referee moderator in the group. We recommend it from the age of fourteen, especially in youth and adult groups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But it is obvious that all big factories are harmful for natural environment. So, you should manage your income wisely: part of the money should be used to protect and restore the environment. Can you have a successful business and be a sustainable user of natural resources? And what is more important &ndash; money or environment? For different players the answer to the question will be different.&#10;&#10;Ecologic will help you model various development scenarios where you must balance environmental and economic concerns &ndash; the key factors of development. The game has a &ldquo;cumulative effect&rdquo;: after playing it several times you will start understanding how to achieve sustainable and balanced development. Later you will learn to see several moves ahead and think strategically.&#10;&#10;Each player (or team) runs a mining company, and the more oil pumps and mineral mines they have on the board, the higher their income. However, every Oil and Mineral Refinery damages the environment and reduces player's Enviro total. There are two indicators in the game: Profits as abstract money and Enviros as the environmental well-being estimation. In Ecologic the ratio and balance between these strongly influences the final score. The more balanced the two indicators are by the end of the game, the higher the victory score.&#10;&#10;GAME MECHANICS&#10;&#10;     The game consists of turns; each turn has four consequent phases: Event, Action, Environment, Income. &#10;     Random Events add unpredictability to the game with each turn.&#10;     All purchases are done via bidding on an auction. The highest bidder gets the goods - just like in real life business!&#10;     Tally up your Profit and Enviro balance every turn, and avoid having to shut down your refineries.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In fact, the battles are becoming some of the most fiercely fought in history.

Play as the stoic Grant, the flamboyant JEB Stuart, the cautious, yet beloved George McClellan, or even the marble man himself, Robert E. Lee.  There are many generals and specialized units from which to choose.&#10;&#10;This first expansion in the Command Combat: Civil War series introduces generals, units, and scenarios for 1862, as well as expanded rules for forts, siege weapons, and the navy.&#10;Just like in the core rulebook, every unit has a points value for creating your own army.  New specialty units include the Louisiana Tigers, the Iron Brigade, and the Orphan Brigade, as well as many others. &#10;Many generals who were in the core rules are expanded in this book, reflecting their changing styles of command as they rose up the ranks.  New generals who made their appearance on the war&rsquo;s stage in 1862 also appear for the first time in these pages.  &#10;Historic scenarios come pre-made with their original army lists.&#10;Included in this book are Shiloh, Pea Ridge, Fort Donelson, Second Bull Run, Perryville, and Seven Pines.&#10;&#10;Combine your army in lists from the core rulebook or any other expansion with armies you build from this book, and siege weapons such as heavy cannon, gunboats, signal towers and the balloon corps, or protect them inside specialized fortifications meant to hold off enemies for extended periods of time.

Some generals who were in the core rules and other expansions return with new features in this book, reflecting their changing styles of command as they rose up the ranks.  New generals who made their appearance on the war&rsquo;s stage in 1863 also appear for the first time in these pages, as well as the rank of army generals to lead multiple corps into battle.&#10;&#10;Historic scenarios come pre-made with their original army lists.&#10;Included in this book are Gettysburg, Champion Hill, and Chickamauga.&#10;&#10;Combine your army in lists from the core rulebook or any other expansion with armies you build from this book.

    "Description": "This battle deals with the situation after the Battle of Eckmuhl and the French pursuit of the Austrians.  General Nansouty with 3 cavalry divisions takes on a significantly smaller Austrian cavalry rearguard attempting to keep the French away from the Austrian main body, giving them time to get away.  There is only cavalry and a handful of artillery batteries in this fight.  It is a wild set of charges and counter-charges, with some intermittent artillery fire, spaced into a couple hours.  So the battle is short and easily played in an afternoon.  Counter density is low and there is some room for maneuver.  Both sides have a chance to win this event.  The more time the Austrians give the main body to escape the better the chance of winning.&#10;&#10;Key Features                                                                     &#10;&#10;        (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; game maps of the Alt-Eglofsheim area&#10;        Approximately 600 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers&#10;        (2) Full Color Order of Battle Charts&#10;        Numerous charts and tables&#10;        (2) Scenarios that allow play on smaller parts of the battle or the entire affair&#10;        Variable combat strengths&#10;        Reduction by Levels of Order&#10;        Cavalry units at the squadron level and artillery at the section level&#10;        Regimental level cavalry units&#10;        Highly detailed without overbearing rules&#10;        Excellent Solitaire Play&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This battle deals with the situation at the start of the Battle for Ulm and the French cutting off of the Austrians.  General Mahler of Marshall Ney's VI Corps is ordered to the south bank of the Danube.  The general is faced by Austrians under the command of Baron D'Aspre who are positioned on the opposite bank of the Danube and are well supported.  Mahler splits his force into three groups and attempts to take the three bridges in the area.  His main force has no success in getting across the Danube in the center of his line, but they do capture the Baron and put his force into the dark with lesser leadership.  Meanwhile, a bit further north, one French regiment manages to cross the Danube and proceeds to overwhelm a strong Austrin force guarding the crossing.  Mahler then orders his remaining regiments to maneuver to the successful crossing site and together Mahler's divisions defeats the Austrians.&#10;&#10;Key Features:                                                                  &#10;&#10;    (8) 11&quot; x 17&quot; game maps of the Gunzburg area&#10;    (1) Full Color Order of Battle Charts&#10;    Approximately 500 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers&#10;    (4) Scenarios that allow play on smaller parts of the battle or the entire affair&#10;    Numerous charts and tables&#10;    Variable combat strengths&#10;    Reduction by Levels of Order&#10;    Infantry units at company level, Cavalry units at the squadron level, and artillery at the section level&#10;    Battalion level infantry, and Regimental level cavalry units&#10;    Highly detailed without overbearing rules&#10;    Excellent Solitaire Play&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This battle is the First Contact of the Ulm campaign.  It set the tone for the entire campaign and gave the French an immense boost of confidence.  Napoleon has ordered his Advance Guard, consisting of part of Murat's Reserve Cavalry and Lannes' Vth Corps, to begin the swing around to the south and east of Ulm, in order to cut off Mack from Vienna.  Mack, being a bit in the dark about the French maneuvers, sent a force under Baron Auffenberg, to determine where the French were.  The Baron's force marched into a very bad situation where his troops, mostly grenadiers, was seriously outnumbered.  A member of the French Impaerial Staff, General Kellerman, happened to be forward with the troops.  He saw a small group of Austrians in the town of Hohenreichen and ordered the Dragoons he was with the dismount and clear out the Austrians.  It was a small affair, but one that showcased the Dragoons ability to fight as infantry.  The Dragoons success in pushing out the small Austrian force led to the scenarios that are included in the game.  In the end the Austrian force was eliminated as a threat to Napoleons plan to surround and capture Mack's force.&#10;&#10;Key Features:                                                                   &#10;&#10;      (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; game maps of the Wertingen area&#10;      Approximately 800 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers&#10;      (2) Scenarios that portray the Main Battle starting around noon, and the Austrian movement back to the main position.&#10;        Full Color Order of Battle Charts&#10;        Numerous charts and tables&#10;        Variable combat strengths&#10;        Reduction by Levels of Order&#10;        Infantry units at company level, Cavalry units at the squadron level, and artillery at the section level&#10;        Battalion level infantry, and Regimental level cavalry units&#10;        Highly detailed without overbearing rules&#10;        Excellent Solitaire Play&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A Medieval Skirmish Wargame&#10;&#10;Swords, mud and blood.&#10;&#10;Medieval man to man fighting was brutal and unpleasant but there's no reason your game rules should be.&#10;&#10;Chevauchee takes the familiar, fast-moving engine from FiveCore and adapts it to medieval skirmish warfare.&#10;&#10;Features include:&#10;&#10;     Warband level gameplay where you can get to know each member of your army.&#10;     Simple D6-based combat mechanics that combine morale and injury into a single roll.&#10;     Systems to build almost any medieval (or fantasy) weapon you can think of.&#10;     Full detailed campaign rules letting you follow a warband across multiple encounters and random events. &#10;     Random character creation providing you with a strong roleplaying element.&#10;     Character skills, letting each individual be a unique contributor to your noble crusade... or petty thievery.&#10;     The &quot;Fief&quot; campaign, letting you run your own petty domain. Hope the peasants aren't too revolting!&#10;     Written by the incredibly talented Tom Mecredy, utilizing the FiveCore skirmish rules as a base.&#10;&#10;&#10;Chevauchee is suitable for games of 6-12 figures per side, using any individually based figures.&#10;&#10;While utilizing the base FiveCore system, every mechanic has been tweaked to fit the subject matter.&#10;&#10;Scenario generator and campaign rules are included.

The default is squads of 5-8 infantry models or single vehicles/monsters but nothing would stop you from playing with individual models (Man to Man) or using troop stands with multiple figures per stand).&#10;&#10;Note that unlike some of our games, Squad-Hammer does NOT include explicit solo mechanics though due to the simplicity of the mechanics, it is very easy to play with one player controlling both sides.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "So after much pain, sweat and toil, Hammer of Democracy is available.&#10;&#10;If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with our Hammer series of games, it&rsquo;s a relatively rules-light game for low-level ww2 action, aiming to play very quickly and with minimal rules look-up.&#10;&#10;A typical game ranges from a reinforced platoon up to a company or more and plays in a very small span of time, combining pretty simple mechanics with surprisingly deep tactical play.&#10;&#10;The game is welcoming of open-ended play where target numbers are set by consensus or a GM, as well as offering a more traditional &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; approach with modifiers and tactical factors.&#10;&#10;As always, we offer suggestions for campaign play, a scenario generator and a points system.&#10;&#10;You also get profiles for the more common fighting vehicles and anti-tank guns of the war, complete with the formula to calculate your own points values if you need.&#10;&#10;This also means if you disagree with our factors, you can adjust them as you see fit.&#10;&#10;If you want to play a simple pick-up game, you can generate an overall battle situation and either roll up random forces to play with, bring an army built to a pre-determined points total or any other option you want to employ.&#10;&#10;A key innovation of Hammer of Democracy is the Support system, tying in things like off-map fire and using weapons such as machine guns and anti-tank guns in a way that feels truly combined arms, while forcing hard choices on the player.&#10;&#10;Playtesters have been pretty universally excited about this system and I think you&rsquo;ll find it really cool.&#10;&#10;Lastly of course we offer a tool box of rules for things like radio problems, fighting in the snow and dealing with civilians, as well as troop traits for commando&rsquo;s, die-hards and even special hero characters if you like your gaming a bit more pulp.&#10;&#10;Whether you are already a fan of games like Squad Hammer and Trench Hammer or brand new to the concept, I hope you&rsquo;ll give us a chance to win you over.&#10;&#10;The core mechanics are shared between Trench Hammer and Hammer of Democracy so that should give you a pretty good idea of what you are in for.&#10;&#10;Basic factors&#10;&#10;     All dice used are plain D6&rsquo;s with most rolls made using 2D6.&#10;     There are no &lsquo;Bucket of dice&rsquo; mechanics in play.&#10;     Turn sequence is IGOUGO with reaction options. &#10;     Game turns are very fast, most being resolved in 5 minutes or so.&#10;     Basic elements are squads/sections of infantry or single vehicles.&#10;     Infantry can be based on team stands or individually. &#10;     The rules are nominally intended for 15mm figures but has been tested with anything from 6mm to 1/72 scale.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once overcome, the airplane became the standard for British observation and light bombing, serving through the end of the war. It was nicknamed &ldquo;Harry Tate,&rdquo; after a cockney comedian, who pronounced his name &ldquo;AIR&ndash;EE.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;RAF R.E.8 (30 Squadron)&#10;30 Squadron, including the first Australian airmen, served entirely in the Middle East, even air dropping supplies to the besieged troops at Kut.&#10;&#10;RAF R.E.8 (Marsh/MacKay Dempster)&#10;52 Squadron was the first unit equipped with the R.E.8. It suffered heavy losses&mdash; among them Marsh and MacKay Dempster&rsquo;s airplane &mdash; fighting in the German 1918 offensives.&#10;&#10;RAF R.E.8 (59 Squadron)&#10;59 Squadron went to France in February 1917 with a mix of veterans and rookies.

The D.IIIa version solved many of the problems, with guns repositioned to assist pilot in clearing weapons of jams, and made up the majority of the 1100 airplanes built by war&rsquo;s end, with most of them flown by Bavarian Jastas.&#10;&#10;Pfalz D.IIIa (Berthold)&#10;Rudolf Berthold (44 victories) flew missions from the very beginning of the war until nearly the end, even after having suffered serious injuries in addition to having lost the use of his right arm.&#10;&#10;Pfalz D.IIIa (Holtzem)&#10;Max Holtzem was a German test pilot, flight instructor and member of a Bavarian pursuit squadron. He received the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Bavarian Military Merit Order with Swords.&#10;&#10;Pfalz D.III (Voss)&#10;Werner Voss was a very remarkable pilot that deserved many awards for his numerous enemies shot down in combat (48 victories), and a good friend of Manfred Von Richtofen.&#10;&#10;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a large park, where many people are doing picnics and having fun, they do not imagine that many ants are preparing to the winter. In this game, people will play different anthills creating paths and lanes around food, trying to create the most efficient way to gather resources for a strong winter. However, in their way, they may encounter other ants or even bigger bugs that could serve as a threaten to their plans. &#10;In each round, players will be able to improve they anthill to be able to gather and stock more food, build paths around the resources to prevent other anthills to compete for that food and fight against enemy bugs to protect their lives.&#10;&#10;",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Aggretsuko is an expansion for any standalone title in the Funkoverse line-up that features the title character from the animated show of the same name.&#10;&#10;",
