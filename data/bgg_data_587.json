    "Description": "THE GREAT WALL STREET FORTUNE HUNT is an authentic computerized model of the real investment world. The opportunities for investment in the game represent the thousands of alternatives available on the various exchanges. &#10;You'll find conservative blue chips like IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) and high risk high flyers like WOW (Wildcat Oil Western). You'll find the fast food industry represented by McDonald's Corporation and high technology manufacturers represented by Texas Instruments.&#10;&#10;Each of the companies available for investment not only represents itself but other similar companies as well. Therefore the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) also represents Shell, Mobil, Arco and the other large petroleum companies.&#10;&#10;Each of the investments has a different sensitivity to the news flashes which come across the TV screen. For example - some investments will go up at a time of world crisis and others will go down. The inherent sensitivity of each investment to the various categories of news is graphically displayed on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate objective is to anticipate investment fluctuations swiftly enough to take full advantage of the many buying and selling opportunities which will occur in a different way every time you play.&#10;&#10;The rules of The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt are designed to replicate real life as closely as possible. You can play it at four levels. It is highly recommended that you feel thoroughly comfortable at one level before incorporating the next level as part of the game. Have fun! Make money!!!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 3-player expansion for Krakow 1325 AD adds an exciting new dimension to the basic game. When there are only three players, the team work typical of the standard game is reduced to a pleasant memory. Each player has his own set of Influence Tokens and faces both his opponents in the Intrigue Card game and the struggle for board domination. The rules changes involved are simple, but the tactical options and scope for treachery have multiplied. Of course, final victory still depends on the scores of the Secret Identities, which are not revealed until Game End.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now you're on your own...&quot; is the motto of this expansion, again developed by Peter Struijf and Melchior van Rijn and self-published by Geode Games.&#10;&#10;The 3-player expansion to Krakow 1325 AD will make its debut in October 2009 at Spiel in Essen (Germany). There are two versions: a ziplocked English/Dutch version and a boxed German version (which also contains a complete set of Intrigues and rules in that language).&#10;&#10;Peter wisely decided not to rely on his own high-school education to create the German version. He was overwhelmed when he found Andreas Brandhorst, sci-fi author and translator of almost the entire Discworld (Scheibenwelt) series, willing to translate the texts of the Intrigue cards. The game rules were translated by fellow Boardgamegeek Christian Krach.&#10;&#10;Ownership of the basic game is, probably obviously, required to play the expansion set.&#10;&#10;",

Then the players choose their sales strategies, everything from free trips to low down dirty tricks are at your disposal. And finally you use those strategies to steal customers from your opponents and make the deal. The one who can move the most inventory wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game gets really intense when you have 5-8 players.

While the Craftsmen toil away building clockwork towers to protect the Damsel, the Henchmen horde approaches from all four sides.&#10;&#10;For the Henchmen, it's all about numbers and diversity; getting the right type of unit to the right location at the right time with the right amount of reinforcement. The Henchmen have four different types of units, the rapid moving Assassin, the agile Horseman, the tough Knight, and the destructive Sappers.&#10;&#10;For the Craftsmen, it's all about skillful placement and upgrades of towers. The Craftsmen get to place the Damsel anywhere on the board that they choose. They can place towers anywhere they wish as well, as long as they aren't in range of other towers or the Damsel.&#10;&#10;This game involves only the tiniest bit of luck. Most of the time it is all about tactics and strategy. Do you have what it takes to protect the Damsel? Or is your soul black like that of the Henchmen out to kill her?&#10;&#10;",

Admiral Erich Raeder called this ambitious program Plan Z, and looked to complete it sometime in 1948. When war actually broke out in 1939, none of these ships had been completed or even started.&#10;&#10;Plan Z is a massive expansion set for Second World War at Sea, kicking off a new alternative history setting we&rsquo;re calling The Long War. It features the ships and planes of Plan Z, pitting them against the Royal Navy and the additional ships and planes of its own building plans.&#10;&#10;There are 510 brand-new die-cut (and silky-smooth) pieces. The huge H-class battleships are here, M-class cruisers, P-class battle cruisers and much more.&#10;&#10;There are also over thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged in the North Atlantic in this alternate world. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bismarck, Arctic Convoy and Sea of Iron to enjoy all of the scenarios. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

By the size of approximately 47 inches by 138 inches it includes over 500 land territories and a lot more sea zones. Beside new options in diplomacy e.g. the control of neutral nations and a large research tree, the game uses over 25 different units, each with special skills and attributes.&#10;&#10;In every game round randomly chosen event cards bring political decisions or historical incidents which affects the gameplay. This makes sure that every game of Rising Tide will be a new challenge. By the use of new concepts in combat and movement the game provides a fast gameflow where each player only executes a small action like a single attack or the movement of a few units before the next players turn. Nevertheless Rising Tide is a grand scale boardgame where each match keeps you busy for a long time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Planeto is a fun and entertaining family game that allows the players to learn about environmental issues. The game is a promotional item published by Agfa-Gevaert N.V. as a part of their environmental campaign.&#10;&#10;In Planeto, the players are frogs that are trying to collect a set of ten picture cards and win the game. They do this by rolling a die and moving on the board in either direction.&#10;&#10;Picture cards are gained by landing on a particular space and answering an environmentally themed trivia question correctly. The questions are multiple choices with three options. Answering the question incorrectly forces the player to discard an already collected picture card. Landing on other spaces allows the players to roll the die again or forces them to skip a turn.&#10;&#10;The rules include a simpler variant for younger players that exludes the trivia cards from the game.&#10;&#10;Planeto components:&#10;&#10;1 die&#10;1 board&#10;4 frog pawns&#10;40 picture cards&#10;220 trivia cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Doolhof (translated 'Maze' or 'Labyrinth') is a game in the public domain which comes with some of the game collection boxes. The board is a maze with arrows and hedges. You throw with a die to move your pawn over the board. When you hit a hedge or side of the board, an arrow shows you which direction you have to move next. When your pawn stops on an arrow which is not near a hedge, you have to move that given direction your next turn, resulting in a move backwards. When two pawns are on the same field, the latest pawn has to restart. The winner is the person who reaches the finish first, which sometimes can take a long time. A nice thing about this game is that almost all boards have a different maze pattern.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards have a parachute symbol and other don't. the more parachute you get, the more you multiply the value of the points you take in the last turn.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can draw a card or play a card (not both) and you can have a maximum of 3 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;If two parachutists are on the same zone, they entangle each other and they start &quot;fighting&quot;, they both throw the dice and the winner pushes the other in another free landing zone, but the looser won't take any points at the end of the round. in case of draw, the one that has been moved, return wherever it was.&#10;&#10;Fast, easy, funny with high interactivity with other players and lots of laughs with the illustrations of Angelo Porazzi.&#10;&#10;check it out at&#10;http://www.worldoftwilights.com&#10;&#10;Woosh and Giorgio Vezzini will be present at Essen Fair 2009 Angelo Porazzi Games booth 30 Hall 9.&#10;&#10;",

Xtreme Takeover is a two-player game in which each player starts with an identical team of one general, three officers and five guards in his own compound. On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.&#10;&#10;If a player&rsquo;s figure lands adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.&#10;&#10;Permanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board. Your goal is to break through the wall surrounding the opponent&rsquo;s compound, whether by assulting the wall directly or using special demolition spaces, then occupy his bunker, scoring points for doing so.&#10;&#10;",

Race from start of the Thames to City of London in 151 stops - with each county having a number of pictorial representations.&#10;&#10;According to Whitehouse it was published by Edward Wallis, 42, Skinner Street&#10;&#10;On the later 1850 edition:&#10;This is a geographical race game played on a map of England and Wales. The boardgame is divided into counties with representations of local landmarks and industry. There are 151 playing spaces. The play is a circular one, with the starting space at the River Thames and the end space in London.&#10;&#10;The players are provided with a Card, containing nine Letters, nine Numbers, two Crosses and one Blank, which are to be cut up on the lines with a pair of scissors. The letters are to be distributed one to each player, according to the number about to play, and the remainder laid aside. They are used to mark each player's position o the Game.&#10;&#10;Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game, and read the description aloud. When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him. But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly. Each card to be returned to the bag after drawing. Whoever draws a blank, remains at his former number. After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.&#10;&#10;The details of the boardgame reveal the date of the Great Fire of Plymouth, October 1840 and the land slide at Lyme Regis of 1839.&#10;&#10;",
