    "Description": "Sixteen is an original card game for two players, ages 8 and older. It is easy to learn (about 5 minutes) and takes about 15 minutes to play, though players will find themselves wanting to play again and again before they put the deck away.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt three cards. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table as the draw pile. The cards are numbered 0-6. There are two of every card, but only one zero card for each suit. There are also two wild cards. Players take turns, picking a card, and then adding a card to a fanned-out, face-up play pile.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win a set: when the face-up cards total 16, or when the last three cards in the win pile are all the same color or number. So, you have to pay a lot of attention to what's in the pile, as well as what's in your hand, as well as make some educated guessing about what could very possibly be in you-know-who's hand. If the play pile goes over 16, a &quot;bust&quot; is declared and the other player gets the win. The player with the most sets when all cards have been played wins the round.&#10;&#10;All of this results in some rather delicious strategic implications. The game can become quite competitive, but the elegance of the game, and the element of luck, keep the competition focused, and light-hearted.&#10;&#10;The instructions describe four optional play variations, one of which extends the game play to younger children (perhaps as young as 6), but the game plays best with the recommended ages.&#10;&#10;",

Since selection is simultaneous and the actions are quick to resolve there is very little downtime.&#10;&#10;After resolving actions, the players are awarded points based on the quality of their aeroplane design and their industrial capacity; then a War Status card is drawn to randomly affect the progress of the war. The game ends when the war does, so timing and efficiently using your actions are important factors in victory.&#10;&#10;The game typically lasts about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Wings for the Baron is available from the designer at the game's web site.  Compared to the playtest version, previously distributed for free, this desktop-published game has rules edited for clarity, ten pages of historical notes, more easily distinguished colors, and fully-illustrated cards.&#10;&#10;",

Many of those who play miniatures began with this book and almost all existing rules systems can trace their lineage back to this book.&#10;&#10;The book is a detailed building up of rules for playing a war game.  It contains detailed discussion of the rationale behind these rules, grounding them in military theory and history.  The book contains two sets of rules:  an elementary set for playing simple games and an advanced set of rules to provide a richer simulation.  It also contains one scenario, a mythical 18th century battle, which is played out step by step in the book.&#10;&#10;These rules define the &quot;Old School&quot; of war gaming: individually based figures in large units with written orders to sub-commanders, etc.  Despite its age, there are groups of gamers who continue to base their encounters on the spirit of this book if not its strict letter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of a base with eight large plastic tower sections which are built up into a leaning tower.  Each tower segment has 16 columns molded on the side and these are aligned before the game starts.&#10;&#10;The simplest game consists of rolling two dice to find the tower segment to be rotated and how many columns it is to be rotated, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.  The player who causes the tower to collapse loses the game.&#10;&#10;In the more advanced version, players may choose which tower segment to rotate and by how much - between 1 and 3 columns - and the player scores 1 point for each column rotation.&#10;&#10;In the final version of the game, players chose a tower element for the player on the left to use and all players are involved in constructing the tower before rotation begins.&#10;&#10;(Note: The English language rules don't state that you cannot reverse the last move made.  This is compulsory to make the game playable.  For the simplest game, if the same tower segment is chosen, then it must be rotated in the same direction as the last move.  Alternately, you can use a House Rule that states that the towers can only be rotated clockwise.)&#10;&#10;",

Is not one of hard-science, instead portraying the sci-fi we have come to know and love as portrayed on television and the movies.

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;&quot;By the year 2750, the 150 year old galaxy-wide war had escalated to the point where casualties were measured in millions per day.  Entire populations were wiped out and planets made uninhabitable by the fallout of warfare.  Faced with annihilation, both sides (the United Democratic Planets or UDP and the Republic of Soviet-Socialist Planets or RSSP)developed an alternative method of waging war.  Their solution was the Omega Suit.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Omega Suit represents the ultimate development of military technology.  Each suit stands over 7' tall and is manned by a genetically superior soldier called an Omega Warrior.  The Omega Suit is a fully enclosed system which enhances strength, reflexes and senses of its wearer.  Omega Suits can withstand tremendous amounts of damage and can carry enough firepower to lay waste to an entire division of conventional armored vehicles.  Instead of sending tens of thousands of infantry to fight a battle, the same goal can be accomplished with a handful of Omega Warriors.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, in the year 3000 AD, the war continues.  Big armies, while maintained by the larger factions involved in the war, are seldom used.  Most battles are fought by the Omega Warriors and where they go the ground trembles and the skies burn, for no target is out of their reach.&#10;&#10;&quot;Omega Warrior is a miniature rules set for creating the battles of the future using 6mm-28mm figures.  Omega Warrior is a complete rules system, including rules for conventional infantry, vehicles, robots, AIs, and of course, the Omega Warriors themselves.  Also included are army lists and a campaign system.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Saxon Gedriht (hearthguard) should be limited to 0-1 unit, like most of the other comitatus units in the book.&#10;&#10;2. Page 53 - the Army of Ecgfrith, King of Northumbria. As printed, poor King Ecgfrith has a Ld of 2 and appears to cost only 10 points. This mighty Saxon warrior was, of course, somewhat more charismatic than this, and should have an Ld of 9 (as per the Saxon Cyning profile on page 49) and cost 210 points!&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Warhammer Ancient Battles&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Three Way Cube is a three-dimensional brain-twister. There are chances on all three levels.&#10;&#10;The rules are similar to the rules of the mill-game. After the lots have been drawn for white and brown, each player receives 32 beads. Now both players by turn try to build up a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line. As soon as a player has built a mill he may take away a bead from his opponent. It is, however, only allowed to take beads which are seizable directly, that means which are on the top of a pin. If a mill is closed you may not take away a bead from his mill.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to take all beads from the opponent or to block his beads in such a way that he cannot move any longer.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Score Four (though with different play and scoring)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game begins when most of the role playing game ends.&#10;The heroes are coming back from their adventures fighting monsters and gathering treasures. But still, the dwarf is missing his axe, the magician is looking for his book with new spells, the Elf wants his enchanted lantern back. So every character is looking for something important to him.&#10;In the first phase of the game each player tries to get the item he wants back by negotiation. If that fails, well, then we will have a hefty battle in that tavern and one sure thing we know is that there will be not a single chair left intact after that fight.&#10;&#10;This game consists of 110 cards (12 different characters like Trolls, Goblins, Paladin, Orc etc. and lots of items), dice and a rule book.&#10;&#10;",
