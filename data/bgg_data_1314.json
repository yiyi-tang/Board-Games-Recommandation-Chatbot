Meeting another player does not lead to a fight, but it may result in joint training or exchange of gold, potions, and valuable information about the monsters in the area.&#10;&#10;The game is played through several rounds, and at the end of each round, the Wild Hunt summons new monsters or Hounds and moves around the board attacking players.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players will face the greatest challenge, a duel with one of the greatest Wild Hunt warriors, the mighty Eredin. All players take part in the final clash, trying to overcome the opponent together - Eredin, however, has a set of unique, powerful attacks that make the fight especially difficult.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bringing four of your stones to the top of the Pyramid doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big task. However, when your opponent has the same goal, you must outthink him.&#10;&#10;A stone has 3 options to move:&#10;&#10;RUN Move the stone forward as many fields as you want as long as his route does not go to a higher level. The stone cannot jump over other stones or share their field. If your stone moves to a lower level which is occupied by another stone, the attacked stone is SMASHED and gets removed from the game.&#10; JUMP Move the stone up to the unoccupied adjacent field one level above.&#10; PUSH Take the place of an adjacent stone by pushing it one field further. A pushed stone can also SMASH another stone. If the pushed stone was on a corner field at the lowest level, he FALLS and gets removed from the game.&#10; OSIRIS Apart from SMASHING and FALLING, stones can also be removed by forming an OSIRIS. If one or more stones of the same color get surrounded by the opposing color on the same level and in one line, they get removed.&#10;&#10;PYRAMID can end in two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The first player who positions 4 of his stones at the marked victory fields at the high level of the pyramid, wins the game and the glory of the Egyptian gods.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;     When a player has only 3 stones left he automatically loses and the opposing player wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

These cards contain a new, advanced special ability of the Monster and descriptions of four special attacks. These attacks are directly related to the characteristics of the Monster in the Witcher's world.&#10;&#10;When a Monster appears on the board, players place an additional large card next to the board - it is visible to everyone and is associated with one specific Monster.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 17 large cards, this expansion introduces 4 Special Combat Cards. Before fighting a monster, shuffle 2,3, or 4 randomly into its Life Pool (depending on the Monster level). Thanks to this, fighting a powerful, massive Werewolf will be a completely different experience than facing Foglet hiding between mists and illusions. Additionally, each fight with the same Monster will be unique because it is not sure which special attacks will appear and in what order.&#10;&#10;Special Combat Cards will allow you to diversify the fights and introduce a completely new mechanic - Passive Attacks. When a Monster discards a Special Combat Card due to its damage, the passive attack is automatically activated.&#10;&#10;Various special and passive attacks of monsters mean that the decisions made by the player while trailing the Monster and in combat must be even more carefully considered.&#10;&#10;",

Keita has honoured that final order every day of his life by keeping them safe with his blade and teaching them the finer points of swordsmanship as they grew. Yet, there is something to Keita that makes people want to bow even deeper in his presence. Perhaps it is his lordly demeanour and inherent nobility? Whatever it may be, he is a welcome and stalwart asset to the Shiho clan in the fight to throw off the yoke of the Takashi imposters and usurpers.&#10;Keita helps the warband in many ways; if you buff his poor melee skill, he can be a viable fighter. But even without any melee exchanges, he offers Virtue Tokens with a wide range of effects that boost the Shiho&rsquo;s inherent talent for unpredictability. In addition, his Deference Ki Feat can keep him safe from some attacks, which is helpful for a supporting model that needs to be close to the action.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Ancient Egypt, more than three millenia ago, men confronted each other in the Trial of Osirium under the eyes of the immortal Gods. Inspired by Osiris, the judge of souls who came back from the dead, the Osirium allowed to settle many conficts and to have the truth triumph. If honesty guides your actions, then you won&rsquo;t be afraid of walking in the duat, and you will make your Deity proud.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;Osirium is a trial. Your goal is to defeat your opponents to make the deity to whom you pledged allegiance proud. To do that, you need to collect as many points (or Ankhs) as possible, performing Rituals with various Amulets. 4 deities are available: Isis, Anubis, Bastet and Seth.&#10;The Trial&#10;The oldest player plays first, since it is assumed that they&rsquo;ll join the gods sooner than the others&hellip; Then, the player on their left plays their turn, and so on.&#10;&#10;On your turn, &#10;&#10;     You must play one of your 4 Amulet Cards. Place it on any free space of the board, choosing its orientation. Then, draw a new Amulet Card to have 4 Amulet Cards in your hand again. You can either take an Amulet Card from the Deities&rsquo; Market, or draw a random Amulet Card from the top of the draw pile. If you take a card from the Market, immediately replace it with a new card from the draw pile.&#10;     You may cast one of the Rituals of your Deity Board (see Cast a Ritual on p.7). You can do this before or after placing an Amulet on the board. You can cast as many Rituals as you like. Casting a Ritual is not mandatory. &#10;&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you may decide to pass. This allows you to discard your entire hand of Amulet Cards to draw 4 new Amulet Cards instead. When you pass, ignore the two actions listed above. &#10;The Trial ends once a player has cast 5 Rituals. Check if any player has completed their Exaltation Card (a secret secondary objective), then proceed to final scoring.&#10;&#10;Cast a Ritual&#10;There are two types of Rituals: Simple Rituals and Advanced Rituals. Players receive Simple Rituals at the beginning of the game. They are easy to cast but do not score many points. Players may draw Advanced Rituals during the game. These Rituals score more points. Each Ritual Card depicts the Amulets required to cast the Ritual.&#10;To cast a Ritual, you must make sure that the depicted Amulets are correctly linked to each other: An Amulet is linked to the adjacent Amulet if both arrows are face to face. There must be no other Amulets between the arrows of the Amulets required to cast the Ritual. There can be more Amulets than required, of course. In that case, simply indicate the ones that you are using. &#10;A Ritual allows you to gain Ankhs (as many as indicated on the card, in front of the matching symbol). However, casting a Ritual consumes the Amulets&rsquo; energy. For this reason, some of them need to be broken. Remove the Amulet(s) of your choice from the ones used for the Ritual and place them in front of you. &#10;Rituals can be cast according to two principles: Order OR Chaos. &#10;ORDER : Such Rituals score more points and break less Amulets &ndash; which means that more Amulets remain available for the other players. &#10;CHAOS : The black symbols depict the Chaos Principle. Such Rituals score less points and break more Amulets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Maki is well versed in killing and ambush and moving with stealth over and under the land. Her family were soldiers for the Eagle, and she has been raised with them, fighting the guerilla war since she was old enough to hold a knife. Out of sheer necessity, Maki learned to fight with two blades instead of one. This would have been unthinkable in the past, but current circumstances dictate that the Shiho samurai have had to be more flexible in their teachings. While it would still be unthinkable for her to wield the Daisho, her Tachi are a suitable replacement.&#10;Maki offers the same unpredictability as her fellow Ashigaru with her Hold the Line! Ki Feat. Her Unassailable Ki Feat allows her to remain on a flank fending off multiple opponents then using her Sidestep to free herself from being locked down.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But that was then, and this is now, and right now, the Takashi Ashigaru are considered the best-trained troops, patrolling the Jwar Isles keeping order for the Prefecture. Still, the Shiho&rsquo;s fighting men have been together since the usurpation, and the loyalty they show each other is matched only by their commitment to the fallen Eagle Clan.&#10;On the table, these Yarimen can move to assist other Ashigaru, meaning any attack on one soldier is potentially an attack facing two or more! Moreover, the enemy will never know the line&rsquo;s strength and weak points as it constantly moves and changes.&#10;&#10;Blister contains two miniatures, 30mm bases and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Heimin class consists mainly of farmers, artisans and merchants.  But these peasants know the true lords of the prefecture and follow them still when they go to war.  Being below the notice of most Samurai and living far from the cities of Jwar, most villages are unaware that the Shiho no longer control the prefecture, while others are still loyal to their old Shiho masters regardless. Those loyal to the Eagle remember the days before the Tsunami, before the masked dead, before the Savage Wave, before the Takashi went to war to usurp the Shiho. But they know, deep within their hearts, and in their prayers, that the Eagle will rise once more victorious, covering Jwar with its wings.&#10;As you may expect, peasants in-game are not very impressive, but the Uncloak Ki Feat means that any of them could have been a Shiho Samurai all along! Now you die! Surprise!&#10;So by fielding three of these, opponents are forced to play as if all of them are Samurai until they uncloak, and you can decide during the game which, if any, are Samurai and which are harmless peasants. Combined with the Shiho Samurais&rsquo; ubiquitous Flank trait, this is a powerful way of controlling where the fight will happen.&#10;&#10;Blister contains three miniatures supplied with three 30mm bases and one full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After Tsuki led her Open Rebellion out of Tsumaga and against The Prefecture, the Takashi family became wary of their neighbours. To ensure a loyal Wolf clan for the next generation, the Dragon offered to foster the Tanaka heir, Nobuko&rsquo;s son with the Takashi family at Eddo. Fostering is an old tradition and it is a great honour for a clan to have their children taught the ways of the samurai by their liege lords. This strengthens the ties that bind the clans together and creates very loyal vassals for the greater clans. Such an offer cannot be refused without causing a diplomatic incident or even war. The Tanaka heir was sent with his uncle Kazuo to Eddo, the seat of the Dragon clan but they simply traveled to Ryu and stopped. The fostering had been agreed so the Takashi had no cause to call out the Tanaka but the boy studied in Ryu under Wolf clan tutors and learned his family ways, not those of the Takashi. They were just always &ldquo;On the way to Eddo&rdquo;. Honour was satisfied. Not all were happy with this however and a Prefecture official saw the boy and his uncle and tried to have them escorted to Eddo by an armed guard. Incensed by the lower ranking official trying to force his hand, Kazuo refused. None of the Prefecture ashigaru survived his refusal. Knowing this would not be accepted, Kazuo took the boy and fled. Lord Nobuo had no choice but to declare Kazuo an outlaw, claiming he kidnapped his son or the Dragon would have cause to declare that the Wolf Clan were disloyal. Now with nobody to help, Kazuo not only teaches the boy the wolf ways of sword fighting, their loyalty to the Shiho and the ways of the samurai but also must protect him from the Dragon and any who would take their coin for the bounty they offer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Altenor Secrets is a game of competitive clashes. Guilds of adventurers and champions compete in the depths of a tower in perpetual motion. To win, you have to manage several parameters. This board game has a well-developed lore, integrates video game dynamics and characters worthy of miniature games.&#10;&#10;You play in circular sections within a level of the endless tower of Altenor, you control a team whose purpose is to defeat the opposing player&rsquo;s team by bluffing, gaining access to key areas and controlling magical artifacts, called atoriums, to your advantage.&#10;&#10;The sections have been converted into arenas by guilds and dynasties but are still in motion during the game. Beware, the rings you are on will be moving!&#10;&#10;Each ring is composed of 8 areas representing grand halls with specific rules. The board center is occupied by a NEXUS, a node of power deep in the tower of Altenor.&#10;&#10;Each player moves their characters alternatively. You activate a character to bring him to life and perform regular and free actions. Each of your 6 characters has a specific role to play that comes with advantages and drawbacks.&#10;&#10;Move through grand halls each with their own surprises. Be clever when taking everything into account and try gaining a tactical advantage towards victory.&#10;&#10;There are 6 different ways to score points, and 4 rounds for you to overtake your opponent. The player whose team scored the largest number of points at the end of the game wins the match!&#10;&#10;Your guild is relying on you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once some Heroes have been transformed, Nom Nom Nom! allows the Krampus to heal whenever he destroys a Naughtie.&#10;&#10;The first action available to Krampus is Into The Bag.

This ability also provides a fun interaction with Kringle's own Nice List ability.

From Jallianwala Bagh to the battle of Yorktown, each Azadi Card is a unique event from history.&#10;&#10;Each Azadi Card has two sides, presenting players with two divergent paths of resistance. Will players take the path of peace and sit on a hunger strike, or will they take up arms and assassinate their oppressors? Each choice in an Azadi Card belongs to a certain Ideologue. Players must choose their path wisely, for their choice will unlock a new zone, and a Resistance Card belonging to that Ideologue, strengthening that Ideologue for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;For every action you complete on an AZADI Card, you will gain legacy. Spend your legacy to erect Monuments to your sacrifice and earn new powers once your nation gains Azadi. If players resolve the number of Azadi Cards required by their difficulty, and a final Foundation Card before time runs out - Azadi will be theirs.&#10;&#10;But the new sovereign nation will need a leader. Players must compete in the first democratic elections of their country to see who will be declared winner.&#10;&#10;What will you stand for? And what will freedom cost?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With the basic game style, it's 1-on-1. You versus your opponent. Each player randomly draws a character and a weapon. These cards have 3 different  traits (Speed, Power, and Finesse). These traits correspond to the dice you will use when battling, so a 4 is a d4, a 6 is a d6, and so forth. When you fight, you roll 1d4 to determine which attack you will use against your enemy.&#10;&#10;1 = Speed (Red). 2 = Power (White). 3 = Finesse (Grey). 4 = You choose the attack, or Roll to select again with a Bonus (Green)&#10;&#10;Since your weapon and character both have traits, you will actually be rolling 2 dice per attack. If a 1 was rolled on your 1d4 for attack selection for the round, you would use Speed as your attack. Your opponent might have a different trait they are using against you, since they also roll 1d4 to determine which type of attack they will use. You might have 1d4 for your character's Speed, but 1d8 for your weapon's speed. You roll these 2 dice together, add them together, and compare to your opponent's total from their 2 dice.  Damage is dealt in the difference between the two sums.&#10;&#10;Strategy comes from things like:&#10;&#10;Blocks - double your dice total but you can't damage your opponent. Typically you get 1 block per match, so use it wisely!&#10; Max Dice Damage - even if you're rolling 2D4 vs. an opponent's 1D8 and 1D10, you can still deal damage to them if you max out either or both of your dice! Whenever a character rolls the highest number possible on any die, they deal an automatic point of damage to their opponent. In this way, there is a chance to deal damage to an opponent even if you don't win the round.&#10; Weapon Bonuses - Most characters have 2-3 weapons they have +1 to dice rolls on if they have a matching weapon.&#10; Choice Bonuses - Each character can also get a bonus to attack rolls if they give up their choice when they roll a d4 and get a 4 for attack selection. If so, they roll again and have to take whatever they get, but they attack with a bonus on their rolls.&#10; Alternate Rules Cards - Putting one of these into play at the beginning of a match can totally change the game mechanics. With 36 different variations, it can really put a new spin on things! These are my favorite part of the game.&#10; Special Characters - 9 of the 27 characters have no weapon bonuses, but instead have special powers or abilities.&#10; 3-on-3 Elimination Matches - Continue fighting with your characters until they are reduced to 0 Hit Points, pulling a new character into the match until either you or your opponents have lost 3 characters.&#10; 3-5 Player Battle Royale Matches - Alternate rules for playing with more than 1 opponent. Last one standing wins!&#10;With all of these options, this becomes a great game for 2-5 players, whether you only have 10 minutes to play or an hour.  All it takes is 1 set of 90 cards, some standard RPG dice (D4/D6/D8/D10/D12/D20), and a friend!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 16th century was a time of strife for Japan. Its many clans were autonomous, headstrong and resistant to unification. The emperor thus began a competition for shogun between his two greatest samurai. You and an opponent will vie for the title as you coerce one village after another, searching for the three resources vital to the creation of the fighting infantry called Ashigaru &ndash; men, food and gold. Will you be able to unite the major clans, better your opponent and become shogun? Find out by playing all three games of Ashigaru:1567 &ndash; making wise decisions, using clever card management, and playing winning 3-Card Poker hands! (Note: This is the first in a series of low-cost games using the 3CP Game Engine&trade;, which employs custom cards plus a user-supplied 52-card deck of standard playing cards.)&#10;&#10;During the game, players try to win Ashigaru cards by playing 3-card poker hands from a standard deck. However, it's not as simple as it first appears. Since you get a new card every round, will you hold onto a pair of jacks, for example, hoping for a third -- making three-of-a-kind? Or break up two Aces to use one in a straight? A simple, easily memorized chart determines what Ashigaru cards you get -- and the better your winning hand, the better the cards you win.&#10;&#10;There are three related games included, of easy to moderate complexity. All are simple to learn, fun to play and balanced, with a fairly high tension level.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Print &amp; Play cards available in Files section.&#10;     Professionally produced card deck available at thegamecrafter.com.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The board is procedurally generated, so whatever ship layout you will end up with will be unique to that game and will require you to adapt and improvise, allowing for many different possibilities and strategies.&#10; Players will have their crewmembers move across the ship avoiding the alien and must make the most out of the different tools and resources available to achieve their goal, locking doors and vents as needed, or using weapons when they have to.&#10;&#10;Keep a close eye on your enemies, but an even closer one on your friends, because no one wants to be the Panic Prey!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

War dreadnoughts add depth to a squadron. &#10;The Juggernauts add a Shriek Missile. &#10;X-ships can carry new versions of plasma torpedoes. &#10;The new trait X-Ship gives those ships powerful advantages. Of course, there are rules for X-ships. &#10;There are seven new scenarios. &#10;One scenario is based on a story that appeared in a Captain&rsquo;s Log; we added it to this book. &#10;Finally, there is a consolidated index to all three books.&#10;&#10;Reinforcements One has all the rules and information you need to play the game when combined with Book 1.2 and Book Two. &#10;Please note that you must have Book 1.2 to play this game.&#10;Some of the material assumes you have the expansion Book Two.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Queen&rsquo;s Men aren&rsquo;t named necessarily for their dedication to Queen Selyse. Instead, it refers to their conversion to the R&rsquo;hllor faith. And while many might be concerned that their true loyalties lie with the Red Priestess, for the time being, they are just as willing to head to battle in service of Stannis Baratheon. In time, their true nature might come to light.&#10;&#10;The Queen&rsquo;s Men unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game give House Baratheon players a new melee-based option on the battlefield. Loyal to the older Baratheon brother, Stannis, they are clad in heavy armor and armed with longswords.

    "Description": "As Daenerys Targaryen sweeps across Essos with her Dothraki army, she has been freeing thousands of slaves as she defeats those that stand against her. It was not originally her intention to have them join her army, but many have willingly taken up arms and are eager to help their liberators conquer more territory. However, this rag-tag group of fighters aren&rsquo;t officially outfitted or trained. They carry simple farming implements turned into arms. They are clad in nothing but the rags on their backs. However, they can still turn the tide of a battle if placed where needed at the right time.&#10;&#10;The Freedmen unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Targaryen players a new option for their forces. While the Freedmen aren&rsquo;t the strongest fighters on the field, they are able to plug gaps in battle lines and hold back enemies hopefully long enough for more seasoned and better equipped fighters to help them out. When seconds matter in a battle, the Freedmen can give House Targaryen the time they need.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "House Baratheon is well known for equipping their troops in some of the heaviest armor found on the battlefields of Westeros. While other Houses might also do this for their frontline combat troops or heavily-barded cavalry, House Baratheon&rsquo;s zeal for heavy armor even extends to their support units. The R&rsquo;hllor Lightbringers are some of the most heavily armored archers that will take to the field. Though most enemies are more concerned with the flaming arrows they fire rather than the armor they&rsquo;re wearing.&#10;&#10;The R&rsquo;hllor Lightbringers unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon players a new ranged unit to add to their forces. Loyal to Stannis Baratheon, they are some of the most heavily armored ranged units in the game.
