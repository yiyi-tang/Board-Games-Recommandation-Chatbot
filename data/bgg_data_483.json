    "Description": "XAGA- Das Stadtspiel is a creative boardgame. The game begins with a city that wants more color from ideas and strategies. Variety is desired, because instead of quantity the citizens are concerned with the quality of the city. On the city-plan, the players alter buildings, plants and so on, and attempt to bring in inhabitants and guests. However the building alone are not sufficient. A clever and imaginative advertisement is fundamental to winning the game.&#10;&#10;In the constant role-change between investor and inhabitant the players together create their own place of fantasy and strategy. Communication is very important! The end the election for the &quot;Citizen of Honor&quot; decides the win. To win the title, one does not only need the votes, but also the &quot;most buildings&quot;, the &quot;most beautiful house&quot;, the &quot;most disturbing neighbor&quot; and several other categories.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Starship is a fairly elaborate tactical simulation of a contact between two starships, each of which has an mission that is unknown to the other ship.&#10;&#10;One player's ship is designated as the &quot;intruder&quot; and the other is the &quot;intercepter&quot; (sic). At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a mission. The possible missions vary depending on the player's role, intruder or intercepter.&#10;&#10;The missions include reconnaissance, space exploration, piracy, raid, and patrol (under either a &quot;cold war&quot; status or active hostilities). Each mission provides conditions for a &quot;strategic victory&quot; (such as capturing the other vessel, making peaceful contact, etc.) and orders which, if violated, will prevent the player from gaining a &quot;command victory&quot; (e.g., a player might be ordered to not fire first). Victory points are given for strategic, command, and tactical victories (the latter being based on ship damage), and these are compared to see who won (if anyone, as a possible outcome is that neither player wins).&#10;&#10;The game takes place in three-dimensional space, but the hex map is only used to show the relative positions of the ships. Markers placed on the map show a ship's vertical distance above or below the plane. A small map can be used because at the start of each turn the map is effectively rotated to put the Z-axis at the center along the line between the ships.&#10;&#10;Players write down and execute their movement and firing orders simultaneously. The main concern in battle is preventing one's systems from overheating, which can occur due to acceleration/deceleration as well as combat.&#10;&#10;While the game's envelope gives the publication year as 1976, all the components say 1975. It seems possible the envelope was added to the game after the first copies were produced.&#10;&#10;",

Its mechanics are described by the author as a reverse of games like Monopoly; instead of acquiring wealth, the players lose money, their job, and their possessions throughout the course of play.&#10;&#10;From the author's own description:&#10;&#10;&quot;Up to [seven] players play at being heroin addicts... the last to lose all his assets is the winner... It was meant as a kind of teaching aid for people who worked for drug programs, or wanted to learn that sort of thing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Three to five [players] is ideal...  You roll dice and advance to heavier habits ($10/day, $20/day, etc.)&#10;as you spiral inward.  There are Hassle and Wisdom cards, when you land on red or green squares, kind of like Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly.&quot;&#10;&#10;When the player loses his or her job due to varying circumstances, hustles help replace player income.  These could be described as variable player powers, because in a sense, different hustles earn a player income in different ways.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, players are likely to acquire more expensive habits which require more money to maintain, as well as suffering the loss of their job, arrests by law enforcement, and negative conseqences of board spaces.  The player who survives the longest is declared the winner, though the true goal of the game is to show that getting involved in the real-life junkie game is always a losing proposition.&#10;&#10;",

Batman's secret identity is what playboy billionaire?&#10;2. True or false.  The Wayne manor grandfather clock is set to the time of death of Bruce Wayne's parents.&#10;3.

The Banker pays off all bets for any agreed number of plays or time limit at the completion of which another player acts as Banker.&#10;All numbers on the layout do not have to be sold. For example, only two or three people may participate in a single play. The profit percentage is exactly the same as if all numbers were covered. &#10;When all bets are down on the layout, the Banker gives the cage a turn which raises and drops the dice at the opposite end of the cage. The three numbers on the top surface of the dice are the winners. &#10;If a bettor's number appears on one die he receives the return of his stake plus a like amount (even money). If it appears on 2 dice he is rewarded with the return of his bet plus twice the amount bet (2 to 1). Three like numbers rewards the players with thrice the amount bet plus the bet (3 to 1).&#10;Lowe's CHUCK-A-LUCK is an exact duplicate of the regulation casino game.

Players are divided into five teams: the Guatemalan Government, the Army/Wealthy Class, the Guerrillas, the Peasants/Workers, and the US Government. An initial 15-minute Strategy Session within each team is followed by three 15-minute months of an electoral campaign involving discussions and negotiations among the teams.&#10;&#10;Each team presents a brief Position Statement to start the action. Over the course of the campaign, each team may use means ranging from moral persuasion to military force in pursuit of its goals. The Army/Wealthy Class and the Guerrillas may opt to launch offensives. The Army can take over at any time, and they also have the option to &quot;silence&quot; members of any of the other Guatemalan teams. At the end, the team in power has the option of holding an election. All Guatemalans except silenced members and guerrillas are eligible to vote. Peasants/Workers have two votes; others have one. Guerrillas may vote by joining the Peasants.&#10;&#10;",

You've been cleared to create high capacity, high speed track, enabling you to double your income along the most critical portion of your rail system. This Age of Steam expansion includes the following unique features:&#10;&#10;    Express Links: Each player is able to build an Express Link, that costs twice as much to build, but provides two income when a good is shipped over it.&#10;    Player-controlled Goods Production: The player who chooses the Production Action determines which goods make it on to the playing area; if no one chooses this action, no new goods are added to the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the website:&#10;&#10;Inside Blitz is a football simulation like no other.  After playing many others in my life I set out to take all the good and get rid of all the bad I saw in those games.  That along with some innovative game play makes this game something special.  The game play is simple yet captures every aspect of the game of football.  Players perform just like they did in the season recreated.  Using a combination of Fast Action Cards and dice plays develop using the personnel on the field.  Your linemen can get called upon to make a play, the defensive secondary may have to stop the run or your linebackers may have to break up a pass.  If it is inside the game of football it is in Inside Blitz.&#10;&#10;With defensive players rated in 7 categories, you can see the strengths and weaknesses of all the players.  From coverage skills in four depths of passes to their run defense you will see the weak links.  Not all pass rushers and ball hawking DBs were created the same and here you will see who those players are.&#10;&#10;Linemen, receivers and runners are rated for run and pass blocking.   Your sieve of an offensive line will allow more pressure while those staunch linemen will protect your QB like Fort Knox.  You will see the blockers blast running lanes or fail to get room for your runners.&#10;&#10;Quarterbacks have 4 different throwing depths so the deep ball guys will perform as such.  Those dump off guys will get their shots downfield but when pressured they will look to their comfort dink passes. The pass rush and scrambling system can really bring out the anticipation of those type plays as well.&#10;&#10;Receivers are rated for pass catching ability in three depths down the field.  All receivers have their own 6x6 cards for each depth of pass with the ability to bust one for a longer gain if they can get loose.&#10;&#10;Runners are rated for inside and outside running making each runner completely different.  Along with each players own 6x6 card for each type of run you will see where the home-run-hitter type runners will get the all or nothing yards while your consistent bull of a back will get his yards no matter but don&rsquo;t expect a big one.&#10;&#10;You have never seen a solitaire system like this one!  Play calling takes into account down, distance and the style of play of both the offense and defense.  Using all this also gets defensive platoons into the game without any hassle on the gamers part.  The distribution of who gets the ball is taken care of with ease.  You won&rsquo;t be seeing a bomb to your clod-footed TE but your track star will be targeted more often at that depth.&#10;&#10;Special teams, penalties and propensity to fumble are not overlooked in this game.  Each coverage team is given ratings to reflect the way they played on the season.  Teams are rated separately for penalties which is a very important aspect of football that gets glossed over with many games.  Finally each player is given their own fumble rating to show how each player took care of the ball.&#10;&#10;All this is presented in a professional and quality way making Inside Blitz the game of the new generation.  Come on inside!&#10;&#10;",

By taking the clown, it will not be possible to take bear-cards anymore (the category is closed).

    "Description": "Text from the introduction in the rules:&#10;The witches keenly stare at the magic bowl.... in a few seconds the magic symbols will appear. The witches are as quiet as mice and even the cauldron has stopped bubbling. Finally the symbols can be clearly recognized. Immediately the witches yell their magic spells, as only the quickest witch to shout the correct spell will become the new superior witch!&#10;&#10;This is one of Haba's Tumble-dice games, characterized by using dice in a domed container, a clever way of ensuring the dice don't get separated and lost.&#10;&#10;The contents of the game are:&#10;- A clear-domed tumbler with seven red six-sided dice (each die with 2 cats, 2 bats and 2 brooms) and one die with one, two or three black dots, or one, two or three red dots on its six sides. &#10;- One orange wooden witch meeple&#10;- 30 cards showing either a scene with many witches or a scene with one witch. The backs of the card show the face of one of three different witches. &#10;- The rules.&#10;&#10;The tumbler is placed in the centre and seven cards are dealt face up around the tumbler. The witch piece is placed on any card and during the game only moves in a clockwise direction. The player whose turn it is shakes the dice and all players simultaneously try to see what spell is indicated and which they must recite. The spell to recite is determined by where the witch lands. The die with one to three spots in two colours determines where the witch lands. If it is a card with many witches, the players must recite the spell corresponding to the type of animal that appears the most times on the dice. If it is a card with one witch, the players must recite the spell corresponding the type of animal that appears the least number of times on the dice. The first player to recite the correct spell gets to keep the card that the witch was standing on. The witch then moves clockwise the number of steps indicated on the pipped die and a new card is placed in the space vacated by the witch.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to get three of the same witch (on the card backs) or any five witches.&#10; The rules provide for a professional variation, where the colour of the dots, either black or red, on the pipped die makes a difference. The cards have little signposts with a black star or red mushroom. The movement of the witch will then be in the direction of the red star or red mushroom accordingly .&#10;&#10;",
