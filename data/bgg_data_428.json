    "Description": "The game is played very much like regular backgammon... to a point. The first player to get all of his pieces off his home board is the winner.  Unlike normal backgammon, however, there are no safe spaces.  When your piece(es) land(s) in the same space as an opponent's piece(es), they do battle (rolling dice and comparing the result against a defense factor) until one side controls the space and the other (or both) has been sent back to the bar. In addition, one of the pieces has a special power (the Summoner) that really changes the flow of Backgammon.&#10;&#10;The advanced game includes fortifications which further complicate things.&#10;&#10;The version available in the Winter 2006 edition of the Crusader must be glued down and then cut out before play. The self published edition comes glued to crescent board and you must cut it out before play.&#10;&#10;",

All you need to add are three six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to move at fast speed to allow them to make maneuvers or go flat out at Furious speed. This decision dictates the number of dice they roll and the options they have during their move.&#10;&#10;Players can pick up Fatigue during the race which can have an adverse effect on their performance at the later stages of the race. However, this can be managed and creates an ongoing 'risk assessment' aspect to the game in addition to choosing when to switch lanes and other situational decisions.&#10;&#10;There is an accessory pack available for the game which includes 4 plastic miniature racing cars, 3 dice and 4 Special Ability cards which add an extra dimension to the games.&#10;&#10;The Basic Game is also supported by expansion 'Toolkits', the first of which is the Wild Canyons which adds extra 'track sections' allowing players to design and create their own tracks and circuits.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    minizoomerz: Wild Canyons Toolkit&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ka-Nexus is a fast-paced, easy to learn card game for two to four players.  It contains a mix of skill, strategy, and chance.  The goal of the game is to score 21 points over the course of two or more hands, each hand taking about 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 61 cards, fifteen cards (numbered 1-12, Queen, Pharoah, Camel) each in four suits (Scarabs, Fortune, Markets, Thieves) plus the Royal Camel (a Joker of sorts).  The game board has locations for each player to store cards, an area to build the card pyramids central to game play, a draw pile area (the Oasis) and a discard pile area (the Sphinx).&#10;&#10;The game begins by taking 25 cards and using them to build two overlapping pyramids in the center of the game board.  The remaining 36 cards are placed in the Oasis.  Each player's turn consists of drawing a card from the Oasis and then making as many &quot;tricks&quot; as possible, where a &quot;trick&quot; is defined as a combination of two cards that add up to 15 or a lone Camel (similar to the classic Pyramid Solitaire game).  Cards for &quot;tricks&quot; may come from the player's personal storage area (which may hold up to 3 cards), the top of the Sphinx pile, or uncovered cards in the pyramid structure.  A player's turn ends when he takes the drawn card and either makes a trick with it, places it in storage, discards it to the Sphinx, or exchanges it with a card already in storage and discards that card to the Sphinx.&#10;&#10;When all of the cards from the Oasis have been drawn and played, the hand ends and players score points for: the Last Royal Trick (last trick played that contains a Queen, Pharaoh, or Camel) for 1 point, Pyramids (clearing the last card from the pyramids) for i point, Majority (most tricks captured) for 2 points, Scarabs (most Scarab suit cards captured) for 2 points, and Camels at 1 point per captured Camel.  Players are penalized for cards remaining in their storage area at the end of a hand.  Maximum score per hand is 11 points.&#10;&#10;",

In each round of the game, players draws a mission from the deck matching his or her role and then take turns to throw dice and move their playing piece around the board to complete the mission and get back to their respective headquarters first.&#10;Along the way they have to avoid red numbered squares, 83 in total, that correspond to a bad event, like a parking ticket, or could make you draw a Chance! card that are divided 50/50 between good and bad. They also have to avoid refueling squares that make you go to the very nearest fuel station and pay for fuel before you may proceed. Players are however encouraged to buy different kinds of Esso solutions that make this cheaper or even make you immune within a radius of your headquarters.&#10;&#10;The number of rounds played are variable between one and ten and the goal is to have the most money when the game is over. The first player to complete the mission each round get a bonus, the second a smaller bonus and the third an even smaller bonus but the last player, no matter if second, third or fourth, instead get a late fee for every space left on the mission. Red numbered squares often make you lose a turn or charge you a fee while the five good Chance! cards often give a sizable reward. Missions also often give a cash reward for one or more steps or a larger reward when completed.&#10;&#10;",

There's only one goat, so players will tussle over who has control. The object of the game is to get the most victory points. Three points are up for grabs in the rodeo and up to ten points are available from bragging rights afterwards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls 2d6 for each of his three riders to determine how far they can go. A ruler is used to measure the distance moved.  If a rider ends his move adjacent to the goat, he can tussle for it. To do that, the player must explain how he takes possession of the goat. Based on the quality of the story, another player judges the likelihood on a d6 roll of the active player taking possession.  &quot;Unexpected events&quot; are handled similarly. At any point a player may spend a coin from their hand and declare one. They describe what happens and then another player decides its likelihood.&#10;&#10;Once the goat it safely back to the starting point, the players may spend any remaining coins, with each coin granting an argument to try to gain more victory points. These may relate to things that happened during the rodeo or to post-rodeo festivities that would make a team look better in the eyes of the spectators. Once all the coins are gone, the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;The first edition of Mongolian Goat Rodeo (2006) was a board game, while the second edition (2013) is a card game in which players need to supply their own dice, ruler and coins in order to play. The designer has also published free &quot;miniatures game&quot; rules that can be played using any mounted figures. See the Community Wiki section, below.&#10;&#10;",

You may find your units running for cover when you least desire it, then find that they return with a new resolve and vigor for the fight.&#10;&#10;These rules are capable of reproducing all the major battles of the American Civil War from Bull Run 21st July 1861 through to Parnetto Ranche 13th May 1865.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Alice in Wonderland Card Game is a deck of 48 cards featuring John Tenniels illustrations. The pack consists of 16 sets of 3 cards each, all bearing the same number. One card in each set is the Leading card, and shows on its face the titles of the two other cards in the set. For example, the leading card in the first set is &quot;Alice Telescoping&quot; with the instructions &quot;Find the 'Rabbit running away' and The 'Fan.' The objective of the game is to complete the most sets. Players accomplish this by playing a Leading card face up in front of them and then calling on other players for the cards that make up the set, in a manner similar to the classic card game &quot;Go Fish.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

A racetrack around the perimeter of your bingo card has some squares with coin icons and some with music box icons.  Roll your D6 and if you land on a coin icon, take a coin from the bank.  Land on the music box icon and, if you have a coin, place it in the slot in the music box and turn the crank.  After the Musingo song plays, a slot-machine-like roller will spin and display up to three notes in one of the five colors of the bingo card rows and columns.  Cover a square on your bingo card matching the color(s) displayed on the music box. First person to make a row, column or diagonal wins. &#10;Contains: 4 Monkey Playing pieces; 4 Individual Musingo Boards; 1 die; 48 Musingo Markers; 50 plastic coins; and the 'Musingo' man, an 8 inch plastic music box shaped and colored as mustachioed organ grinder.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zombie Cafe is a game of zombies and brains. You had a nice little delicatessen, but that was before The Change. Overnight, your best customers became zombies, and a zombie's favorite food is brains. Fortunately your meat supplier also turned into a zombie, so getting your standing orders changed from pastrami and corned beef to brains and more brains wasn't difficult.&#10;&#10;Zombie Cafe is a game of selling. Players are dealt five Brains from a Brain deck, each brain has a numeric value assigned indicating quality. The first player to sell all of their brains wins! Sounds easy, right?  Of course it isn't! During your turn you play modifiers from the Cafe deck on your brains to improve their quality and make them easier to sell, you play modifiers on other player's brains to decrease their quality and make them harder to sell, and general chaos ensues! It's not uncommon for one player to think they have it made and they'll go out on their next turn when suddenly a flurry of cards are played and they now have four more brains to deal with.&#10;&#10;The game is fast to play, is good for 2-6 players (you could try eight players, but you'll exhaust the Brain deck pretty quickly), and a game usually lasts 20-30 minutes. One page of rules (double-sided), 52 Brain cards, and 52 Cafe cards. You will need two six-sided dice per player.&#10;&#10;Home Page : http://www.sparebrainsgames.com/zombiecafe.html&#10;&#10;",

Springline is a wild, fast moving and unpredictable game of skill and tactics for two, in which moves lead to chain reactions, prisoners return to the game and pieces bounce off the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;The board is a hexagonal grid with five spaces along each edge, and is positioned between the players with a corner pointing toward each player. The corner spaces are return pads with the three closest pads belonging to their respective players. There are eight pieces for each player that begin on the three closest return pads, midway between them along the near edges, and two spaces forward of each of the central three pieces. Moves are one space in a straight line or in a hexagonal orbit around any other piece. Three (or more) pieces in a line form a Springline, and either end(s) must discharge before the end of a turn. Discharged pieces travel in a series of straight unobstructed lines (bouncing off the edges of the board as necessary) as far as the player wants. Capture is by replacement, and prisoners are immediately exchanged upon capture. Exchanged prisoners must be re-entered onto one of a player's own vacant return pads at the earliest opportunity. Failure to be able to do so (because they are occupied) loses the game. Alternatively, if a player holds, even for a moment, three opposing prisoners, this wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Rogue Football League runs over the course of three seasons, so owners will have plenty of time to see their league grow and succeed.&#10;&#10;What makes RFL fun to play is that while players are trying to beat each other on the field, they must work together for the success of the league off the field, or no one wins.&#10;&#10;It is not necessary to have eight players to play RFL.  While the game has mechanics for non-player franchises, and can even be played solitaire, interaction is a BIG part of the game.&#10;&#10;League models, or templates, are available for leagues of between six and twelve teams. Each individual game on the schedule can be resolved in 3-5 minutes with the two owners rolling against each other, or a quick play function is available if owners wish to concentrate on the managerial/financial aspects of the league.&#10;&#10;Rogue Football League comes with a 14-page rulebook, 24 franchise cards, 52 veteran cards, 44 rookie cards, 60 event cards, originals of all necessary game forms, and three double-sided player aid cards.&#10;&#10;     Two expansions have been released: Foreign Fields, which adds in more league templates, more cards and rules for Canadian/European franchises; and Ghosts of the Past, which adds in more cards, a random event table and scenarios for recreating the USFL, WFL, and WLAF&#10; Available from Brothers-in-Arms Games at biagamesonline.tripod.com - check out the site and check out the game.&#10;&#10;",

Only one alien race was discovered, and that lone example of intelligence was conquered and enslaved. It was that victory, those acts, which sowed the seeds of mankind's greatest threat. On the verge of discovering that man was not supreme in the galaxy, humanity turned upon itself.&#10;&#10;It was an age of idealism. It was an age of elitism. It was an age when man turned against man, confident in his own superiority. It was an age of ignorance... when man strode too proudly amongst the stars.&#10;&#10;Included in this book is everything you need to play out the story of the Terran Civil War with the VBAM and Starmada X game systems, including: &#10; * Rules to model internal politics for VBAM&#10; * Expanded links between VBAM-Starmada abilities&#10; * Rules for designing new Starmada weapon systems&#10; * Expanded fighter design rules&#10; * New ground force design rules&#10; * New scouting options&#10; * New planetary facilities&#10; * Enhanced Starmada-VBAM scenario/setup rules&#10; * Expanded elite officer and crew rules&#10; * 27 Starmada ship designs&#10; * Complete orders of battle for &quot;historical&quot; play&#10; * In depth campaign setting and background&#10; * &quot;Historical&quot; scenarios for Starmada play&#10; * 50+ star systems, based loosely on real stellar cartography&#10;&#10;THIS IS NOT A STAND ALONE PRODUCT AND REQUIRES THE Victory by Any Means: Campaign Guide(VBM-101) AND Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition (MJG-0113) TO FULLY USE.

Each of 3 to 5 players represents a clan (Wolf, Bear, Turtle, Eagle, or Deer) within the Iroquois Confederation during this time and attempts to gain control of Confederation policy and the beaver trade.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are two main elements that players must deal with - influencing the five nations to follow your clan and attacking the enemy tribes.&#10;&#10;Each nation grants a different benefit when it follows your leadership. Control of a nation is determined with an area control/influence mechanism.  If one is willing to surrender their influence during a council turn, more beaver tokens (victory points) are earned.&#10;&#10;When attacking neighboring tribes, other clans may join yours in the attack.  Their help will improve the chances of victory, but means the spoils will be shared.  Success is determined by a simple superiority of numbers after the defending tribe has had a chance to eliminate the attackers.  Success earns the survivors a share of that tribe's beaver furs.&#10;&#10;",

The results of a roll table indicate whether you must try to use all the blocks left in the kitty, or only one block. Often, the result of the roll indicates the shape of a block that you must place on top of the tower. Completing the tower grants you 15 points, causing the tower to collapse on your turn grants all the other players points equal to the number of blocks left in the kitty. There is an exception: if you fail in your attempt to place the very last block atop the tower, each other player gets 15 points. The game is played to a 50 point total.&#10;&#10;The year, 1972, is a guess, as the game is unmarked.  However the box is very similar to &quot;Penta-Logics,&quot; which did come out in 1972, hence the guess.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players start out with a few ships in one of 9 &quot;quadrants&quot;. On each turn, you gain ships based on the number of star bases you've conquered plus a bonus ship for each quadrant you completely control. Only one ship is allowed per space and each ship can move up to 3 spaces in any direction. You can then attack single enemy ships with 1 to 3 ships of your own at a time. The defender rolls one die and the attacker rolls as many dice as ships used in the attack. Whoever rolls the single highest die removes one enemy ship involved in the fight. Ties result in no losses. The game continues until one player controls a set number of quadrants, i.e. 3 quadrants in a 4-player game.&#10;The designer released a the very-similar Stargate SG-1, based on the sci-fi TV show. That version adds ground troops and action cards but uses the same board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Stargate SG-1&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Task Forces at War is a really quick card game for two, pitting the Axis' and Allies' naval vessels against one another.  Players secretly and simultaneously select three ships from their hand of five, then reveal the chosen three.  Each ship has three combat values, namely aircraft, big guns, and torpedoes.  If there are four or more aircraft carriers, then the battle will be a carrier battle, and all ships use their aircraft.  If, instead, there are five or more battleships, all ships will use their big guns.  Otherwise, the ships will employ their torpedoes.  Once the type of battle is identified, the players total their combat strengths, then compare them.  The player with the higher total sinks one of the opponent's ships.  Generally, the loser selects the ship to sacrifice; however, if the winner has double or more the combat value of the loser, then the winner sinks whichever ship she likes.  Once the decks are exhausted, the round is complete, and the player who has sunk the higher total victory point value of ships wins the round.  Winning two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to be the first player to get a complete set of cubes and cylinders, in each of the six colors, off the board and onto their twelve &quot;Home Spots&quot;.&#10;&#10;This is a classic 2-Player, Abstract Strategy Game where each player is trying to be the first to get a complete set of rainbow colored cubes and cylinders past the square marked with a &quot;star&quot; and off onto their side of the board.&#10;&#10;Each game is new and exciting because every game starts with an empty board and players take turns placing one piece at a time anywhere they want on the board except for the two &quot;Home Squares&quot; that have a &quot;star&quot; on them near each end of the board. It doesn't matter if they place a cube or a cylinder or even which color it is because no one player &quot;owns&quot; any piece until it is safely off of the board and onto one of their &quot;home spots&quot; on their side of the board.&#10;&#10;Movement rules are pretty short and simple with the key fact being that if there are two pieces of a particular color and shape on the board, those pieces can move either once or twice and once they are&#10;down to one piece, they can only move once. The other main rule is that you MUST get your cube of a color off the board before you get the matching cylinder off the board.&#10;&#10;The ability to jump other pieces and move either type of piece, the fact that no one &quot;owns&quot; pieces until they remove them from the board makes for a depth of strategy seen in very few games.&#10;&#10;When you add the fact that there is no set starting position for the playing pieces, you will soon see that this game is almost &quot;Bottomless&quot; which gives it the ability to be studied and played for years, if not decades before anyone will ever figure out if there is an optimal setup&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game with a billiards theme is not a dexterity game as you could expect, but it&rsquo;s an interesting tactical dice game. Object of the game is to reach as many points as possible by moving the 3 billiard balls across the board with the use of 4 6-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Moving the balls is quite unusual, since you don&rsquo;t move the numbers of the dice rolls, but you must land on fields which show the numbers of these rolls! For that reason, each field of the 7 x 11 gameboard shows a number between 0-6, where the zeros are regarded as jokers. There are several bonus points to achieve - most of them when you manage to hit one ball after the other (like in real billiards). To give you enough strategical possibilities, you are free to choose the billiard ball with which you want to start the moves.&#10;&#10;Though the number of players is given from 2-6, it works perfectly as solitaire game, where you can think about your next turn as long as you want.&#10;&#10;",
