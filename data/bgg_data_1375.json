    "Description": "The Original Skateboarding Card Game was conceived in Afghanistan when a passionate Skater, on a mission and away from home, had the strong desire to feel the emotion of Skateboarding. Although riding his board was not an option, the tricks did not stop flowing in his mind, every time a bunker or T-Wall was spotted, a trick was inevitably created in his imagination. This game is the result of breaking down the creative process of skateboarding, allowing players to experience the excitement that skaters feel when formulating their tricks in the real life. It doesn't matter if you can jump or not. This is our language, our way of expressing the Art of Skateboarding action in our own words.&#10;&#10;",

When you have made this final contact, the circuit is completed and the red light will glow to indicate a correct answer. If you were to place the selector tip in your right hand on the wrong metal disc, say in the lower left corner by the Anchor, nothing would happen, and you would have given a wrong answer.

Born with a power that is both blessing and curse, the mutant Rogue can absorb the powers and memories of anyone she touches. This remarkable but devastating power allows her to wield the abilities of her foes but leaves them depleted&mdash; or worse. Prolonged contact with her skin drains the vital energy from those she touches. Afraid to harm those close to her, Rogue fled her past life. A runaway from the American South, she started her career as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants under Mystique before joining the X-Men to fight on the side of good.&#10;&#10;Remy LeBeau is Gambit, a dashing scoundrel with the mutant power to accelerate the molecular energy of an object, transforming mundane items into kinetically-charged explosives. Raised by a gang of New Orleans street thieves, Gambit is a master thief and former member of the Thieves&rsquo; Guild. Forced into the employ of the Marauders, Gambit had an unwitting hand in the destruction of the Morlocks. Wracked by guilt, his life of wandering ended when he met Storm and him finding a new family as one of the X-Men. Now fighting to protect others, he dishes out punishment with his bo staff and trademark playing cards. With a little kinetic enhancement, Gambit always has the winning hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

She was born to be a living weapon and had minimal human contact to enhance her savage and killer instincts. X-23 is a peerless fighter and assassin with all the mutant abilities of Wolverine, including a superhuman ability to heal from any injury, lightning-fast reflexes, and retractable adamantium-coated claws in her hands and feet.&#10;&#10;Alchemax Genetics created Gabrielle Kinney from the building blocks of X-23&rsquo;s genetic makeup. She was trained by Alchemax to serve as a bodyguard and elite fighter who possessed the same regenerative ability as Laura Kinney and Wolverine, as well as retractable bone claws. Her creators further enhanced her to be impervious to pain through an Alchemax nanite therapy, a painful process that shortened the lifespan of its subjects. She ultimately broke free from her cruel makers in Alchemax with the aid of her rebellious sisters and assumed the identity of Honey Badger as a member of the X-Men.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Teleported to a new world, the Players find mounts and gain the ability to ride them, causing them to become Riders. Riders move their Mount Pieces space to space on tiles based on the roll of a d4, discovering more of the world as they do by setting new tiles when they reach the end of a tile. Riders take different actions depending on the type of space that is landed on when they run out of movement. These actions cause you to gain items, equipment or spells, meet interesting characters, participate in wacky events, or fight Akuwu which are the monsters of the land in order to either Liberate towns or remove them from the road. When fighting Akuwu, Riders use their equipped equipment and miscellaneous items and spells to attempt to have more Kapow than the Akuwu they are fighting, rolling dice when necessary to raise Kapow by the roll, in order to defeat them and gain rewards that add to the Riders worth. Riders have 16 turns to gain the most worth before the final Boss appears, whether it be in the form of pure Gilver obtained throughout the game or assets such as items, equipment, spells and Liberated Towns that are automatically sold at the end of the game. The Riders must defeat the boss, either together or on their own to reap the rewards or else face the consequences of failure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tributo de Sangre (Tribute of Blood) is an operational game for two players, framed in the colonial conflict that confronted the Spanish Army with the hardened local tribes of the Rif (North of the Moroccan Sultanate) which was administered by Spain as a Protectorate. The game focuses on the peak phase of the conflict, led by the Campaign before and after the so-called &quot;Annual Disaster&quot; (1921), which caused the death in combat of thousands of Spanish soldiers. A tragic episode that would decisively mark the political and military future of Spain during the two incoming decades.&#10;&#10;Tribute of Blood is a card driven game, with a map of areas that replicates the domains of the Riffian tribes, and a network of connected spaces that allow a &ldquo;point to point&rdquo; movement through a rugged territory, suitable for ambushes and surprise raids The basic mechanics consist of the use of action points to deploy movement, logistics, offensive and diplomatic operations. The events of the cards will serve as drivers of these actions, while providing the necessary &quot;historical flavor&quot;. During each game turn, players will be able to launch raids, incursions, charges, sieges, assaults..., as well as pressure their opponent with various diplomatic actions.&#10;&#10;In Tribute of Blood, one player represents the Spanish Army and another the Riffian rebels. The game can be summarized in a pendulum movement, with both sides adopting offensive and defensive postures during different phases of the Campaign: the Rif side enjoys the initiative during the first turns and has the chance to cause a disaster similar to the historical one in Spanish lines. Starting on turns 6 and 7, the Spanish reinforcements will even the scales and provide the opportunity to regain control of the territory and avenge their deaths. The game is asymmetrical in many of its mechanics, beginning with the different positional &quot;habitat&quot; of each of the contenders: the Spanish formations move from point to point, through connection lines, while the Riffian rebels (harcas) unfold and move inside and through the areas (Cabilas). This means that there is not a defined combat front, and the Spanish must launch constant incursions to confront Abd-el Krim's warriors. It is a simulation of an irregular and asymmetric warfare, with interesting innovations on mechanics and interactions.&#10;&#10;Tribute of Blood consists of the following scenarios, each with an increasing level of depth and complexity:&#10;&#10;- 1. Historical Scenario: &quot;Annual's Disaster&quot; (5 turns)&#10;- 2. Alternative Scenario: &quot;Avoiding Disaster&quot; (5 turns)&#10;- 3. Advanced Scenario: &ldquo;Recapture of the Kert&rdquo; (11 turns)&#10;- 4. Annual Campaign; 1921: (16 turns)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ahoy privateer! A hurricane the likes of which ye&rsquo;ve never seen is bearing down on Doubloon Lagoon, the site of the lost wreck of the treasure-teeming megaship, The Dorado. Rumors have it that the storm is shaking the booty free of the clutches of the reefs, and rife for the taking. However, ye not be the only pirates in these parts, and the hurricane winds are filling sails, me hearty. So get all hands on deck and beat those bilge rats to the treasure, or send them to the briney deep.&#10;&#10;This is a grid-based, pirate-themed, battle royale sailing game that uses mechanics such as wind direction, dice battling, and movement economy to race and battle your friends to be the last ship afloat with the most treasure aboard when the storm hits. You command 3 ships; a slow and heavily armored/gunned Galleon, a balanced Brigantine, and a weak yet fast Sloop. Each of these ships have different attributes in regards to bonuses they receive in movement, cannon power, and defenses.&#10;&#10;Rather than chess-style movement, each turn the wind will (or may not) change direction, effecting all of the ships ability to sail on certain headings. Learn the actual points of sail used by sailers to maximize your movement and chart the best course to play the wind and best your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a randomly generated chest of treasure will surface somewhere in the play area, creating an ever shifting goal for you while you fend off other players and dodge cannon fire. Win the game by being the last one afloat with most treasure when the turn-based timer runs out and the hurricane hits. Randomly generated wind, treasure locations, unnavigable-island tiles, and up to 8 players make for different play styles and outcomes with every session.&#10;&#10;",

You may exceed out of the &quot;top&quot; of your bag, but when you do so you risk dropping items or worse, the dreaded &quot;bag rip.&quot;&#10;&#10;At their discretion, players may draw another bag card from a pile (aka bags just in your car) to create more space to carry more items into the house. These bags have different dimensions - such as a convenience store bag, wine shop bag, clothing store bags, recycled totes, and more.&#10;&#10;Scoring is resolved at the end of the game by totaling the scores indicated on each of the food items that you successfully brought to the house, dividing by the number of bags you used, and subtracting the scores of any of the food items that were dropped or suffered a bag rip.&#10;&#10;",

It will be yours to investigate, follow leads, interrogate suspects, study the clues, and solve the murder. Once you think you have the answers, you can write them on the Final Report included in the box, then break the seal to read the resolution and find out if you were successful in your investigation.&#10;&#10;The case centers around the murder of movie-star Clara Rose and her estranged husband Joe Fletcher. They were found shot to death on the dusty backlot of Orpheum Pictures. Classic murder-suicide? Hollywood rivalries that became too real? Mob debts unpaid? Or perhaps something far more sinister... As the Global Detective Agency&rsquo;s newest recruit, it is up to you to find the truth.&#10;&#10;",

If you hired the Mercenary using an Orb, it is yours for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The Shapeshifter is an optional play expansion mercenary for Dwellings of Eldervale that now starting with the 2nd printing (initial Second Edition printing) comes in its own tuckbox. This expansion is now only available as a separate expansion pack. Included in the tuck box is the 50mm Shapeshifter miniature, standee, and corresponding game card. For the right price you can hire the Shapeshifter, a very versatile ally.  The Mimic ability allows you to use one of your other Unit's abilities, except Build.&#10;&#10;ALL First/Kickstarter Edition copies of Dwellings of Eldervale came with a surprise/hidden Shapeshifter placed under the bottom tray of the game box. Because this was a closely held secret until the first of the campaign rewards were opened by Kickstarter campaign backers, the Shapeshifter is not pictured in the first printing of the rulebook, but the Shapeshifter card did come in the standard card pack shipped with all copies to &quot;spark the hunt&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Market Works is an engaging card game that immerses players in the world of finance and investment through strategic gameplay. Designed for 2-4 players, this game combines the thrill of competition with the intricacies of managing finances, making it a captivating experience for both casual gamers and those with an interest in the financial markets.&#10;&#10;In Market Works, players start with a set amount of money and a goal to be the first to accumulate $50,000 without incurring debt, or to be the last one standing after all other players have either gone bankrupt or been unable to manage their debts. The game is played with a deck of cards divided into three main types: Action, Market, and Expense cards, each playing a crucial role in the game's dynamics.&#10;&#10;The gameplay revolves around investing money, handling unexpected expenses, and navigating the volatile market to maximize returns. Players can invest their money during their turn, locking it up until a Market card is played, which will determine the return on their investments based on market conditions represented by the Bull and Bear cards. Bull cards double the investments of all players, while Bear cards halve them, adding a layer of risk and strategy to the investment decisions.&#10;&#10;Action cards offer players opportunities to directly influence their own financial standing or interfere with their opponents' strategies. These include the Spy card, allowing a player to view another's hand; the Rob card, which lets a player steal a card from an opponent; and the Loan card, providing a quick cash boost at the risk of incurring debt.&#10;&#10;Expense cards introduce an element of unpredictability, simulating real-life financial challenges that require players to pay specified sums to the bank. These expenses must be paid with savings, adding a strategic layer to managing invested and uninvested funds.&#10;&#10;Market Works is not just a game of chance; it requires strategic thinking, careful planning, and a bit of cunning to navigate the financial challenges and opportunities that arise. With its mix of competitive gameplay, financial strategy, and a dash of luck, Market Works offers high replay value, ensuring that no two games are ever the same. Players will need to adapt their strategies in response to the dynamic market conditions and the actions of their opponents to emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;Whether you're looking for a fun way to spend an evening with friends or family or you're a budding financier eager to test your investment strategies in a risk-free environment, Market Works promises a compelling and enjoyable experience that will keep you coming back for more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On Base Baseball is a Sabermetric-driven tabletop baseball game using cards, charts, and dice. Using real MLB players gamers can recreate many modern and classic games and seasons. At its heart, On Base is a game engine that you can change and add to as you like. It is basic enough to be played quickly (similar to basic APBA or Strat-o-matic) but, through gamer mods, it can become more nuanced.&#10;&#10;There are carded seasons for the game and there are whole decades of roster sheets available. The older cards have at bat outcomes right on the cards while newer card sets and roster sheets give you the values to use while playing the game but the outcomes are found on the game engine chart--the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;Game play is based off of some of the original dice baseball games from the early 20th century--roll two d6 dice and a d9 (or d10). From that roll result the gamer cross references the player's game play values against the roll number to find the outcome of the at bat.&#10;&#10;One of the unique features of the game is the pitcher/hitter interaction. Every at bat starts with the pitcher. If there is an outcome for the pitcher then the at bat is complete. If the outcome for the pitcher is blank then the outcome comes from the batter. The game is based on the DIPS Sabermetric theory so pitchers will affect strikeouts, walks, and home runs based on their ability to control those outcomes in real life.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragonborne is a solitaire fantasy wargame played with a narrative campaign. The player assumes the role of the titular Dragonborne: a person who is psychically bonded to an ancient biological war machine known as a Dragon. Together, the Dragon and rider confront a series of enemies human, mechanical and monstrous in tactical battles of resource and position management on their journey to fulfil their destiny.&#10;&#10;This is a pure solitaire game. All enemy activity is regulated by an automata controlled by a single die roll per turn and answering a few questions. There are 29 different opponents included, each presenting their own strengths and weaknesses for the player to discover and overcome. Each battle is connected to the next by a story, and the player's resources are persistent from one fight to the next so thinking ahead is critical. Depending on the player's performance, they will end up playing one of three branching campaign paths, each with their own different opponents.&#10;&#10;As the story progresses, the Dragon will evolve, gaining new powers and abilities randomly or as directed by the player along an evolutionary tree. There are 60 different evolutionary powers to choose from and combine, allowing for a huge range of strategies. You may end up with a massive, heavily-armoured Dragon able to absorb incoming attacks and retaliate using the attacker's own energy, a swift, nimble Dragon that outmaneuvers it's opponents before finishing them with precision attacks, an offensive powerhouse that rends it's enemies to pieces with jaw and tail, or a shamanistic monster that uses magic and the elements to overcome adversaries.&#10;&#10;",

Designed by a manga artist and published by a manga publisher, the game is sold in their stores and has a manga produced with it.&#10;&#10;The deck has cards numbered from 0 to 9, and each card has a special action on it. Each player chooses two cards and hides them from the other player, standing them up in small standees. The players must deduce which cards are hidden.&#10;&#10;The players start with two hit points. Each time a player makes a correct deduction, and accurately identifies a hidden card (an attack), the hiding player loses a hit point. When a player gets to zero, or starts their turn with no hand cards, they lose the game. But players can recover points when playing cards during the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of the remaining cards, and take turns playing a hand card and then making a guess. The hand card played has a special demand, such as, 'is this card a 5 or higher?', or 'which card has the higher value?'. Other cards have actions such as, return a played card to your hand, and, your opponent may not attack this turn.  As cards are played out to the table, it becomes more obvious what cards are hidden.&#10;&#10;However, when a hidden card is revealed, it goes back to the player's hand and they may place another card hidden.&#10;&#10;By logical deduction, a player should be able to work out which cards are hidden and eliminate their opponent.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The Battle deck includes the cards you need to score victories. These are verses used when battling allegorical enemies in the Lightraiders realm.&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t remember the verse referenced on the battle card in play, use a lightraider card from your hand that matches its suit. Or recite a verse from a card in an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Of course, you can only see the reference on the back of your opponent&rsquo;s card, so you&rsquo;ll have to rely on memory.&#10;&#10;Lightraiders play this game on the road and at Lightraider Academy to practice sacred verses and prepare for battle. Now you can play First Watch at home. Even better, use your First Watch cards for organization and reference during other lightraider adventures. This set makes a great companion to the original DragonRaid Vintage Boxed Set or Starlots the Game. Game effects are listed on each card, and each card also incorporates a real-life Scripture application to expand your discipleship learning.&#10;&#10;Intended as Bible memory verse tool that has been gamified to support an expanded/enhanced play method for DragonRaid and/or Starlots.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stellar Ventures is a highly-interactive economic game set in space. Players are investors in space-based corporations that compete for dominance over a multitude of planets. Corporations spend their invested capital to expand their network and purchase spaceships, which in turn increase the company value and shareholder dividends. By exploring alien planets, corporations can gain access to additional technologies to give them an edge in the space race.&#10;&#10;Corporations may elect to sign The Agreement with the aliens, accepting a one-time special dividend to all shareholders in exchange for a promise of peace. However, the more corporations that sign this lucrative pact, the more likely it is that the aliens will double-cross them and take over all company assets.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Good Witches and Wizards of Joralee have been kidnapped by a horde of evil Foes! The only hope is for their Familiars to dutifully band together on a quest to overthrow the Foes and save their spell-casting partners. They&rsquo;ll bumble their way through new spells, unleash ancient artifacts, and craft crazy combo attacks to succeed. They may just surprise their Witches and Wizards with a few tricks (and Familiars) of their own!&#10;&#10;Familiars and Foes is a 1 to 5 player co-operative style game where you play as one of five Elemental Familiars with their own unique abilities - Earth, Wind, Fire, Air, or Aether. The game is played in four waves. Each wave increases in difficulty and reveals a new set of Foes that must be defeated to save a Witch or Wizard.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player must choose one of three actions to perform - a physical attack, cast a spell, or use an artifact. The success or failure of the action is determined by a dice roll or coin flip. The rest of the players have the opportunity to contribute to the active player's turn and create combination moves. They can perform team attacks, use special abilities, or cash in rewards to boost the initial attack or benefit Familiar health. Group strategy is key to surviving and beating the game.&#10;&#10;The Foes don't just sit idly and take beatings the whole game. They have their own turn each round where they release potentially devastating attacks on the Familiars. The Familiars have a few tricks to defend themselves or they can just hope for a weak attack to survive another round.&#10;&#10;The game is won when all four waves of Foes have been defeated, all the Witches and Wizards have been rescued, and at least one Familiar is still standing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
