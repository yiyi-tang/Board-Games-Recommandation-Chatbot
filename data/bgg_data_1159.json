What makes the other happy, what makes him happy?&#10;During the Spirit Butterfly board game, players try to figure out which of their players to choose from. The Soul Butterfly will test how deeply we know others and ourselves. With its unique, special beauty cards and situational situations, it offers many gaming surprises to newcomers to the world of board games.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play the game. Basic game and situational game version.&#10; For the base game, the board must be placed on the A side. Each player chooses one color and receives the corresponding tip puck and puppet. The starting player receives a gray marker card and one of each player's suit. The butterfly card 60 and the gift card 21 must be shuffled and placed face down on the board. This will be the draw deck.&#10; The dealer draws one less card than the number of players and puts it face up. Place at least one face down card on each card. You can also use gray for a card you think is not close to any player. The players then try to guess which card the dealer intended for them by using the tip disc. Depending on how confident you are with one or two point sides. Then the markers turn and the evaluation follows. For correct tips, the player's dummy moves on the scoring bar to score points.&#10; In the situation version, if the dealer is on a situation field, you will have to draw two situation cards and read one of them. You will need to place your marker cards accordingly. The dealer on the smiley field acts according to the basic game. While a player on the doubling field will score all points, but in the case of a dealer, the player can decide whether to play the turn normally or draw from the situation cards.&#10; The winner of the game is the one whose puppy crosses the finish line first or moves to that field.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is a dark time for the Mortals. Creatures have driven them from their cabins in Camp Murkwood and pursued them all the way to the Forbidden Island.&#10;&#10;Evading the dreaded onslaught, a group of fighters led by no one has begun to resist these creature threats with weapons stolen from the mad scientist armory.&#10;&#10;These scientists, obsessed with their next great creation, have dispatched creatures to continue the hunt. But this time, the Mortals plan to fight back...&#10;&#10;Revenge of the Mortals is a stand alone game in the Campy-verse where players will take on the roles of different Mortals facing 8 rounds of Creature attacks. Armed with unique weapons, players will need to form squads to combat these creatures, and lucky for you, your party of friends are here to help. But in the end, there can be only one hero of the story.&#10;&#10;Your goal, in Revenge, is to score the most valuable Relics and Treasures by defeating Creatures. Revenge of the Mortals is played over the course of eight rounds. Every round a new Creature threat is drawn and each player will play a Weapon card from their hand in an attempt to survive the threat and possibly score some sweet Loot. Players can work together as a squad to overcome these threats or turn on each other in order to score more points. Players will negotiate, and then play a card from their hand face-down in front of them. Once everyone has chosen or The Sands of Time has run out (in which case a card must be selected randomly), each player reveals their chosen card simultaneously. Players will either survive the threat or lose Health. Can you survive the night?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 16 lutego 1807 covers the battle of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka, fought on Feb. 16, 1807 between the French 5th Corps commanded by Gen. Jean-Anne-Marie Savary and the Russian Corps commanded by Gen. Ivan N. Essen. The main goal of the French Corps was to secure the supply line of Napoleon&rsquo;s main army fighting with Gen. Bennigsen. Just after the bloody battle of Preussisch Eylau (Feb. 7-8, 1807) both sides started to look for possibilities of taking advantage over the enemy and draw away some opposite forces from the main theater before the next expected battle. After set of back and forth operations in the north Mazovia, Russians decided to launch an offensive against units of the Frech 5th Corps situated near Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka. Russian commander, Gen. Essen, strengthened by the 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski, prepared a plan of attack. He decided to divide his forces into two wings. One of them (6th Division and a part of 9th Division), commanded by Gen. Wolkonski, had to attack the town Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka from the north, approaching along the west bank of Narew river. The other wing (10th Division and a part of 9th Division), commanded by Gen. Essen, approaching along the east bank of Narew river, had to attack the town Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka from the east. Russians had significant numerical advantage but their problem was that both operational groups were completely separated by the impassable river with marshy banks and in effect could not suport each other.&#10;&#10;Before the battle started, Russians had made feign attacks near Myszyniec along the line of communication of the main French army, north-west of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka, fooling the French command. Gen. Savary decided to send there whole 1st Infantry Division of Gen. Suchet. Before the battle started, two events had taken place that had great impact on the course of it. The first one caused that Russians completely lost surprise effect. French caught the Russian messanger with letter from Essen to Bennigsen, from which they got to know the plan of the offensive. However we do not know how many details of it. The second event was also disadvantageous for the Russian Corps command. Gen. Bennigsen, who was the commander-in-chief of all Russian forces operating against Napoleon, recalled 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski to the main Russian army, to the north. Gen. Wolkonski, supported by Gen. Essen, tried to convince Gen. Sedmioradski to postpone execution of this order and take part in the planned ofensive against French 5th Corps, but Sedmioradski decided to obey strictly order from the upper commander and had marched to the north just befeore the offensive started. The effect was that Wolkonski&rsquo;s group which had to advance along the west bank of Narew river was reduced to 1/3 of its units.&#10;&#10;The battle of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka fought in 1807 is a classical example of the maneuver from a central position. Knowing more or less enemy&rsquo;s plans, early morning of Feb. 16, 1807, near 4 AM Gen. Savary also decided to divide his forces into two groups. He found the Russian wing approaching along the west bank of the Narew river as more dangerous because it could had cut him off from his line of communication. That is why he decided to march with the majority of his forces to the north, defeat it as the first and then revert back to the Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka to fight with the rest of the Russians. In Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka Savary left only 8 battalions with some artillery and cavalry. They had to defend and keep the town until he had defeated the enemy approaching from the north. Battle fought by Savary with Wolkonski&rsquo;s group near Stanis&#197;&#130;aw&oacute;w was quick. Russian General, seeing enemy strongly outnumbering his group, after short combat started retreat. It was 10 AM when being near Stanis&#197;&#130;aw&oacute;w Savary heard the sound of cannonade coming from Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka. At that moment he realised the Russian group he defeated was the smaller one and the main Russian forces were at Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka attacking small French contingent he had left there in the morning to defend the town and area around it. Leaving some units to pursuit Wolkonski&rsquo;s group Savary ordered force march to Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka. It was noon when the first units of his group appeared near the town where they met coming back from the north west 1st Infantry Division of Gen. Suchet. How defenders of the town were able to keep control of it to that time is another story. Some historical sources mention that although outnumbered, they even attacked Russians in the first part of the battle, confusing them and disturbing the decisive attack. Also some parts of Essen&rsquo;s group were delayed. Finally, near noon, when the defenders were about to lose, suprisingly Russian attacks on the town stopped. Russian command decided to withdraw to the positions to the east of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka, stay there until the end ot the day and make retreat during night. When Savary&rsquo;s group and the 1st Infantry Division crossed the Narew river and formed the battle line, the last part of the battle commenced. There were no more than 2 hours to the dusk but it was enough for the French to break Essen&rsquo;s group, however in effect of darkness, early coming during winter, the victory was not so overwhelming as it had been if the French had had more time. It is estimated that Russian lost 2500-3000 casualties, while French 1500-2000 ones.&#10;&#10;The game is an expansion for Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831. It means that Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 16 lutego 1807 uses system rules (also charts &amp; tables), markers and the board which are in Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831. There are special rules for this historical period and battle (2 pages only). There are three scenarios in the game: &#10;- The Defense of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka, &#10;- Operational,&#10;- The Battle on the East Bank of the Narew River. &#10;The first scenario covers the initial part of the battle. Its feature is a chit-pull system, used to simulate activity of the French units at the beginning of the combat and their better command system. The second scenario, the largest one, allows to play the whole battle. Its aim is also to show the operational background around the battlefield. It tries to join two levels of warfare: tactical and operational. In fact it is a kind of scenario generator: each player can choose among few options how to divide his forces among two groups. This decision has a great impact on the course of the game. Another important decision up to the Russian player is possible bringing to the battle Russian 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski, what gives him more forces but changes victory conditions to more demanding for the Russians. There is a plenty of additional options for this scenario. The third scenario depicts the last part of the battle, great frontal struggle on the east bank of the Narew river with most of the units participating in it. The playing time varies depending on the scenario, style of play and many other factors. The third scenario is the shortest while the second scenario as a whole is definitely the longest one. However in case of lack time, basing on the second scenario you can create little battles which can be played in 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Components (all packed in ziplock):&#10;- 324 die-cut counters (9 small counter sheets)&#10;- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)&#10;- Two sheets with unit rosters (for French and Russians)&#10;- One sheet with turn tracks&#10;- Four bags for counters&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Nagorno-Karabakh War: Soviet Fallout: 1992-1994 is a simulation of the war between Azerbaijan and the breakaway province (Oblast) of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited by a majority of Armenians. After the first ethnic clashes between Armenians and Azeri, during the death throes of the Soviet Union, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence from Azerbaijan. The Azeri launched an ethnic cleansing campaign. Faced with annihilation, the Armenians resisted and fought back, conquering most of Nagorno-Karabakh and parts of eastern Azerbaijan, a situation which has lasted until today (2019).&#10;&#10;The Nagorno-Karabakh War is a two player game: the Armenian (AR) player and the Azeri (AZ) player. The AR player must fight a numerically superior foe but he has the advantage of interior lines and a unified command, whereas the AZ player has a greater supply of former Red Army weapons and ammunition but has to fight not only the Armenians but also political infighting and low morale. In this game, the enemy population it is not the victim of collateral damage: the enemy population is the target, so conquering towns and villages and practicing ethnical cleansing is a key aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The subject is the 25 Swedish provinces, each set of four cards consisting of: one showing the province on a map of Sweden, also listing significant towns, lakes and rivers; one showing the coat of arms; one showing the province animal; and one showing the province plant. A special bonus card shows the coat of arms of Stockholm.&#10;&#10;Each player gets an initial hand of seven cards. Gameplay proceeds as normal for Go Fish, with players demanding cards from each other and drawing from the talon, setting any completed sets aside. Bonus points are given for scoring many sets from any of the three major regional divisions, and for drawing the Stockholm card.&#10;&#10;There is no maximum number of players stated, but the deck size will support a deal to 14 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

We encourage players to craft their own insane truth to explain what happened and answer the question which the General Public has posed.&#10;&#10;The General Public player will choose the winners for the rounds by picking the story they choose to believe.  They may choose the winner by whatever criteria they like.&#10;&#10;The winning player will keep the Event card for scorekeeping.

Unlikely allies will rise to either save this village or condemn it.&#10;&#10;Can you make it through the lengthening nights and save the town? Or is something creeping up on you, disguised as a neighbor, waiting for its chance to BITE?&#10;&#10;BITE is a social deduction game with secret roles for social gatherings. Players receive roles and pair up for a few minutes of conversation at a time, at the end of which each reveals an action card to the other player. They resolve these cards and move on to the next discussion, their motives changing throughout the game based upon which side they find themselves: Good or Evil. By the final night, either darkness will have been rooted out of the town, or it will have triumphed.&#10;&#10;Each role has action cards associated with it that reveal information about their conversation partner, protect them from harm, convert them to their side, or kill them off in various ways. The roles are themed to a gothic fantasy setting including Witches, Hunters, Villagers, Occultists, Vampires and the like.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;I mean to destroy the English and leave not one upon our lands.&rdquo;  Pontiac  &ldquo;It is not in the Indian&rsquo;s power to affect anything of consequence.&rdquo; Major Gladwin.&#10;&#10;Pontiac&rsquo;s War 1763-1766 followed on the heels of the French and Indian War which ended in 1763. Thanks to Indian resentment over the French surrender of their lands and the harsh policies of General Jeffery Amherst, governor-general of British North America, 20+ Indian nations rose up under the charismatic leadership of the Ottawa sachem, Pontiac and the Lenape Holy Man, Neolin. Pontiac&rsquo;s War attempts to recreate the reaction of Indian leaders to British mishandling of frontier politics and the impending colonial crisis it presaged. Building on the point-to-point system and loose Indian alliances used in King Philip's War, this design expands frontier conflict using Battle cards to introduce combat chaos, British expenditure on troops, Uncertain Indian Arms supply, siege rules, the capture of prisoners, French interference and trader influence.&#10;&#10;The game offers five short introductory scenarios (15-30 minutes), three one-year campaign scenarios (2 hours), and one three-year grand campaign (5-6 hours). Although not a solitaire design, it is solitaire friendly. Components included a mounuted game map and large, 338 3/4&quot; size punch-out counters.&#10;&#10;Game Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: Seasonal turns (approx. 3 months per turn)&#10;Map Scale: Point-to-Point map (approx. 60-75 miles between points)&#10;Unit Scale: 30-50 men, 4-6 artillery guns, individual officers and sea vessels&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Both queens hate each other and feel envious that the opposing land is greater than their land. Then one fateful day, these two queens rally their armies to wage war between themselves.&#10;&#10;In SEN: Save The Queen, each player becomes the queen of their respective kingdom and duels to take the lands of the other. Using only eighteen tiles to play, each player must outwit the other to trap the opposing queen. Each player has three types of units: swordsmen, spearmen, and horsemen. The battlefield is a 3x3 grid of tiles, with each player's queen occupying an opposing corner and a priest as a neutral unit in the middle of the battlefield. Then each player in turn, places their units in the available spaces.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple: There are eight action cards, and each player holds three cards at the beginning of the game. In turn order, each player can play a card from their side or take back two cards to their side of field. Each card affects certain units they control to move or attack opposing units. The player who can successfully occupy two adjacent grids owned by the enemy queen with their healthy units wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Take as many tokens as there are Bandits, half Gift and half Empty. If there is an odd number of Bandits, take an Empty token of more than Gift Tokens. (Example: with 5 Bandits, take 2 Gift and 3 Empty).&#10;    Shuffle the selected tokens face down and give one to each Bandit. These tokens must remain hidden from the opponents throughout the game. If you play with the Marshal &amp; Prisoners expansion, do not give the marshal a token.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;    The Elf moves only following the bandits in motion.&#10;    When a Bandit starts his movement triggered by an action Change Floor or Move from the position where the Elf is, move the Elf with the Bandit.&#10;    The Elf can park on Marshal&rsquo;s position.&#10;    The Elf is not moved if the Bandit&rsquo;s move is due to a Punch, an encounter with the Marshal, a Django shot or an end of round event.&#10;    The Elf can not be targeted by a shot or a punch.&#10;    If you play with the Horses &amp; Stagecoach expansion, the Elf follows the Bandits in the Ride Action. He can enter and leave the stagecoach. He can park on the Shotgun&rsquo;s position.&#10;    If you play with the Marshal &amp; Prisoners expansion, the Elf does not follow the Bandits in prison. He does not follow the Marshal either.

Players with an empty token are automatically eliminated.&#10;    If the Elf is at least two cars away from the Locomotive, the winner is the richest Bandit among those with an Empty token.

It is an almost perfect balance of power, since no House has enough strength to claim the throne they share by itself ... Until now.&#10;&#10;One of the Regent Houses, the Envers House, has discovered how to travel to the distant worlds of the universe. And with those new worlds at their disposal to dominate and gain Power, all Houses seek to grow enough to claim the title of Earth Emperor.&#10;&#10;In Rise of an Emperor: Worlds in Conflict, each player chooses one of the seven Regent Houses (each has 10 personalized cards) and two of the different paths that exist in the world of RoaE to gain power. Each of them (Science, Religion, Economy, Politics, Subterfuge, Military and Exploration) adds 20 more cards to build its initial deck. In addition, each House has three Counselors that can be used on the Council Board.&#10;&#10;Players use cards for actions like increasing their House skills, raising their military and technological levels, building buildings, playing the characters of their House ...&#10;&#10;The large number of cards in the game (770) allows a great variety of actions. You can make and break alliances with other races and civilizations, send assassins against your rivals, or spy on them to know what they hide. You can try to make your ruler a living God or be the richest House in the Universe. You can find alien artifacts, other races and friendly or hostile civilizations, worlds and moons, powerful strategic resources, build buildings such as the Academy of War or the Intelligence Center and an endless number of other options ...&#10;&#10;Each House has a personal board to develop their civilization, and to do so many of the cards must be built before they can be used ... but both space and resources are limited.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is the ubiquitous Treaty, which limits the Houses' actions. Many of the actions in the game are illegal ones. So in order to avoid the punishment we must cover them up or legalize them ... or maybe another House can catch us in fraganti !!!&#10;&#10;Rise of an Emperor is a Civilizations 4x game, which uses mechanics like worker placement, hand and resource management, and hidden information management. Each game is different and the multiple combinations of customization make it highly replayable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World War Africa: The Congo 1998-2001 is a wargame simulation of the 2nd war fought over the Congo by two coalitions of African countries during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The consequences of these two wars are still felt today.&#10;&#10;In the war of 1996-97, the corrupt regime of Joseph Mobutu was overthrown by a coalition of East African countries led by Rwanda. The country formerly known as Zaire was renamed Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Mobutu was replaced by another Cold War era dinosaur, Laurent Kabila, at the helm of the huge, mineral-rich African country. One year later, however, Kabila&rsquo;s sponsors, particularly Rwanda were not pleased. A number of issues including; the expulsion of Rwandan advisers from the DRC, Kabila recruiting Hutu combatants who had fled Rwanda, and the discrimination suffered by ethnic Tutsi in eastern DRC, moved Rwanda to try to remove Kabila from power. Supported by Uganda, Congolese rebels and the Tutsi minority in DRC, the Rwandans expected to win an easy victory, just as the year before. Kabila, however, was quickly supported by expeditionary forces of Zimbabwe and Angola, among other African countries, so overthrowing him turned out much harder than expected. The resulting conflict would involve about a dozen African countries, and cost the lives of an estimated 5 million people, thus earning the name of &ldquo;World War Africa&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The Great African War&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map represents 100 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents from one to three months, with 13 game turns (GT) covering the period from August 1998 to June 2001. Ground units represent brigade, regiment and battalion sized formations. The combat aircraft units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions over the time-frame of a turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #52&#10;&#10;",
