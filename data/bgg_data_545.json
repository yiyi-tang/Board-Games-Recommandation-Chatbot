This game uses all five fingers (unlike Finger Twister) and the board has a different arrangement of spots and also includes special spots known as 'breathless points'.&#10;&#10;The instruction under 'breathless point':&#10;&quot;You can touch whom you are interested in through the delicate balance position! Sometimes physical contact bring people together.&quot;&#10;&#10;However, there's also a caution on the label: &quot;Please note that this game doesn't always let boy meets girl.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each chip captured counts to that player score, different colors have different values.&#10;&#10;Any player can give-up playing at any time, except the last, that must continue play until no more moves are allowed.

Challenged, I devised a game using only an available pencil and some sheets of paper. I was rather surprised when it gained a considerable measure of popularity among my friends, some praing it as the &quot;last word&quot; in word games.&quot;&#10;&#10;Last Word is played in a grid on squares 9 x 9. The central 9 squares are filled with 9 letters at random. In his turn, each player puts a new letter adjacent to at least two others already in the layout. Using this letter and the others that are in line with it, the player forms words. The letters can be rearranged in the layout to acomplish this. He can not put a letter if he can not form a word in at least two different direction and he scores by multiplying the lenght of all words formed by that letter. It is not necessary to use all letters in a direction, but all letters used must be continuous up to the letter added.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all four edges of the grid are reached with at least one letter.&#10;&#10;",

It is a great party game, taking fifteen minutes to prepare, one minute to explain, and as much time to play as the guests wish to devote to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is a very simple party game in which each player receives a ribbon. When a player makes another to say 'No', he can take all ribbons from that player. The game continues until a predetermined time, when the player with the most ribbons is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Play is as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Locate a nice prize.&#10;         As everyone enters the party, pin a small ribbon on their clothes, one per person.&#10;         After everyone has arrived, gather them together and give a speech similar to the following:&#10;             &ldquo;The object of tonight&rsquo;s game is to collect the most ribbons. To collect ribbons, you must have an opponent say the word &lsquo;No&rsquo; to you. Upon uttering that word, you may promptly collect every ribbon currently pinned on them; they are yours, at least until you say &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Other words, phrases, and actions, like &lsquo;Nah,&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; and a swift slap, are perfectly valid; only uttering the word &lsquo;No&rsquo; causes a lack of ribbons. At [some time here], the person with the most ribbons wins the game, and receives a nice prize.&rdquo;&#10;        &#10;         Play as the speech above states.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Current boards include Psyche's Board, Tenstones, WaterBird, Pentagram/Mercedes, and Circuit Board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns writing &quot;ideas&quot; into vacant spaces on the board. In competitive play, players score points &quot;by claiming links between the idea in their own move and the ideas already in play in those positions on the board connected to it by the lines of the board in question. A link can be any form of association - similarity, opposition, cause-and-effect, metaphor. Fanciful links may be made and enjoyed - or hotly contested.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The HipBone Games are based on the concept of the Glass Bead Game described by Hermann Hesse in his Nobel-winning novel, Magister Ludi.

The first tile for each player is placed without restrictions, one color on the bottom and the other on top, but subsequent tiles must match the color facing up on the previous tile.&#10;&#10;Players alternate choosing tiles from the face down pile.  If they cannot place the tile, they return it after everyone has seen it.  There are also witch tiles for use in a version of the game for older children.  If a player draws a witch, all other players are forced to discard face-down the tile at the top of stack.  The first player to rescue Rapunzel twice wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players each select a color and the goal is to collect all three of the fish matching that color.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all the fish tokens are placed face down in the middle of the board.  Each player picks one fish token to begin then, in order, players spin and spinner.  If the spin results in a &quot;Go Fish,&quot; the player selects a fish token from the middle of the board.  If a number is spun, the player moves on the board and takes the action on the space.  There three actions: &quot;Go Fish&quot; where a player selects a piece from the middle, &quot;Shark!&quot; where a player must put a fish back in the middle, and &quot;Ask!&quot; where a player can ask another player for a fish.  If a player is asked for a fish and doesn't have it, he tells the other player to go fish.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately after one player collects all three fish of his color.&#10;&#10;",

On the other side this is a nightmare for game collectors, as the box measures 20&times;14&times;2 inches. Add a gameboard twice its size, other game components and both box halves made of ultra-thick cardboard, a book containing all the game's treasures of the world and their descriptions and last but not least metal game pieces, and you have a game weight of over 3 kg.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple but fun for the whole family. Out of nearly 100 cards you get a random set of 5. They show the treasures you have to find and to dig out. You travel one of the numerous routes on the board depicting a world map to reach your destination as fast as possible. In order to do this there is a clever system how to use your dice roll. When you reach your destination you take 2 special dice, pay the digging fee and try your luck.&#10;&#10;To enhance your treasure income, you can choose whenever you want to unearth one of the nearly 50 additional pirate treasures. But destination is hidden, and if luck is not on your side, you have to travel round the globe to reach it, and you are not allowed to skip it!&#10;&#10;Game ends when the first player reaches home port after his last treasure of the initial 5 has been lifted, but winner is the one with the most income.&#10;&#10;Highlight of the game are the pawns: Tiny little petroleum lanterns made of metal in 6 different colours.&#10;&#10;Parts Inventory:&#10;&#10;2 d6 of various sizes/types of the day&#10;2 special red lucite dice with zeros on four sides&#10;6 lantern movers large or small&#10;64 or 65 black cards&#10;30 red cards&#10;20 $500    chips&#10;30 $1,000  chips&#10;30 $5,000  chips&#10;30 $10,000 chips&#10;10 $50,000 chips&#10;&#10;",

Play by yourself or with up to eight players. Play your own boat by starting behind an imaginary line sailing to windward, tacking to avoid the head wind, rounding the mark, reaching to the second mark and on to the downwind leg of the course. The basic strategy involves port and starboard tacking and staying clear of the competition. Fun and instructive for the new sailor and a challenge for the experienced skipper. The whole family will love to play as there are no complicated wind changes and the game moves along at a pace that will keep everyone interested.

    "Description": "Empire is light civilization-building game, played using 4 shared decks of cards.  In that respect, it bears some similarity to games such as San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, but with added combat and resource-development elements reminiscent of Magic: the Gathering.  The game, the first offering by fledgling publisher Gurushar Games, provides 2 to 4 players six different paths to victory: either by amassing 80 Gold (a measure of the civilization's wealth), 30 Order (a measure of infrastructure and governmental improvements), or 10 Support (a measure of the civilization's morale).  Alternatively, a player may attempt to reduce their opponent's Gold, Order, or Support to 0, thus eliminating them from the game.&#10;Similarly to Magic: the Gathering, Resource (i.e. land) cards, such as farms or villages, are played, and then taxed to produce Gold.  This Gold is then spent to play more Resources.  It is also possible to use this Gold to buy Units (which defend the land, or can attack an opponent's Order), or Systems (e.g. Democracy, Capitalism, Martial Law), which provide permanent upgrades to a player's capabilities.  Alternatively, your Gold may be spent to trigger 1-time Event cards, or simply hoarded to reach the 80-Gold victory condition.&#10;&#10;",

Similarly a vice at the head of a snake results in the outcome at its tail (eg argumentative --&gt; isolated; worried --&gt; tired).&#10;&#10;A booklet accompanies the game that defines each virtue/vice in one sentence simply understood by a 7 year old.&#10;&#10;Some squares allow the player to draw from the 'Virtue deck'. &quot;These cards describe how a virtuous attitude can rescue you from the karmic payback  for hurtful, negative attitudes.&quot;&#10;&#10;The final variation on the traditional game is the last eight squares called the Safe Zone, which allow the player to draw from the 'Power Deck' of cards. &quot;On reaching this zone of the 8 Powers you are safe under their canopy, protected from all negative influences, because an inner voice guides you away from situations which steal your energy. In this zone you enjoy strength, good fortune and happiness.&quot;&#10;&#10;A score pad is included that encourages each player to write down each of the virtues that they accumulate during the game.&#10;&#10;The material does not appear to be specific to any one religion.&#10;&#10;",

It combines card collecting and trading with game play that requires both strategy and skill.&#10;&#10;Two players go head to head in a game of football, with each directing their own personalized team. Through collecting uniquely designed footballer character cards, each with their own special skills, players have a limitless choice of strategies and tactics so no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;Play centres on taking alternate turns to build your footballer character cards into attacking and defending moves whilst the footballer character special skills enable you to enhance your moves or disrupt your opponents.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions placed on formations or style of play. You can pick a team of bruisers with special skills like &quot;Body check&quot; and &quot;Thundering tackle&quot; or try to cheat your way to victory with &quot;Covert cynical tackle&quot; and &quot;Diver cheat&quot; or play the classy way with &quot;Playmaker&quot; and &quot;Attacking pace&quot; or blend them altogether.&#10;&#10;It's a language-level2 game as play centres on the text on the cards, although once payers become familiar with their cards this text is seldom used.&#10;&#10;The first release of cards is entitled &quot;Hell In The Pacific - The Unity&quot; and includes 81 unique footballer character cards from 40 countries. These first edition cards may be hard to come by as the publishing company is rolling the game out through Hobby stores, Bookshops and Football Club Shops in the UK on a regional basis.&#10;&#10;Further releases of cards &quot;New Blood&quot; and &quot;The Final Conflict&quot; which increase the number of strategic and tactical permutations are scheduled for 2009 and 2010.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.footballresurrection.com&#10;&#10;",

On their way out they need to evade traps and fight demons.&#10;&#10;The Vault of Illusion (2-6 players)&#10;More dynamic and complex game, compared to the others. The adventurers move across a multicoloured hex grid at random, dictated by a coloured spinner. The goal is to acquire a magic weapon and then battle one of six different monsters.&#10;&#10;",

The Boards here have 9 different kinds of Space Obstacles and Vortexes.

Counters are on 8 1/2 x 11-inch large sheets showing the weapons systems in detail that the silhouettes on the BFA counters only implied. THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR MORE PEOPLE (UP T0 11 can play). Each player handles one ship. Sun Slayers specializes in OutPosts, Beacons, Omega Ships, Monitors; all are enclosed and utilize the drama of the long-term duties of the Star Forces in the  defensive OutPosts that might be raided at any time to poke a hole into Federation territory, for Taal Battle Cruisers to rush through and how fast Thetan and Alliance ships can rush to the aid of the Defensive Line.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The number of dice or distance rolled will be modified if the aircraft dives, turns, or performs special maneuvers (stall, climb, barrel roll, or loop).&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by the attacker rolling machine gun dice and the defender rolling maneuverability dice. For the basic planes, each player rolls 3d6, with a hit being scored if the attacker rolls a higher total. A plane is shot down after taking six hits.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules cover gun jams, sun position, rear gunners, custom planes, pilot skill levels, and damage effects.&#10;&#10;Variant rules suggestions are included for Star Wars dogfights.&#10;&#10;",

Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&#10;&#10;&quot;Severiano&quot; (named after the famous Spanish golf player Severiano Ballesteros), was included in issue 2 and was obviously a golf match simulation. Players had to provide two counters (representing balls) and two dice, plus pencils and paper to note scores. Dice rolling determine the movement of the counters, while several terrain features affect movement in different ways.&#10;&#10;",
