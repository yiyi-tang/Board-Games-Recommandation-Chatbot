    "Description": "In addition to being an incredibly popular pastime, beloved by an impressively broad and diverse fanbase, Blood Bowl is also a shockingly lucrative business. Imperial Nobility teams have been springing up out of the woodwork of late, the seemingly bottomless coffers of their patrons hiring top talent, providing the finest equipment and training facilities, and supporting their teams through extensive advertising campaigns. The B&ouml;genhafen Barons are the most popular of such teams, exploding onto the scene and shaking things up.&#10;&#10;While superficially similar to Human teams, the Imperial Nobility have a different skill set that makes them very tricky to play against. A well-coached team can keep their opponents guessing while setting up the solid Noble Blitzers to score. They look absolutely incredible whether they're winning or losing, clad in the finest equipment you're likely to see on any pitch.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to build the B&ouml;genhafen Barons, an Imperial Nobility team for use in games of Blood Bowl. It contains 12 players:&#10;&ndash; 4 Imperial Retainer Linemen&#10;&ndash; 4 Bodyguards&#10;&ndash; 2 Noble Blitzers&#10;&ndash; 2 Imperial Throwers&#10;&#10;You'll also find 2 turn counters, 2 coins, 4 balls, 12 32mm Round Blood Bowl bases, and a transfer sheet.&#10;&#10;The rules to use Imperial Nobility teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Blood Bowl (Second Season Edition): Spike!

    "Description": "Black Orcs have been splitting off and forming their own teams for years now. Smarter, stronger, and more serious than their kin, they were tired of soaking up all the big hits and giving up all the glory. Their biggest weakness is a lack of speed &ndash; but that's where the Goblins come in. Well drilled in comparison to their peers, the little guys are quick to run the ball through any gaps the Black Orcs open up for them. Even the trolls on Black Orc teams are well trained, which is an impressive feat!&#10;&#10;Teams like the Thunder Valley Greenskins have made a name for themselves with their impressive athleticism and discipline as much as their capacity for grievous violence. If you like your plays rather unsubtle, this is the team for you. Grind down the pitch, crushing the other players underfoot, until your Goblins are close enough to make a dash for the End Zone. Score. Repeat.&#10;&#10;Incredibly strong on offence and hard to shift on defence, a well-managed Black Orc team is a fearsome thing to face off against across the Line of Scrimmage.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to build the Thunder Valley Greenskins, a Black Orc team for use in games of Blood Bowl.

    "Description": "Amateur games of Blood Bowl are often played on a smaller pitch, with fewer players. A quick game of Sevens is a well-loved way to settle a grudge, pass the time, or take out business and romantic rivals with a convenient 'accident'. Even professional teams occasionally play a game of Sevens to stay sharp or as a charity event.&#10;&#10;As Blood Bowl Sevens is played with fewer players on each team, it makes sense that the pitch is reduced in size too. As such, some pitches are smaller than standard Blood Bowl regulations dictate, designed specifically for use when playing games of Sevens.&#10;&#10;This simplified version of the game is ideal for younger players, busy coaches, or anyone looking to get into the game with a shallower learning curve.&#10;&#10;This reversible Blood Bowl pitch features a standard turf field on one side and astrogranite tiles on the reverse. Though the size is reduced, all the standard markings are present and accounted for.&#10;&#10;You'll also find a pair of matching double-sided dugouts to complete the theme. Redesigned for games of Sevens, each dugout features a shorter Score, Turn, and Re-roll tracker, plus Reserves, Knocked-out, and Casualty boxes. You'll need a copy of both Blood Bowl &ndash; The Official Rules and the Blood Bowl: Second Season Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Death Zone supplement to use this pitch.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once upon a time there was an enchanted forest in a magical land where a playful lioness cub happened upon a storybook with the most wonderful tales. Little lioness imagined herself as the main character with a flowing cape and super strength. She showed the book to all her creature friends, who also dreamed of what it would be like to be one of these fabled names. What if all critters could become their favorite characters? With Character Critters game, you can help them reach this dream!&#10;&#10;Character Critters is an imaginative drawing game for the whole family. Every round, each player receives a random Character Card and Critter Card and draws the Critter in the style of the Character. What would a horse look like as Rapunzel? How about a kangaroo Santa Claus? Players draw their Character Critters simultaneously and earn points by guessing drawings correctly and having their drawings correctly guessed. There are also Jr. Character cards included for younger players so they can conjure up a scientist penguin or a frog who&rsquo;s a clown. With over 4,000 possible card combinations, you&rsquo;ll flex your creativity and make some delightfully unique art each time you play!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The heroes of the game get married and fall into insanity, get an education and meet celebrities, sit in gulag camps and try to survive the war.&#10;&#10;148 historical events presented in the game paint a comprehensive picture of Soviet life and tell about culture and science, wars and economic breakthroughs, political terror and international relations. Each event has a different effect on the characters, depending on their class (worker, peasant, &quot;former&quot;, security officer, military, specialist, enemy of the people and informal) and how their personal life develop.&#10;When moving along the board, player pick a card for their  character personal life and another for the USSR.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players gets to 1991, the end of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who scored the most points by participating in various historical events, as well as the achievements of the Soviet country, in which his/her characters participated.&#10;&#10;&ndash; mostly translated from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Command an elite group of death-defying spaceships desperately harvesting energy from a dying star before it explodes in this game of orbital mechanics. Utilizing a unique spiral gameboard inspired by the ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (previously reconstructed and released by the same game designer, Zach Horton), Supernova requires you to make tough choices, as all of your ships must share the same energy allotment, and it is never enough to power them all at once.&nbsp; The more you power, the fewer Boost Points each one receives, restricting its maneuverability.&nbsp; This is a high-stakes tradeoff, as the star's gravity pulls all of your ships ever closer. You'll need to boost your orbits to keep from burning up.&#10;&#10;Ships move in a counterclockwise spiral toward the star at the center, while the star releases energy bursts (cubes) that travel clockwise toward the edges of the board.&nbsp; The core of the game lies in the interactions between the energy cubes and ships as they collide.&nbsp; Different types of cubes behave differently, but all are dangerous and all are valuable if you can capture them.&nbsp; Clear and yellow cubes can be stored and used as energy to perform special actions, while yellow and red cubes count as victory points at the end of the game.&nbsp; These energy cubes serve as your primary obstacles, primary goal, in-game currency, and victory points.&#10;&#10;Players take turns deciding how many ships to power and then moving each one according to both gravity and Boost Points.&nbsp; Ships can form special formations to help protect them, block your opponents, and collect energy cubes.&nbsp; After players have taken their turns, each round ends with a &quot;star action&quot; that moves the cubes on the board and releases new ones.&nbsp; The sequence of star actions is determined by randomly drawing cards when you set up the game.&nbsp; Thus every game is completely different.&nbsp; Players can only see the star cards for the current and next rounds, and therefore have limited information about future conditions.&nbsp; Despite this element of long-term uncertainty, however, there is no other luck in the game.&nbsp; Players have complete control over the outcomes of their actions.&#10;&#10;Supernova is relatively easy to play, but exceptionally difficult to master, as it asks you to think in spiral rather than linear geometry.&nbsp; The game's mechanics offer many possible ways to achieve your goals, but far more options become available when you begin to work with rather than against the spiral: sometimes the most efficient path from A to B is the long way around...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

First, reveal a &quot;spot&quot; card &mdash; something like a block party, car show, or family reunion &mdash; each with one of five different vibes. Players then pick an action card, an energy card, and potentially a boost card to play all at once. Actions can give you boosts and cancel your opponents'. Energy cards have a variety of values and give you boosts if they match the spot's vibe, but you can use each energy card only once!&#10;&#10;Once players have taken their actions, and energy has been counted, whoever has the most wins the spot! Spots are worth points on their own, but are worth extra points if they are collected as a set, or match a player's personal vibe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Divorce of Druids and the Division of the Domains is a game about a druidic dyad splitting up and dividing their domain, which includes a variety of creatures and plants. The druids are torn between taking what they need to form a harmonious land for themselves and leaving their once beloved partner druid with enough to create a harmonious land as well.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player is the Divider while the other is the Decider. The Divider literally cuts the land into two distinct fragments, and then the Decider chooses which to take first.&#10;&#10;Each player forms their new domain by gluing these land fragments onto a blank map. Fragments may be divided again using a limited number of additional cuts. After you glue things onto your land, you can colour them in.&#10;&#10;Every living thing within your land has a Law determining how it scores at the end of the game. As a half of a druidic dyad, you have been responsible for half of the things within your land, so you only know half of the laws of your land. Your beloved knows the other half.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will question your beloved about the other Laws, gaining knowledge about how to score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;descriptions from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A gateway naval strategy game with no reinforcements on the way. Players take the helm of a fleet they construct at the beginning of the game to sail around the map, seize islands, and loose cannons on the enemy. First to control 6 islands or be the last ship sailing is claimed to be the newest Old Salt and is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Players can opt to play with or without faction abilities but will construct a fleet in a draft selection at the start of the game. There are 5 ship types players can choose from with limited coins to purchase ships with. On a player's turn, they have the option to sail, fire cannons, seize islands, and if playing with faction abilities will have access to 3 more unique abilities. Players can do these actions in any order as long as they don't exceed maximum sail distance (3 tiles unless sailing over tradewinds), don't fire more times than their ship's health points and have the gold to pay for what they want to do.&#10;&#10;Players are allowed to sail up to three ships on their turn a distance of 3 tiles unless assisted by a known trade wind that grants a bonus of 2 tiles of movement. Position your ships carefully as the broadside of a ship and stern/bow impact game play and firing options on and off turn.&#10;&#10;Players fire at the enemy by counting the tiles to the enemy ship and rolling that amount or more. On the die is a blank side which if rolled, results in an automatic miss. Cannons aren't perfect weapons so sometimes it's best to use faction abilities to finish off an enemy ship. When a player destroys a ship, they will take the mast off the ship they destroyed and use it in a future transaction to seize an island or turn in at the top of their turn for a bounty reward.&#10;&#10;In order to seize an island, a players ship must be adjacent to the island in question. The transfer of ownership costs 2 gold plus 1 gold for each enemy ship that occupies that island within the area (two tiles of the island). The player must also turn in a mast belonging to the island's current faction owner. If all costs are met and paid for, the transfer of ownership is immediate and the first to 6 islands is pronounced the Old Salt and the winner of the battle.&#10;&#10;The faction abilities add a new level of replayability and strategy to the game as each faction has 3 abilities that are unique to them and their theme. Players can construct their fleet to offset a particular weakness of the faction or to enhance a strength of theirs. New players are encouraged to play their first 3 rounds without factions in order to gauge their comfortability before adding in the additional abilities and layer of depth this game can reach while still being excellent for those unfamiliar with the wargaming genre.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Play as one of four goatherds whose prized goat has escaped atop the nearby mountain. The paths are constantly shifting and the mountain full of pitfalls and perils, preventing you from quickly bringing your beloved goat home. Using your wits, and a bit of luck, you may just be the first to win bra-a-a-aging rights over your fellow shepherds!&#10;&#10;To begin, each player should choose their house. Place the 'Top of the Mountain' card in the center of the play area. Create the game deck by shuffling together the directional and effect cards. Building outwards from the 'Top of the Mountain', deal a 7x7 grid from the game deck with the cards dealt face down. Place the houses as the corners of the square grid.&#10;&#10;Finally, deal each player 3 cards as their hand. Place all goats on the 'Top of the Mountain'. Place each shepherd on their respective house.&#10;&#10;ON EACH TURN:&#10;&#10;1) Move your goat&#10;&#10;Roll the directional dice. Move your goat in the direction rolled. The 'Top of the Mountain' acts as the game's compass.&#10;&#10;2) Your move (choose one of the following)&#10;&#10;Option 1: Move your shepherd&#10;Shepherds can only move in the four cardinal directions, following the path formed by face-up cards. If you move onto a face-down card, reveal it and align two arrows to discover the path. If it is an effect card, resolve its effects immediately.&#10;&#10;Option 2: Play an advantage card&#10;You may exchange a card in your hand for any face-down card on the board. Play it face-up and keep the face-down card in your hand. If the card played is an effect card, resolve its effects immediately.&#10;&#10;Option 3: Rotate your current card&#10;You may rotate your current card by 90 degrees.

For example, to defeat the fox ninja we need 2 fire attacks, which are created on the character sheet from the dagger fighting style and certain dice.

The winner is the person with the highest score (the sum of all the atomic numbers of the elements making up the surviving compounds) at the end of the game.&quot; - Description from the instructions.&#10;&#10;Atom@tak is a simple card game in which players create chemical compounds in order to score the most points. On a player's turn, they may play cards from their hand to form chemical compounds based on the real electron configuration of the elements involved. Some compounds are poisonous, explosive, or radioactive which can destroy opponents' compounds if they do not have a card to defend against it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tri Dimensional Chess, or tri-d chess was inspired by a stage property created by Irving A Feinberg for use in the Star Trek television program. While it appeared or was referenced in six episodes (Where No Man Has Gone Before, Charlie X. Court Martial, By Any Other Name, Whom Gods Destroy (dialogue only), Day of the Dove) no rules were ever developed for the game during the original run of the show. However, it did appear to be a two-player only game played with with standard chess pieces having (when viewed in plan) standard chess moves albeit on a multi-level play area.&#10;&#10;The play area consists of three chequered 4x4 boards, called levels, mounted at different heights so that the bottom level overlaps the middle level by 2 rows at one end and the top level overlaps the middle by 2 rows at the other end. Additionally, four 2x2 boards, called attack boards, are mounted on columns that may be fitted at any of the four corners of the three main levels. These attack boards may be moved around during play. Due to the overlap, all the boards are transparent. When viewed from above, the square colour of one level or attack board matches the colour and of those above and below (e.g. colourless above colourless, coloured above coloured; the colourless squares are called white and the coloured are called black in standard terminology). However, in the television series (e.g., By Any Other Name) the top level is oriented so that the left hand square of the side nearest the camera is red while the corresponding square of the middle and bottom levels are both colourless meaning this top down perspective of matching colours above colours was not based on the tv show.&#10;&#10;Outside of the tv show, rules for the game were first hinted at in the 1975 Ballantine Books in Franz Josef Schnaubelt's Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual but there is nothing close to a playable game explained. Encouraged by Schnaubelt, chess player and Star Trek fan Andrew Bartmess published a full set of rules of play. Since then numerous rule sets have been created including those by Jens Meder which include rules for tournament play (largely meaning rules on arbitration, use of a chess clock, official notation, etc.) and the official rules of the World Tri Dimensional Chess Federation written by military fighter pilot John Hawkins ostensibly partially inspired by aerial combat tactics.&#10;&#10;The most notable difference between the various sets of rules are to do with the attack boards and vertical movement of pieces. For example, do the attack boards always stand above the levels, or may they be &quot;inverted&quot; to hang as pendants below the levels? Can they move with just one pawn or with any other single piece?  When viewed in plan, do pieces block movement for all levels or can the moving piece travel on one level if the other piece is on a different level? Can pieces move just vertically or must they always have least some horizontal component? Lesser differences between rules sets include promotion (e.g., does an attack board above the pawn mean the pawn does not promote) and castling (i.e., kings and rooks start on the attack boards, do they just swap spaces or does one piece move to the main level).&#10;&#10;While Tri-D chess bears similarity to the 3-D Chess Game from Lynn R Johnson, the first episode featuring the Tri-D chess set aired in 1966 while Johnson's game was not published until 1967.&#10;&#10;",

The other players have to guess what's missing on the transparent paper, in other words, what was on the drawer's card. The player who first guesses correctly earns 1 point, with the drawer losing 1 point if no one guesses.&#10;&#10;To win, being clever is more important than being a good artist.

    "Description": "In the Flying Gang, you take command of a small ship and try to gain leadership of the Flying Gang.&#10;The Flying Gang was founded in the 17th century and was able to establish its own pirate empire for around 5 years.&#10;&#10;Among the most famous members were pirates such as Benjamin Hornigold, Henry Jennings, Edward Teach alias Blackbeard or Anne Bonny......&#10;&#10;Flying Gang is a turn-based game for 2-4 players with some historical events.&#10;&#10;The player who has collected the most pirate points at the end of the game immediately goes into a PVP battle against the captain of the Flying Gang.&#10;The strength of the captain only becomes apparent during the course of the game as this is controlled by political cards.&#10;The captain of the Flying Gang gets all the expansions that players can buy from these cards. The game lasts 8 rounds and only one of four cards is drawn in each round.&#10;&#10;For example, the Thirty Years' War, Western Design or Holmes Bonefire.&#10;&#10;It is therefore impossible to predict how strong the captain will be in the end.&#10;&#10;To gain pirate points, players can raid towns, attack other ships, recover treasures, fulfill quests.&#10;By raiding neutral ships or historical pirates, the player receives loot, which he can then sell in the harbors to buy improvements or a better ship.&#10;&#10;In Flying Gang there is an easy-to-understand combat system like rock-paper-scissors.&#10;&#10;There are many different cards in the game.&#10;Sea movement cards, treasure cards, equipment cards, political cards and quest cards.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to take up the challenge and become the leader of the Flying Gang?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Dra. Motus and the Cordis&quot; is a board game to develop socio-emotional skills for children over 6 years old and adults. It has been created by V&iacute;ctor Garrido and Pablo C&aacute;rcamo, illustrated by Juanca Cort&eacute;s, and edited by Boreal Ediciones.&#10;&#10;Dra. Motus is a leading scientist who has dedicated her life to making robots capables of behaving like human beings. After years of work and effort, she has managed to give life to &quot;the Cordis&quot;, fabulous creatures with great knowledge but who are still learning about the emotions of humans. To check the emotional abilities of the Cordis, Dra. Motus has designed a series of questions that must be answered through beautiful illustrations in order to interpret the emotions of the other players.&#10;&#10;In each of the game modes, you will assume the role of Dra. Motus and question the other players, who will be Cordis looking to show that they understand emotions better than the rest. In this challenge, each Cordis will be equipped with an emotion chip. As in life, different emotions allow us to act in different ways: emotion chips offer Cordis various abilities during the game. Along with this, the illustrations will be great allies to interpret the emotions of Dra. Motus in different situations.&#10;&#10;COMPETITIVE MODE&#10;Each player receives 5 image plaques.  One player is Dr Motus, who must pick a situation card. Each situation card has 2 scenarios, and the doctor must choose one of them. Then, every other player must pick one of their image plaques that they believe best represents the feelings of Dr Motus about the situation. Then Dr Motus picks the best one and that player wins a point. Since Dr Motus didn&rsquo;t had the chance to win points, she has the option to face a challenge card.&#10;Then, another player plays the role of Dr. Motus.&#10;In the competitive mode the first person to reach 4/5 victory points (depending on the number of players) will win.&#10;&#10;COOPERATIVE MODE&#10;I this mode we display 3 emotions cards in the center of the table and every player receives 3 image plaques. &#10;Dr Motus must pick one of the image plaques and place it on the table, without saying what emotion that cards mean for her. Then, all other players as a team try to guess the correct emotion. If they guess right, they win a point. In the cooperative mode players try to get the best score possible and compare it to a table.&#10;&#10;",
