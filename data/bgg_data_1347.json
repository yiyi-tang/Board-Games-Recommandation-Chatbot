They are numbered 331 - 384.&#10;&#10;Mistfall: Heart of the Mists is is a fully cooperative card-based adventure game set in a world of mystery, eldritch powers and perilous adventures. Heart of the Mists continues the story of Mistfall in a standalone expansion featuring new Heroes, Enemies, Encounters and Quests, and introducing Allies, as well as alternative versions of some of the base game mechanisms.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a fixed deck of equipment and power cards, as well as a set of upgrades that can be added directly to a player&rsquo;s hand during the game. A semi-randomly created board makes for a different landscape every time the game is played, and randomized sets of encounters and enemies create different challenges for players to face before their time runs out.&#10;&#10;Mistfall: Heart of the Mists introduces more of what made Mistfall great, making it a good entry point for new gamers, as well as a solid expansion for existing fans. With next to no elements replicated from the base set, Heart of the Mists is the perfect addition to the existing Mistfall set &ndash; and a challenging experience both solitaire, as well as with a group of up to three friends.&#10;&#10;Gather up your resolve, check your gear and get ready to go to the smoldering heart of the unrelenting Mists!&#10;&#10;",

Build your web, grow your colony and enhance your skills as you struggle to gain food and fend off attackers. There is an ominous humming sound as the Hoover-Bot 3000 gets closer and closer to the web, threatening a to destroy to your colony in a horrible Hoovergeddon. Your only chance is build an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse weapon) from parts you find in the lab and fire it off to destroy the Hoover-Bot. Can you build the EMP in time, or will you be overrun by attacking critters and meet your Hoovergeddon.&#10;&#10;Game Description&#10;&#10;Arachnid is a cooperative game for 2-4 players. Each player is a spider with unique abilities controlled by their own action board with upgradable worker placement spots. The center play area is a hex grid, where the spiders reside and tiles are placed as the web is spun. This shared web is the spider&rsquo;s home, where food is trapped, new skills are acquired, and new workers are hatched.&#10;&#10;Flies occasionally fly by, becoming trapped, and eventually, food. Players influence when the Flies are triggered, but this also increases the risk of Critters attacking the web. It's a fine balance between starvation and safety. Players can also enhance their spider skills, but this involves sacrificing parts of their valuable web home.&#10;&#10;How to lose&#10;&#10;-If the web somehow becomes detached from the edges of the board due to critter attacks, it will mean the end of the colony.&#10;&#10;-if the Golden Scarab reached the Den in the center of the web , then &quot;Activates&quot;, the colony will be destroyed.&#10;&#10;-If the the Hoover-Bot reaches the web, the game will end in a horrible Hoovergeddon.&#10;&#10;How to win&#10;&#10;Find enough spare parts to create the EMP, then all spiders meet at the Den to set it off and fry the Hoover-Bot.

Cards from the deck are used to replenish the well first, and then the hand. The highest score when the deck runs out wins.&#10;&#10;Yammer Solitaire: Yammer for one player, aiming to have a high score at the end, or the fewest cards unused.&#10;&#10;Yammy: Gin Rummy with the Yammer deck.  Wild cards and multipliers are removed. Players start with 9-card hands, and on their turn they draw from the top of the draw or discard pile, and then discard a card. The round ends when one player can use their whole hand to spell words, each of which must be of the same color.  Play until winning a target number of rounds or reaching a target total score.&#10;&#10;500 Yammy: 500 Rummy with the Yammer deck. Like Yammy, except that players may play single-color words during their turn, and/or add to existing words on the table.  They may also draw any card in the discard pile, but they must use that card to make a word immediately, and must draw all cards above that card in the pile.  A round ends when one person depletes their hand.  Play until reaching a target total score.&#10;&#10;",

Vaults filled with gold, gems, and other valuables, a great many of which were stolen from the dragons they had driven out of the cave centuries before.  Legends have it that the dragon who lived in the cave fought to defend it until the bitter end.  It is said that in those last minutes he withdrew into himself and all that was left of him was a glowing crystal egg that has become known as a soul gem.  Perhaps out of some strange sense of dragon pride or out of personal greed you have decided to make the dangerous run through the caverns in hopes of grabbing the soul gem.&#10;&#10;Dwarven Dive is an intense race through a series of defended caves.  The maps and defenses are set out as the game progresses to make for a different game each and every time it is played.  Which dragon will be the first to make it to the vault and retrieve the fabled soul gem?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;  1 folio cover&#10;  15 map sheets&#10;  Two counter sheets with 60 total counters, consisting of:&#10;    20x Dwarven Troops&#10;    15x Dwarven Priest&#10;    10x Recharging&#10;    15x Field Artillery&#10;  1 Scenario Booklet&#10;&#10;",

However, before the cases can be solved, the players have to follow the perpetrators from one city to the next. In order to find out where and when the perpetrators will appear next, the players must carefully analyze the 50 case cards and solve puzzles. If the players need help, they can use clue cards. At the end of a case, the players take the solution card to check how many details they have correctly determined. They get one point for each correct detail. Finally, the evaluation of the investigative work takes place based on the total number of points achieved.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

The barricade must not fall!&#10;&#10;A game turn is comprised of 3 phases:&#10;&#10;     Barricade Phase - roll the red D6 Action die &amp; consult the Action table (add zombies or add to the barricade)&#10;     Car Phase - roll the red D6 Action die &amp; consult the Action table (add zombies or remove from the barricade)&#10;     End Phase - zombie check &amp; increase the black D8 Hour die&#10;&#10;&#10;Players loose if there are 10 zombies at the barricade.&#10;Players win if the D8 Hour die value exceeds 8.&#10;&#10;",

The card will not be worth 10 points unless you bid 30 and 50 in future auctions.&#10;&#10;The economy is relatively closed with winning bids going to the auctioneer, and the auctioneer's bids going to the bank; however, if any player bids an amount shown on the card up for auction, that card receives a coin from the bank, covering that number.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players earn points for their completed cards, purple cards with special scoring criteria, star symbols on cards, and a bit for leftover money. Of note, players without at least one star symbol are eliminated. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Bohnanza, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: 25 Jahre-Edition is a special 25th anniversary edition of the game that contains a new bean type (&quot;Elsterbohne&quot;; magpie bean) and comes with three variant games, one of which will use a collectible coin packaged in the box.&#10;&#10;",

Our Tale about Invasion takes us right to the Eye of Zamrock, or how people there call it - &lsquo;the Eye&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;It is now nearing the end of the Eight Age after the Becoming and by surprise, the Demon King was slain while trying to set hold in the Eye. This left his younger brother Lorial unattained and a new King of Demon Realm. The New King's lust for vengeance and hatred against all life pushed him to force open a portal in the middle of the Eye at the Crystal Lake Iris.&#10;&#10;It was in this dark hour that the almost forgotten prophecy was unearthed. It speaks of one Kingdom that will rise above all others and build a Crystal Tower that will shine the light which will destroy the invaders and cast its beam to discover the Truth that will save the Eye and free all.&#10;&#10;But the the prophecy brought hope as much as the divide, for Kings&rsquo; ambitions extend beyond the current conflict, as each one hopes to emerge from the war as the strongest ruler, worthy of uniting Zamrock under a single banner.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory, but not all lead to saving the world. Become the leader of one of Six Kingdoms of the Eye and balance your relationship with other players and your ulterior motives to become the leading Kingdom in order to attain the most victory points. Command your Kingdom where you build up your city, armies, equip your Hero through quests, and expand with your Emissary and fight Demon forces who have built a Portal in the iris of the world to destroy everything. There are five different areas in which your Kingdom can gain influence - Battle, Trade, Build, Quest and Colonization. Enough influence points allow you to acquire crystals needed to construct Crystal Tower.&#10;&#10;Demons win if any of the Kingdoms fail to build their Crystal Tower to level three by the end of the 24th Turn of play. If the Tower is built, demon Portal closes and a celebratory Tournament is held. Kingdom with the most EOZ Medals, in the end, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Be advised, straying too much from the path of stopping the invasion can make everything you do to expand your Kingdom futile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Everyone who was anyone in the industry had come together for the new edition of the &quot;Schlager-Megaparade&quot;. The Christmas edition of Germany's most successful TV entertainment show was to be recorded in midsummer of all times. For it neither costs nor efforts were spared! Presenter and pop star Michael Prinz would again present a mix of well-known stars and promising newcomers. The show with snow cannons and a skating reindeer ballet should not only provide for Christmas mood in the living rooms of the spectators, but also strongly boost the record sales of the performing artists.&#10;&#10;The recording began punctually at 6:30 p.m. in the sold-out Magdeburg Stadthalle. All the artists were eagerly awaiting their turn. But shortly after the show began, a shrill scream echoed through the hall: a production assistant had found the artist Janine Bayer dead in her dressing room. The singer, who had won the industry award &quot;Der Goldene Gockel&quot; a few weeks ago, was supposed to present her new No. 1 hit &quot;Ich tr&auml;um von mir heut Nacht&quot; that evening.&#10;&#10;Of course, you immediately called an ambulance and the police.

    "Description": "The Winter King is a variant of the Command &amp; Colors system for fighting battles of the Late Renaissance, focusing primarily on the late 16th to the mid-17th Century. This includes the French Wars of Religion, the Dutch Revolt, the 30 Years War, and the English Civil War. Other conflict areas within this time period (say the 1560s through the 1650&rsquo;s) should also play well with this system, but earlier conflicts (such as the Italian Wars) or later ones will be less and less representative the farther away from these dates you get.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Athanasia is a Scifi/Fantasy Competitive Skirmish Wargame where players engage in tactical conflict to secure the key to immortality.&#10;&#10;Players mobilize and strategically position their characters, leverage their surroundings to increase their power, and battle their rivals as they venture towards victory.&#10;&#10;Every character has a value that determines their health, movement, defense, and attack power as well as additional character abilities that increase their effectiveness on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player is allotted 3 activation points for their civilization which they can use in a variety of ways to increase their own power as well as decrease their rival's power as they carve their path towards victory.&#10;&#10;In a given turn a player may: Move their characters across the battlefield based on their allowed movement, collect and activate items that spawn dynamically, activate obelisks to increase their movement, defense, and attack power, activate character abilities to weaken their rivals, and attack or steal items from adjacent rivals using a D20 die to simulate battle. As in any battle, strength in numbers always helps you come out on top. When attacking or defending from rivals, you get additional D20 roll or defense bonuses by positionally linking your characters together.&#10;&#10;Securing the key to immortality first requires crafting it at the crafting table in the center of the battlefield using both the philosopher's stone and antimatter which are spawned throughout the game. The race is then on for a civilization to secure the key and activate it at the battlefield's exit point. The player that successfully activates the key at the exit point is the winner. Alternatively, you can win Athanasia by being the sole survivor after obliterating your rivals. Will you be the first to reach immortality?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This cube tracks the available amount of actions to fulfill your current directive.&#10;Each time the cube reaches the end of its track, the campaign deck gets updated and if you take too long, you might have failed your current directive. When the campaign deck runs out, you tally your score and if that score is better than your previous scores, you can rejoice!&#10;&#10;In summary, this is a game of heavy action-economy optimization. You are trying to fulfill your goal with the most optimal sequence of actions while trying to improve your overall situation to have a better chance to also tackle the next directive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
