    "Description": "The players race for conquering Mt. Everest. The game features a 3d mountain with the East, Southwest and North faces of Everest.&#10;&#10;The players may choose to begin either in Kathmandu or Lhasa. Players advance by rolling a die. The approach march takes place on the flat part of the board and once you have reached your base camp you may again choose between longer and shorter, but more risky, routes to the summit.&#10;&#10;There are three kinds of event cards, for approach march, camp and climbing events. A card is drawn when a player lands on a marked space or a camp. There are both good and bad events to advance or delay the conquest.&#10;&#10;When climbing players must set up 4 camps and go back and forth between them to &quot;acclimatize&quot;. Aluminum ladders and safety ropes may be set up by successful die roll to get over chasms and evil spots. Once the player enters the Death Zone (over 8000 m) oxygen tanks are needed. In case all oxygen is consumed without the player being able to reach the summit, she must return to previous camp to get more. The first player back at base camp after summiting Everest is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Belankas is the Malay name for the King Crab, one of the pictures featured in the game.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a four-sided tee-totum. Modern Belankai spinners are made from a thin wooden dowel that runs through a cuboid piece of plastic with the pictures engraved on four sides. The pictures are a king crab, a flower/star/coin (hard to tell - the pictures are all stylized), a fish and a prawn (c.f. Hoo Hey How).&#10;&#10;A staking board is drawn on any large piece of paper (or the ground) showing the four symbols. Players stake on the pictures and the banker (who will claim the stakes or pay winnings) spins the tee-totum in wide dish and covers it with a bowl. When the tee-totum comes to rest, it is revealed and players are payed according to whichever picture has come to rest on top.&#10;&#10;Dobree describes that a plate of rice is often to be found where this game is played - it is used to hold the dish where the tee-totum is spun and serves to steady the dish and deaden  the sound of the top when it is spinning.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hoo Hey How is a Chinese dice game with similarities to Crown and Anchor dice. This gambling game consists of three dice with six different pictures on their sides and a paper board marked with the same six pictures for stakes to be placed on them. This board could be self-drawn but you can get printed boards together with the dice nowadays.&#10;&#10;The name, Hoo Hey How, is derived from the Hokkien names of three of the things that usually appear on the dice = a fish (Hoo), a prawn (Hey) and a king crab (How). However, modern dice tend to show ordinary crabs.&#10;&#10;Dobree, in the 1950s, described the objects commonly depicted on the dice: a fish, a prawn, a king crab, a flower, a butterfly, a beautiful lady. But he also noted that other pictures could also appear: a cat, a mouse, a cock, a centipede, a tiger, an elephant, a gourd, three coins (Chinese cash).&#10;&#10;Today, the dice tend to show more standard pictures and the selection of pictures is standardized for the region where they originate too. For example, the dice in Malaysia and Singapore (and I assume Hong Kong, where many of them are made) depict a fish, a prawn, a crab, a Chinese coin, a gourd and a cockerel. Thai Hoo Hey How dice (called Nam Tou Bu Bak [please excuse my bad transliteration]) have a tiger instead of a coin, as do dice from the Malaysian state of Sabah, but the Sabah dice show the head of the tiger rather than the whole animal. In Vietnam, they are called Bau Cua Tom Ca and often played at the new year: the distinguishing feature is a stag instead of a coin. Another feature is that the dice may be made of cardboard.&#10;&#10;Many variants are possible, some that do not even feature the Hoo, Hey or How, so I don't know what they would be called. From Penang in Malaysia, I have dice that feature an elephant, a rabbit, a butterfly, a snake, a centipede and a flower. In Singapore, some older dice I have feature mahjong dragons together with symbols of political parties from the 1950s.&#10;&#10;To play, one player takes the role of banker and the others are punters. Players stake money on the betting board and the dice are cast (either under cover or into a porcelain bowl). Punters are paid an equivalent amount that they staked, the number of times their picture appears on the dice (e.g. if someone bet on the fish and it appears twice, the punter gets back twice their stake).&#10;&#10;This game is similar to The Game of Crown and Anchor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zhuang Yuan Chou (Chong Yuen Chow in Cantonese) is a gambling game using dice and tallies, first mentioned in Chinese texts in the late 18th century, but still played today.&#10;&#10;'Zhuang Yuan' is the title given to the scholar who achieved the highest distinction in the imperial examinations that determined entry into the Chinese bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;The game consists of six dice and sixty-three tallies bearing titles of ranks of achievement in the examinations and the number of points they are worth. There is only one each of the top 3 positions, of which the highest value (32 points) and the largest tally is the Zhuan Yuan. &#10;The lower the position, the thinner/shorter the tallies and the fewer points each is worth. At the lowest rank, Xiu Cai, there are 32 tallies worth 1 point each. As with many Chinese dice games, a porcelain bowl is often used to hold and roll the dice.&#10;&#10;To play, punters agree on a value per point (Dobree mentions 1 cent, 10 cents or 50 cents). Each player takes turns rolling all six dice. According to the roll, the player is allowed to claim tallies of equivalent worth from the center of the table where they are initially placed. Certain rolls allow one to claim tallies from other players if those tallies were previously claimed. The game is played until all tallies have been claimed.&#10;&#10;The best roll is six of a kind, allowing the player to claim all the tallies, whether they are in the pool or with other players. Five of a kind allows the player to claim the Zhuan Yuan tally wherever it is. Red fours (on Chinese dice, the one and four spots are red) are also good to roll - four of them will also get you the Zhuan Yuan tally. Dobree and Culin have both described the game including the values of the rolls.&#10;&#10;In the past, tallies were made of bone and hand-engraved. Modern sets have brightly colored plastic tallies and can be found for sale in Mahjong shops in Singapore (and likely elsewhere).&#10;&#10;",

The player spins on a wheel with letters and the letter that the spinner stops on should be the initial letter of the word you are competing for. When you come up with a word you say it aloud and throw a small ball into the box. If there are more players who says a word at the same time, it is the ball that comes at the bottom that wins. For each win you have to mark the box and the one that first succeeds in marking 10 squares or most if all 25 squares are marked wins.&#10;&#10;The name of the game translates into English as 'The ship is loaded'.&#10;&#10;",

On each side there is a 3 x 4 &quot;Safety Zone&quot; which serves as the starting area for each player.

Once they enter the arena, they can move diagonally in any direction but may not leave the arena.&#10;A player may create a &quot;prince&quot; by landing on an opponent's pawn with one of his pawns.  The stack of two pieces can then move either 1 or 2 spaces, still diagonally, but may move forwards or backwards.  It may not enter any safety zone (it must remain in the arena).&#10;A player creates a king when his prince takes a pawn or his pawn takes a prince (princes may not take each other).  A king is a stack of three pieces.  Once formed kings are removed to the scoring area.&#10;The game ends when there is no possibility of additional kings being made.  The winner is the player who has the most kings.&#10;Note that while the game says it will play 2-4 there are no rules offered for any number other than 4.&#10;&#10;",

They are historically based, in that they recreate the military capacities of a given era in the history of warfare, but they are abstract. They do not restrict the player to the circumstances of a given campaign, or to the capacities of actual units, or to the style of an actual leader. Both players are equipped with units whose capacities are equivalent to those of the era in which the game is set. But their forces and situations are abstract and equal, and each player must win or lose according to his own skill and judgment, without the influence of luck or of pre-existing historical conditions. There are no dice or chance outcomes.&#10;&#10;Chris's Comments&#10;The game is played on a map divided into equal squares using units to represent Infantry, artillery and Cavalry.  To make the game balanced the map is also symmetric about the line dividing the two sides.  The game is won by either eliminating all field units, or by blocking the roads leading from the opponents city or occupying the opponent city.&#10;&#10;",

The two children rule is that all tiles are shuffled and put into the middle of the table picture side down. On the first turn a child draws a tile and sees if its his color. If it is he can place it picture side up on his side of the table. If it is not it must be put back into the middle. On subsequent turns the child draws a tile and this must be his color and match the tile/s already placed. If not the tile is put back. A child can choose any tile in the middle including the tile just discarded by the other player. The first one having his twelve farm tiles in a matching row wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Starting Lineup Talking Baseball, one or two players take on the role(s) of Major League Baseball managers.  Each player tries to out manage his opponent using teams made of up of actual MLB players.&#10;&#10;On defense, the manager can choose the pitch type and location.  He can also choose to intentionally walk a player or to bring his infielders in to increase the chances of getting a runner out at home.&#10;&#10;On offense, the manager must choose the type of swing (bunt vs. power, for example).  He can also increase the chances for a hit if he can guess the location of the pitch.  The manager may also choose when to attempt a stolen base.&#10;&#10;Both managers may, of course, make substitutions.&#10;&#10;The game came with All-Star Teams comprised of American League and National League players.  Additional cartridges that contained all 26 MLB teams (as of 1988) were available so that you could play a game between any two teams.&#10;&#10;",

It was published by a cookie factory for marketing purposes.&#10;&#10;The background of the board is an illustration of Dutch troops attacking a revolting native town in the Dutch East Indies colony (probably in Atjeh). There are 90 numbered dots (white and red) on the board, the rules are printed in the lower left and lower right corners.&#10;&#10;The game is is played like Game of Goose, with 2 dice and pawns. Each player rolls two dice to decide who goes first(highest roll starts). The rest of the players take their turn clockwise. Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves his pawn according to his roll.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game every player pays ten chips to the bank. Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots. These events may be positive or negative for the player. For instance: roll again, get wounded (and move backwards to the hospital) or get killed (and have to start all over again). In most of these cases the player also pays chips to or receives chips from the bank.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to reach nr. 90; the dot at the heart of the native town. This player is honored with the Ridder Kruis (Knight's Cross) and receives all chips in the bank.&#10;&#10;",

You throw one heck of a party and you invite all who want to come and join in. And when they leave, you give them a thank-you present.&#10;&#10;On the 10th of September 2005, the Deutsche Spielemuseum (the German Game Museum and brainchild of Peter Lemcke) celebrated in style in its current hometown of Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony, by attempting to break a world record in conjunction with that other birthday kid, the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot;. A more than 300 meter long game table was erected, offering room for 1000 Settler players, who all could participate on one gigantic Settlers map, using 17,500 Settlers' hexagons in the process. As it happened, 816 participants sat down to invade the ribbon island and the record stood.&#10;&#10;To mark the occasion, a commemorative Settler expansion, themed on the German state of Saxony, was issued by Kosmos, in a limited edition of 1000, one for each participant. Klaus Teuber was on hand to sign his life away.&#10;&#10;Saggsen Gadan presented two new scenarios for Settlers, both requiring game pieces from the basic set to play. Special game pieces needed for these Saxony scenarios were also included, ready to cut out. Instead of the usual variable game-set-up of the basic game, the two scenarios both use a ready-made map. There is one scenario map printed on each side of the expansion sheet, in the same vein as the game boards from boxed historical theme set expansions.&#10;&#10;1. Saggsen-Gadan:&#10;For this game variant, players must colonize Saggsen using the usual building and resource trading mechanisms. Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points. But be warned: Saggsen is sliced up by many rivers, that can only be crossed at bridges. To become King of Saggsen you will have to make your influence count in the seven regions of the state. Who is the first to obtain 10 victory points?&#10;&#10;2. Catan-Offensive in Chemnitz - a quick scenario for 2-3 players:&#10;By utilizing the resources obtained through building and trading, players aim to populate the city of Chemnitz bit by bit. As the game progresses, players can obtain colorful postcards of historical buildings, museums and leisure facilities. These postcards can then be exchanged for victory points. Karl Marx, after whom the city was known in its East German days when it was called Karl-Marx-Stadt, now takes over the role of Joker/Robber.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    CATAN&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Greeks &amp; Eastern Kingdoms is the first expansion to Commands & Colors: Ancients. The armies of Philip, Alexander and the Successors meet the hosts of Persians, Scythians and Indians to the east. In this expansion, you will find historical scenarios that focus on the hoplites of classical Greece fighting off the invading Persian army at Marathon and Plataea; epic battles from the Peloponnesian War, the rise of Macedon and Alexander's battles of Gaugamela, Issus and Granicus against the Persians; and battles involving Alexander's successors. With your Greeks you will be able to turn west and battle the Carthaginians in Sicily, or as King Pyrrhus at Heraclea and Ausculum, battle the Romans.&#10;&#10;This first expansion showcases over 20 scenarios (the package includes over 300 new unit blocks and stickers you need to fight out these battles). Now, that is a lot of history, but Commands & Colors: Ancients is, by design, a unique historical game system that will allow players to effectively portray stylized Ancient battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There is also a central square. The moves of the six figures (five &quot;pawns&quot; and one &quot;king&quot;) of the two players are determined by throwing marked sticks, probably not by only counting some marks but also interpreting and calculating the throw according to some rules derived from the Yijing.&#10;&#10;Winner is the one who captures all of his opponent's stones.&#10;&#10;",

Once a player has a certificate, he draws and keeps (or discards) Loading cards until he has the exact amount of cargo required.&#10;&#10;Once fully loaded, a player enters the second phase of the game -- sailing. A player under sail chooses a sail state (full, 3/4, 1/2, storm), then draws a card and checks the resulting combination on their sailing wheel. There is a Total Loss card which, if followed by a second draw indicating bad weather or other calamity, can damage the player's ship or force him out of the game entirely.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive safely in London is the winner.&#10;&#10;No copyright date is given, but a London game collector asserts the vintage for this game to be of the early 1930s. The subject matter is consistent with this estimate, in light of the Great Grain Race of 1932, and the box style (i.e., small label fixed to larger cover) fits that of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;",

Six cardboard &quot;elves&quot; are provided, but the inventor add that it may also be played by more than six people by adding &quot;shirt buttons or pennies&quot; for the other players to move with.&#10;&#10;Finally, the game contains an optional 1-hour tape of Irish music and dance, recorded live during a summer ethnic festival in Baltimore.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gala, also knows as &quot;farmer's chess&quot; or &quot;pagan chess&quot; was a game played in some farmers villages in northern Germany. The game probably comes from the middle ages. It has been mentioned in the game books by R. C. Bell, Jack Botermans / Pieter van Delft and Glonnegger.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of ten by ten squares. The four corners of four by four squares are distinguished by a line, thus shaping a cross two lines wide, consisting of the  rows 5 and 6 and/or the columns e and f. These lines are called deflection lines.&#10;Each player has eight Kampas (pawns), five Horsas and Kornas and two Galas (kings), placed like this:&#10;White:&#10;Gala a1, j1; Korna a3, b2, c1, i1, j2; Horsa a2, b1, h1, i2, j3; Kampa a4, b3, c2, d1, g1, h2, i3, j4. &#10;Black:&#10;Gala a10, j10; Korna a9, b10, h10, i9, j8; Horsa a8, b9, c10, i10, j9; Kampa a7, b8, c9, d10, g10, h9, i8, j7.&#10;&#10;Galas move in general as kings in chess. Additionally, when a Gala is on one of the four squares in the middle of the board, it may be moved in one move to any empty square on the board with the exception of those squares that contain a piece in the opening setup. Kings can only take when moving over a deflection line. &#10;A Korna moves as a rook in chess when in a corner of the board, and as a bishop in the middle of the board. It is also possible to combine these moves in one turn! Kornas can only take in moves where they move over a deflection line. &#10;Horsas are just the opposite of Kornas (with an additional small difference in the taking rules): they move as bishops on the corner parts, and as rooks on the middle part. Again it is possible to combine such moves. Horsas only take in moves where they pass the deflection line, but not when they move only one square in rookwise fashion.&#10;Kampas move diagonally towards the middle of the board until they are in the middle part or in the opponents corners. It is allowed to move two squares if the deflection line isn't passed with the first move of the Kampa. When the Kampa is in the middle part or in one of the opponents corners, then it may move one square in any direction. When a Kampa is moved back to a corner of the owning player, it can only move diagonally forward again. Kampas only can take in the move after they have crossed a deflection line.&#10;&#10;When a player threatens a king of the opponent, he says: Gala! The opponent must defend the king, if possible. Otherwise, the player takes the king of the opponent. One wins the game by taking both kings of the opponent. &#10;When only two kings of different players are left on the board, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;There are different variants discussed in the internet concerning the moves and the winning (defining another goal in placing the Galas in the 4 squares in the very middle of the board).&#10;&#10;",
