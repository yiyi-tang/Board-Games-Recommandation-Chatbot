    "Description": "In the second century of the Christian era, the Empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilised portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period (A.D. 98-180) of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the design of this...to describe the prosperous condition of their empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth.&#10;&#10;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&#10;&#10;Edward Gibbon, 1776&#10;&#10;Empire of Rome is a game depicting the internal politics and wars of Imperial Rome from 27 BC to 284 AD. Players control factions, each one controlling senators, consuls, proconsuls, provinces, legions, fleets, courtiers and trade concessions. One faction controls the Caesar, who can reward and punish, wage war and make peace and takes the cream of Rome&rsquo;s wealth. Every hand is raised against him and to claim victory he must survive assassinations, rebellions and the attentions of the Praetorian Guard. Foreign wars interfere with internal politics, the expansion of the empire leads to great glory and renown, but Germanic tribes and Parthian kings may invade at any time and the generals sent to repel them may march on Rome to claim the imperial purple. If the players place the good of the Rome before their own ambitions it may expand beyond its historical limits, if not they could precipitate its premature decline and fall.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As summer came on the heel of spring, a new regime was bound to replace the old one, whenever the right time arrived. Before an old regime was replaced, there were unmistakable signs indicating its coming end, such as flood, drought, famine, and epidemics, the same as twilight signified the rising sun and falling leaves marked the coming of winter. When natural calamities repeatedly occurred, it was clear that the old regime had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Then the reigning monarch, facing the inevitable, should elect the wisest and most virtuous man to replace him, so as to make the change of dynasties a peaceful transformation. Failure to do so would provoke revolt which, in this case, was clearly justified. In the end the old regime would be overthrown and replaced by a new dynasty, which in turn had to pass through the same process.&#10;&#10;Dun J. Li, the Ageless Chinese&#10;&#10;Mandate of Heaven is a game for four players, which should take 4-8 hours to play. It depicts the political and military history of China from the Han Dynasty to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Each player controls eight empires which earn victory points by holding the Mandate of Heaven, controlling the Forbidden City, occupying areas, building spheres of influence and destroying enemy armies. Each empire has counters representing its leaders, armies, artillery and spheres of influence. Empires add counters through invasions and the natural increase of population, move them on the map and resolve combat using dice. At the end of the game the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The story of the Second Civil War is short and simple. King, Lords and Commons, landlords and merchants, the City and the countryside, bishops and presbyters, the Scottish army, the Welsh people, and the English Fleet, all now turned against the New Model Army. The Army beat the lot.&quot; Sir Winston Churchill&#10;&#10;The New Model Army was created by Parliament in 1645 to defeat the armies of King Charles I in the 1st Civil War. As Lord-General they chose Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had little interest in politics, but his second-in-command was Oliver Cromwell, already a leading member of the Independent Party in Parliament. As a military machine the New Model did all that was desired of it. They beat the Royalists at the Battles of Naseby and Langport, besieged his capital of Oxford and in 1646 Charles surrendered. Parliament needed to reach an accommodation with the King for a Settlement of the Kingdom, but he refused to yield any of his Royal Prerogatives. Secretly, he negotiated with Irish Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians and English Radicals, anyone who could return him to power.&#10;&#10;Man of Blood is an area movement and impulse game for two to four players recreating the Second English Civil War of 1648. The first player controls the New Model Army; the second the Parliamentarian Northern Association, Irish Army, Scottish Whigs, some lukewarm militia and a mutinous fleet; the third has a loose alliance of Cavaliers, Presbyterians, Welsh, and any ships that desert the Parliamentarians, and the fourth the Scots Engagers and Ulster Army. Players manoeuvre their forces from area to area across the map in order to destroy enemy regiments, capture towns, build up a navy and control the King. It has a 34 by 22 inch map depicting 17th Century Britain from the English Channel to the Highlands and 280 half-inch counters representing the generals, admirals, regiments and warships that fought the war.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This board game is designed to be used by the student after class discussions of the Video Production Process. Up to four students can play the game between classes as a fun way to learn the steps in the video production process as well as see examples of unexpected events that may occur during the process.&#10;The board is divided into three parts - Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production - to mirror the actual process as closely as possible.&#10;&#10;Rules The goal of Action! is to finish the game with the most money left. The decisions the players have to make and the event cards they have to draw during the game will affect their budget.&#10;&#10;1. Each player receives a game piece and a Decisions-sheet. The various card stacks (Script and Event cards) are put face-down on the corresponding fields on the game board.&#10;&#10;2. To determine which player goes first, each player rolls the die. The player with the highest number goes first.&#10;&#10;3. The first player becomes bank manager.&#10;&#10;4. The first player also rolls the die to determine the scenario (see section Scenarios). The scenario describes the type of video that the players will be &quot;producing&quot; during the game.&#10;&#10;5. Each player rolls the die to determine his/her budget (see section Budget) and receives the corresponding amount of money from the bank.&#10;&#10;6. Based on the scenario and the rates on the Decisions-sheet (page 1), each player hires staff and rents equipment.&#10;&#10;The players mark their choices on their Decision-sheets and pay the total fees to the bank.&#10;&#10;7. The players put their game pieces on the &quot;Start&quot; field. The player who goes first rolls the die and advances the corresponding number of spaces in the direction of the arrows. The player performs the Action! specified on the space to which s/he moved:&#10;&#10;&#10;     On &quot;Draw a card&quot; spaces (indicated by ), the player draws a card from the corresponding pile and performs the Action! specified on the card. The player puts the card back in its pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     On passing a &quot;Make a decision&quot; space (indicated by ), the player marks his/her choice on the Decisions-sheet (page 2).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     On &quot;Draw a card and mark the outcome on the Decisions-sheet&quot; spaces (indicated by ), the player draws a card and marks the outcome on his/her Decisions-sheet (page 2).&#10;&#10;&#10;8. The next player is the player to the first player's left.&#10;&#10;9. If a player runs out of money during the game, s/he receives a loan of $ 10,000 from the bank. However, that player loses a day for negotiations with the bank manager (thus receives a &quot;Lose a day&quot; card from the bank which, at the end of the game, will cost the player $ 5,000). If, at the end of the game, the player is able to pay the full amount of the loan back (i.e. by selling the Oscar to the bank), s/he wins a day.&#10;&#10;10. The game is over when the first player reaches the space &quot;The Oscar.&quot;&#10;&#10;The player in second place receives one &quot;Lose a day&quot; card, the player in third place receives two &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards, and the player in fourth place receives three &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;11. The Oscar is awarded to the player who spent the most money on staff/equipment. The Oscar is worth $ 10,000. If more than one player spent the most on staff/equipment, the Oscar prize money is split equally.&#10;&#10;12. At the end of the game, each player counts his/her remaining money. Each player also calculates his/her &quot;Lose a day&quot;&#10;&#10;(- $ 5,000) and &quot;Win a day&quot; (+ $ 5,000) cards.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money left wins the game. If all players end the game without any money left, the player closest to his/her budget wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The player must circle the Analyze phase until they are able to collect a token. After collecting a token, they may move on to the next phase.&#10;&#10;* Play stops only when a question has been answered incorrectly or the player's token lands upon a STOP space.&#10;&#10;* Play continues until one player manages to collect all five tokens.&#10;&#10;",

The project can only be implemented if all participants on a number of key decisions agreed.&#10;&#10;The PPP Project&#10;&#10;As a result of global warming, the oceans are warmer.

This leads to big problems for certain small low-lying islands, especially in the Pacific, which are often wholly or partially independent. Meanwhile some small islands have already completely disappeared under the sea. Currently we are considering for general evacuation of the population (10000 persons) of such an island to Western Australia. But of course you can also take measures to reduce the impact of rising sea levels to overcome. The package of measures forms the backdrop of the PPP game.&#10;&#10;Players&#10;&#10;The players representing the various stakeholders: the island government, developers, financiers, tourism and the bourgeoisie.

A quick game could be played up to 100 points. A greater point total would be set for a more in-depth game experience.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;1. Each player must roll one die. Whoever gets the highest roll selects a playing piece and places it on a Mission Card Spot. The player with the next highest roll chooses next. This continues until everyone has placed their piece. Note: Players do not get to draw a Mission Card at this time.&#10;&#10;2. The player who placed their piece last gets to play first. This follows until the player who placed their piece goes last.&#10;&#10;3. The players roll two dice. When the game begins the players must decide which way they will be travelling. On following turns they must continue the direction they were travelling on the previous round. The players may choose to stop moving at any time during their turn. For example, if a player rolls five on the dice, but only need three to get to a Question Spot, they may cease movement on the Spot.&#10;&#10;4. The direction of movement cannot be changed until one of the following has occurred: the player lands on a Question Spot; the player lands on a Mission Card Spot; or the player has a Mission Card that allows reversal of motion.&#10;&#10;5. Players must land on question spots to be asked questions. The answers will be presented in a multiple-choice format. When a question is answered correctly, the player recieves the number of points printed on the card. The person who moved previously acts as the questioner. If this happens on the first turn, the player who goes last asks the question. The questioner draws a Question Card corresponding to the map grid and the color landed on by the player. There are three levels of difficulty for answering questions.&#10;&#10;Level One: Beginning learners would play for the full point total and would have the multiple choice answers read to them.&#10;&#10;Level Two: Intermediate play would have the most options; the learner can answer the question for full points by not having the multiple choice answers read to them and for half points if they need to have their answer options read to them.&#10;&#10;Level Three: Advanced learners would play for the full point total without having the multiple choice answers read to them.&#10;&#10;6. If the player does not answer the question correctly, the remaining players may attempt to jump in and steal the question. If they answer correctly, they gain half the points that the original player would have recieved. If they answer incorrectly, they lose half of the points the original player would have recieved. All other remaining players may attempt this with the exception of the Questioner.&#10;&#10;7. After successfully answering a question, the player must move to another map grid before stopping at another Question Spot. This does not apply to players who jumped in on someone else's question.&#10;&#10;8. When the players land on a Mission Card spot, they get to draw one Mission card. Some Mission Cards may be saved for later and others must be played immediately. The card should state when it comes into effect.&#10;&#10;9. The game concludes at a predetermined win scenario. The game can be played towards a point limit. For example, the first player with 100 points could be the winner. Alternately, the game can be played to a time limit. PLay could be set to end in 30 minutes and whoever has the most points would be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each player selects a country and places his piece at the Berlin Conference. One player will be the score keeper, filling out the score sheet.&#10;&#10;2. Players spin to determine the first player. The highest spin goes first. If the spinner lands on chance, the player spins again.&#10;&#10;3. Players spin to determine how many spaces to advance. Each hexagon represents one space and only one player may occupy a space at a time with the exception of the entry points.&#10;&#10;4. If the spinner lands on chance, the player will draw a chance card, read it out loud and follow the directions, adding or subtracting points on the score sheet.&#10;&#10;5. In order to enter a territory, a player must land on the entry point by exact roll. He will then select the dilemma card for that territory. He must read the card aloud and select a choice. He then must check the corresponding number on the Dilemma Answer Sheet. If successful, then the territory is colonized. The player then places the appropriate country's flag on that territory and adds the appropriate number of points to their score. If unsuccessful, the player, with his piece still on the entry point, loses one turn but may attempt to colonize the territory on his next turn. During this time, other players may attempt to colonize this territory.&#10;&#10;6. Once a territory is colonized, a player must return to the sea before entering another territory.&#10;&#10;7. Play continues until all territories are colonized or the instructor ends play.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest&#10;roll goes first and then play proceeds clockwise.&#10;Starting The Game&#10;To start just roll the die and move your game piece clockwise that many&#10;spaces. Draw the card that corresponds to the color space you landed&#10;on. Follow instructions on the card. If you run out of cards for a color&#10;that space becomes a &ldquo;roll-again&rdquo; space.&#10;Winning and Ending the Game&#10;The game ends when a player lands on the finish space.

Place one chip on any circle with a black circle in the middle, this is your initial infection. The player who was last sick goes first (their parasite is closer to the surface). Play will continue clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;A turn consists of two phases:&#10;1) Growth&#10;Some circles have a set of numbers in them. The first number is the amount of parasite chips that grow every turn. If you have at least one chip in the circle, you will add this number of chips to the circle. If you do not have enough chips of your color, you may choose where to grow. The maximum number of chips a single player may have on the board is 50. The second number is the maximum amount of parasites this circle can support. If you begin the turn beneath the maximum, you may grow to the maximum number. If you begin the turn above the maximum, your parasites are strangled and you LOSE the amount of chips you would have gained (down to the maximum, but not below). &#10;Examples:&#10;&#10;     Parasite Influidia has 3 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Influidia gains 3 chips to be at 6.&#10;     Parasite Betonium has 16 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Betonium loses 2 chips to be at 14.&#10;     Parasite Steve has 14 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Steve gains 1 chip up to the circle maximum of 15.&#10;     Parasite Rogainium has 11 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Rogainium loses 1 chip down to the circle maximum of 10.&#10;&#10;&#10;2) Movement&#10;Once all your parasites have grown, you may move them. Parasites may move across one black line connecting two circles. Parasites may only move one circle per turn. All parasites must move in stacks of a maximum of 5. You may split your parasites into smaller stacks at any time. The unnumbered circles may only have one stack inside at a time (so a maximum of a 5). Any parasites inside of an  unnumbered circle MUST MOVE this turn or lose one chip. Any parasite moving into a circle occupied by another player begins combat. Combat When one player's parasites moves onto another player's  parasites, they fight. Each attacking parasite kills one defending parasite by sacrificing itself. If the attacking player has more parasites, the remainder now occupy the circle. If the defending player has more parasites, any that are left remain on the circle. If both players have the same number of parasites, all are destroyed and the circle is left empty.&#10;&#10;Elimination / Winning&#10;If at any time a player has no more parasites on the board, they are eliminated. The game is over when one player controls all green-colored circles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Polish May Coup d'&Eacute;tat on May 12-15, 1926 (Polish: &quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; or &quot;zamach majowy&quot;) is one of the least known events of the 20th century. Even so, its outcome was very important for the whole world, as it settled the overall course of Poland until 1939, including opposition both to the Third Reich, as well as USRR.&#10;&#10;What started as an officers' demonstration led by First Marshall J&oacute;zef Pi&#197;&#130;sudski against the unpopular center-right government rapidly expanded into an unsuccesful coup d'&eacute;tat and ended as a short, albeit intensive quasi-revolutionary civil war. It put Poland at the brink of revolution and annihilation.&#10;&#10;It is a rare example of an unsuccessful coup followed by a successful civil war.&#10;&#10;&quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; had a very special climate. At the beginning it was partly a traditional &quot;szlachta&quot; foray (polish: &quot;zajazd&quot;), partly a political demonstration, with all of the 18th century &quot;honorable war&quot; traditions (including dueling officers and shooting above opponents' heads).&#10;&#10;Unfortunately in a few days it fall into an abyss of bloody total civil war, with mass use in the center of Warsaw of tanks, armored trains, heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; with general strike, assassinating, sniping, and execution of prisoners as well as masses of civilian combatants, on both sides. It was really close to use of gas warfare.&#10;&#10;The game &quot;Maj 1926&quot; (name may change) depicts those days in an innovative way: a card-driven euro-wargame.&#10;&#10;Occupying areas in Warsaw (like the Citadel, telephone center, Prime Minister chancellery, Ministry of Railroad, Ministry of Defense, hospitals, supply depots; also railroad, power, gas and water stations) brings advantages (bonuses to combat, movement, logistics, politics, and many more, including variable phase order). Usually it is necessary to leave a unit to fully exploit such areas (a kind of worker placement).&#10;&#10;Oddities of this conflict (such as a lack of fog of war, fluent dynamics of aggression, a big influence of politics over the course of battle) as well as all &quot;what-if&quot;s (like foreign intervention) are well represented in the mechanisms.&#10;&#10;If you want to make successful coup in Poland (or defend the legal government) and you know the Polish language, it is a game for you.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately the author doesn't anticipate an international version (other than translating the manual and all cards into a BGG file), as &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; is a kind of event understandable only by Poles.&#10;&#10;Polish site about this game:&#10;http://www.strategie.net.pl/viewforum.php?f=161&amp;sid=0239f37ae2c3e623e339d6505c118971&#10;&#10;Photos about this game:&#10;http://umpapa.multiply.com/photos/album/26#&#10;&#10;The game was to be published in 2011, on the 85th anniversary of &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot;. However due to delayment in playtestying, game will published later. Please be patient, as we want this game to be perfect.&#10;&#10;",

The game is designed for easy set up with a playing time of about thirty minutes.  Information regarding the world&rsquo;s treasures will pique the interest of all playing. The game is straight forward in play with each participant trying to acquire as many treasures as they can as quickly as possible.  Wealth is accumulated by seizing treasure tokens, retaining situation cards of value, and collecting treasure notes.  For those who enjoy a quick search of facts, an informative twenty-page booklet listing historical finds of treasure has been provided.&#10;&#10;Treasure Trove was created to provide an opportunity for parents and grandparents to sit down together with older children and enjoy a board game that is not too time consuming.  The game was designed to invite the interest of all ages targeting 7-12 year old.  The theme of treasure was chosen because it fascinates people of all ages.  The game has unique colorful player tokens, and the multiple treasures allow each player to collect their share in the process of playing the game.  An element of strategy is evident, but there is enough chance and luck to prevent that from dominating the game.  The beginning player has just as much chance of winning as one who has played often.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be colorful and imaginative. Any quest for treasure entails adventure.  Illustrations of strange animals, castles, lost cities, sunken ships, and temples add to the experience of traveling the world in search of treasure.&#10;&#10;There are 72 situation cards that keep the game entertaining. Historical facts, tales of wealth and hidden truths about treasure are revealed in the cards.  Some contain as much value as the treasure pieces, while others cause the loss of a turn or opportunity to move to another location on the board, adding to the element of chance.  Some of the cards are witty to keep the game light-hearted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "64-32 Ranch Roundup is an abstract strategy game system that may or may not employ cards for luck, depending on which of the provided rules are used.  The board consists of a central round-up area and four corner corral areas; all the game pieces begin in the round-up area and it is the goal of each player to move their colored pieces to their own corral area.  Pieces and spaces are numbered, and this can be employed in different ways, again depending on the variation being played, and paper money is included for scoring.  Other games from Wales Game Systems were subsequently given a &quot;64-32 Ranch&quot; western theme, undoubtedly to maximize sales in an era when Westerns were extremely popular.  The game's designer states in the patent files for these games that they are abstract and that any theme could be applied to them.&#10;&#10;",

Instead, players are encouraged to dredge up more interesting factoids about themselves. When everyone's done, these facts get tossed together and read aloud. The player who drew the topic card tries to match each fact to the correct person. Before the facts are read, players can wager on whether or not they think the guesser will match them up correctly. On a correct match, the guesser rakes the wager over to his side. On a wrong match, the guesser has to fork over a like sum.&#10;&#10;",
