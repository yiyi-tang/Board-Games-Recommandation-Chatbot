Climb up buildings and run between rooftops, leap down to ambush enemies from above, hire war machines and epic heroes from the Kings of War armies, and build your warband&rsquo;s reputation as the fiercest and toughest fighters in all of Mantica.&#10;&#10;The rules are based heavily on Kings of War, so players of the full-size wargame should feel right at home. It&rsquo;s heavily inspired by other skirmish games such as Mordheim, but with the ease-of-play the Kings of War rules provide so gameplay is quick and decisive.&#10;&#10;As the surviving veterans of The Star-Struck City have said: Perditus now only offers riches or death.

Every other person around the table is on the same team and the rotation moves counter-clockwise. The deck stays at the center of the table and whoever has their turn draws from the deck. The aim is to get your teammates to guess the word on the card before the timer runs out. However, you cannot say the word that is on the card. In addition, there are other rules, like no rhyming or pointing, that you can find in the full instructions on the website. Finally, once your team guesses the word, the play moves to the other team immediately. The first team to guess 21 cards correctly wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the year 2065, people had grown bored of watching regular football. The athletes had devolved into overpaid, drug-addicted illiterates. Desperate to find a new impact sport for the masses, the TV networks sanctioned a think-tank of programmers, machinists, engineers, military experts, and game theorists. &#10;Within two years, the game of Cyberball had been born.  &#10;     &#10;The whiny, mentally stunted athletes of football had been replaced by 18 feet tall gleaming robots, adorned with spikes and sponsor adverts. These robo-athletes did not complain, ask for more money, do drugs, or get arrested.....they just rocked! And rock they did. In little time, the Cyberball League far eclipsed the popularity of all other sports combined. The crunch of metal on any given Sunday combined with spectacular explosions garnered fans from every walk of life. Soon, the Cyberball League included dozens of teams from all over the world. The corporations pumped millions of credits into this monster they had created and reaped huge rewards.&#10;&#10;Now the year is 2072, and Cyberball is the most anticipated sport on the planet. All teams compete for the Cyberbowl at season's end, where the two top teams slug it out for the coveted 'Assassin's Cup'. As a Cyberball coach, it is your job to secure the best sponsors and coach your team to the promise land. The season can be grueling for a rookie coach. Use earned credits to your advantage and field the best players, while destroying other team's star players. Embrace the thrill of giant metal machines mauling each other. Become a Cyberball coaching legend!&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            &#10;

                       &#10;                    &#10;                &#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The futuristic and brutal world of Cyberball comes to life with this miniatures game. Choose a sponsor, upgrade your players, and prepare for gridiron mayhem.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to outscore and brutalize the other team to receive monetary bonuses from the league and sponsors. Football fans will find themselves right at home with this 2 player game. To win games, you must score touchdowns. Once in possession of the ball, the offense has six plays to diffuse the ball by either passing midfield or getting in the endzone. The ball gradually heats up: cool - lukewarm - warm - hot - sizzling - critical. If a critical ball is not diffused, it will explode at the conclusion on the play. If a robo-athlete is holding the ball, they will be obliterated. The game is 7 on 7 robot football with a colorful cast of characters. Here are brief descriptions of the deadly participants:&#10;&#10;QB - The offensive captain is the linchpin of any good team. Unlike other robo-athletes, the Quarterback has legs which allow for quick lateral movement, but not flat out speed. The QB's weakness is its dreadful lack of armor.&#10;&#10;RB - An outstanding combination of speed and armor. The Runningback is often the workhorse of the offense. Many coaches find that an upgraded RB becomes a scoring machine.&#10;&#10;PB - A new addition to Cyberball, the Powerback is gaining popularity across the league. Being able to run or pass the ball, make the PB an unpredictable asset.&#10;&#10;WR - Perhaps the greatest offensive threat on the gridiron, the Wide Receiver is a true speed demon. Although lightly armored, a WR speeding down the field with the ball is rarely caught.&#10;&#10;TE - Tight Ends are cheap to produce and make good supplemental blockers on the line of scrimmage. Some coaches are able to use TEs to good effect in a short passing game.&#10;&#10;LM - Lineman are the bullies of the gridiron. Their main responsibilities are to block along the offensive line and make tackles along the defensive line. On tracks, they are slow but very maneuverable.&#10;&#10;CB - The fastest player on the defense is the Cornerback. They are primarily charged with covering the elusive WRs and making an occasional blitz. What they lack in armor, they make up for with speed.&#10;&#10;SF - Safeties are equally good at stopping the run or covering the pass. With respectable armor and above average speed, a good SF can be counted on to stop the offense dead in their tracks.&#10;&#10;LB - The intimidator of the gridiron, Linebackers have very think armor and decent speed. Although able to cover short passes, these monsters are better at dominating the line of scrimmage and dismantling opposing QBs.&#10;&#10;Teams in the Cyberball league utilize sponsors to supplement their income. It is a symbiotic relationship. Teams make thousands of credits each season for slapping sponsor decals onto their robo-athletes. Sponsors get valueable exposure on national TV. Deals are struck between each game and it is not uncommon to see a team switch sponsors frequently. Each coach selects one sponsor before the game.&#10;&#10;This can be played as a stand-alone game as well as in season mode. In season mode, players can save up their money to buy bigger and better bots.&#10;&#10;",

The classes include the wizard,, who moves like a knight from chess and can pass over other pieces or walls; the warrior, who moves parallel with the edges and can move two spaces; the rogue, who moves diagonally and may leave or re-enter the game; and the princess who may choose how she moves.&#10;The monsters are kobolds and goblins. Kobolds move parallel to the edges of the board. Goblins move diagonally. The monster player gets a piece for each player, and may move each piece 1 time per turn. Monsters controlled by another player can hunt players for points. Each player is worth 5 points to the monster player.&#10;Players control peices that navigate an 8&quot;x8&quot; board using dice to determine if a space is a trap, a wall, or a hall. Sometimes player obtain treasure or gold. Gold is used to determine points at the end of the game. Treasure is represented by cards drawn from the treasure deck. Players determine the effect a treasure has when it is used. This causes the treasures to change each game. The game concludes after all players have exited or have been captured. The surviving player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The ASLOK XXXII pack builds on the success of the ASL Oktoberfest XXX pack, and highlights the design and playtesting talents of Ohio&rsquo;s finest. Guided by veteran playtesters and tournament directors Bret Hildebran and Bill Hayward, the expert scenario designers Bill Sisler and Pete Shelling bring us eleven scenarios ranging from 1939 Poland to 1945 Hungary, with stops in Ukraine, Russia, New Guinea, Burma, Italy, France, and Belgium along the way. Place names like Vistula, Balta, Luga, Bougainville, Myitkyina, Elba, Caen, Falaise, and Bastogne will all ring a bell. These scenarios will stretch your tactical knowledge and skills, with many different situations (although no night actions&mdash;so sad). Some are infantry only, one is armor only (almost), but most feature combined arms. Assault engineers with all their toys are featured, and the King of Battle makes its appearance in the form of offboard artillery in several scenarios. Along with the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; Russian, German, and American battles, these scenarios also involve Poles (both 1939 and 1944 versions), British, Japanese, Chinese, the Free French, and the SS (of all different squad types).&#10;&#10;The two new boards bring added flexibility to the system and are integral to most of the scenarios. Board 78 is a true wilderness board (no buildings) featuring a brush-covered ridge along its length. Board 79 provides a new river, three to five hexes wide, with a village strung out along both banks. Both highlight the steady skills of Charlie Kibler and are sure to see wide use in future scenario design. With great boards and great scenarios, Action Pack #13 is sure to be a big hit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to their familiarity with the forest, your apes use the terrain to hide, observe enemies from a distance, move with agility and climb on trees to gain strategic advantage. Humans, while hampered by their inability to climb, have superior technology that gives them considerable firepower. You'll constantly have to make the best tactical decisions, anticipate human actions, coordinate and help each other.&#10;&#10;3D EXPERIENCE! Trees give your apes a huge tactical advantage! See without being seen, get bonuses, jump from tree to tree or even directly at your enemies!&#10;&#10;SOLO PLAY Play solo and take on a variety of scenarios with adjustable difficulty levels.&#10;&#10;TACTICAL COMBAT Your apes all have different weapons and abilities, making combat highly tactical and cinematic.&#10;&#10;COOP Mutual aid and coordination between players are key! You must counter the enemy's firepower with cunning. anticipation, and coordinated action over multiple rounds.&#10;&#10;In the shadows that darken between the ancient trees, a shiver runs through the forest that carries a bad omen.&#10;An ape, breathless and his eyes filled with a wild urgency, makes his way through the undergrowth to reach the secret entrance beneath the waterfall that leads to the lair of his leader, Caesar.&#10;The alarm is sounded: the horn of a small group of apes, located near a camp to the east, has been blown. The signal leaves no room for doubt; human patrols, thirsty for revenge since Koba's attack, have begun their assault. The targeted camp, a haven for the war wounded, is now in imminent danger.&#10;&#10;&quot;The humans are approaching, Caesar&quot;, the messenger mimics in sign language, panting. &quot;Our brothers are holding their positions, but the enemies are numerous and well-armed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Caesar, the figurehead of this endangered Eden, catches every word, his gaze sharp as flint. Without wasting a moment, he orders reinforcements to evacuate the wounded camp, while planning the fortification of the main refuge. Determined, Caesar picks up arrows, dips them into the embers of a nearby fire, and murmurs with unwavering resolve:&#10;&#10;&quot;You will not be the only ones to use fire tonight.&quot;&#10;&#10;With agility that defies the treetops, he leaps through the branches, a shadow among shadows, ready to defend his people to the last breath.&#10;&#10;APES TOGETHER STRONG&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mischief Media is a social deduction, tabletop game designed around the deceptive world of journalism and politics where players try to manipulate each other in an attempt to push their agenda.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role of a &quot;Philanthropist&quot; who influences different key characters of the media world to gain control over the public's interest. To gain control of a news cycle (ROUND), the player must gain a majority of the available viewers, be the only one left with viewers, or be the only one left with credibility. Win three news cycles and you have successfully pushed your agenda changing the public's opinion.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the round with 2 Credibility Cards, 1 Collusion Card, 7 viewer chips, and 1 Action Card. These are the tools that are used to push your agenda.&#10;&#10;There are six Credibility Cards, each with their own action, that are used to affect viewership or credibility. On your turn, you may choose to take an action of any Credibility Card whether you have that card or not. If you lose both Credibility Cards, you no longer have a reputable opinion and are out for the round.&#10;&#10;Viewer chips represent how many people believe in your movement. Each player starts with 7 viewer chips. If you gain 20 viewer chips, then a majority agree with your opinions and you win the round. If you lose all of your viewer chips, then you have become no longer relevant and are out for the round.&#10;&#10;If a player does an action of a Credibility Card that they do not have, then they are susceptible to being called out for their Fake News! If correctly called out for Fake News by an opponent, the player loses one of their Credibility Cards. If incorrectly called out for Fake News by an opponent, the opponent loses a Credibility Card.&#10;&#10;Management of both viewers and credibility are key to success. Focus too much on credibility and a player could lose all their viewers. Focus too much on viewers and a player could lose all their credibility.&#10;&#10;To turn the tide of the game, a player can use a Collusion Card. Collusion Cards come with a higher risk because it requires a specific set of Credibility Cards. Yet the reward is well worth it because the player gets to follow through with a special action.&#10;&#10;As you become close to winning, the media has more watchful eye on your actions forcing you to draw a hidden Scrutiny Card. Scrutiny Cards change the way you play the game possibly forcing you to play truthfully or to play as a full on liar.&#10;&#10;Once you have won three news cycles and successfully pushed your agenda, you get to tell your fellow melancholy media members what is now commonly accepted as truth i.e. &quot;It is considered rude to greet a friend without using excessive JAZZ HANDS&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Many micro-details are left to the player, only the &ldquo;important&rdquo; rules are included in the twelve pages of the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes nine Scenarios, covering classical wargame scenes like searching for loot, attacking an enemy base, defending your territory, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot!&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Scout&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Warband, your enemies will also become stronger.&#10;&#10;Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A gathering so secret even we don't really know what happens there. All we know things tend to get quite rough. All mooz (players) are eager to have a nice drink (or two, or three, or more...) but the real boozers get lost in the forest. Their follow-mooz cannot wait to find them and lush up together. Are you curious about what kind of mooz you are going to meet? Before you know it, you are in a world of choices, speed, agility and above all: lots of fun!&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;The goal of the game is simple: The player who has the least blood alcohol content (bac) points when the game ends, wins. The game ends when all cards are face up.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;STEP 1: Gather some friends and take a seat. Clear the table.&#10;STEP 2: Make sure everyone has a glass and fill this glass with a drink of choice.&#10;STEP 3: Spread all cards on the table face down.&#10;The youngest player starts the game by turning a card of choice face up. Turns go clockwise until all cards are face up.&#10;&#10;Does the Question Mooz has it in for you? Or are you, as Royal Mooz, calling the shots? Are you a Gentlemooz or do you steal booz from your neighbors? Everything is possible, as long as you finish the game as the mooz with the least points.&#10;&#10;Servant Mooz, another round please!&#10;&#10;",

Category cards are to be kept separately.  Wordsmiths will take turns rolling the die which will determine which category is played that round. The category will display an unrelated question in which you compete for the best answer. The winning Wordsmith of that round gets to add the answer to their Word-O-Gram in the matching category. Once they have one of each category, the Word-O-Gram&rsquo;s story will be readable and complete. If a player gets 5 of the same category they may trade 4 in to get one they are missing. Remember, the goal in playing cards is not only to get picked but mainly to complete your Word-O-Gram, so choose cards that will impress your opponents but also play well with your story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On his turn the player has to take one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;1 &ndash; Take a card from the market into his hand. &#10;2 &ndash; Take the top card of the drawing deck.&#10;3 &ndash; Alter a recipe from the cookbook by exchanging one of the ingredient cards in his hand with a card from the cookbook.&#10;4 &ndash; Play a special card from his hand. &#10;5 &ndash; Perform the special skill of his role.&#10;6 - Complete a recipe. Give all the ingredients compiling a recipe to complete it.&#10;&#10;Each recipe gives a certain number of points which equals the sum of the points of ingredient cards that compiles the recipe. At the end of the game the player who has collected the most victory points, wins.&#10;&#10;In the elimination game &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; each player will create their own unique cookbook and will try to steal their opponents&lsquo; recipes. This way, he reveals other players&lsquo; culinary secrets and their unique cookbooks decreases. After the last recipe from a player&rsquo;s cookbook is stolen, the player must leave the game. The last surviving player with recipes that have not been revealed is the winner.&#10;&#10;In &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; the active player allowed actions are:&#10;1 &ndash; Take a card from the market.&#10;2 &ndash; Take the top card of the drawing deck.&#10;3 &ndash; Play a special card.&#10;4 &ndash; Exchange an ingredient card from his hand with a card from another player&rsquo;s cookbook. &#10;5 &ndash; Improve a card in his cookbook. This way a recipe form the cookbook becomes more difficult for stealing. &#10;6 &ndash; Steal an opponent&rsquo;s recipe.&#10;&#10;In the cooperative variant - &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; a royalty has noticed our masters of the sweets. She wants them to make incredible sweets for her birthday. Now the players must combine their efforts and team up in order to exactly fulfill all the royal&rsquo;s requirements.&#10;In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; each player will hold the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The other players will give him clues about his cards.&#10;&#10;In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; the active player allowed actions are:&#10;1 &ndash; Point a card from the cookbook and then discard a card from his hand. If the discarded card is of the same type as the one that has been pointed at, turn the cookbook card face down.&#10;2 &ndash; Discard a card from his hand and exchange the position of 2 cards from the cookbook. &#10;3 &ndash; Discard 2 cards from his hand in order to discard a card from the cookbook. Replace the discarded cookbook card with a new card from the drawing deck.&#10;4 &ndash; Discard a card from his hand in order to give a clue to another player, what cards he holds in his hand. The active player must indicate &ndash; by pointing &ndash; which cards he is offering a clue about. Two types of clues are allowed:&#10;A) A clue about one, and only one value. For example: &ldquo;You have &lsquo;5&rsquo; point cards, here and here and &hellip;&rdquo;. &#10;B) Point a recipe in the cookbook. Afterwards, the active player should point out all cards from one team-mate hand that are of the same type as at least one card from the selected row or column. For example: &ldquo;Here and here and here &hellip; you have the same cards like in this recipe&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if all the cards in the cookbook are face down, then the queen is happy and all players win together. Otherwise the game is lost.&#10;&#10;To be a true master of the sweets, you need a lot of workouts. The best workout is when you are confronted with your own best achievements.&#10;The solo variant &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; is the same like &ldquo;MasterSweets&rdquo; for two players. The goal in the &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; is the player to collect more victory points than George &ldquo;The cake&rdquo; (his fictional opponent) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you roll the dice, sum them, and find that space.  If the space is blank, put one of your cubes there.  If it has one cube of another color, bump that cube -- replace it with your cube and return the bumped cube to its owner.  If it has 2 cubes (of any color), miss your turn.  If it has one cube of your color, put a second there and 'lock' the space -- it is now safe from being bumped.  The first player to get rid of all their cubes wins.&#10;&#10;On other boards, players roll 2 dice and take the difference or roll 3 dice and take the sum of all 3.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with more than 2 players if each starts with fewer cubes (3 players use 7 each, 4 players us 5 each).&#10;&#10;This game has been made freely available online as a print-and-play.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in a less aggressive fashion by giving each player their own board.  On your turn, roll and cover the appropriate space.  The first player to cover a specified number of spaces wins.

The journey to Mars is however long and demanding. Also, the planet is not suitable for human life. Therefore the brightest minds of Earth concluded that if humans cannot be transferred to Mars, some new special robotic machine will prepare the ground for them.&#10;&#10;And so GOLEMs (Gear Operated Looting and Exploring Machines) appear.&#10;Their mission: to explore the Red planet, extract its resources and build structures suitable for human colonisation. Once deployed, GOLEMs will follow their programed mission: extract resources, improve their design, build colonies and destroy enemies indefinitely until one day their creators will land on the red planet and turn them off.&#10;Until then, GOLEMs are the only Lords of planet Mars&hellip;&#10;&#10;G.O.L.E.M. is a steampunk themed, card driven, battle and colonisation game featuring a modular map, high quality miniatures and superior artwork.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Home of the Brave is a sociopolitical board game emphasizing the complexity of the world of modern U.S. politics. It's a 2-5 players tabletop game in which players will compete for influence, advance their professional position and gain powerful supporters. Driven by a story presented in a 18-page novella, the game creates a rich landscape where politics, media, social activism, business and criminal world mix. Home of the Brave is full of negotiation, blackmail, alliances and scandals.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in rounds. Each round (except the first) starts with revealing a voting card (events) and voting for one of its two possible results. Then the players take turns doing actions (play a card, earn profit from previously played cards, advance on the path of bravery, etc.). When everyone has finished doing actions and has passed, the round ends - players draw new cards and reveal a new voting card. The primary player action is to play a card. Each character has their own deck of cards representing their typical behavior, acquaintances, and strengths. Each card has a cost (in resources) to play it, which is printed on the card. Skillful resource management and optimal card play is the key to victory in Home of the Brave.&#10;&#10;A basic type of resource in the game is supporter cubes. They symbolize allies, voters, subordinates, or favors owed to a character. There are four types: Republicans, Democrats, Activists and Criminals.&#10;&#10;Additional resource types are dollars and bravery points.&#10;&#10;Players keep their own resources hidden behind screens so that opponents cannot see them. A player pays the cost of playing a card by paying the required resources from behind their screen to the bank. A player cannot play a given card if they do not have all the required resources.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to gain 4 (or more) stars before one&rsquo;s opponents. 2 stars can be gained by career advancement along the path of bravery, but each character also has many other ways to earn stars, mostly through their personal goal cards. Players will often have to prioritize between their career and private life.&#10;&#10;",

Your garden beneath the trees of Wyr grow the flowers and herbs you need for your craft.&#10;&#10;In the time of harvest you set out to gather what you will require for those you care for. You have a day to harvest all you will need while trying to stop the mischievous Keiju from causing havok in your Garden.&#10;&#10;If you can find the right combination of flowers and herbs to satisfy them, they will consider you a friend and move elsewhere.&#10;&#10;To Win: &#10;The goal of the game is to harvest all but one of the Nature cards from the Garden and entice all the Keiju to leave.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Shuffle the deck of 8 Keiju cards and draw 4 of them. Remove the others from the game. Place these 4 drawn Keiju on top of the pile of 44 Nature cards and shuffle this deck of cards and lay them out face up in 4 rows of 12 cards each This area is the Garden.&#10;&#10;Leave room for 5 cards below these rows. This area is the Basket.&#10;&#10;You will also create a discard pile - the Harvest - during the game.&#10;&#10;To Play:&#10;You may choose one of any two matching cards from any of the rows if your choice is: two adjacent cards within the rows, sharing the same suit or number OR if there are exactly two other adjacent Nature cards between the pair you are choosing to remove one of (Note: A Keiju card may not be one of these in between cards).&#10;&#10;Only one of these two cards is chosen and is then placed either in the Harvest or the Basket. Each time you remove a card from a row, slide any cards to the right or left of the removed card to fill in any gaps across the rows. Cards are moved from the bottom rows upward or the top row downwards as a gap is filled.&#10;&#10;The Harvest - This is a discard pile, you will receive one point for each card in this pile at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The Basket - Instead of placing cards in the Harvest you may place a card instead in one of 5 card &lsquo;piles&rsquo; in your Basket. Cards in your Basket are used to entice the Keiju in your Garden to leave.&#10;&#10;Keiju must be removed in numerical order, lowest to highest. If, at any time, cards on top of the piles in the Basket match a request as shown on the next consectuive numbered Keiju card in the Garden, you may remove that Keiju to the Harvest where it is worth 10 points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The four or five cards used to bribe the Keiju are then removed from the game and will not score any points. Keiju do not have suits. They will form blocked areas in the rows of cards which can affect how you remove the suited cards.&#10;&#10;As you play cards to the Basket you will cover up previous cards played there, which can then only be revealed once they are used to entice Keiju.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;At game end you will receive:&#10;&#10;1 point per Nature card in the Harvest.&#10;10 points per Keiju in the Harvest.&#10;Any Keiju left in the Garden are -5 points each.&#10;Any Nature cards left in the Garden are -1 point each.&#10;Cards remaining in the Basket count neither for nor against you.&#10;&#10;This game can be played with a traditional card deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Epic Battle of Alesia 52 BC is an old school classic hex and counter game that is designer Grant Wylie's reimagining of the Avalon Hill title, Caesar: Epic Battle of Alesia originally published in 1976.&#10;&#10;The game allows players to refight Caesar's epic battle fought against the Gaul in 52 B.C., on a 34&quot; x 44&quot; hard mounted board.  Borrowing many concepts from the Avalon Hill title, the concepts have been simplified and clarified to make a smooth playing game that is good for 2 or more players, and if you are a gamer who doesn't mind playing both sides to the best of your ability, the game is very friendly.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S INCLUDED:&#10;&#10;Large beautiful box Box &#10;34&quot; x 44&quot; Hard mounted game board&#10;4 counter sheets with large 3/4&quot; counters with rounded corners&#10;2 copies of the rules (one for each player)&#10;1 six sided die&#10;2 full color player aids&#10;1 off board movement chart&#10;1 plastic custom counter tray&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adult XXX Charades is played like a regular charade game for the most part. The goal is to be the first team to reach 10 points and be declared winner.&#10;&#10;After the teams are formed, the first team (chosen by determining who most recently had sex) selects an actor who then announces which phrase he/she will act out (1-6). Then that actor draws a charade card from a deck of the provided cards (before being able to see what the phrases are!)&#10;&#10;Each of the six phrases on the charade cards are marked with a single &quot;X&quot;, a double &quot;XX&quot; or a triple &quot;XXX&quot; which represents the potential difficulty of acting out/guessing that particular phrase.  A single &quot;X&quot; will be alloted one run through of the provided 60 second sand timer. The double &quot;XX&quot; will run through the sand timer one full time and then flip for a second run through.  The triple &quot;XXX&quot; designation shall allow the team to have a third sand timer run through. Regardless of which level &quot;X&quot; is assigned, the point alloted for a correctly guessed phrase is one.  The &quot;X&quot; designation simply allows for more or less time during the acting out/guessing phase and does not impact scoring.&#10;&#10;The phrases often can be acted out using very common gestures, but some will be nearly impossible to portray without performing a lewd gesture (or ten.)&#10;&#10;The actor may tell the team what level of difficulty &quot;X&quot; the phrase is but no other oral communication is allowed. Once the sandtimer is flipped, the acting and guessing commences.  The actor can not sing, talk, hum, mouth words, or give any other oral clues (besides naughty gestures) nor can the actor draw letters in the air.&#10;&#10;When scoring points, the entire phrase must be correctly stated. &quot;Kissing&quot; would not be granted a point if the phrase was &quot;kissing under the mistletoe&quot;.&#10;&#10;If the team correctly acts out and guesses the phrase before the sand timer(s) runs out, one point is marked on the included score sheet. Whether or not a team scores, once their timer runs out, the other team takes their turn.  This continues until one team has collected ten points and wins (Climaxes) the game.&#10;&#10;Adult XXX Charades is a game of charades that is inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18.  The game does include sexually explicit references and innuendos, and may be offensive and inapropriate to some audiences.&#10;&#10;Inside the box there are 100 charade cards with six phrases on each, 2 pencils, 60 second sand timer, score pad, instructions, and a charades signal sheet. The charade signal sheet is a helpful guide on how to act out common phrases/clues which can be used for any charade type game.&#10;&#10;",
