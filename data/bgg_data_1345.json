Each player controls a character represented by three randomly determined stats: Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina. The game is played on a square grid representing a bread shop. The basic object of the game is for the characters to beat the heck out of each other in an effort to obtain the bread and exit the bread shop.&#10;&#10;To start the game, one player is selected at random to be in possession of the bread. The other players then set up their characters around the one with the bread. Starting with the player who has the bread, each player takes a turn consisting of movement and combat actions.&#10;&#10;These turns continue until one player's character escapes with the bread, somebody flips over the game board, or everybody just gets tired of the silliness and moves on to a real game. Somewhat similar in spirit to the parody game Panzer Pranks, the emphasis of Bread in October appears to be on satire rather than simulation or playability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

If you defeat the other witches OR summon your Guardian, you will break the curse, but if you fail, your coven will be banished to the shadows until the next ritual.&#10;&#10;In Witches of Wickville, a game of witches in which from 1 to 4 players we can face each other to win the victory. The objective of the game is to be the first to light our candles to activate the ritual and wake up our guardian or we can also win by defeating the enemy by throwing the three cursed potions at him.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players choose a witch from each team who will represent their character during the game.&#10;&#10;Then we place both guardians in the center of the table on their inactive side, shuffle the rest of the witchcraft cards and place them randomly on their inactive side, forming a circle around the guardians.&#10;&#10;The game will take place in turns, in which we will have a compulsory action and two optional ones.&#10;&#10;We must always move and optionally we can flip a card and/or use our character's ability.&#10;&#10;Every time we flip a card, the cards activate an ability that must be executed, that card can produce chain effects, flip the next card, deactivate a specific card... and so on.&#10;&#10;The first player to have all four candles lit and the grimoire book on the side of his color will activate his guardian, lighting his four candles a second time will make him the winner of the ritual.&#10;&#10;But beware! With the yellow potions, if you throw all three potions you will damage the opposing witch, if you do it a second time, it will be another way to defeat him and win.&#10;&#10;",

Within each turn, the figure can be moved to as many positions as its strength allows.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rest: Each figure that stays in place and is not attacked increases its strength by one point each turn, until it reaches a maximum strength of six.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Attack: The attacking figure must enter the square of the opponent figure, following the rules of movement (i.e., it must expend the strength needed to enter the opponent's square). After moving, the strengths of the two figures are compared and the stronger of the two survives.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who first brings the crown to the base.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Now that the vacation season was coming to an end and the last tourists had left, the campsite at Teufelssee was once again firmly in the hands of the few loyal permanent campers. At the joint autumn festival, numerous homemade salads were dished up to say goodbye to the summer with beer and sausage. Together they ate and drank extensively and reminisced.&#10;&#10;The party should have been the prelude to the quiet and relaxing half of the camper year. But what was meant to be a celebration took a dramatic turn during the evening when the campground's grumpy, chain-smoking owner, Gisela Nickel, was found dead in the reception area. How could this celebration have ended so fatally?&#10;&#10;Players&#10;&#10;4 female and 4 male roles (with 8 people).

Inspired by the real monastery of Lindisfarne, players work to create resources, feed themselves, and write religious texts for the library, culminating in the great Lindisfarne Gospels.&#10;&#10;The monks are represented by dice, and the pips on the dice represent their level of experience. As the monks are placed on action spaces each round, their pips are converted to action points to spend in that action space. Each round, the player who has pip majority in each action space may claim an available bonus, which may include the ability to pip up a die.&#10;&#10;Monks can also be sent in pilgrimage to holy sites overseas, and to collect rare, vivid inks to take home for use in their scriptorium. The monks must also beware the Vikings, who raid the monastery every summer, and who must be paid off in beer and mead, lest they steal the treasures of the monastery or murder the monks!&#10;&#10;A full game of Lindisfarne Monastery is played over four game rounds, representing calendar years, where in each year there are two action phases, and within each action phase the monk dice are placed, and then resolved. Points are scored from pilgrimage, from writing religious texts, commissioning treasures for the monastery chapel, and for retiring monk dice from the board. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;WarBonds: Battle For Vitoria&quot; is a strategy war game where players deploy and mobilize a medieval fantasy army in an effort to reign supreme amidst the war torn lands of Vitoria. Players start with a unique warlord that&rsquo;ll serve as the leader of their army, and the first unit deployed onto the Battle Map. Each warlord is vying for control and ideological dominance. All units, warlords included, have an ideological alignment that will be tried by the brutalities of war. Players will make nuanced decisions that will affect the leadership of their warlord, and the loyalty of their units.&#10;&#10;One such decision involves influencing the public to incite revolt or enforce order across the land. Inciting a revolt is looked upon favorably by all chaos alignment units, but unfavorable to all law alignment units. Such a decision will cause these units to gain or lose loyalty. Units without loyalty are susceptible to leaving your army; or worse, be persuaded by the leadership of an opponent's warlord to join their army. There is no randomness; players must out-think their opponents to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;To achieve victory, a player must satisfy any one of the below conditions:&#10;&#10;     Be the last player with a surviving warlord and war camp.&#10;         If your warlord is killed, you lose the game.&#10;         If your war camp is destroyed, you lose the game.&#10;    &#10;     Be the first player to gain a level 3 war camp.&#10;     If the dragon arrives, when it reaches the End of Game event, have the largest army size (IE: victory points).&#10;&#10;&#10;When a game is fully set up and ready to start, the gameplay runs through a cycle of game rounds until one player achieves victory. A game round consists of a series of ordered turn handling for the deployed and enabled units and war camps; followed by the handling of various ordered events. The next game round starts after all aforementioned game objects have completed their respective turns, and each event has been handled. To assist with tracking and management of a game round an Initiative Table is used to indicate which in-game object&rsquo;s turn must be handled next. Players only take their turn when one of their owned and controlled in-game object is designated to take their respective turn. This cycle of starting and ending game rounds proceeds until a player achieves a victory condition, or the game reaches its final round triggering the End of Game event.&#10;&#10;In WarBonds: Battle For Vitoria each player selects a single warlord from a pool of warlords for which to start their war campaign with. Afterwards, in the same order, all players select their starting war camp and warlord location on the battle map. Once war camp and warlord placement is complete, the game can now begin, starting with the player whose warlord has the lowest initiative score indicated on the Initiative Table. As each round progresses, players will select and deploy various units to make up their army.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Spin Doctors is a game in which the players take on the role of the chief of staff and help their candidates in entering upon the highest office in the country.&#10;&#10;The player, having a predetermined budget at their disposal, chooses appropriate campaign workers and uses their cards in each round to send them to different regions of the country with different tasks. Those could be an election rally, fundraising or an election trail. But they could also be a little less friendly forms of rivalry like incitement against political opponents, manipulation or propaganda. The player has to remember however, to plan these actions out carefully because all the campaign workers have their own distinct abilities, useful in specific situations, and only a limited number of them can carry out their tasks in each round. Moreover, the players have to predict the moves and the plans of their opponents, as the cards are placed on the board face down. They know where their opponents are sending their people, but they do not know which ones and with what tasks. They can also use their campaign workers to cooperate with the media, which can influence the turnout in several regions of the country as well as the topics important for the local communities. &#10;Additionally, the players must prepare an election program for their candidates and make sure that they fulfil as many promises as possible. Each mistake means a loss of votes and the risk of defeat.&#10;&#10;Campaign workers&rsquo; actions influence the endorsement in each region and allow the candidates to earn endorsement points there. The one with the most endorsement points becomes the winner in the given region and gains votes from the local electorate which can represent one of 4 social groups.&#10;&#10;The player with the most votes in all social groups at the end of the game wins the elections and becomes president. &#10;But remember that politics is often a brutal fight which doesn&rsquo;t always encourage fair play, and media manipulation, provocation or leakage of compromising material are only a few of the challenges you will have to face. Everybody wants to win, and they will do anything to reach their goal.&#10;&#10;Do you have the guts to grab for power?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Animals have survived by undergoing a series of changes called evolution. And evolution takes place when an animal's wish to change is conveyed to its Evolution Agent.&#10;&#10;In this game, the players, as Evolution Agents, help animals evolve according to their wishes by the magical &quot;paint-on&quot; pen. If an animal wishes to eat leaves in height, extend its neck and tongue. It would also be nice to extend its limbs.&#10;&#10;However, do not be complacent. Other players will ask questions to check if each evolution fulfils the wishes. Through the repeated process of evolution and checking, aim to be the best Evolution Agent.&#10;&#10;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#229;&#145;&#189;&#229;&#137;&#181;&#233;&#128;&#160;&#231;&#179;&#187; &#227;&#129;&#138;&#231;&#181;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#139;&#133;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#228;&#191;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#181;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#228;&#191;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#185;(&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#153;)&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#231;&#167;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#228;&#191;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

Cards represent fleshed-out characters or the vehicles or vehicle upgrades they use, or major story elements that can be played to shift the game's dynamics. It feels like playing a streamlined Warhammer 40k with Magic: The Gathering cards.&#10;&#10;1 - 2 players, ages 12 and up, games lasting 30 mins to 1 hr.&#10;&#10;Played on a tabletop with cards, six-sided dice, a ruler, and elements representing terrain. Everything required to get started is available in the Sourcebook And Core Rules.&#10;&#10;The narrative background of the game and its associated and ongoing book series is based on classics like Dune, Star Wars, Firefly, and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series:&#10;&#10;&quot;Two thousand years ago, the Salt Mystic declared her vision of the forces of history, and how to harness them to shape human events. Naraia was the name they gave to the sprawling republic that arose from her teachings, encompassing countless cities on land, floating on the seas and tethered to the seafloor, and tucked into pockets of artificial space called oriels.&#10;&#10;All of that shattered a generation ago in a terrifying and almost supernatural conflict called 'The War Of The Rupture'. Now, roving bands of Naraia's remnant fleets and soldiers and its marvelous machines scatter like maple seeds for anyone with a vision to seize them. And abandoned oriels lie in wait for brave explorers with the heart to enter inside.&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
