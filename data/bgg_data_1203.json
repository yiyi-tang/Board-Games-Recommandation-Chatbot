Building upon the superb third rate plastic sprues, the box contains additional metal components to make the following famous vessels, all of which were present at the Battle of Trafalgar!&#10;&#10;Indomptable- A Tonnant-class 80-gun ship of the line, Indomptable was laid down in 1788 and saw active service from 1791. In her first engagement at The Glorious First of June she lost her mast and had to be towed back to Brest.&#10;&#10;Under the command of Admirable Villeneuve she went to sea as part of a large fleet bound for the West Indies, but returned for Europe upon news that Nelson had arrived there. In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, a violent artillery exchange was halted by thick fog, an exhausted French fleet thus anchored in Ferrol before sailing on to Cadiz. Admiral Villeneuve, with his command under threat, vowed to meet the British at the Cape of Trafalgar.&#10;&#10;At Trafalgar, Indomptable was part of the Spanish line, engaging Vice Admiral Collingwood's flagship HMS Royal Sovereign, as well as HMS Belleisle, HMS Revenge, HMS Dreadnought and HMS Thunderer. Drifting downwind, and out of range, she turned back towards Cadiz but got caught in a rescue operation for Bucentaure which had struck a reef. The following night, Indomptable was caught in a storm and carried onto rocks offshore from Cadiz. Only 150 (of between 100 and 1400 men) are estimated to have survived the wreck.&#10;&#10;Formidable- an 80-gun Tonnant-class ship of the line of the French Navy, she was briefly named Figuieres, but this was restored to Formidable prior to her launch at Toulon on 31 May 1795. She participated in the Battle of Algeciras, the Battle of Cape Finisterre and the Battle of Trafalgar - in which she served as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in the six-ship vanguard of the French fleet.&#10;&#10;She was captured by the British at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805. Renamed HMS Brave whilst in service of the Royal Navy, she was eventually sold to be broken up in 1816.&#10;&#10;Argonaute- a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy. Under Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse, she took part in the expedition to Saint-Domingue in 1802. She took part in the Battle of Trafalgar but managed to return to Cadiz. She could not leave port due to heavy damage and the British blockade, she was eventually exchanged for the Spanish ship Vencedor in December 1806. At this point, she was renamed Argonauta, but was never recommissioned.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Building upon the superb third rate plastic sprues, the box contains additional metal components to make the following famous vessels, all of which were present at the Battle of Trafalgar!&#10;&#10;Monarca - a 74-gun third rate ship of the line belonging to the Monta&ntilde;&eacute;s-class. Her main guns were arranged over two complete decks, with 28 24-pounder cannons on her lower deck and 30 18-pounders on the upper, in addition to 12 8-pounders and 4 8-pounders on her quarterdeck and forecastle respectively.&#10;&#10;Under the command of Captain Teodoro Argumosa, she took part in the Battle of Trafalgar, in which she suffered heavy damage at the hands of HMS Bellerophon. 55 Royal Marines boarded and captured her, but one night later the survivors overpowered their captors and set them adrift in the storm. 3 days after the battle, the survivors had decided to attempt repairs to return to Cadiz but were pursued by HMS Leviathan (which had picked up the adrift marines). She ran aground on 28 October near Huelva and was destroyed by HMS Naiad to prevent her restoration.&#10;&#10;Argonauta - an 80-gun third rate ship of the line, she was the last of the Monta&ntilde;&eacute;s-class of ships (of which there were four). On 25 August 1800, she fought off the British Ferrol expedition as part of Joaquin Moreno's squadron.&#10;&#10;Subsequently, she fought at the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and as part of Federico Gravina's second squadron at Trafalgar. Captured at the latter battle, she was taken in tow by HMS Poyphemus, but was abandoned due to the storm which followed the battle On 24 October HMS Defiance rescued survivors and attempted to re-establish a tow unsuccessfully. The Argonauta sank 6 days later, its survivors landing at Algeciras the next day.&#10;&#10;San Justo - a 74-gun ship of the line, San Justo was launched 11 November 1779. She participated in such actions as the Battle of Cape St Vincent, and the Siege of Gibraltar. She later participated in the battle of Trafalgar, managing to escape destruction. She was eventually broken up at Cartagena in 1828.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They were not designed for combat, being built mainly for cargo, passenger and fishing purposes.&#10;&#10;During the Napoleonic era, Schooners were used to communicate dispatches, rather than divert more important warships for this purpose. In fact their size and swiftness made them ideal for this purpose. Such vessels sometimes received criticism from the Admiralty for their sailing durability and inherent weakness, without understanding their exact purpose.&#10;&#10;That is not to say that schooners did not actively engage in combat. Their speed made them ideal to intercept Slaver ships for example.&#10;&#10;Schooners count as small vessels in Black Seas, operating only a single broadside light cannon. Despite this, schooners make the ideal basis of a Privateer fleet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The USS Essex was a 36-gun frigate that participated in the Quasi-War with France, the First Barbary War, and the War of 1812. She was very successful in disrupting British whaling in the Pacific, before being captured in 1814, and re-purposed as the HMS Essex under the Royal Navy.&#10;&#10;Launched on 30 September 1799, she was armed with short ranged carronades that could not hope to match the range of 18 or 24 pounder naval guns. The US Navy accepted her nevertheless and under the captaincy of Edward Preble, holding the distinction of being the first US Naval ship to cross the Equator in early 1800.&#10;&#10;The first Barbary War saw duties shift to the Mediterranean, with blockading and convoy escort duties at Gibraltar as well as participating in the Battle of Deme (27 April 1805).&#10;&#10;After the declaration of the War of 1812, USS Essex achieved major success in disrupting British whaling activities in the Pacific under the command of Captain David Porter. From February 1813, over the course of a year, Porter successfully captured 12 British Whalers, and 360 prisoners, whilst sailing around Cape Horn and cruising the Pacific.&#10;&#10;However, On 28 March 1814 at the battle of Valparaiso, Porter was forced to surrender to the frigate HMS Phoebe and the sloop-of-war HMS Cherub when Essex became too disabled to offer any resistance. Of the 12 ships Porter had captured, only one returned to the United States; seven returned to British control, three were sunk, and the Chilean.&#10;&#10;As HMS Essex, she was reclassed as a 42-gun ship, serving as a troopship in 1819, and hulked in 1823 to serve as a prison ship in Cork initially, and Kingstown from 1824 until 1834.&#10;&#10;When used as part of a US Navy fleet in Black Seas, the special rules pay tribute to its successful run in capturing whaling vessels.

    "Description": "This four day battle is one of the more gruesome fights in the Pacific Theater.  This game showcases a unique landing system.  While the fight to capture the island is not really 'in doubt', the Marines have a difficult time of wresting control of the place from the tough Japanese defenders.  The main battle campaign starts with the Marines aboard their transports.  From there they must move onto the landing craft and make their approaches to the beach.  The fire from the Japanese ashore is heavy and, as the Marines dicovered to their dismay, the reef causes a major disruption in the landing plan.  It also creates plenty of easy targets for the Japanese player to hammer.  Once ashore the Marines are going to be hammering away with everything they have and the dugin enemy positions are hard to eliminate.  Securing the island within 4 days is no picnic and playing it safe will not cut it.  The Marines need to be aggressive and willing to take casualties in order to move forward.&#10;&#10;In the Landing system all Marines start on their transports.  When they become available on the Wave Chart they are loaded onto their landing craft.  From there they move to the Landing Craft Beach Chart.  From here the Landing Craft determine which hexrow of the beach lane they will enter the map.  This can cause some serious traffic jams.  Then the landing craft make their run ins' to the beach.  This is pretty exciting in itself, but then the Marines find wire and mine obstacles waiting for them in front of the sandy beach.  These cause major problems in landing.  The net result of all this is some very high nervousness about whether the Marines will get a solid bridgehead ashore.  The most problematic beach is RED 1.  The Marines here almost didn't make it and it is where the 'the Issue is in Doubt' quote comes from.  You will do better I'm sure.&#10;&#10;There are some small scenarios, focusing on 1 beach, an intro scenario of the 2/8 Marines attacking on 22 Nov, and a 'what if' scenario should the Marine player decide to try his hand landing on the 'Black' beaches.  These beaches were located on the seaward side of the island and were covered by extensive minefields.  Good luck with that.&#10;&#10;This game includes:&#10;-(8) 11x17 map sections of Tarawa, (2) 22x34 map equivalents 34&quot; across by 41&quot; top to bottom&#10;-5x Unit counter and marker sheets&#10;-Death Ride - Tarawa Master and Supplemental Rules&#10;-Charts and tables similar to other Death Ride games to support the system; and&#10;-Charts that are specific to support the Amphibious Landing such as the Wave Chart and Transport Chart&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players deploy custom forces representing a Nationality, determine a scenario, and layout terrain to recreate one of the historical battlefields of the Great War.&#10;&#10;A notable difference to Blood &amp; Valor is the unique initiative system. Each round, players simultaneously and secretly bid points in order to determine who will act first. Strong forces can increase the number of points a player has to bid with, thus giving the player a better chance to act quickly. Players will take this into consideration when building their armies.&#10;&#10;As always, our highest priority is historical accuracy and a large range of settings and options to choose from. &#10;The scope of this game is not limited to the western front! &#10;These rules allow for battlefields set in the Alps of northern Italy, the open spaces of the eastern front, the Gallipoli peninsula, and much more.&#10;&#10;The choice is up to you and your imagination.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The board consists of a five-by-five grid of squares numbered 1 to 25.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the &quot;Opposite Start&quot; game variation, the computer selects a starting square (identified by number) for each player. The players then race to see who can get through the maze first and reach the opponent's starting square, through trial and error. The players alternate taking turns moving through the maze. A player can move through any number of squares until the player runs into a wall, at which point the other player gets to take a turn.&#10;&#10;There are two solitaire maze games and six two-player games. In the &quot;Blind Alley&quot; variations, the maze includes dead-ends that force a player to backtrack to get back on the correct path. In the &quot;Back to Start&quot; variations, when a player runs into a wall the player's pawn is returned to the starting square, adding a memory element to the game. In the standard &quot;Maze&quot; game, both players start on the same square and are racing to reach the same destination square.&#10;&#10;The plastic game board features a two-digit LED readout, red and green LED's (which correspond to the color of the opposing playing pieces), and a storage compartment for the four playing pieces (plastic pawns and start/finish space markers). A 9-volt battery or AC adapter is required.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;In French.&#10;&#10;",

Obviously to one of the heroes like you! It doesn't matter if you are a neighborhood hooligan, a world-famous sports personage or an elderly lady skilled in gardening, THE TOWN NEEDS YOU!&#10;&#10;In UAZG, each player plays an inhabitant of a small town hit by a zombie outbreak. The aim of the game is to reach the rescue teams, which appear after a certain number of game turns, depending on the number of players; very difficult mission without the character upgrade, an upgrade that can be obtained by completing the missions that will be available during the game.&#10;&#10;UAZG is a Semi-Cooperative Zombie Game, this is because during the game you will have to cooperate to survive, but at the moment of the arrival of the rescuers maybe someone could have the brilliant idea of caring about the companions and saving the skin, since the rescuers will not have time to wait too long among thousands of zombies.&#10;The game is based on the Pick-Up &amp; Delivery mechanics and it will be essential to cooperate to complete the missions that will advance the 'Game Time'. Not doing any mission during a turn means advancing the 'Danger Marker' by a space that will lead after a few turns to fail and lose the game.&#10;During the game there will be the level increases that will enhance the character of your choice and there will be the possibility of crafting useful objects or weapons, managing inventory better. In addition, there will be an opportunity to trade weapons with the heads of killed zombies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All other players try to guess the amount the original player has chosen-using poker-like chips valued from one dollar all the way to &quot;No Freakin Way!&quot; Everyone reveals their best guess the same time. Those who guess correctly, get &quot;gems&quot;. The player with the most &quot;gems&quot; at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Movement is measured with distance marker sticks, and combat is resolved with a simple dice pool mechanism.&#10;&#10;Games last for up to 8 turns, and movement order is determined through a chit pull mechanism. When a general&rsquo;s chit is pulled, he may command armies in range or contact. Players may defer or jump in the turn order by rolling against a command rating for their generals on the field.&#10;&#10;Players may choose from four included historical scenarios, or build armies with a point system which also determines the winner of a battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Time to give them their due.&#10;&#10;Task Force Zeta Volume Two: Fleet Auxiliaries brings these forces and more to your tabletop space battles. This volume includes:&#10;&#10;     Numerous optional rules, including boarding combat, ramming attacks, combat/long-range scouts, docking, towing, explosions, shipboard fires, and more!&#10;     New classes of vessels, including starbases and ground installations, transport ships and shuttles, Exosuit and Mecha-based fighter squadrons, and Oversized vessels that have no theoretical limit in their size and capacities during their construction.&#10;     Six new weapon characteristics that expand the capabilities of existing weapons classes, Unconventional Weapons to conduct specific forms of electronic attacks against the enemy, mine warfare rules, and Organic ship hulls to represent bio-mechanoid ships.&#10;     29 new and expanded systems that can be added to ships of any size, including teleporters, tractors beams, grappling hooks, troop, cargo, and passenger bays, deployment systems for troop transports, and more.

Each player impersonates one of the rappers of the Machete crew: SALMO, NITRO, DJ SLAIT, JACK THE SMOKER, RASTY KILO, KILL MAURI and HELL RATON. Between albums to produce, scandals and hits, build the Pyramid of the Machete Empire, block the climbs of your opponents and become the King of the music world.

The first player begins by rolling both dice at the same time. They will then move up to the number of spaces shown on the dice along the colored line shown on the dice. After they are done moving, pass the dice to the next player in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;Greedy Gobblers can move in any direction. They must remain on the line of the indicated color shown on the die unless they roll a &ldquo;Smiling Joker&rdquo;. This will allow you to move the Greedy Gobbler on any colored line.&#10;&#10;One thing to watch out for is rolling a &ldquo;Sad Joker&rdquo;. If this happens, the player unfortunately loses their turn.&#10;&#10;Players can move their Gobbler fewer steps then shown on the dice. This can potentially help them collect more Blobs on their next turn.&#10;&#10;If there aren&rsquo;t any blobs on the colored line rolled, the player must move the total amount of spaces shown on the numbered die.&#10;&#10;Greedy Gobblers block a player's path. If there is a Gobbler in your way, you cannot move past the one in front of you.&#10;&#10;When all the Blobs have been collected, Players all open up their Greedy Gobblers and count up the total number of Blobs. The player with the most Blobs is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In this legend, the almighty god creator Wiraqucha gives his children, Ayar Manqu, Mama Uqllu and their siblings, a magical gold staff named the Tupayauri. With it, they travel across the future Tawantinsuyu, searching for the perfect land to found the Inka Empire.&#10;&#10;In this game, players first race for the Tupayauri at the center of the board, then they try to steal it from each other. The Tupayauri is needed to be able to conquer a wamani (province). Once a wamani is conquered, its hidden &quot;Pacha Card&quot; is revealed. Within one of the 12 peripheral wamanis, the Qusqu (Cusco) card is hidden. Whoever finds Qusqu or defeats all enemy warriors, wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are 5 different ayllus (clans), with 5 type of warriors each: A Guide, a Scout, a Fighter, a Hunter, and a Shaman, each with special abilities needed in the game.&#10;&#10;The game also showcases llama pieces, which serve to energize attacks and as offerings to the god Wiraqucha.&#10;&#10;INKAS: The Legend currently has rulebooks in English and Spanish, and a Quechua version is forthcoming. Quechua is the main language of the Inka Empire, still spoken by 10 million people in South Am&eacute;rica.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It also serves as a game roster sheet and is intended to be photocopied by the players and used during the game. The order of battle gives you as much information as possible about the armies. Often game units are made up of several historic units, and wherever possible those historic units are noted.&#10;&#10;Regardless of what rules systems you enjoy, BATTLES OF THE SEVEN YEARS WAR is an indispensable game and historical resource.

    "Description": "This historical game simulates a battle that took place on the 14th of June, 1800, in Marengo (northern Italy) between the army of the Austrian Empire, led by General Melas, and the French Republican army, led by General Bonaparte.&#10;&#10;The game system is designed to be of medium complexity while remaining historically accurate. The rules, the map, the combat counters and the revolutionary use of dice have all been created with these goals in mind. The game also features no stacking of regiments, an innovative loss recording system and only minimal use of markers and tables. Two challenges are proposed: the French player, who begins the game in a position of numerical inferiority, must attempt to achieve the same feat as the army of General Bonaparte, to resist until the arrival of reinforcements, and then use these troops to seize victory. The Austrian player must try to do better than General Melas, who was overconfident of victory at 15:00, only to let it slip from his grasp..&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Any battler in that area loses one health (heart token).&#10;&#10;COIN- a coin token in flipped over and placed in the specified location. The first battler to get to this location adds a unique weapon to their common weapons. But if two or more players arrive at the same time, a battle ensues and only the last person in that location gets the reward...&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT- Each player secretly chooses one of their four movement tokens that specify direction of travel or if they want to stay where they are. All tokens are revealed at the same time and the players move into position for...&#10;&#10;BATTLE- Battler may play a weapon to injur other battlers nearby. Some weapons damage battlers in the immediate location, some damage battlers in consecutive locations, and some have other advantages like damaging someone elsewhere on the map or getting more health.&#10;&#10;When a battler is defeated (by losing all of their health), they are eliminated and the rival who dealt the final bow gets of of their remaining weapons.&#10;&#10;More:&#10;Medieval Royale takes 30-40 minutes from set-up till final triumph. Players are usually not eliminated until the last few rounds, so that eliminated players don't have to wait long to jump in on another game. Many games take longer and longer as rounds go on, but MR actually gets shorter and shorter, since fewer locations and weapons force a quick ending.&#10;&#10;Characters, their abilities, and artwork is based on Of Knights and Ninjas- a medieval card game for 2-6 players that blurs the line between party and strategy game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The British forces landing near Syracuse had the shortest path, but that way was beset with numerous rivers that ran west to east and were easily defended. British airborne troops were given the task of taking the most heavily defended river position, the Primosole Bridge over the Simeto River in an attack dubbed &quot;Operation Fustian&quot;. Unbeknownst to the Allies the Germans also rushed airborne troops to help secure the position along with the Italian garrison. One of most costly and violent battles of the Sicilian campaign would be fought here. Can you do as well or better than your opponent?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Finally, on September 10th, 1944, Field Marshall Montgomery met with Dwight Eisenhower at Melsbroek airfield outside of Brussels. At this meeting, Montgomery won approval for an ambitious plan to allow the Allies to drive from Belgium through Holland and then cross the Rhine River into Germany - an operation that called for three airborne divisions to be landed in stages over three days miles behind enemy lines - code name: Market Garden.&#10;&#10;",

It also saw the first widespread use of wire-guided antitank missiles and the first major generation of post-World War Two armored vehicles.&#10;&#10;The Armies of October is the most comprehensive study of the belligerent armies available under a single cover. For the armies of Israeli, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Liberation Army The Armies of October features:&#10;&#10;     Army organization&#10;     Doctrinal strengths and weaknesses&#10;     Detailed notes on equipment holdings&#10;     Order of battle down to the battalion level&#10;&#10;&#10;For 'Command Decision players we also include game organizations from division to battalion level and a complete list of weapons and combat vehicles with all game statistics.&#10;&#10;The October War provides a unique conflict for study and gaming, a blend of the logical development of World War Two weapon systems encountering the early examples of late-century military technology in the form of wire-guided missiles, extensive mechanization throughout the force structure, and omnipresent light antitank weapons. The Armies of October is the indispensable guide to exploring that conflict.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A new virus emerges, threatening society as we know it. Help the world fight the deadly virus by finding the best possible vaccine!&#10;&#10;Each turn you pick one of the face up Vaccine Tiles and add it to your Science Lab (player board). When completing a row or a column in your Science Lab, you make breakthroughs and can complete objectives on Research Cards to gain Vaccine Points. Breakthroughs also let you gain valuable knowledge by secretly looking at a Disease Card - showing you which traits you should try to avoid on the Vaccine Tiles you pick in the future.&#10;&#10;All players will start the game with asynchronous information (you all know something, but none of you know the same), so keeping an eye on the other player's choices can increase your chances of picking the best Vaccine Tiles!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the weaknesses of the virus is revealed and final scoring commences - It's time to see how many final Vaccine Points each player scores, for having potent Vaccine Tiles to counter the weaknesses. The player with the most Vaccine Points in total is the winner!&#10;&#10;Released as a free Print &amp; Play during March, 2020.&#10;&#10;Why?&#10;&#10;     Many people world wide are isolated in their homes to prevent spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019). If making and playing a simple board game can keep people indoor for even just a little while longer, we can add that to the prevention of the spreading of the virus.&#10;     Scientists are working hard to find the best possible vaccine for the virus. If, or when, the time comes to administer the vaccines, the number of vaccinated people will directly impact its effectiveness. It&rsquo;s a scientific fact that people fear what they don&rsquo;t know. By educating - even just a little bit on vaccines through play - we&rsquo;ll be able to reduce that fear and make the vaccines more effective.&#10;     On a personal level, this is my contribution to help the global COVID-19 crisis (and similar in the future). I hope to inspire you to find your own way to contribute, and to remind you that help comes in all shapes and sizes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Normandy to Lorraine&#10;&#10;On June 6th, 1944, the Allied invasion of France began, an undertaking that involved 12,000 planes, 7,000 ships, and over 160,000 men on the first day alone. After a brief, but bloody struggle, the beachheads were secured, and the land campaign could begin. The Allied troops would face bitter fighting in the hedgerows of Normandy for the next month before Operation Cobra, the operation to break out from the Normandy beachhead, began. The battle for Normandy would go on for more than two months, with Allied troops pushing south and east into France. It would see counterattacks by the Germans at Mortain, and the closing of the Falaise pocket. It would include the liberation of Paris, and the German retreat across the Seine. At the end of August, the Commonwealth troops in the north would plan to move through the Low Countries, while the Americans attempted to push to the Rhine through Lorraine. The end of the war was growing nearer.&#10;&#10;This book presents ten exciting and balanced historical battles for Command Decision covering the fighting in the American sector from June to September 1944. &#10;These scenarios come complete with historical summaries, detailed maps, and carefully-researched orders of battle. &#10;Also included is an overview history of the campaign, as well as complete data charts for the scenarios.&#10;&#10;",
