    "Description": "This story takes place in the 12th century when Portugal was taking shape...&#10;&#10;With his armies marching towards the south, Afonso Henriques, the King of Portugal, could not abandon the territory conquered from the Moors and decided to donate a huge plot of land in the center of the country (44,000 hectares) to a religious order of French origin called Cistercians. This community of monks, which had already settled in other regions, would have to manage the territory and resources of this place. In order to do that, an enormous monastery was built in Alcoba&ccedil;a and that same monastery would go on to become one of the most important for the Order.&#10;&#10;The Cistercians' motto was Ora et Labora (prayer and work), so their abbeys were usually in secluded locations. Silence for their prayers was paramount, as was easy access to stone (in order to build the monastery) and several other goods, such as wood and iron (which were essential to build farming equipment and tools). Fertile land and access to water (necessary for food, hygiene, and agriculture) were also essential to achieve self-sufficiency. Alcoba&ccedil;a filled all the requirements for the task, so the Cistercians accepted the king's challenge &mdash; and this is the historical background from which this game was born.&#10;&#10;12 Monks is a competitive game in which players emulate the mission given by the King to the Cistercians to manage and run the resources from the grounds of Alcoba&ccedil;a. Players will occupy this territory, produce and manufacture cultivated goods, extract the necessary resources to build the monastery of Alcoba&ccedil;a, and build the levada (that is, a system of aqueducts) that will give them access to fresh water.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the time the patient showed several symptoms and the infection was spreading throughout the lungs, stomach, liver and kidneys.&#10;&#10;This game takes place inside a laboratory where each player will be a scientist working to discover a vaccine against a fast spreading virus discovered on patient zero. Time is of the essence and each player has to work on the taken sample (tile-laying on a common board) in order to fulfil the immune system&rsquo;s demands (therapeutic objectives) and getting antibodies (Y disc) which are necessary to neutralize the antigen agent in each of the four affected organs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Their people are rotting away, the lack of discipline is rampant. It cannot go on like this! After the latest scandal, it is finally time to act and apply the best practices. From now on the following applies: Yubitsume ... Every misconduct costs a finger.&#10;&#10;Yubitsume means shortening of the fingers. Fortunately, this game is not like the original, in Japan. With Yubitsume, the yakuza have to snip themselves when they screw up. It follows a strict ritual: You cut off a finger joint in the same presence of the clan chief. If the boss is in a nasty mood, it can be a bit more. You repeat that until ... need we say more.&#10;&#10;Even in the game Yubitsume, mistakes and inaction do not go unpunished. Whenever that happens normally with the yakuza, fingers come off, if you still have some to remove! But rest assured, everything runs more gently and - let&lsquo;s say more symbolically - in this game.&#10;&#10;",

Countries and global corporations are growing desperate and have taken to the outer planets for a new source of energy to replace our dwindling reserves. A deep space probe discovers a new rare element in the lower troposphere of Jupiter which scientists name Exonium. This element will provide significant relief to the energy crisis on Earth. &#10;In a move to beat its competitors, the Power Dynamics Corporation (PDC) has decided to take matters into its own hands. PDC has built a large carrier spacecraft containing four drop ships and sufficient resources to initiate development of stations on four of the moons of Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow PDC teammates will serve as the Commanders of these moon stations. You will each strive to establish a base camp, build the necessary production facilities, and become self-sufficient all the while working with your fellow commanders to get the Orbital Platform running at full strength. The environment around Jupiter is an extremely hostile one. Radiation, magnetic storms, moon quakes, and uncounted quantities of small debris rain down on every moon within the Jovian system. Life on an inhospitable foreign moon can be dangerous, but if the human race is to survive, failure is not an option&hellip;&hellip;.&#10;&#10;Welcome to In the Shadow of Jupiter, a strategic co-op game where you and your fellow PDC colleagues will strive to build stations on the different moons of Jupiter and survive against the dangers of space long enough to complete construction on the orbital mining platform.

Mind you, there is still danger in the world, some brand new, but the way you approach it is different.&#10;&#10;Along with the new stories come new rules. The aforementioned new Voyage rules that allow for a more relaxed pace, completely new rewards and penalties for adventures, and new thematic Battles.&#10;&#10;As the Onwards Odyssey stories take place after the corresponding Cycle, you won&rsquo;t be able to access normal Cycle hubs&hellip; but you will be able to experience some of the R&amp;R, Dreams of Pharos and Inward Odyssey adventures you&rsquo;ve missed.&#10;&#10;To keep it interesting, there is a caveat to going on an Onwards Odyssey though! During normal play, once you cross from Cycle to Cycle, you base Argo stats replenish. No such luck with Onwards Odyssey! So, if you were running on empty and snatched victory out of the jaws of defeat at the last moment, you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to rebuild your ship and crew before you move to Lakonia or Delphi.&#10;Onwards Odyssey is more than 50k words of stories, rules, battles and secrets!&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Black is trying to connect N-S edges of the board, White E-W with an orthogonally connected group.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsGroup: Either a single stone (a group of one) or any number of stones of the same color connected through a continuous series of orthogonal adjacencies.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayFirst player places a single black stone on any grid intersection, after which the second player decides which color they will play (pie rule). Players then alternate taking turns.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point. Then, if possible, place a stone of your color on an empty point that is orthogonally adjacent to two groups of your color, and keep making such placements until no more are possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;AcknowledgmentsEvery one of the regular posters on the BGG Abstract Game forum could rightfully consider themselves a co-author of this game if they wished. I'm like a kid who built something (hopefully cool!) out of LEGO -- but they made the bricks. Thank you all for your generosity and brilliance.&#10;&#10;Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures helped clarify the presentation of the rules - Thanks.&#10;&#10;This game shares some similarities with Quadrex by Bill Taylor, although it was arrived at independently.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online PlayScaffold is one of the many games that can be played for free at mindsports.nl.

Over the course of three years, they work to balance each student's needs, provide encouragement, and help them graduate.  Should one instructor ever find themselves a bit overwhelmed, they can call on their co-workers for a helping hand.&#10;&#10;After choosing from one of the four classes, players receive the corresponding event chart, seat number deck, and student cards.  The students are shuffled and randomly placed in a 3x4 grid, which forms the seating chart for the room.  Then seat number cards are drawn to determine the initial placement of power and negative markers.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds through a series of lesson rounds, both group and individual ones.  Instructors try to balance encouragement and enthusiasm via the movement of power markers while slowing or outright eliminating the stress and frustration from the negative markers.  Should a student ever accumulate enough stress, they can spread it to others around them or even become absent.&#10;&#10;At the close of three years, students are subject to a final exam.  After that, those that are absent or lack at least one power marker fail to graduate.  Teachers are then provided with a title and evaluation based on their work.  If too many students fail to pass, all the instructors are also seen as failures and lose.&#10;&#10;",

Based on the epic 1930 Himalayan adventure which ultimately failed to climb the third highest peak in the world, the game uses original photos and draws on Frank Smythe's book The Kangchenjunga Adventure, written almost 100 years ago.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game the players recruit climbers and sherpas, and gather a range of other resources. These are all represented on the cards. This calls for a mixture of set-building and push-your-luck, as you aim to bring together the strongest expedition possible. Although the game is competitive, there are ways of helping each other too.&#10;&#10;The second part of the game sees the players making their final preparations for an assault on the summit of Kangchenjunga. Some cards may not be useable if the set isn't correct. Then the summit attempt begins and players take it in turns to advance up the mountain. Kangchenjunga is 28,156 feet tall, and successful players must achieve this. But whatever the outcome, details of the players' expeditions can be recorded in the 'Hall of Fame' at the back of the Almanac.&#10;&#10;Kangchenjunga works beautifully as a 'filler' game for a wide range of ages. Simple to learn, the game-play has surprising depths and re-playability is high. See the Rulebook and Almanac link below for full details of how the game plays.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Between 2 cards&hellip; Which image is repeated??? mmmm&hellip; I ALREADY SAW IT!&#10;&#10;You have to say it quickly, as soon as you found the match. The more attention you have, the easier you will see them! Hurry up, concentrate, wake up because in this game, speed rushes us and fun awaits us. If you take two cards and look closely, you will see that they always have one image in common (one and only one). So the goal of the game (in its 5 variants) is to find that common image between two cards and name them as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;1- Pile, Pile with challenges!&#10;A card with images is distributed to each participant and the rest are placed in a pile in the center, with the images visible. You must look for the common image between the card that touched you and the first of the stack. Whoever names the match first draws the center card and places it on top of their own pile. when a challenge card appears, whoever meets it first wins the indicated cards. The game ends when there are no more cards in the center of the table and whoever collects the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;2- Discard with challenges!&#10;Opposite of &quot;Stack, stack&quot;: a card is placed in the center of the table and the rest are distributed among those who play. Each participant has to find the common image between the card that is on the table and the first of their stack. When the match is found, it quickly drops it on the table, discarding itself. Whoever runs out of cards first wins. In this variant they also play the 4 challenge cards, each time a participant reveals one of these cards, they must read it aloud to the rest... So everyone participates!&#10;&#10;3- The jersey (without challenges)&#10;In the center of the table 9 cards are placed face up. The jersey is assembled by finding the same image on three different cards. Whoever forms them first and names the image that matches, takes all three cards (which must be replaced so that there are always 9 cards on the table). Once the cards are finished, whoever collected the most wins.&#10;&#10;4- Take it yourself! (no challenges)&#10;Each participant receives a card face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stack face up in the center of the table. Each participant has to find the common image between the card of the center and that of any participant (except their own). When the match is found, give the center card to whoever has the card with the match. Whoever keeps the most cards loses.&#10;&#10;5- Pass it fast! (no challenges)&#10;Each participant puts a card on the palm of his hand, in view of the rest. When someone finds the image in common between one card and another, he puts his own card on the matching card. Here nobody wins, but whoever keeps all the cards at the end loses.&#10;&#10;",

With Grand Ayatollah Khomeni gravely ill, there was no one in charge within the Iranian government or military who could or would thwart this dangerous escalation of force. On April 14 the FFG (guided missile frigate) USS Samuel Roberts struck a mine at the edge of the international maritime channel near the Gulf of Bahrain while escorting a fleet of oil tankers. While no one aboard the stricken vessel was killed or seriously injured, the mine blew a gaping twenty-foot wide hole in the ship. Only the quick and skilled action by its crew kept USS Samuel Roberts from sinking. It was quickly determined by investigators that the Iranians had deployed the mines, and National Security Advisor, General Colin Powell advised President Reagan that a massive demonstration of force was required to demonstrate once and for all that Iranian armed interference with the flow of ship traffic in the Persian Gulf would not be tolerated.&#10;&#10;Operation Praying Mantis was the largest US fleet action since the Second World War. While the US had a preponderance of force, any error or serious loss could possibly embolden the Iranians, especially the hard liners who resisted any end to the war with Iraq or compromise with the US-led coalition that opposed them. Operation Praying Mantis is a solitaire play game with the active player taking on the role of the commander of the US naval force charged with implementing the operation. The game&rsquo;s rules govern the Iranian response. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Operation Praying Mantis is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;One 11 by 17 inch map&#10;112 single-sided, unmounted counters&#10;One player's aid sheet&#10;6 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Players will also need a six-sided die and one standard deck of playing cards to play the game. A custom card set that replaces the standard deck of playing cards, has rules reminders on pertinent cards, and features graphics by Bruce Yearian is available from High Flying Dice Games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Conquest&rdquo; dates back to the 19th century and is one of the many games inspired by Checkers and Chess and which are also inspired by real historical episodes, such as battles, sieges, military events; among these games we remember &ldquo;Asalto&rdquo;, &ldquo;Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Siege of Paris&rdquo;. The game is developed on a 9x9 chessboard; each player has eight Soldiers and a King, initially arranged in the 3x3 lower right and upper left areas; the King is placed in the center of these areas and is completely surrounded by the eight Soldiers. The goal of the game is to conquer the Fortress, which is the 3x3 area in the center of the game board. &#10;Information on this game is not readily available: it is mentioned in &ldquo;Il Grande Manuale dei Giochi da Tavolo&rdquo; by Giuseppe Meroni and Aldo Spinelli (1996).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ancedale's Hope is a print &amp; play game for single player linking survival mechanics and science fiction universe. Survive during expeditions on an island city and return to your HQ to produce the cure to fight a dangerous virus. Survive expeditions across a hostile island city. Return to your HQ to make the cure. Ancedale's Hope is a printable game. To play it, all you need is a pencil, an eraser and 5 dice. Ideally 4 of them will be of the same color, the 5th will be of a different color.&#10;&#10;How to play ?&#10;&#10;Your HQ is located in a safe place near Ancedale. In this base of operations, you will create the cure by validating various objectives, prepare your expeditions but also spend your money and experience points on permanent improvements.&#10;&#10;In Ancedale's Hope, expeditions are at the heart of the game. But beware, your time is limited, you only have 10 days to find resources, complete the various objectives and finally evacuate the island before the virus infects you too.&#10;&#10;An expedition consists of 3 steps:&#10;&#10;&#10;     First: roll the single colored dice to find out the position of arrival on the island. Then roll 2x all 4 dice of the same color to determine the strength of the island's watchtowers &#10;     How a day unfolds: At the beginning of each day, during your expedition, roll all 5 dice. The single colored dice will determine the direction of the watchtower's view. The 4 dice of the same color will be used for your movements and for the items collected during that day. Simply note your movement on the map and mark the areas you have searched. At the end of the day you should have enough resources (food and water). In some cases you will also need to find a warm place to shelter from the cold before nightfall. If not, your health will be diminished. &#10;     At the end of an expedition: this one can be a real success or an abject failure. Fail and you will lose all the resources collected during the expedition. Succeed and you can bring them back to the safety of your HQ.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Playful maths&#10;&#10;We have created a board game that bridges the gap between school and home activities, and between learning and playing. It provides transition between age groups and people with different abilities.&#10;&#10;It takes you from childhood to old age. It helps to move from playing alone, through playing doubles, to playing in teams. It can help children with autism to start talking. And it&rsquo;s as diverse as autism.&#10;&#10;The clarity and comprehensibility of shapes, colours and numbers can calm you down when competing.&#10;&#10;Pam Pam Pam board game is built on values.&#10;Pam Pam Pam rules of the game:&#10;&#10;Pam Pam Pam is a board game in which players must find two identical symbols on the cards of a selected deck, place the colour, shape and value discs on the solution strip, and then place the solution strip next to the draw deck and name the discs.&#10;&#10;In each deck, on each of two cards, there is only one symbol of the same colour, shape and value. A symbol is designated by colour, shape and value. The value is expressed by a number. The size of the symbols does not matter.&#10;How the game works:&#10;&#10;1. Players are given the basic tools.&#10;&#10;2. Each player is dealt a card.&#10;&#10;3. The remaining cards are placed face up in the middle. This will be the draw deck.&#10;&#10;4. Players try to find two identical symbols on the newest card of their deck and the top card of the draw deck.&#10;&#10;5. The first player who&#10;&#10;a) places the discs of the correct colour, shape and value on the solution strip,&#10;&#10;b) places it next to the draw deck,&#10;&#10;c) names all three discs,&#10;&#10;d) which are checked by another player, and if he/she judges them to be correct,&#10;&#10;e) then the first player puts the discs from his/her solution strip back on the disc tray,&#10;&#10;f) finally, he/she can pick up the card,&#10;&#10;g) which he/she adds to his/her own cards.&#10;&#10;If the solution is incorrect, the player takes back his /her solution strip and the round continues.&#10;&#10;6. The game continues until all cards from the draw deck are used up.&#10;Winner of the game:&#10;&#10;Winner of the game is the player who has collected most of the cards.&#10;A symbol consists of:&#10;&#10;A colour: brown, blue, purple, red, pink, yellow, grey, green,&#10;&#10;A shape: square, triangle, circle,&#10;&#10;A value, e.g.: Arabic numeral, dot, finger, Roman numeral, number of two parts, a part of a number, mirrored number, vehicle, shape, letters, binary system, value of chess pieces, number of protons, number of legs of animals, combinations of these.&#10;&#10;",

They will do this by finding a solid path containing their die value leading from a circled leaf to another leaf, drawing a line over the path, and circling the new leaf. &#10;Each time a player circles a leaf, they gain the benefit of that leaf, which will either be a bonus or a scoring opportunity. These benefits will be tracked on your tracking mat. &#10;The game will be played in rounds, with all players taking simultaneous turns, until a single player has reached any 4 of the goal leaves. All players will finish the current round and then proceed to scoring.&#10;&#10;",

Your mission: fly your helicopters into the volcano to rescue the hikers before the advancing lava reaches them.&#10;&#10;This game stresses crisis planning, risk-taking, and cooperation. Three separate lava advances are controlled by dice, and hikers run from the advancing lava. Some locations in the volcano are easier to land in than others. Eventually the lava will fill the crater, and any hikers trapped will perish. Pilots who crash into the volcano must also be rescued. It is a race against the lava!&#10;&#10;Players use dice to simulate the difficulty of flying in tricky conditions. Helicopters can be upgraded with power-ups and individual pilot cards grant special abilities. The overall victory is cooperative, but points are also awarded individually for a best pilot award.&#10;&#10;This is a great game for introducing the importance of cooperation, teamwork, and risk taking in life-and-death situations. The situation is simulated but tension is real.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
