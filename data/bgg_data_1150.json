Each player's chips are the same color. The objective of the game is for each player to take their chips from the start to the goal; trying, along the way, to eat others. The first to get it will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Like parcheesi, it is a turn-based game, where you can only move your chips in your turn. In your turn you must choose to roll the dice (and move one of your chips that number of squares), or make a special move with one of your chips. At the end of your move, and its consequences, the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For example, a value of 3 for the winning card will let the player choose any card from the first 3 floors, but not the 4th.&#10;&#10;When the last building card is taken, players tally their points and the one with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summmary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;This first volume is District Commander Maracas. It takes as its subject counterinsurgency operations in a megacity - the urban battlefield of the future, and the cutting edge of modern doctrine. The sudden departure from power of Jesus Shaves, charismatic leader of Virtualia, has created a power vacuum in the streets of Maracas, capital city with a population of over 3 million people. The Virtualian Liberation Movement is exploiting this situation by organizing areas of the city against established authority, sabotaging civic services, and staging attacks on symbolic objective points. The local security force commander must contend with not only the urban guerrillas of the VLM but also private neighborhood armies and criminal gangs running amuck.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The crew always takes on a scenario of its choice.&#10;&#10;As in the basic game of Menara, the temple builders gather information and seek the advice of their fellow players before each game turn. Construction plan cards specify in what way temple floors are to be equipped with columns. The new rituals create new challenges; to meet these, players need well-conceived cooperation, clever statics, and steady hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Make your own set of rules. Choose from pre-set scenarios or mix the rules you like from a variety of new rules.&#10;&#10;5 new types of construction plan cards present you with new challenges.&#10;&#10;8 new temple floors of tricky shape want to be built into the tower. But each floor has its own rules, which can make the planning of your comrades much more difficult. Deal with temple floors of strange names like &quot;The Double Axe&quot;, &quot;The Wheel of the Five Winds&quot;, &quot;The Wedge Moon&quot;, &quot;The Bridge of Dangers&quot;, &quot;The Ring of Balance&quot;, &quot;The Wheel of Three Truths&quot;, &quot;The Thorn Moon&quot; and &quot;The Crescents of the Sun&quot;.&#10;&#10;The tears of the gods, red and blue crystal stones, want to be cleverly built into the tower before the temple is completed.&#10;&#10;The cards of fate determine the shapes of the temple floors you can expect in the course of the game. But by no means all future floors will be revealed to you immediately...&#10;&#10;13 rituals await you: For each game, you draw a ritual card, which changes the rules of the game and sometimes requires a completely different approach to the usual tasks.&#10;Play the rituals: &quot;THE ENLIGHTENMENT&quot;, &quot;THE DARK&quot;, &quot;THE BAN OF THE BLUE COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE CURSE OF THE GODS' TEARS&quot;, &quot;THE GRACE OF THE YELLOW COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE JINXED YELLOW COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE UNHOLY WHITE COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE THIN TIP&quot;, &quot;THE SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE&quot;, &quot;THE GLOWING RED COLUMNS&quot;, &quot;THE BALANCE OF FATE&quot;, &quot;THE NARROW BASE&quot;, and &quot;THE NARROW BASE&quot;.&#10;&#10;10 ready-made scenarios let you quickly set up a unique game.

Needing to refuel their vessel, the Dominators begin drilling into the surface of the planet, where they plan to fire their rockets into the molten core of Dulkis, then drop an atomic-powered seed pod which would turn the whole planet radioactive.&#10;&#10;When the Second Doctor, Jamie and Zoe arrive, they are unable to persuade the Dulcian leaders, who believe violence is never an option, to retaliate. Assisted by the rebellious native, Cully, the Doctor steals the seed pod from the drilling site, smuggling it on-board the departing Dominator ship. As it takes off, the pod explodes, destroying the alien invaders with their own weapon.&#10;&#10;This expansion adds Dominators to Doctor Who: Exterminate! The expansion includes two Dominators miniatures and three Quark miniatures, two Dominator and one Quark faction cards, and three new adventure cards to expand the Doctor Who: Exterminate! universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The multi-award-winning strategy game Hansa Teutonica is back in a Big Box edition including the base game and all expansions. In the game, players attempt to increase their standing as merchants in the Hanseatic League by gaining prestige points in various ways. For instance, they can try to establish a network of counting offices in new Hansa cities by occupying an entire trade route between two cities &mdash; but before that happens, player markers can also be displaced by other players. Players may also aim to develop their trading skills, improving their abilities throughout the course of play. With only two actions per turn and a variety of contested opportunities, every turn is equally quick and strategically demanding.&#10;&#10;Hansa Teutonica is a highly interactive strategy game as players block and push each other each turn, but it also gives cunning players the chance to put being blocked into an advantage. The game's many possible strategies can also be tested and perfected on the variant game boards of the beloved Hansa Teutonica: Britannia and Hansa Teutonica: East Expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a merchant, your goal in Age of Fairs is to accumulate the most reputation and money by giving your customers the best combination of change.&#10;&#10;Each round, players will be greeted by a new queue of customers. How these customers are treated will determine who will be the winner.&#10;&#10;There are many customers who pay for your wares with high value coins which, of course, need to be exchanged for change. By giving the best combination of change to the customer, your reputation will rise as customers walk away happy to be free of the annoyance of jangling coins in their pockets. If you give them too many coins, your reputation will fall as your customer is angry with the great weight of coins you've sent them away with.&#10;&#10;Though we live in a world with convenient electronic payment by credit card, much of the history of mankind has been faced with this problem: how to manage money held in hand.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#135;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#178;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#228;&#184;&#161;&#230;&#155;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#233;&#161;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#137;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#174;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#139;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#182;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#233;&#138;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#174;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#229;&#163;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#229;&#138;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Iris is a two player abstract strategy game that is played on a &quot;hexhex&quot; board (a hexagonal shaped board made with hexagonal cells).  An Iris board has rainbow colored perimeter cells and gray interior cells. Boards of sizes 5-8 cells per side are recommended.  (Size 5 is recommended for beginners.) Player 1 plays with black stones and Player 2 plays with white stones.&#10;&#10;On the very first turn, Player 1 plays a SINGLE black stone to any gray cell.  Thereafter, starting with Player 2 on his/her first turn, each player plays TWO stones per turn, subject to the following restrictions:&#10;&#10;1) If the first stone of a turn is played on a colored perimeter cell, then the second stone MUST be played on the corresponding same-colored cell on the opposite side of the hexhex board.  (In the case of a corner cell, the corresponding same-colored cell is the opposite corner cell.)&#10;&#10;2) If the first stone of a turn is played on a gray interior cell, then the second stone MUST be played on any empty non-adjacent gray cell.  (If all remaining empty gray cells are adjacent to the first stone, then the second stone is forfeited.)&#10;&#10;When the board is full or when both players consecutively pass, the game ends and players score their groups of stones.  A group&rsquo;s score is equal to the number of colored cells that it occupies.  The player with the highest scoring group wins. If scores are tied, then players ignore their highest scoring group, and compare the highest scoring of their remaining groups.  If still tied, then players compare their next highest scoring groups, etc., until the tie is broken.  (Despite there being an even number of colored cells, for subtle reasons having to do with board geometry, it turns out that draws are impossible.)&#10;&#10;(A note on the game's name: &quot;Iris&quot; was the Greek goddess of the rainbow.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Honors&#10;&#10;&#10;     Iris was a finalist in the Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game Contest of 2019&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monkey King Chess by Peter Gelman is a chess variant with a main board representing Earth and two small boards representing clouds, 44 squares total. In it, the Monkey King fights the Goblin King in a theme with oriental influences.&#10;&#10;The Earth board includes a river which influences play. Forces are asymmetrical, representing mythological forces including sea dragons, celestials and mountains.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for the Monkey King player is to move his Pilgrim off the opposite side of the board; a winning move would be any Pilgrim move from row 8 off the board. The object of the game for the Goblin King player is to checkmate the Pilgrim. As with Sittuyin (Burmese Chess), a move that causes stalemate is illegal.&#10;&#10;A piece requires the ability to fly to move to or from the Clouds. A few types of disk-faces have this ability. The ability to fly does not imply any additional movement ability or limitations. The fliers are: the six Monkey Kings, the two Goblin Generals, the two Lancers of each side, and the one Celestial of each side. Only a flier can fly to or from or across the Cloud squares. No piece may make a capture when they fly to or from a cloud. Furthermore, a disk may only fly to a cloud square from the magic river square associated with it. The disk may land on either of the two squares of that cloud, so long as that square is empty. No piece may make a capture when they fly to or from a cloud, including flight from one cloud to the other. A disk starting movement on a Cloud square must note the color of the square first; it may fly to any empty square on the Earth board of the same color, or the other Cloud&#194;&#146;s square of the same color if it is empty.&#10;&#10;Except for the disks that represent the Pilgrim and the Goblin King, all of the disks are two-sided, with a different chess piece showing on either side. If you start a turn with a disk standing on any magic river square, you may flip the disk and simultaneously move it according to that new game piece's abilities. To put it another way, a disk standing on a magic river square has the ability to move as the disk on either side of its two faces. A disk may not flip if it is not on magic river square.&#10;&#10;The Goblin King player cannot flip a disk if the Goblin King disk is not on Earth board (thus before initial placement, or after its capture, means the Goblin King player cannot flip disks). The Monkey King player cannot flip disks unless he/she has initially placed the Pilgrim disk on the board.&#10;&#10;The two sides' pieces start the game roughly, but not exactly symmetrical. For the most part, even when identical on the front side, Red and Blue disks flip for different transformations.&#10;&#10;There are twelve types of disks in the game: Pawn, Sea Serpent, Monkey King, Knight, Lancers, Goblin General, Whirling Monkey Fists, Celestial (a different type on each side), Goblin King, and Buddhist Pilgrim.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the boards empty. Starting with the Goblin King player, each player takes turn either introducing a disk on their half of the Earth board, or moving a disk they previously had placed. Players may not introduce disks in this manner on any Cloud square.&#10;&#10;The disks have a front and a back. Players may only place disks with the front side showing. The back side of the disks cannot appear unless the piece stands on a magic river square and flips it.&#10;&#10;All pieces that can capture move as they capture except the Sea Serpent. The Pilgrim and the Red Celestial cannot capture. Brave Whirling Monkey Fists is an off-board &#194;&#147;counter&#194;&#148;, not a normal type of chess piece. Its design intention is to help compensate for the helpless Pilgrim piece.&#10;&#10;The classic tale &quot;Journey to the West&quot; inspired the theme and function of this chess variant. Chess game influences include Sittuyin, Moscow King Chess, Shogi, and standard Western chess.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to raze the city in reprisal. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II.&#10;&#10;Game covers whole uprising, since the first to the last days of fights, giving players a chance to see if there was any way to win this possibly pointless battle. German player controls Whermacht, SS and eastern collaboration forces, while Polish player controls all the major underground resistance units as well as pro-soviet Polish People Army that tried to help the uprising.&#10;&#10;Game is drived by command points - each player has a limited number of these. Players spend command points to perform certain actions like movement, attack, resupply, introduce reinforcements, pacify, ruin or build the barrickades. There also cards depicting various events that happend throughout the uprising.&#10;&#10;",

In the west of the island of Sicily there lived a wolf (now extinct): the Canis Lupus Cristaldii, a large and fast, lethal blond wolf. This is true the story of a Wolf and a man who lived in the deep European Middle Ages: do you want to be part of it? Nebrodensis is the name of the Sicilian mountains and in this enchanted island the game develops on 8 abstract games 1vs1 (or 1vs2) or other in 8 solitaire games; symmetrical and asymmetrical, strategic and aleatory, german and american, nocturnal or diurnal, pushed into a psychological wood where only fangs and magic win. The only way to survive is to become an extinct Wolf or a magical Hermit really existed: do you accept the challenge or are you too afraid of the moon?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Unpredictable up to the last hand, Electoral College Combat combines strategy and chance as two players amass Electoral College votes while navigating Fake News, Russian collusion, recounts, celebrity endorsements, and swing states to become President of the United States.&#10;&#10;There are 56 cards:  50 state cards and Washington DC, whose value is reflected in their electoral vote count, and five wild cards.  28 cards are dealt to each player who take turns laying five cards face-down and sight unseen from the top of their stacks.  Each player turns over one card.  The player with the higher card can take that card and any other or the lower card and two of the remaining face-down cards.  Opponent gets the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;Electoral College Combat is designed to simulate the wild swings and uncertainties of election night.  A sound strategy--like a well-run campaign--does not guarantee results.  That's all part of the fun.  While not a gambling game, Electoral College Combat finds its roots in video slots/poker where the wild cards activate bonus rounds.&#10;&#10;Each wild card has specific rules.  A player who turns over a second wild card in the same hand wins the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;There are twelve hands.  In the 11th and 12th hands each player has only three cards remaining.  When their turn arrives, players must add two cards of the cards they've collected to their hand:  their highest card and another of their choice, shuffle the cards, and place them in front of their opponent.  Play continues as before. When play is concluded, the player with 270 or more electoral college votes wins the presidency.  2nd prize?  Hindsight and book deal.

Additionally, any player who holds a bureaucrat and has incorrectly called a bluff or has been called on a bad bluff can play the bureaucrat and override the call.  Whoever plays the bureaucrat redetermines the next card and plays it.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player discards every card while avoiding a valid call of bullshit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
