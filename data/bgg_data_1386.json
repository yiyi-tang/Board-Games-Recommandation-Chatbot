It is also well suited for adult team building.&#10;&#10;The game consists of:&#10;&#10;    6 beechwood blocks&#10;    1 bracket with metal rod&#10;    1 plate with 8 holes and 16 cords (each 2 metres long)&#10;&#10;&#10;For the Fr&ouml;bel Tower, a large outdoor or indoor play area is necessary.&#10;&#10;Object of the game&#10;The construction of the Fr&ouml;bel Tower is possible only by means of joint, coordinated action. The Fr&ouml;bel Tower can also be built in a competition between different groups.&#10;The group that can build the highest tower wins the game in this version.&#10;&#10;Preparation&#10;Form a circle and place the six beechwood blocks in the middle with the groove facing upwards.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Each player takes one or more cord ends in his or her hand, depending on the number of participants.&#10;The cords were previously passed through the 8 holes in the plate. Now you tighten the cords and try to hook the bracket into the groove of a wooden block, lift it up carefully and place it gently on another wooden block.&#10;It is important that you hold the cord only at the very end. It must not be shortened by reaching forward.&#10;&#10;Together you try to stack the wooden blocks on top of each other until the Fr&ouml;bel Tower is completed. You have won the game as a team if you manage to use all the wooden blocks and the tower does not fall over during the building work.&#10;When you hook in the bracket, this may cause a wooden block to fall over. Therefore, you should decide before the game starts whether this wooden block can be put back in place or whether it is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Game variants&#10;&#10;    The game is not over until you have dismantled the tower as a team.&#10;    You are not allowed to speak during the game. Naturally, this makes building the tower more difficult because you cannot give each other any instructions.&#10;    You are only allowed to guide the cord with one hand. This also adds another level of difficulty.&#10;    The most difficult way to build the tower is to guide the end of the cord with your &quot;weak&quot; hand. For right-handers it is the left hand, for left-handers the right hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Jealousy worms its way into the heart, and rots at the very soul of those who know these secret combinations.&#10;&#10;Those lucky few able to overhear their betters slip such forbidden knowledge during inebriated tales of past forays find themselves more than excited to let their soul wear away at the chance to even behold such monstrosities.&#10;&#10;Just like our Cross Promotion Pack, our Resin Lupercalia Kits from last year are now available in plastic. The Lupercalia 2021 Pack includes a plastic set of all seven of the miniatures we made in Resin from our last Kickstarter. This also includes their Item Cards, Combatant Cards, and Adventurer Cards.&#10;&#10;Profane Occultists Made Immortal&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Toxie scrubbed the blood from her hands, noting idly that she had nailed the color when choosing her crimson fingernail polish. In the far corner of the abandoned warehouse, a half dozen corpses, all still bound hand and foot, lay in a heap as testament to her night&rsquo;s labors. Her final victim lay sprawled on the concrete floor behind her, still breathing shallowly through his broken, twisted mouth. She hadn&rsquo;t actually been planning to pull out his teeth when she started questioning him, but then Luperci and Tixie had radioed in that they cleared the enemy&rsquo;s hideout, and that Mena was one of the captives they had freed. Threatening the Faun was one thing; dragging an innocent child into it was something else altogether.&#10;&#10;Toxie dried her hands gingerly, then turned around to consider her captive. He was definitely dying; even if someone found him now, there weren&rsquo;t enough surgeons or drugs on Earth to save him. But Toxie had to meet up with her pack to run down the last of the heathens who had escaped with the Faun, and she didn&rsquo;t like leaving jobs unfinished.&#10;&#10;She hunkered down next to him and saw with satisfaction that his eyes were still open, though only just through the swollen wreckage of his face. She blew him a kiss.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;You get a little mercy now,&rdquo; she crooned as she gently stroked a blood-free patch of skin on his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late for an orgy, so I can&rsquo;t really wait around for you to die. You know how it is. . .&rdquo; &#10;She turned to her gear bag and considered her options. She wanted to use her favorite, but, of course, it had to be the messiest of the lot and she had just finished cleaning up. Eh, what the hell, she thought. Grinning, Toxie grabbed the pink handle and turned back to finish the job.&#10;&#10;Outside the warehouse, an early morning train rumbled past, just loud enough to mask the roar of a chainsaw.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;This product contains 7 miniatures, Adventurers, Espers, and new Items.&#10;&#10;These new Espers spice your game with unknown variety by adding new Espers that can be summoned by both Adventurers&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player opens a 20-card booster pack, selects two cards from it, and then passes the pack to the player sitting next to them. They then pick two more cards from the pack they've been handed, and so on, going around the table until all cards are picked. This is repeated with a second booster pack, and again with a third, until everyone has picked a total of 60 cards. Players then choose a commander (or a commander/background pair, if the commander has the Choose a Background ability) from among the cards they drafted, add any number of basic lands, and build a 60-card deck matching the color identity of their commander(s). Then everyone shuffles up their decks and battles in a free-for-all! (A larger pod of drafters splits into two groups first.)&#10;&#10;The set is sold in draft boosters (individually or in displays of 24), set boosters (individually or in displays of 18), collector boosters (individually or in displays of 12), and bundles, as well as three-pack prerelease kits, which were made available a week in advance of the set's full release. In addition, four 100-card tie-in Commander decks were released alongside the main set.&#10;&#10;",

In the second, on the other hand, it won't hurt if you think a little ahead so that you end up where the most points are.&#10;&#10;GAME VARIANT: DICE STUDY&#10;&#10;For this variant you need one die and five chips or coins per person. The 12 Mondriaan cards are laid out in the center of the table in a 3x4 grid.&#10;&#10;One person rolls a number, while another randomly reveals one of the color cards, if possible at the same time. The two together determine what you need to look for in the cards.&#10;&#10;So, if there is a 6 and a red card, you have to look for a card that has six red color squares on it and quickly put one of your chips on it. Whoever succeeds first gets to discard the chip.&#10;&#10;Since each combination occurs exactly twice, you can also get rid of two chips per round. If you have no more chips, you win the game.&#10;&#10;GAME VARIANT: SPACE COMPOSITION WITH 6 COLORS&#10;&#10;For this variant you need two dice and three differently sized game pieces or markers per person, each in one color.&#10;&#10;The six color cards are placed face up on the table as a circle. The shuffled Mondriaan cards are distributed evenly to everyone.&#10;&#10;Take turns placing one marker on each color card. Never place two markers of the same size on the same card, but place several markers of the same size on the same card.&#10;&#10;When both dice are rolled, you take turns performing one of the following actions:&#10;-  place a card from your hand on a color card matching the value of a die (if you roll a 6, you can place a card with six red squares on the red color card)&#10;&#10;- place one of the upper Mondriaan cards already on the table on another color card, if the conditions there are right.&#10;&#10;- place one of your own point markers on another color card&#10;&#10;When a person puts down their last card, you calculate your points:&#10;For the color with the most cards on it you get three points, for the next two and then one.&#10;You then multiply these points by the values of your markers, from small to large with one to three.&#10;Whoever has the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, the isolation of the last war caused the corporation to wither, and the various outposts and colonies were eventually left to look after themselves. Some became true collectives, or limited democracies, while others have fallen to the rule of gangsters, warlords, and despots. In all cases, the limited resources of air and organic material has made life difficult.&#10;&#10;In this supplement for Stargrave, the crews must travel from asteroid-to-asteroid, and even down to the system's single, barely inhabitable planet, searching for a man who claims to have discovered a &lsquo;big score'. During their journey, players will fight through numerous different environments - including asteroid mines, zero gravity, and even hellish jungle. Captains must curry favour with the various small political factions that hold power in the Belt. Only through a combination of wits, diplomacy, and weapons can players hope to reach the last prospector and gain a share of his claim&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Battles are fought on two parallel boards: the harsh Illerian desert of the physical world, and the mystical and surreal badlands of the spirit world.  Characters exist in both worlds, and actions in one world often affect the other.  For example, characters can spend actions in one world to boost their counterpart, and killing a character in one world greatly harms them in the other.&#10;&#10;Illeria is a miniatures-agnostic game, in which you can play with any models you have.  It can be played as either a one-off game, or as part of an ongoing campaign.&#10;&#10;",

The belief that the bayonet and the massed charge of men and horses was mightier than machine guns and rapid firing field artillery, that stuck in the minds of the Generals and statesmen, even when proved wrong. The beginning of the 1914-1918 saw a &quot;mobile war&quot; of sort, a planned &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; of marching men and railway timetables that broke down. Could it have succeeded?  This game cannot give an answer, only a hint.&#10;&#10;Game includes 1 tabloid-size map, 3 pgs. of rules, 88 counters (unmounted), and charts. This appears to be a game taken from Combat magazine.

    "Description": "As with the other editions of Tick Tack Bumm (aka Pass the bomb), speed is the most important factor in the pocket version. Here, however, no bomb goes from hand to hand, but everyone always plays at the same time! The bomb at Tick Tack Bumm Pocket can be found on some of the cards to be turned on: In this category it is important to find a word as quickly as possible that contains the letter combination you are looking for. Poetry fans have the advantage of looking for a suitable rhyme word. And with the magnifying glass symbol, a word that matches the respective category is required. If you play fast-paced and with brains, you quickly get closer to the goal of first discarding all cards and thus winning the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You may stop at any point after moving at least one space.&#10;&#10;If, after banking off at least one edge, your disk lands on a space occupied by any other disk (even one of your own disks), capture that disk by replacement. At the end of the game, your score is the number of disks in each captured color multiplied.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The title means something like 'flower position'.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of seven cards in their own colour. Some cards are Warabe (children) and some are Ayakashi (weird). If a player can give away all their weird cards by the end, they win. Otherwise, points are calculated.&#10;&#10;Each card has a shadow half, and a bright half, on both sides of the card. So a player can look at another player's hand and see which cards are the bright side up and shadow side up. Players arrange their own hands at the start of the game, and cannot change this later.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all the cards in the player's hand are shadow side up.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to offer a card to another player, by drawing the card up a little in their hand. The player offered either takes it or declines it, but either way the card is now turned shadow side down, and cannot be offered away. If the card was taken, the player can place it anywhere they like in their hand. If declined, it stays in the same position as before and cannot be moved.&#10;&#10;Once every hand is shadow side down, the game ends. If a player has disposed of all their own Ayakashi cards, they win. Collecting Ayakashi cards from other players does not matter.&#10;&#10;Otherwise, players score points. +1 pt for Warabe cards, -1 or -2pts for Ayakashi cards. But if a Ayakashi cards is flanked by Warabe cards, it is worth zero. Then, the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for a 4 player game using two packs. In this case, it is played as a doubles game, with partners discussing their moves.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The Gallic tribes led by Vercingetorix were defeated by the army of Gaius Julius Caesar near Dijon and retreat to the city of Alesia, convinced to find in this fortress a safe position and the time necessary to regroup the troops and recover morale.&#10;&#10;Julius Caesar, sensing the intentions of the enemy, also takes advantage of the particular isolated position of the city, planning one of the most ingenious sieges in history. He built two rings of fortifications, one external and one internal, to defend himself at the same time from attacks from the city and from the tribes who came to the aid of the besieged. The walls were fortified with towers, ditches and traps and sanctioned the victory of the Romans over the Gauls.&#10;&#10;In The Walls of Alesia each of the two players takes the role of a Roman Legatus, commissioned by Caesar to supervise the construction of one of the two walls. Each one will have to take care of creating the most effective fortifications, hiring the necessary workers and deciding for each stretch whether to obtain immediate advantages from the palisades or to erect towers that will guarantee future advantages.&#10;&#10;There will be a high competition in this constructors' challenge, but during the match there will also be two coordinated assaults by the Gauls, in which the Legates will have to cooperate to limit the damage. At the end of the second assault, it will be verified who has obtained the most prestige in the eyes of Julius Caesar.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by a Duchy board that is placed in the Player board.&#10;&#10;",

It consists of 18 cards including new loot, plot, and enemy cards, and a new boss, Zogar himself!&#10;&#10;The Lonely Troll Inn This 18 card pack unlocks the ability to hire henchmen before you set off on an adventure. Simply pay some gold and they will tag along. Each one will provide different perks and each will have unique ways that their morale will drop. If they lose all their morale, they will leave, unless you pay them some more money. The provided 12mm die is used to track your henchmen's morale. This pack also includes a bunch of new trappings to equip your hero with!&#10;&#10;Beasts &amp; Burdens This 18 card pack introduces Afflictions! These nasty cards are gained in a number of ways and will cause the mechanics for play to change. Maybe you will suffer from gluttony and need to eat twice as much in between dungeon levels, or perhaps, you become plagued and start gaining poison at an alarming rate! This pack also includes a bunch of unique, and stronger, enemies to deal with and three mini-bosses that are actually plot cards!&#10;&#10;Realms &amp; Relics So you want more powerful items in Iron Helm? Now you get them! Artifacts are powerful relics that you can gain by spending blessing tokens when you are asked to draw a loot card. Spend the required blessing tokens and draw an artifact card instead! That is only half of this pack. It also introduces environment cards. These are drawn at the beginning of each dungeon level and they change the mechanics for that level. Maybe you are on the Shadow level and you are ambushed whenever an ambush card is drawn, even if it is the first card drawn! Or maybe you are in the Parched and all fire creatures are stronger.&#10;&#10;Random Encounters This includes four double-sided jumbo map cards to track what level of the dungeon you are on. Also included are three minis (Male Ranger, Female Warrior, and Male Wizard) to use to track your position. Random Encounters adds a new mechanic where your hero encounters something in between each level of the dungeon. Symbols on the map cards indicate what the player will run into. Maybe Bolda trap, or some mushrooms, or a nasty foe lurking in the shadows...&#10;&#10;Card Dividers This is not the sexiest addition, but these new dividers will keep your copy of Iron Helm nice and organized and sometimes order is sexy...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Masqueoca NAC wargames in its project to promote games with a national theme has been kind enough to include in its programme one with a hitherto unpublished and original theme, and as a Canarian designer it is a great satisfaction for me to present it.  Wood against Steel, The Conquest of the Canary Islands. Already the title gives us a small clue of the inequality in weaponry on the sides involved in this war.  The wooden and stone weapons of the Guanches against the iron and steel of the conquerors of the Crown of Castile. But make no mistake, even though it was a very unequal struggle, the conquest of the whole archipelago lasted no less than 94 years, practically a whole century of fighting, precisely in the 15th century, which is enough to show that it was not a military stroll. By way of comparison, the conquest of America took about 40 years. It should be noted that the clash between the indigenous Canary Islanders and the Castilian troops was brutal. &#10;This war involved the Canary aborigines, called Guanches, and the conquistadors, on the one hand sent by the Crown of Castile and on the other sent by the Crown of Portugal. Both kingdoms coveted control of these islands, which were so strategic in their overseas territorial expansion.&#10;&#10;It is a wargame for two players, where the Castilians slowly but continuously land on each of the 7 islands through the arrival of ships loaded with conquerors and the Guanches try by all means to stop and expel the newcomers to their earthly paradise. The game is played by secret and simultaneous orders and with the help of two decks of event cards, so the turns are a lot of fun and with variable strategy adapted to the moment.&#10;The battles are resolved on a Battle mat with special rules for mountain regions. There are also naval battles. The Castilian player wins if he has conquered the 7 Canary Islands in the last turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Masqueoca NAC wargames en su proyecto de fomento de juegos con tem&aacute;tica nacional ha tenido a bien incluir en su programa uno con tem&aacute;tica hasta ahora in&eacute;dita y original, y que como dise&ntilde;ador canario es una gran satisfacci&oacute;n para mi presentar.  Madera contra Acero, La Conquista de Canarias. Ya el titulo nos da una peque&ntilde;a pista de la desigualdad en armamento en los bandos implicados en esta guerra.  Las armas de madera y piedra de los guanches contra el hierro y acero de los conquistadores de la Corona de Castilla. Pero que no llame a enga&ntilde;o, aun siendo una lucha muy desigual, la conquista de todo el archipi&eacute;lago dur&oacute; nada menos que 94 a&ntilde;os, pr&aacute;cticamente todo un siglo de combates, precisamente el siglo XV,  ello es un indicador suficiente para entender que aquello no fue un paseo militar. Como comparaci&oacute;n la conquista de America dur&oacute; unos 40 a&ntilde;os. Se hace necesario destacar que el choque entre los ind&iacute;genas canarios y las tropas castellanas fue brutal. &#10;Esta guerra en la que intervinieron los abor&iacute;genes canarios, llamados guanches, y los conquistadores , por un lado enviados por la Corona de Castilla y por otro enviados por la Corona de Portugal. Ya que ambos reinos codiciaban el control de estas islas tan estrat&eacute;gicas en su expansi&oacute;n territorial de ultramar.&#10;Es un wargame para dos jugadores, donde el castellano mediante la llegada lenta pero continua de barcos cargados de conquistadores va desembarcando en cada una de las 7 islas y los guanches intentan por todos los medios frenar y expulsar a los reci&eacute;n llegados a su para&iacute;so terrenal. Se juega mediante ordenes secretas y simultaneas y con la ayuda de dos mazos de cartas de eventos , con lo cual los turnos son muy divertidos y con estrategia variable adaptada al momento. Las batallas se resuelven en un mapa de batalla anexo con reglas especiales para las regiones monta&ntilde;osas. Tambi&eacute;n hay batallas navales.&#10;El jugador castellano ganar&aacute; si en el ultimo turno ha conquistado las 7 islas canarias.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "STEPS GAMES are fun and exciting games in which players build structures by throwing wooden plates, called Stepses, onto a platform. The first player to get rid of all their Stepses is the winner!&#10;&#10;Sound easy? It's not!&#10;One does not simply put Steps on the structure.&#10;&#10;You should throw it in a way, so that it touches the opponent's Steps when landing.&#10;&#10;You need a strategy that works for you but against your opponents, one that you will constantly need to adjust during the game.&#10;&#10;The winner must apply physics, engineering, logic, strategy, and a little bit of luck. All of which are useless without a well-aimed throw.&#10;&#10;It is an utterly unpredictable game where you won&rsquo;t know if your next throw will work until you try it.&#10;&#10;You and your friends won't be bored while playing the game!&#10;&#10;The basic principle of the game is to keep the structure upright on your turn but unstable enough that it collapses on an opponent&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;There are six types of Stepses (for example rectangular) with different weights, sizes, and colors. The variations in size and weight mean that each type of Steps behaves differently when played.&#10;&#10;Want to add a personal touch to the game?&#10;&#10;You can have your name, motto, company name, or logo engraved on the Steps!&#10;&#10;For a spectacular victory, take your Personal Steps and throw it with a flip so that it lands with your name up&#10;&#10;This is how a Stepsman wins the game!&#10;&#10;Play for any Company: Have fun with friends &amp; colleagues, play with your family. It is interesting for children too, you can even play Solo!&#10;If you play alone, you need to throw all the Stepses from the set on the playing board so that not a single Steps falls out of it.&#10;&#10;If at least one falls out, improve your skills and start again!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Golden Animal is an auction game for 3 to 5 players where you try to attract golden animals, such as cheetahs, giraffes, and lions - though also elephants, zebras, and rabbits.&#10;&#10;A deck of cards is used for both what you are bidding on and what you may bid with. The auction is broken into three simultaneous lots: a mountain area, a river area, and an in-between area (though these are referential only, and not thematic.)&#10;&#10;Players program their bids for each of the three areas, by arranging the cards in their hand.  The highest bid for each area will take a card, followed by the next highest bid.&#10;&#10;If a player wins food cards or rabbits, these are placed face up in front of a player.  If a player wins a rock card, it is added to their hand.  If a player wins a gold card, it can be discarded or swapped for another card in their hand.&#10;&#10;After the auction, the player return the cards they used in the previous round to their hand (allowing for any additions or exchanges from the rock and gold cards), new cards are added to the areas, and the game play repeats.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds, the players compare who has the most in each of the three food types, and golden animal cards are awarded.  Players add the points collected from those to points (both positive and negative) on other cards in their hand, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;GOLDEN ANIMAL

Everyone looks at their story card and writes the first (in later rounds, next) sentence for the story. They read it aloud and players vote with cards (0 to 3 points) for the best sentence (including their own). The sentence that gets the highest score will be written in the storybook. The player who wrote this sentence scores 3 points, everyone else scores as many points as the number they assigned to the winning player.&#10;&#10;Keep writing the story this way, eventually using all the number cards. (For a shorter game, only certain numbers are used.) The player with the most points total wins, but of course it's the story that you've written together that matters.&#10;&#10;",
