    "Description": "The Alaska-class fell midway between a heavy cruiser and a battleship, and the United States Navy considered these vessels large cruisers rather than battlecruisers. &#10;They were designed as cruiser-killers, tasked with destroying post-Washington Treaty heavy cruisers. As a result, they were given 12-inch guns, significant armour protection, and could travel at up to 33 knots. They resembled current generation battleships in appearance, with the familiar two forward, one aft main battery turrets, massive columnar mast and a multitude of 5-inch dual purpose guns along the sides of the superstructure. However, they were built to cruiser standards, lacking the armoured belt and torpedo defence of capital ships.&#10;&#10;Commissioned late into the war, USS Alaska saw limited service. &#10;Operations included those off Iwo Jima and Okinawa in early 1945, such as anti-aircraft defence in carrier task forces and shore bombardment. &#10;After the war, she participated in the Korean occupation. &#10;She was decommissioned in February 1947.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the largest battleships ever built. &#10;Based superficially on the South Dakota-class, the USS Iowa had heavier armour and was 200 ft. longer. It was also incredibly fast, due to increased output from the engines, and its greater size allowed it to mount more anti-aircraft guns, making it a formidable prospect for attacking planes. Invariably used as flagships for task forces, the Iowa-class was also supremely equipped to act as escorts for the fast carrier fleets of the Pacific.&#10;&#10;During World War Two, USS Iowa transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic to Algeria, bound for the conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in 1943. &#10;Transferred to the Pacific fleet the following year, her operations including the preparatory shore bombardments at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and the screening of carriers around the Marshall Islands. &#10;She was present for the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay, serving as the flagship of the Third Fleet under Admiral William F. Halsey. &#10;She would go on to serve in the Korean War before being decommissioned into the &ldquo;mothball fleet&rdquo;. &#10;Reactivated in 1984 in efforts to counteract the expanding Soviet Navy she was finally decommissioned after 19 total years of active service in 1990. Today she serves as the USS Iowa Museum at the Port of Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Abandoned by her crew, she was sunk by an encroaching force of Japanese Destroyers &ndash; her sinking marked the last US fleet carrier to have been sunk by enemy action.&#10;&#10;Of the Yorktown-class aircraft carriers, built in a series of three, only the USS Enterprise survived the war, with the USS Yorktown sunk during the Battle of Midway. &#10;The USS Enterprise went on to become the most frequently decorated US carrier of the war, even earning the British Admiralty Pennant, the only ship outside of the Royal Navy to do so. &#10;She was finally put out of action in 1945 by a kamikaze attack that severely damaged the hanger deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players will now need to strategically plan their hero movement and placement.&#10;    2. Friendly Fire : Powerful abilities have been tweaked - in general, heroes can no longer unleash a skill without a care in the world : swinging their sword at their allies will cause significant damage! The addition of friendly fire means that hero position, skill choice and energy expenditure decision is now even more strategic!&#10;    3. Players may no longer swap items at any time during their phase. Swapping items from the inventory to the hero board can now only be done during the &quot;take a breather&quot; phase, at the end of a hero turn.&#10;    4. Energy token management : Energy tokens can now be used to recharge a skill. This adds another level of strategy to the energy token management. Do you recharge a skill, or save the energy to unleash another skill?&#10;    5. The concept of Line of Sight has been added to the game&#10;    6. Terrain elements have been properly incorporated into the game. There are more strategic decisions to be made around these elements, such as Shrubs, Magic Barriers, altars and monoliths.&#10;&#10;Spawn Rate and Yokai Difficulty level&#10;    1. Yokai Spawn rate has been modified , there is now the normal mode (harder), and an easy mode.&#10;    2. Additionally, each spawn point will now spawn a yokai each turn, unless specified otherwise by the scenario conditions&#10;    3. Yokais attributes, attack and defense stats have been tweaked and modified.&#10;&#10;Additional changes&#10;    1. Heroes no longer receive treasure tokens for defeating a Yokai, unless specified by scenario conditions. Treasures must be earned!&#10;    2. Skills or Abilities have been completely revamped. Each Hero now begins their adventure with a limited number of skills, and are able to purchase more powerful skills with the victory points (experience) they gained during their adventures.&#10;&#10;Download the new rules here:&#10;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Swi9sXRXel9ejZ9PeCtpSLnqe9udPNs?usp=sharing&#10;&#10;New campaing on kickstarter, suscribe in:&#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zenitminiatures/yokai-quest-strikes-back&#10;&#10;",

In Farms &amp; Factories: Inventions, everyone has a chance to change the world and maybe score a few points along the way.&#10;&#10;In Farms &amp; Factories: Inventions (as in Farms &amp; Factories) players draw and play Action &amp; Building cards from a communal deck until it runs out of cards. Inventions adds a new card type, Tech, which is shuffled into a separate deck at the beginning of the game. Unlike with Actions or Buildings, a player must patent a Tech before it can be played by discarding cards from their point pile. This means each Tech requires careful analysis to decide if it will pay off in the lost points. Tech cards are very powerful however, with lasting effects that can be used as soon as they are played, and often shape a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;In additional to 30 unique Techs, Farms &amp; Factories: Inventions adds 35 new Buildings and Actions, adding complexity and strategical depth to the original game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

So he called together all of the McClains and proposed a game as a last test to see the worthiness of those he deemed had potential. But someone in the family had other ideas. During the family get-together, the McClain&rsquo;s oldest and most prized possession, a medallion bearing the household&rsquo;s coat of arms, was stolen.

    "Description": "In Prime Ordeal, two or more players take turns drafting armies from a &quot;Spawning Pool&quot; (a face-up collection of Creature and Bonus cards that all players have access to) to get ready for battle. Each creature has a Power Level, represented by a single number. These numbers are added together to form a player's Total Power Level when battling. As the game progresses, so does each player's army and Total Power Level.&#10;&#10;To draft (referred to as &quot;Create&quot; in game), players discard combinations of Prime cards from their hands into the Prime card discard pile. Each Creature or Bonus card features a Creation Cost, specifying the combination of Prime cards necessary to create it. The Creation Cost may feature any combination of the following Prime card types: Bug, Sea, Bird, Reptile, Mammal, and Amphibian. Creatures themselves have types that directly correspond to their Creation Cost.  Players are encouraged to collect creatures that share types to increase synergy and for better chances at acquiring Bonus cards.&#10;&#10;After each player takes a turn Creating, the round concludes with a mandatory, free-for-all style battle. Each player's Power Level is compared and those with the highest or tied for highest Power Level win the battle, while each other player loses a Life.&#10;&#10;Players draft in between each battle and the game continues until only one player remains with any Life. The amount of Life chosen before the game will determine how long a game lasts. It is recommended to start players at 7 (short game), 11 (medium-length game), or 13 Life (long game).&#10;&#10;This strategic, card-based brawler features a modular design.  The core set, Genesis, functions as a standalone game.  Players may purchase expansions and shuffle them directly into the core set to change the game entirely. Groups may decide on which expansions to include and which to omit for a customizable gaming experience. Prime Ordeal is traditionally played as a free-for-all; however, its design accommodates team play as well.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The aim is to come up with clues that other players will be able to SYNK with you without the cardholder figuring it out.  When you've thought of your SYNK! word propose the definition to all players. If another player thinks they know you lock eyes, countdown from 3 and... SYNK! If the two players guess correctly then the next letter of the secret word is revealed. Now all players need to think of a word that starts with the first AND SECOND letter of the secret word. However if the cardholder also guessed the SYNK! word then it's back to square one. The game continues until a player thinks they know the secret word.&#10;&#10;If a round comes to a halt with players struggling to figure out the secret word, then the cardholder must reveal its definition. The first player to think they know the answer must then shout &ldquo;SYNK!&rdquo;. If a player is able to either correctly SYNK! the secret word with another player or guess the word from the definition they win the round. If players SYNK! or guess incorrectly the cardholder wins. First player to win three cards is the victor and gets full bragging rights - until the next game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The battles on the network aren't fought with soldiers, they're fought with runners: hackers who compete over lucrative data servers, filled with corporate secrets.&#10;&#10;Black Hats is a head-to-head skirmish-sized tactics game. Players take turns commanding their runners, spending crypto to support them with cards from a custom-built cyberdeck, and hacking the network upon which you play. There are dozens of runners and cards to choose from in deck building, allowing you to craft a strategy that feels unique to you and your crew.&#10;&#10;The tactical core of the game revolves around the hacking mechanic. Territory on the board is defined by connecting groups of same-colored hexes into &quot;subnets,&quot; but both players can change the color of any space at any time, reshaping the board as you play. An enemy that sits across the board may be absolutely unreachable or just a single space away and, if you can outsmart your opponent, you control which.&#10;&#10;Hire your crew, customize your cyberdeck, and hack your way to an early retirement. This is Black Hats!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One more card is placed face up on the table, as a starter for the neighborhood.&#10;- In your turn, you must lay down a card from your hand that correctly connects to at least one other card on the table.&#10;- There are a few special cards that make other players get a punishment (extra cards).&#10;- First player to get rid of all their cards wins the round, and gets the points from other players&rsquo; cards.&#10;- After several rounds, the winner is the first player to get to 200 points. For a quick filler you can also play without scoring, just to see who wins the round.&#10;&#10;Suburbs! can be played from 2 to 10 players.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

A round begins with the first player prepping one of the alien decks and dealing each player one card. The card you get is your alien card for the round, and is kept secret from other players.&#10;&#10;Players go around the table once, making a noise they think their alien might make. This is their clue to other players what alien they have. Then players simultaneously begin making their alien noises, during which each player decides to either pair up with another player by fist bumping them, or not pair up. When all players are ready to proceed, players reveal their alien cards.&#10;&#10;Players score points based on how they paired up, with maximum points awarded to pairs of players who were alien partners and to single players who did not pair up and didn't have their partner in play. The player with the most points at the end of 6 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Subjective interpretations and the chance of a devious Mimic being in play makes commitment risky, and surprising misunderstandings are common.

As you play, the totals on the dice, when you have rolled them, tell you where to move. The squares on which you land tell you what to do (for example, penalty of &quot; holding&quot; -you go to the penalty box for two turns).

There are 5 rabbits to choose from. On setup of the game the player will choose to either be the Farmer, Thief, Gambler, Tax Collector, or Insurance Broker. Each rabbit has their own special ability.  There are three piles of cards (Farm, Steal, and Rabbit Hole).  You start off with 24 cards in each deck, any extra cards will be removed from the decks and placed in the box. Thirty carrots per player will be used to create the Harvest.&#10;&#10;A player's turn will consist of the following:&#10;1. Remove any Closed Tokens that were put into play on their last turn.&#10;2. Receive any carrots via farming or banking. If a player cannot receive any carrots they will receive 1 carrot from the harvest.&#10;3. The player will complete one of the following.&#10;A. Purchase a Farm Card (Cost 0 carrots)&#10;B. Purchase a Steal Card (Cost 1 Carrot)&#10;C. Purchase a Rabbit Hole Card (Cost 3 Carrots) Rabbit Hole Cards may be played at anytime during the player's turn.  The only exception to this rule is if the card has a carrot with a lightning bolt and or a rabbit with a fire on its head.&#10;D. Gamble&#10;E. Bank *Note if more than 4 carrots were banked on the player's last turn, they may not bank this turn.&#10;&#10;If one of the card piles or the Harvest gets depleted, this will trigger the end game. Any Rabbit Hole cards left will be counted as 2 carrots unless card otherwise specifies.  The player with the most carrots wins. In the event of a tie, the player who took their final turn earlier will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

This challenge is complicated by the deck containing eight cards each of numbers 1-7, with half the cards being red and half blue &mdash; which means almost every set of eight cards will sum to more than 10!&#10;&#10;The trick is that certain combinations of cards are worth less than their face value:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Three cards of the same color and number = 0&#10;    Three red cards in sequence are worth only the highest number in the sequence, so a red 345 = 5.&#10;    Three blue cards in sequence are worth only the lowest number in the sequence, so a blue 345 = 3.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of eight cards. On a turn, draw a card from the deck, then (if you don't have a sum of 10) discard a card in a row in front of you; alternatively, you can pick up the discarded card of the player before you, add two cards from your hand to this card, play it beside you as a special sequence (a &quot;get&quot;), then discard a card. The cards in that &quot;get&quot; cannot be altered for the remainder of this deal, but they still count as being in your hand toward the desired sum of 10.&#10;&#10;When someone does reach a sum of 10, whether by drawing a card or picking up a discarded card, the round ends, with players scoring points based on the combinations they've made and certain conditions in their hand. Having only one 7 in hand is worth 1 point, for example, as is having four red and four blue cards, whereas having all cards of one color or two triples are each worth 3 points. You also score points for being the one to end the round.&#10;&#10;Play enough rounds so that each player starts a hand twice, then whoever has the most points wins. Alternatively, if a player collects a &quot;God Ten&quot; &mdash; that is, all eight 2s or all eight 5s, each of which sums to 10 &mdash; they win the game instantly!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Go Adventure is a family-friendly card game that was inspired by one of the game creators going out on 'adventures' with his son. Sometimes their adventures didn't always go as planned. This hard-learned lesson to pack appropriately gave way to inspire children to also think creatively about going out on adventures. The objective of the game is to fully &ldquo;pack&rdquo; the required items needed to go on eight different adventures. The gameplay is simple and straightforward. The cards are brightly colored and cheery. Laughter will certainly ensue.&#10;&#10;Players can only play one card during their turn but they have four choices of card type to play. They can play a Required Item card on an adventure thereby 'packing that item'. If the player places the last required item needed to be packed for an adventure, then they get to keep that adventure card pile. This drives the primary objective of the game. The remaining choices purely drive the fun secondary elements of the game. A player can use a Skip-a-Turn card thereby skipping the next player in order. A player can use a Funny Action card, which forces someone in the group to do something fun and silly that relates to the adventure themes. Lastly, a player can use a Random Item card, which can be placed on any of the adventures but the player must make up a story about how that item will be used on the specific adventure. This adds a fun storytelling element to the game. Gameplay continues until all eight adventures have been fully &ldquo;packed&rdquo; for and the winner is the player with the most completely packed adventure piles in their possession.&#10;&#10;Go Adventure is unique in its mission to get kids thinking about what adventure means to them as well as what needs to be packed to go on adventures. The gameplay is quick, around fifteen minutes, and the storytelling element will continue to provide exciting replayability for families. Any extra inspiration kids and parents find to get out there and go on new adventures is free of charge!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
