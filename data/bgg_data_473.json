In the summer of 1941, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini dispatched a corps of three divisions to fight alongside the Germans in their invasion of the Soviet Union. The CSIR arrived at the front in August and soon engaged in combat with the Red Army.&#10;&#10;Fronte Russo brings background articles and scenarios covering these crack troops and their battles to the Panzer Grenadier game system. It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front to play most of the scenarios, and Road to Berlin to play all of them. This is a book supplement complete with a full set of die-cut and mounted counters, much like Sinister Forces and East of Suez.&#10;&#10;Scenarios take place on the Eastern Front. The Italian divisions sent to Russia &mdash; the Pasubio and Torino infantry divisions and Duca d&rsquo;Aosta cavalry division &mdash; were well-trained units of the regular army, though not well equipped by most standards. Background articles place the scenarios in the full context of the Italian war in Russia.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This version of baseball was produced in 1941 by Milton Bradley. It is a physical dexterity game that uses a thick cardboard bat about 3.4&quot; long, with a wood semi-circle glued to the underside about 1/3 in from the handle, and with a small hole near the tip of the bat. There are 8 small glass balls, 4 white and 4 black. The cardboard playing field is inset into the box bottom, and is punched with a variety of holes.&#10;&#10;The rules on the side of the box say that when batting, a player puts the bat about 2&quot; from the home-plate corner of the box, mounts a ball of his color on the hole in the bat, and then brings down his finger with a sharp blow to the bat handle. This launches the ball up and onto the playing field. Falling into one of four large oblong holes around the pitcher's mound is a strike. Dropping into the round hole near each fielder  is an out. Dropping into any of the numbered holes is a safe hit of that many bases. There is a home run hole in deep center field. If a launched ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a ball. Three strikes cause an out, while four balls of course generate a walk. Successful hits are marked by putting balls into holes on the appropriate bases before batting again.&#10;&#10;The game can be found listed in &quot;Baseball Games from Antique Baseball to Modern Baseball Sims&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Giog uses Xiangqi Pieces but no board.  All players help to scramble the 32 pieces face down and distribute the pieces evenly to themselves.  If the number of players is three, the winner of the previous game or a volunteer receives 12 pieces and the other two players receive 10 pieces each.  Like a Mahjong game, each player arranges his/her pieces into one line with half of the pieces on top of the other half.&#10;&#10;Play is very similar to the Western card game 'Hearts', inasmuch as players reveal pieces in turn and whoever has the highest ranking piece being the winner.  Should there be a tie among some players, they apply the same procedures again by revealing more lower pieces until the order is finally determined.&#10;&#10;The player who played the strongest combinations of a same type (as what the round-starter played) wins that round.  If there is a tie, the round-starter always wins, or the order of players determines the winner.  For example, if the first and fourth player play the same combinations, first player wins unless fourth player is the round-starter.  The winner of a round collects the won pieces and starts a new round.  The game is played until all pieces are exhausted.  The game will go to the player who wins most pieces.&#10;&#10;Other versions of this game are known as S&#196;&#129;nb&egrave;i q&iacute; (&#228;&#184;&#137;&#229;&#128;&#141;&#229;&#133;&#182;: triple game), D&#199;&#142; q&iacute; lu&ograve; (&#230;&#137;&#147;&#230;&#163;&#139;&#230;&#145;&#158;: playing chess stacks), Ch&#196;&#147;l&uacute;n q&iacute; zh&agrave;n (&#232;&#187;&#138;&#232;&#188;&#170;&#230;&#163;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#176;: wheel chess battle) or J&#197;&#171; m&#199;&#142; p&#196;&#129;o (&#232;&#187;&#138;&#233;&#166;&#172;&#229;&#140;&#133;): chariot-horse-cannon, which is one of the noble three-piece combinations) or Sang Krip.

If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&#10;&#10;Based on the Dream Works film Shrek 3.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: 'Merlin Card' When you play this card you call out a color of your choice.

Like poker, the goal is to have the highest-ranked hand after several rounds of wagering, although the exact rules differed among numerous regional variants (this too, is much like poker). The game is played with a standard deck, with the 8's, 9's, and 10's removed.&#10;&#10;From lowest to highest, the four-card Primero hands are as follows:&#10;- Numerus: Two or three cards of any suit. Only the cards from the strongest suit are scored.&#10;- Primero: One card from each suit.&#10;- Supremus: Ace, 6, 7, of one suit (this is the highest-scoring Numerus, but counts as a superior hand).&#10;- Fluxus: Four cards all of the same suit.&#10;- Chorus: Four of a kind.&#10;&#10;Some variations exclude the Supremus or Chorus. Ties are resolved by the total value of the scored cards in the hand.&#10;&#10;",

The questions are difficult enough so that no one is expected to know the correct answer, but everyone is required to &ldquo;take a wild guess&rdquo;.  The person reading the question competes against the other players, who work together to arrive at a consensus answer. The interaction between the other players generates conversation and laughter and often a reasonably close guess. Points are awarded to those that are closest to the exact answer and to any answer that falls on or within the &ldquo;margin of correctness&rdquo; (50% either side of the exact answer).&#10;&#10;There are five categories animals, 19th century America, science, military, and the 21st century.&#10;&#10;Sample Question:&#10;During the last Ice Age's coldest stage (approximately 18,000 years ago), the average temperature in what is now Kansas was how may degrees Fahrenheit colder than today?&#10;&#10;The correct answer is 18 degrees.&#10;&#10;If the reader was closer than the consensus answer of his opponents he receives 1 point for each player. If the consensus answer was closer each player, except the reader, receives 1 point.&#10;&#10;Bonus points are awarded if the closest answer falls within the specified margin of correctness. For this question the margin of correctness is 9 degrees to 27 degrees.&#10;&#10;",

Each such monster's body can then hold a variable number of heads, limbs and tails (i.e. the blob cannot have a head but can have up to 8 limbs and tails).  Each body also provides a special power different from other monsters.  Players bid for different cards of body parts, each provides additional powers for your monster.&#10;&#10;Players start with 12 dice to allocate among their monster's body parts.  The dice indicate the amount of power available to each body part and how much damage it can take.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn they can choose to attack with one of their body parts (i.e. laser beams from the head, pincer claw limbs, etc.) rolling the dice from that body part.  The player targets an enemy monster's body part, hits cause damage that remove dice from that body part.  When a body part runs out of dice it is destroyed.  When a monster loses all of its dice it is destroyed.  Different powers allow players to reallocate dice and recover dice.&#10;&#10;",

But if delayed at a city they stomp about in frustration and cause great damage. True to the ideals of collectible monster games, the monsters enjoy fighting each other and grow in size with each victory. Moreover, the theme of collectible monster games also led the mad scientists to create three colors of monsters, each of which has an advantage against another.&#10;&#10;The game is easy to learn and quick to play. Two playing boards are included: a chart makes learning the game simpler, while a map of Japan is prettier to use.

    "Description": "The game uses a 6x6 grid as the main playing area. Each player receives a bunch of little plastic pieces and 2 large ones (gnome crystals) with an irregular shape.&#10;&#10;The object is to score the most points by the time the game ends, which happens immediately when someone runs out of pieces to play. A point is scored by having a straight or diagonal arrangement of three crystals of the same color, and a large crystal as part of such an arrangement scores 2 points instead of 1. A line of 4 crystals scores twice, once for each &quot;end&quot; of the row.&#10;&#10;The game is played by rolling two dice, one for each side of the grid (rows and columns). After rolling the dice, the player places them on the appropriate row and column that matches the die face. Then the player can place a crystal in any empty location on either the row or column indicated. They can also choose to &quot;combat&quot; another player's crystal on the specific intersection of the rolled dice. Combat involves a simple die-off, defender wins ties, with a large crystal providing a +1 bonus to the roll.&#10;&#10;Finally, if a player rolls doubles and is able to place a crystal on the intersection (say row 3 and column 3), then they get to roll again.&#10;&#10;",
