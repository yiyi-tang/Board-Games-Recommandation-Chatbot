Are you finding it hard to get new plants to take root and grow? You may think these are signs that insects or bad soil quality are at work but I must warn you it could be a sign something far more sinister is at work. Something you may have heard of. Faeries! There are those who want you to believe faeries are these cute, harmless little winged people who are only curious about humans. That belief could not be farther from the truth. Fairies are nothing more than selfish little addicts, whose sole desire in life is to suck the life right out of your garden. What you don't know is that a beautiful well tended garden is a place of magic and magic is what the evil little creatures are addicted to.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Bad Faeries, the game of faerie combat. In Bad Faeries each player controls a mob of faeries fighting over a magical garden and the right to drain that garden of its life giving magic.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;Players build a mob of 200 points worth of fays, such as Brownie, Pixie, Leprechaun, Goblin, Nymph, etc.  Each fay type is rated for six attributes: Flit, Nimbleness, Wards, Wariness, Smacks, Being, and has a given cost.  A mob can be of mixed types, and you may have Brownies facing Brownies.&#10;&#10;Once your mob is assembled, give them weapons and magic abilities.  The mobs then meet in combat to determine who rules the Garden.  Rules are provided for movement, ranged, melee and magical combat, wounds, terrain, morale and victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blitzkrieg, by Diffraction Entertainment, is a MONSTER wargame to end all monster wargames. The map of Europe is phenomenal in its size, detail, and accuracy. It uses a scale of 1 hex is 15 miles! There are over 4,000 counters!!! It includes land, air, and naval units. As a bonus, the game can be broken down into smaller mini campaigns, very helpful when you haven't the table area for the full map!!! I was privileged to talk in detail with John Bannerman, one of the designers.&#10;&#10;This is part of the blurb from the game's web site.&#10;&#10;4480 counters covering the ground, naval and air forces of (in order of &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;): Germany, Poland, Great Britain and The Commonwealth, France, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  These are supported by a meticulously researched Order of Battle for the first year of the Second World War and include additional details for the United Kingdom and Germany until June 1941.&#10;&#10;17 map sections (14&rdquo; x 21&frac12;&rdquo;) for a total of 35 sq ft of maps from North Cape to Bologna and Brest to Minsk at 15 miles per hex.  Laid out, the maps occupy an area of approximately 7&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; and have been created using digital mapping software developed in-house by Diffraction Entertainment.  Maps have been painstakingly digitised from period topographical maps in the 1:250,000 to 1:300,000 range.&#10;&#10;The extensive Rule Set has been devised from the start as a standard for the entire game series including a framework for an exhaustive set of Political and Economic rules defining each nation&rsquo;s operational parameters and special cases.  By the last game in the Second World War Series, these will have evolved into a detailed production model allowing players to explore different strategic options for the major combatants.&#10;Multiple modules covering Poland (Stab in the Back), Scandinavia (Operation Weser&uuml;bung), France 1940 plus The Battle of Britain (War in the West), and of course, Blitz!, a grand module to link all these together to cover the first year of the Second World War.&#10;Ground unit values are derived from OLI formulas originally devised by Trevor N Dupuy, a methodology that allows many different weapon systems to be consistently rated then summed using the ground unit&rsquo;s TO&amp;E to give a theoretical operational combat value.  Differences in national capabilities of training, leadership, communications and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; factors are simulated using a Combat Effectiveness Value (CEV) for each nation which is then used as a multiplier to the basic unit combat value.  CEV evolves for each nation during the war showing increasing competence for Allied forces and, after initial increases due to combat experience, a decreasing capability for German forces as manpower and unit TO&amp;E&rsquo;s degrade in capability.&#10;&#10;Naval units down to destroyers are shown as individual ship counters with lesser ships and submarines depicted as flotillas.  Major liners also have individual counters so as to denote their special high-speed capabilities for transporting personnel.  The naval system utilises a naval zone approximately 75 miles wide superimposed on the 15 mile hex grid so that the unique properties of naval and air-sea interaction can be modelled simply but still keep the essential flavour of naval operations with brief bursts of high intensity operations.&#10;Air Units are sized so that half units are available for carrier operations and have been rated by a bespoke system taking in to account a large number of performance parameters.  To reflect the attritional nature of air operations, air replacements are required to be expended just to keep forces in operation in addition to replacing combat losses.  Emphasis has been placed in the rules to encourage historical missions rather than wholesale commitment of airpower to offensive and defensive close air support.&#10;&#10;",

Repeated tragedies at the Acadamy have made people aware that the legend of the existence of the 'Witch of the Acadamy' may indeed be true.&#10;&#10;To get rid of the witch, 5 members of academy start the research about the  legend of the Witch.&#10;&#10;The aim of the members of this group  is to find and to get rid of the witch.&#10;&#10;By the way, the legend also says that the witch can transform into whomever the witch has killed.&#10;&#10;This means there is always a question about,  if one of the research members is already a witch.&#10;  &#10;Humans have their own magic which is different from magic users from far beyond the beginning of the academy. This magic is called &quot;information&quot;...&#10;&#10;The frightful magic of the 'Witch of the Academy' can celebrate the murderer as a saint, and can execute a bonny innocent  girl as a witch.&#10;&#10;About this game&#10;&#10;You become one of the 5 possible characters, and by gathering information about the witch, you try to contribute to the research and to become the most reliable character.&#10;&#10;Also you must pay attention to the possibilities that one of the members is actually a witch, you may point out a member as a witch.&#10;&#10;(In this game, you must discard a field card and take a field card.)&#10;&#10;Discarded character card gives you information, while you point out a character as a witch by taking cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;To tell the truth, there may be no witch amongst the members of the group. However, a character who is pointed out as being the witch may lose the trust of the rest of the players in the game and  may be executed.&#10;&#10;So it is important to gather information, but at the same time it is important to cast doubt on the other characters by spreading witch rumors, or by trying to avoid being accused of being the witch yourself.  The winner is the person who survives the swirling eddy of information and misinformation surrounding the Witch Distrubance.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;Anarchy may be described as a fast and furious parody of trick-taking games, the point being that you all play at once instead of going through the laborious and time-consuming process of taking turns - which of course is undemocratic, conferring an unearned privilege on whoever goes first, and being therefore suitable only for the decadent entertainment of a hierarchic-&eacute;litist society.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a card and then they are all flipped at the same time. The player with the highest card of each suit wins the other cards of that suit that were also played during that hand. If there is only one of a suit, it is compared to the other individual cards and the player with the highest card collects them all.&#10;&#10;At the start of the turn, you must decide what you are playing for. You can try and simply collect the most cards or go for a specific color, suit or the least amount of cards. The more specific you option the more points you get at the end of the round, which occurs once all cards have been played.&#10;&#10;The game is played to a specific amount of points and once a player reaches that number, they are declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The current rules for the game include the variants Anarchist Bomb, which has more bids and the role of the Anarchist, and Organized Chaos which has a fixed 10-round structure in which each player must make each bid once.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A dice game in which you roll 5 dice three times, setting one aside each time, trying to get the highest score possible.  If your total is over 10, then you get points worth the difference between your score and 10.  However, if your total is less than 10, you get points equal to three times the difference between your total and 10.  If your total is 10, you are out of the game!&#10;&#10;However, there's one more twist: of the five dice, two are normal dice marked 1-6, two are trick dice marked with three 2s and three 6s, and the last die has a 5 on every face.  This contributes to some interesting strategies as you try to maximize your points but avoid the dreaded 10!&#10;&#10;First to reach 99 points exactly wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary: The game is played by rolling five dice, and setting aside aside at least one scoring dice after each role, rolling only the dice that aren't kept for as long as the player keeps scoring.  If, at any point, no dice rolled score, then all points set aside in that turn are lost, and the dice passed to the next player.  Following any roll in which at least one dice scores, the active player may 'bank' the points accumulated that turn, and pass the dice to the next player.  The next player then has the option of building on that score by rolling only the non-scoring dice, or picking up all five dice and starting from zero.  At any time, the active player may call 'portito', which has the effect of flipping all dice following the roll: 1s become 6s, 2 become 5s, etc.  The player remains 'portito' until calling 'normal', which they can only do when the dice are in their possession (so you remain 'portito' while the dice go round the players).  The game continues until one player exactly reaches some pre-determined target score: 5000 or 10000 is common.&#10;&#10;Scoring dice within each roll are as follows:&#10;1 = 100 points&#10;5 = 50 points&#10;3 of a kind = dice score * 100&#10;&#10;",

But never break the whole keks into pieces! Each tile is worth one point, except the very first tile of a certain color, which counts zero points. As soon as you collect 3 same-color tiles (of value), you won that color, except for the very first color, which is won in the game. This color counts - again - zero points.&#10;&#10;You win the game by winning the fifth color.&#10;&#10;Happy keksing!&#10;&#10;",

Each batter is rated for: Overall batting ability, propensity to get on base, to strike out, to hit into double plays, to hit singles, doubles, triples &amp; homers, to draw walks, to be hit by pitches, to attempt base steals, and base stealing success. Each batter card also gives the number of games the player appeared in along with the team stint. This is included for those of you wishing to conduct realistic player transactions during a season. Each pitcher is rated for: Overall pitching ability, propensity to keep runners off the bases, to give up hits, to walk batters, to strike out batters, to throw wild pitches, to hit batsmen and to commit balks. Each pitcher card also included the number of games the pitcher appeared in, along with the number of games he appeared as a starter. As with the batting cards, a team stint number is also included.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each team has its own fielding chart, with each position player listed, along with the positions he played, the number of games in which he appeared in that position, his error rating for that position, and his throwing arm rating (if he is an outfielder.)&#10;&#10;Unique control system controls the flow of the game.

Players will use these powers to try and gain control over the people, and build temples and fortresses for themselves to help solidify their victory.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds, in which players will simultaneously select one of their available action cards, and then execute them.

While enslaving, converting, and battling your opponents followers can gain you the precious tribute and points you need to win the game, doing so will increase the other players' wrath, making their ability to respond that much more powerful.&#10;&#10;- User Summary&#10;&#10;",

The result is a slightly longer, but richer gaming experience.&#10;&#10;The book comes with two all new Encounter Cards exclusive to this adventure, but fully usable in the core game as well. The Encounters are new 'Boss' type encounters that, when discovered in the core game's Encounter deck, will do something 'bad' to the party before being placed at the bottom of the stack to be faced as the final encounter.&#10;&#10;The Adventures:&#10;Savage Arena...&#10;You and your party of adventurers are chained, neck to neck, as prisoners of Big Boss Gronkk. You must work together to survive a lethal coliseum of traps and monsters before the strongest among you earns the right to win your freedom.&#10;&#10;Errand of Evil...&#10;Your mysterious employer sends you to the stronghold of his rival to steal everything you can, for among his treasures is the one relic that can restore his misshaped body. The relic can change form, so you need to bring all you find -- but will his secret be your undoing?&#10;(NOTE: If you can avoid it, don't read the Encounter card before the end of this book - for maximum fun and impact!!)&#10;&#10;The book utilizes materials from the base game as well as Tombs and Tomes and Relics and Ruins. All materials are provided in the book if you do not own those expansions. (Copy the cards before playing - especially for Errand of Evil)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A miniatures wargame set in a version of Earth with animal-based countries. From Napoleonic France populated by burrowing mammals, to an Ottoman Empire founded by reptilian nomads, Brushfire continues to follow our Legendary Realms roleplaying mentality with an indepth hero and army development system, as well as a complex Campaign design. (Publisher Blurb)&#10;&#10;The game features a unique and interesting system using 10 sided dice instead of the classic 6 sided.  This creates new dynamics as well as new odds to master.  In addition, the game has three different kinds of points by which to buy your army.  This creates a very different feel than most war games, as an army feels like an army, not all heroes or all infantry.  Finally, the game uses and RPG-like style of hero creation, where a player is given so many hero levels, which can be used to buy skills on a skill tree.  Overall this makes for an original and fascinating game.&#10;&#10;",

If you find all your opponent's Velociraptor bones, you win the game. Easy? Think again! You'll need to avoid dangerous tar pits as you build your Velociraptor with the excavated bones! The first player to excavate and build a complete Velociraptor wins!&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take turns to try to discover dinosaur bones using the same A-J, 1-10 grid references as Battleship. Key differences are that the bones do not have target points which consist of a single straight line and that the bones have preset positions to fit onto four 5x5 terrain tiles. Don't be fooled though, this preset position rather than destroying the game, as I expected actually makes it far more of a logical deduction game than a guess fest.&#10;&#10;BTW the blurb about dangerous tar pits is just blurb. The game rules do not mention any tar pit effect.&#10;&#10;",

Groups of cards are auctioned, with players bidding using other cards from their hand. The winning bid for each group gets incremented by a card, and then auctioned in the next round. Sets to be collected are typical rummy/poker-like sets: straights, sets, flushes, etc., plus a few sets peculiar (in at least two senses of the word) to the Decktet. A sister game to Snark which uses the same mechanics, but with a Rainbow Deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subtitle: Being In The Main a Preoccupation For The Better Sort of Chap, &amp; Making Full Use of Classic Toy Soldiers (Which The Pedants Call &quot;54mm&quot;)&#10;&#10;Publisher's description:&#10;&#10;Written in part as a tribute to HG Wells ground breaking  Little Wars , FLW is a much expanded and broadened modernization. There is a fascinating chapter devoted to Wells the Man and his journey with his &quot;Little Wars&quot; from inception to the day in 1916 when he put the game away for good. For fans of Wells' work, The Padre may surprise you with information you did not know, or could even guess.&#10;&#10;Retaining many of Wells' original rules (such as the use of spring-loaded toy cannon), there are now additional rules for Shell Bursts, machine guns, observation balloons and aircraft, field hospitals, supply wagons and dumps, spies, military bands, unit Colors and Standards, Brigade up to Division Commands, hidden movement, skirmishers, snipers, unpredictable effects of terrain, signals, morale, and much more.&#10;&#10;Infantry units are a standard 20 figures strong, Cavalry 12, and Artillery can appear as single Guns with crews, or as Batteries of up to three strong. From two to four such units, with a Battery, typically form a Brigade, the perfect command for each Player. Two or more Brigades form a Division, and this is the post for the Player who will act as Commanding Officer for his side.&#10;&#10;Each Brigade and the Divisional HQ is represented by a variable number of Staff and ADC's, marching on foot, mounted on prancing steeds, or even seated in Rolls Royce, Cadillac, Renault, or other grand Staff Cars from the Golden Age of Motoring. From these HQ's must come the orders to the units on the firing line, but the traffic isn't all one way! Back to the Brigadiers and the Commanding General, come the reports of the scouts--and the desperate messages from the front lines delivered by Runners, Gallopers, and even Pigeons! There is far more skill than luck required to lead your miniature minions to victory, and the rules provide this without complicated systems. In many respects, there is far less abstraction in Funny Little Wars in the spaces of your garden than there is on the traditional table top.&#10;&#10;While designed for yard games, the rules can be played on the floor or table top. Figures used can range from antique and modern &quot;Collectibles,&quot; to readily available plastics. Included are detailed lists for 14 different Armies identified by their &quot;Colors,&quot; (&quot;Army Red,&quot; &quot;Army Black,&quot; &quot;Army Red/Gold,&quot; etc) with complete information on how to build your favorites. Each Army has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and a personality which will definitely suggest its historical counterpart.&#10;&#10;Much as Wells' rules did, FLW covers the quarter century prior to WW I, when war was still romantic, the uniforms were dashing, and the Generals still waltzed. This is the very era that gave birth to the Military Pentathalon, and a player may find himself having to excel in one or more of its challenges to deliver a crucial dispatch! Padre Paul's rules reflect the late Victorian and Edwardian spirit in both the substance of the rules and the delightful style of his writing. Designed for &quot;The Better Sort of Chap,&quot; the book contains suggestions for proper Dress during the game, etiquette on the field, and more. Nor are the Ladies and &quot;Girls of the better sort&quot; forgotten. The Padre's Wife, Georgina, provides a charming account of a &quot;proper dinner&quot; served after an especially Gentlemanly game at Dover Castle one recent Summer.&#10;&#10;Not only are there the Basic Rules, but many Optional Rules allowing players to set their own levels of play. There are lists of providers of toy soldiers in every price range, as well as all manner of accessories, and recommendations on how to shop inexpensively on the Internet for those items you will not find so readily in the stores. Sections describe how to set up a yard, park, rockery, beach, or other site to be your Battlefield. For once, you WILL have room to perform that wide flanking maneuver! Light Cavalry and Infantry come into their own, screening your forces while trying to detect your enemy's. Once more, War Gaming is as much fun as when any of us discovered the hobby, no matter how many years--or decades!--ago.&#10;&#10;Rules for basing figures are flexible and encourage players to work with what is best for their needs. And while comprehensive, there are no complex rules or formulae, and nothing more than traditional six-sided dice are required--besides measuring tapes and a beautiful day under the shade of the trees. Childlike, but never &quot;Childish,&quot; FLW goes back to the Hobby's roots, and even our own as we play once more with the toy soldiers so many us first had as kids.&#10;&#10;",

When reaching such an enemy, the active player may try to defeat the enemy. For that purposes he bid a number of hour glass tokens and throws a ten sided die (values 0 through 9). The number thrown is then multiplied by the number of hour glasses bid and if that number is equal or higher than the enemies value, the enemy is defeated and life points are gained. Otherwise the enemey card remains on the board and three life points are lost.&#10;&#10;Players win the game when all six enemies are defeated or they lose the game when they have no more life points left.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuarenta )&#10;&#10;Cuarenta is the national card game of Ecuador. It is a fishing game played with a Baraja, a pack of 40 Spanish playing cards. The game can also be played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).&#10;&#10;Cuarenta is Spanish for the number 40. This refers to the number of points that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it. Two chicas or the first chica with zapater&iacute;a (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a &quot;mesa&quot;, which means &quot;match&quot;). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams.&#10;&#10;Five cards are dealt to each player, given out as a batch of five cards at a time. Each player plays one card face up onto the table. Cards on the table may be captured by the opponent. If cards are captured, they are placed face down in front of the player or his teammate. Played cards remain on the table until they are captured or the round ends.&#10;&#10;Cards can be captured in the following three ways: matching (card same rank as on the table; player places matching card onto own pile), addition  (two cards add to the value of the other; a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 6; an ace, a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 7; cards with pictures have no value and cannot be captured this way), and sequence (a card captured by matching or addition entitles the picking of the next higher card; matching a 2 entitles the capturing of the 3 and 4 (etc.), as well, should there be any).&#10;&#10;If a player clears the table by capturing all cards, they score a limpia. If a player captures the card just played by the player before, this is called a ca&iacute;da. In either case, the player scores 2 points.&#10;&#10;Before the first individual turn after each deal, special announcements have to be made by each player if applicable. These are the doble ronda (four cards of the same rank) and the ronda (three cards of the same rank). A doble ronda  automatically wins the game; a ronda scores two points. After all five cards are played, there is a new deal. After all cards have been played (2 deals with 4 players, 4 deals with 2 players), each player or team counts their collected cards. If the number of collected cards is 20, 6 points are scored; an additional point is given for each captured card in excess of 20, rounded to the next even number.&#10;&#10;A chica is won when a player or team reaches 40 points. The game is won when a player or a team wins two chicas or when the opponent doesn't reach ten points at the end of the first chica.&#10;&#10;",

As you watch them assemble, you recall the previous Victories were gained through intelligence and a keen sense of strategy.  Explore every option, then choose your course of action - but, remember, your opponent will be doing the same...&#10;&#10;Tactics must be used which recognize the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent's battle forces, as well as your own.  Slow-moving ground forces can successfully defend key sectors of the Battle Grid, while swift-moving ground forces race through alley-ways to the attack.  But always be aware of the power of the air forces and the Ranger which, when skillfully positioned, can be devastating.&#10;&#10;Now, it is time to clear your mind so that you can imagine the impossible.  Be prepared to change course in a heartbeat, yet always keep the ultimate goal firmly in mind.  You are ready.&#10;&#10;Play:  Players execute one option per turn and alternate turns until victory is attained.  The battle forces consist of the army under the command of a player.  Siege occurs when you can attack your opponent's commander on your next turn.  Victory is attained when your opponent cannot excape siege.  Opening setup is similar in look to a chess game, and each individual type of fighter is able to move in a different way.  The fighters include both ground and flying forces.&#10;&#10;Ground forces can be positioned by movement, or in certain cases through spinning, or through BOTH spinning and movement.  Flying forces can fly in the flight zone established by the ground forces (portals).&#10;&#10;",

Also, to make things more interests, you use the Seven Heavenly Virtues and Seven Deadly Sins to help in this endeavor.&#10;In the end, the Seven Wonders help to take advantage of cards that already being used, for a small price.

    "Description": "Foxhole is a series of board wargames planned to cover a number of important battles of World War II and later those of other wars from the Napoleonic Wars to the War on Terror. Players assume the roles of Divisional or Corps  commander. Although there are other ways to play the game, in the historical scenarios the goal is not to &quot;win&quot;, but rather to do better than the historical commanders whose role the players have overtaken. The series' scale encompasses both the Operational and Tactical  levels. Although the product is a wargame its publishers prefer to call it a simulation. It is developed by game designer Glenn Davis and published by Diffraction Entertainment, Ltd. based in Scotland, UK.&#10;&#10;Foxhole's first product Utah Beach can be played by two to six players, while future installments are to allow additional players.&#10;&#10;The product comes with three ways to play the game: &#10;1) The historical scenario that comes with each product where the goal is to do better than the historical results, &#10;2) A competitive (called tournament-style in the rulebook) system with over two dozen orders similar to Warhammer 40k like sieze and hold, rearguard action, etc. where your goal is to &quot;beat&quot; your opponent to the goal.  Interestingly, in this version you each take one of the hexagonally shaped maps, set up your forces, and then push them together, giving you a bit of fog of war.  &#10;3) TSWW conversion: Although seemingly not fully supported in the original product, the rulebook implies that with later releases of TO&amp;E data players will be able to play out TSWW battles at the Foxhole scale, giving gamers the first opportunity ever to play out World War II at the company scale ... everywhere.&#10;&#10;As for playing the game; the following is ripped straight from the rulebook: &quot;A Primer on Foxhole&trade; in 400 Words or Less&#10;Each Player Turn consists of 6 essential Phases:&#10;&#10;    Supply-Movement Phase: Units which are adjacent to enemies, plan on firing an artillery barrage or conduct an Activity this turn must Trace Supply instead of do anything this Phase.  Otherwise they may move as usual.&#10;    Barrage Phase: Barrages may be fired this Turn by Sorties and Artillery.  In the case of Artillery, they must have Traced Supply in the prior Phase and not move in the next in order to do so.  Note that the Reacting Player may also be able to fire Barrages.&#10;    Activities-Movement Phase: It is during this Phase and only if the Unit Traced Supply in the Supply-Movement Phase that Units may conduct Activities other than Movement such as digging entrenchments, demolishing them, bridges, etc., crossing a river or un-pin a Vehicle Platoon (which represents Vehicles bogged down).  Units may also move unless they fired a Barrage in the prior Phase.&#10;    Combat Phase: There are two kinds of Combat and each hex may be attacked only once.  Assaulting allows Units to enter and, if successful, secure a hex.  Its disadvantages are that it allows the opposing Player to make Covering Fire against your Assaulting Units, you have less terrain benefits and are limited to 4 Units Assaulting the Hex.  By contrast, Fights allow Units to attack enemy Units from range and has none of the above hindrances, but cannot secure a Hex and is less likely to do serious damage to the opposition.&#10;    Motorized Movement Phase: Motorized Units are all Vehicle Platoons plus any other Unit with the little wheels at the bottom.  Any of such Units can move during this Phase.  In lieu of moving, they may instead make a 50/50 attempt to Un-pin themselves from the hex (but they couldn't have moved anyway).&#10;    Vehicle Assault Phase: During this Phase Vehicles Platoons (not all Motorized Units) may make Assaults.&#10;    Full Turn: A Full Turn consists of Weather Determination and Forecasting followed by a Player Turn from each Player.  The Offensive Player always goes first, which is also the Allied Player in the Utah Beach Historical Scenario.  There are three Full Turns each Day representing the Morning, Afternoon and Night.  Preceding each Morning Turn and the beginning of the day both Players should conduct a Dawn Briefing.&quot; - Foxhole Rulebook, page 36.&#10;&#10;&#10;The only thing the above misses is a fun little weather forecasting and resolution where players forecast the weather two turns ahead of time, and it may or may not actually end up being the weather they thought it was going to be (but *probably* will), adding a lot a pressure/tenseness as the commanders look overhead to see whether those clouds will clear up, start a drizzle, or remain overcast as predicted.&#10;&#10;",

In it, you assume the role of one faction of the Zyn, an inch-high, insectile alien race determined to &#10;conquer our planet, one cluttered surface at a time!  You can choose to play as either the Kyll&rsquo;al, the militant arm of the alien invasion, or the Sav&rsquo;m, the  rebellious faction looking to halt the invasion.&#10;&#10;Players control small teams of 28mm miniature aliens, usually 3 or so figures per side, one Leader, one Support and one Scout or Assassin. These figures represent the alien factions fighting to either get a foothold on Earth or to stop the invasion.  Since these figures represent inch high aliens the battle field can be your desktop, itchen table, or any suitable surface, using what ever happens to be there as terain to give your figures cover as as they battle.&#10;&#10;Figures are given stats such as Speed, Melee Combat, Ranged Combat and Body Points (hit points) and can have special abilities.  Combat is D10 based and rules allow close combat and ranged combat.  Players roll against each other for initiatie each turn.  The winner gets to use each figures action points to perform move or combat actions.  Once done the next player does the same.&#10;&#10;Playsheets are included.  Players use these to track the status of their figures, one per sheet.&#10;&#10;There are simple campaign rules allowing figures to gain special abilities or improve their stats over a course of several games.&#10;&#10;Play is scenario based and each side is given objectives, the winner is the side to first complete their objectives or alternately the last side standing.  Scenarios can be found on the publiher's web forum.&#10;&#10;The game comes with six figures, two Stat Card sheets (which may be copied and should also be available on the publisher's website), two pencils, two 10-sided dice, one measuring tape and the rules.&#10;&#10;",

In the following years, these warrior-spies, known as the Brandenburgers, operated behind enemy lines around the globe, from Russia and Yugoslavia to Egypt, Iraq, and India, Often bending the rules of war while completing their daring covert missions. Trained to be mobile and independent, steeped in foreign languages and customs, and expert in numerous military specialties, the Brandenburgers influenced the world's special forces long after World War II.&#10;&#10;Brandenburg is a tactical wargame for up to three players, depicting the actions of the German commando force throughout the entire WWII. The game's map is assembled using hexagonal tiles, a method which simulates the fog of war and increases the game's replayability over time. Counters represent individual units, with specialized infantry (soldiers, medics, engineers, scouts and snipers) able to pack, equip and use a wide variety of weapons and gear to carry out their missions. Civilians, agents and partisans populate the conflict zone, acting as influential factors capable of tilting the balance of power to either side's favor.&#10;&#10;",

The Defense may &quot;boost&quot; just ONE play per set of downs.&#10;&#10;After the cards have been selected, the Offense and Defense reveal their players and the outcome of the play is determined by the ratings.&#10;&#10;Run Plays: Compare the Offense Run Rating and the Defense Run Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Offense is 50 and the Defense is 41, the Run gains nine yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was six, then the new Defense rating is 47 the rush gains only three yards instead.&#10;&#10;Pass Plays: Add the Quarterback Pass Rating and the Pass Rating of the selected player. Take that total, and compare it to the Defense Pass Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Quarterback Pass Rating is 30 and the selected Offense Player is also 30, for a total of 60, and the Defense Pass Rating is 50, the Pass gains 10 yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play, and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was five, the pass gains five yards instead.&#10;&#10;Substitutions: Teams may substitute players only at halftime. However, they can use the same starters throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Overtime: If the teams are tied after four quarters, a new coin flip will determine who has the first possession of overtime. The first team to score wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Follow the band from city to city and visit awesome places like Seattle - Boston - San Fran and Miami.

Concerts must be played in the order they are on the board, and all tickets from the first concert must be taken before the next concert can make its tickets available, and so on.&#10;&#10;To move your bus toward a concert city, draw a travel card and place it face up so all can see.  If it is a move card, there will be a white bus on the card. You can move your bus the number of spaces the white bus indicates.  If there are other buses on the card, that color bus also gets to move.  If your colored bus also happens to be on the card, then you may move again.  Buses are moved in the order they are played on the card.  In a two or three player game, ignore any buses not being played.  If you happen to end your turn on the same space as another player, then jump ahead to the next space.  In some cases, the player who drew the card will also get to move another player's bus.  These are wrong turn cards.  Any special instructions will be on the cards.&#10;&#10;Sometimes a card will have special instructions, such as move to any city, or swap tickets with another player.  In these cases instead of moving this turn, just do what the card says.&#10;&#10;Once you begin to move in a direction, you cannot backtrack on the same road.  The only exception is in the case where a card you draw has your color bus on it as well.  These are considered two different moves.  They must be done in the correct order on the card.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game:&#10;After all 8 concerts have happened, everyone adds up their points (from Rest Stop and Concert Ticket cards).  The player with the most points wins the game.  That player is the Naked Brothers Band's Biggest Fan!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Background&#10; Zombie Masters uses the popular Zombie theme and adds some new twists to the Zombie games.&#10; This time you take the role of a Zombie Master, who creates these &quot;undead&quot; bodies and sends them out to control the world. Everybody is wondering about why Zombies are driven to eat brrraiiiins... we will give you the answer! &#10; We all know that knowledge is a drug for mankind (just ask Faust) - it's a drug for Zombies as well. Our Zombies don't want to live with a brain all the time and therefore, feed upon the Living to get there wits back. Of course, this process is very slow and it would take tons of Einstein brains to spark rational thinking in a Zombie. But who cares, if you are &quot;undead&quot; and have all the time in the world.  Additionally, if you are a very dedicated and strong human and have the (mis)fortune to get bitten and turned into a Zombie yourself, you may be lucky and retain some of your basic knowledge regarding routine tasks/skills. So a cop may be able to still fire a pistol - though much slower and maybe not very accurately or the Zombie nurse may still be able to perform the task of giving you an injection.&#10; And naturally,  - intelligent brains are much more attractive to Zombies than &bdquo;no-brainers&ldquo;.  Thus, a special resource is made available to Zombie Masters: Beer! Too much beer makes human brains unattractive for Zombies and those people who drink a lot of beer are not eaten by Zombies. And  you,  of course, as an evil Zombie Master can have the beer infested people fight or work among Zombies as well - they simply will not notice it ;-)  &#10;  &#10;General game description&#10; Zombie Masters is a game for two players, who fight for control of a city or other location. Each player represents a &bdquo;Zombie Master&ldquo;, who is able to create Zombies and control them to achieve his goals.&#10; Zombie Masters tiles are used to build a strategy for this game. Each player choose a set of 30 unit- or character tiles and put them into a chosen order in five turn sets consisting of six cards each.&#10; A game turn consists of the following actions:&#10; 1) Produce Zombie Masters resources&#10;2) Play Zombie tiles face down to locations you would like to attack&#10;3) Players alternately put Zombies or Humans on the Zombie tiles&#10;4) Turn over the tiles you like and place Zombies on them. Discard Zombies which are surplus or can't be played on the tile&#10;5) Starting with Initiative 0, use the action of that tile or attack with it until all tiles have been used&#10;6) Seize locations if there is no enemy Zombie or citizen left and at least one of your Zombies/Humans occupy the location&#10;7) Continue to feed &quot;living&quot; Zombies&#10;&#10;Zombie Masters will include a base set of 30 tiles for two players as well as a whole lot of Zombies and the remote city of Riverview to battle for. More strategy boards, unit tiles, locations and Zombie/Human tokens will follow up in expansion and scenario packs.&#10;&#10;",

The first player, whose three pawns arrived at the end fields, is the winner.&#10;Variations:&#10;Neutral fields: Nobody can capture an other pawn&#10;Chains: If you move one pawn to an other own pawn on one field, nobody can capture this two pawns&#10;Tandem: If you have two pawns on one field, you can move both together as one pawn, but then every other pawn can capture this two pawns as one.&#10;Barricade: Put four black pawns on the four neutral fields on the board. You must arrive these fields with the right number and displace the black pawn to any other field on the board as a barricade.&#10;&#10;The idea for the Irrgarten is from Greek mythology. It is a labyrinth like on Kreta, which was build by Daedalus for the King Minos. You start at the outer circle of the labyrinth. Who moved first through all five circles to the center, is the winner. There are 12 neutral black pawns at any point of the labyrinth. You throw a dice and move one of your three pawns forward or backward to the center. You must throw the right number to stop directly on a field of a black pawn. Now you can displace the black one and barricade the way of your opponents.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Civilization: The Expansion Project &#10;is designed for five to eighteen players covering the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture to the emergence of Rome as the dominant Mediterranean power - a span of almost 8,000 years.&#10;&#10;Civilization: The Expansion Project is one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements. One of the greatest advantages with Civilization: The Expansion Project is that it has a large map so that each game can be played at different location on the map. This fact alone gives the game more flexibility and depth than it's base game.&#10;&#10;Included are even more civilization advancements than in advanced civilization which give the players new options for advancement. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a mapboard much larger than in advanced civilization that stretches from the Mediterranean to India as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture. Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Civilization: The Expansion Project is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, political and religious factors. Conflicts that do arise result from rivalries and shortages of land rather than from attempts to eliminate other players. Nomads, farmers, warriors, merchants, artisans, priests and citizens all have an essential part to play in the development of each nation's civilization. The player who most effectively balances these various outlooks will achieve the best balance and win the game.&#10;&#10;New stuff &amp; impact on the base-game:&#10; * Redesigned extended map&#10; * More civilization advancements&#10; * 18 player at most&#10; * New victory point system&#10; * Improved timeline&#10;&#10;",
