Now the marker is moved back to the start of that over and a die is thrown again, and so on for six deliveries. Then it is the 2nd over, and so on.

Or, play as that evil and conquer the world!&#10;&#10;This four-player game has everything you and three friends need to play all in the box. Play as Highlord Tirion Fordring, Lady Jaina Proudmoore, or Queen Sylvanas Windrunner and battle against the Lich King! Each player takes a deck, and the three heroes of Azeroth team-up to free the land from the threats of Icecrown Citadel. If the 3-on-1 seems unfair, know that the Lich King raid deck has some of the most powerful cards you've ever seen. He's no mere mortal! Plus, each deck comes with the hero's legendary weapon: the Ashbringer, Staff of Antonidas, Frostmourne, and Deathwhisper. The decks also feature new art for Fire Blast, Frostbolt, Counterspell, Multi-Shot, Redemption, Hammer of Justice, and others!&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic has streamlined the raid deck experience, making it far more friendly to new players. There are no new rules to learn; each player takes his or her turn just as they would in a normal game of World of Warcraft TCG. The included rulebook ensures that even completely green recruits can jump in the action.&#10;&#10;The three raiding decks easily convert into tournament-legal Core decks as well. Just replace the hero card, remove the legendary weapon, and you can battle at your local Core Constructed or Battlegrounds event.&#10;&#10;Each four-player game comes packaged with an Assault on Icecrown Citadel Treasure Pack, and the Treasure Packs are sold separately as well. There are 20 uncommons, 7 rares, and 3 epics in the set. Each pack contains 9 foil cards (8 uncommons and 1 rare or 1 epic) unleashing never-seen-before allies, abilities, quests, and equipment cards into the World of Warcraft TCG card pool. Find Muradin Bronzebeard, High Overlord Saurfang, and Highlord Tirion Fordring as new allies to join your party. Recruit the best of Northrend before you go back to the mainland. You also have the chance to open Loot cards from Worldbreaker: Mottled Drake, Grim Campfire, and Landro's Lil XT.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simulation of re-racing the 108th Kentucky Derby. Cards for all 32 horses that were eligible are included. Unusually, this seems to have been published before the real race was run, so the designer suggests that you could run the race more accurately after the horses are entered in real life.&#10;&#10;Movement is by rolling dice and then looking at a chart on the back of each horse's card. On the back of the card, each horse has a set of target numbers for each quarter of the track. Dice are rolled and if you roll one of those numbers, the horse advances. If you don't, the horse doesn't move. Eight(8) horses are in each race, the players divide up the 8 horses.&#10;&#10;As 32 horses are provided and only 8 run, you can play a series of 4 races, to use every horse once.&#10;&#10;",

The box is nice, shaped like a treasure chest, and the map comes rolled up with a ribbon round it.&#10;The board is map of the sea between Sail Point Bay and Treasure Bay, superimposed with squares. The game uses dice but in a novel way. Turn order is decided by chance and that order of play continues for the whole game. We will call the first player 'the Leader'. He throws a red die and consults the compass at the top of the board. There are 6 compass points and each points in a different direction. The number rolled dictates the direction of movement, for all players, this round. Then the Leader throws a black die and moves his ship that many spaces in the correct direction. Each player after that does the same, throw the black die and move, but not the red die as that is only thrown at the start of the round. There is a little choice in movement. You can decide to 'tack' and move in the direct opposite direction of the compass throw, but you don't move so far, in fact, you might not move at all.&#10;There are perils to be avoided, like rocks or the dreaded Seaweed Sea where you just float randomly until clear of it.&#10;The first player to sail into Treasure Bay wins.&#10;&#10;",

Any number of these arena cards can be combined in any configuration to create the combat arena in which players will battle.  Terrain tokens can be added to further diversify the arena.&#10;&#10;There are twelve different Gear Jackets in the base game, with more planned for future expansions.  Players select the Gear Jacket of their choice.  Each player also takes five combat cards and a damage card.  Each combat card represents a different section of the Gear Jacket--Head, Chest, Arms, etc.  Combat is based on predicting the opponent's moves.  The attacker selects two combat cards, while the defender chooses three.  These cards are simultaneously revealed.  Any cards revealed by the attacker that are not matched by the defender count as hits.  Hits in different sections cause different amounts of damage, and may have extra penalties for the defender, as well.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for game variants such as King of the Hill, Death Race 2000, and Tag that allow for further game diversity.&#10;&#10;",

The strategy is to search for the most or longest words and accumulate the highest score possible.  Each player must decide how to best allocate their play time between moving the cube or searching and calling out each word with its point value. Typically, a game consists of 2 to 5 rounds of play.  Players compete for the highest score by adding up the letter values for all words appearing anywhere around the cube.  The letters can wrap around the sides of the cube from one face to another and must links diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. In QUBLE JUMBLE and FIRST TO FORTY, scoring may be based upon the length of the word. The more letters in a word, the more points.&#10;&#10;Besides word game play, QUBLE can also be played as a conventional brain teaser by matching up each face of the puzzle by solid colors.&#10;&#10;Rulebook includes 7 variants, mostly in the scoring and win conditions.&#10;&#10;",

Players swap piles, then choose one of the two piles they hold to serve as their Queen hand. On a turn, a player draws the top card of the deck or the top three cards on the discard pile, optionally plays sets and runs and plays off opponents, then discards one card. To open, a player must first play a set and run from the Queen hand of 3-7 cards. Once the player does this, she may meld additional cards and play off opponents.&#10;&#10;Once a player has run out of cards in the Queen hand, she picks up the other pile &ndash; the King hand &ndash; and needs to play a set of 3-7 cards from this hand before being able to play off opponents once again. The round ends when a player runs out of cards in her King hand. The other players are penalized based on the value of cards remaining in hand, and the player with the lowest score after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

It is a game of chance and is won by the first person to reach the bombing target (the German city of Coblenz).&#10;&#10;The Green game is for any number of players, again as a game of chance but requires finding Pinpoints via Latitude and Longitude.&#10;&#10;In the Red and Green games a number of aircraft set off from their base in Kent to bomb a target at Coblenz.&#10;&#10;The games requires the player to copy and create miniature airplanes, Compass Rose, 10 deg angle indicator and Latitude/Longitude Finder.&#10;&#10;The game includes maps as well as extensive briefing triggered by either a draw from a deck of cards or dice roll.  The players continue to roll/draw cards until they land on the target by exact count. Any overshooting requires the bomber to fly back around.&#10;&#10;A briefing can have extensive instructions causing the player to head off track or be attacked by enemy fighters ending in a change of course and position on the map.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sky Castles is a tile and worker placement game where the players collect gemstones from castles in the clouds.  The theme is aimed at children, but the game claims to provide scope for strategic play at all levels.&#10;&#10;The tiles depict a cloudscape dotted with gemstones.  Each turn the player selects one of four face-up tiles and places it into the cloudscape so that the borders match adjacent tiles, and can optionally place a sprite token to claim a cloud or section of sky.  There are three scoring rounds where the players score points for the gemstones that their sprites have claimed.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is similar to other tile placement games (e.g. Carcassonne) but Sky Castles has less complexity and claims to be suitable for a younger audience while retaining similar strategic options.&#10;&#10;",

The motherships are able to shoot &quot;disc missiles&quot; but only only can move laterally along the gameboard's central circle, while the combat modules can move forward and feature an spring-based system that makes them &quot;explode&quot; in case one disc missile hits it's front.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each combat module is placed over it's correspondent sign in the circle, and the motherships are placed in each side of the gameboard. The starting player moves one of his modules one square forward and then shoots his mothership. If he hits and destroys one of the other player's modules, he can advance one of his again, until he fails, ending his turn. The first to move one of his modules over the central square (The earth) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Starmada: Fleet Ops is a &quot;fleet-scale&quot; game using the same database as Starmada: Admiralty Edition science-fiction starship combat game. S:FO is very similar to S:AE in many respects, but Starmada: Fleet Ops' flow is intended to be faster-moving and more abstracted.&#10;&#10;Game scale is &quot;grand tactical&quot;, each ship is a single counter on the map, and its statistics (damage level, weapons, and so on) are tracked individually, although not in as much detail as Starmada: Admiralty Edition. (Any ship you can build using Admiralty Edition's ship design rules can be represented in Starmada: Fleet Ops, making the two games highly compatible).Construction rules are included, and also guidelines on converting Admiralty Edition ships to Fleet Ops statistics. An entire fleet of ships can be represented on a single standard sheet of paper.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous. Each player takes turns giving orders to his units by placing a marker on top of one ship to indicate the orders it has been given. Once all ships have orders, initiative is determined. The player losing initiative moves all his ships first (giving the non-moving player an advantage), but then fires first in the subsequent fire phase (gaining an advantage).&#10;&#10;Movement and firing are both simplified and sped up from Admiralty Edition, reducing the amount of record keeping and the number of die rolls. Mechanics new to the Starmada system are introduced, including morale and command ships.&#10;&#10;The product is available as either a download in Adobe .pdf format, or as a print-on-demand saddle-stitched book (44 pages). Additional material, including printable colour counters and map sheets, is available for free download from Majestic 12 Games' website for purchasers of either format.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Socker is a two player breakthrough abstract board game that simulates a soccer or rugby-like game where socking opposing pieces is a means to the end zone.&#10;&#10;Socker is played on a 9x11 field, 9 columns and 11 rows. Each player has five man tokens (for example meeples), called sockers, and there is a ball token.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, the ball is placed in the center space of the board. Players toss a coin to see who plays first. Starting with the toss winner, each player places all his or her sockers upright on any empty spaces that are in their nearest half of the field, but not adjacent (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) to the ball and not in the center row.&#10;&#10;Players continue alternating turns and do the following.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must perform one to three actions listed below using any of his or her upright (referred to as active) sockers.&#10;&#10;     Move.  An active socker may be moved to any adjacent empty space. This includes the goal and out of bounds areas. However, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, no more that three of his or her sockers may be in the goal and out of bounds regions.&#10; Kick. If an active socker is adjacent to the ball, the ball may be kicked directly away one space provided the destination space is empty.&#10;&#10;Sock. If an active socker is adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s socker, then the opponent&rsquo;s socker may be pushed directly away one space provided the destination space is empty. The pushed socker is then put on its side to indicate that it is inactive and will not be able to perform any actions for one turn.&#10;&#10;Any action or active socker may be used multiple times. Player may use any combination of actions and active sockers, and in any order they like.&#10;&#10;When a player completes his or her actions all that player&rsquo;s inactive sockers are put upright and become active again. This ends the player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to kick the ball over your goal line, into your farthest 1x9 row.  Players can choose either of the following winning conditions: first to score a set number of goals (usually one), or most goals after a set number of turns followed by sudden death if necessary. After a goal, players should use the setup procedures with the non-scoring player going first. For sudden death, only two sockers per player are used, and a coin toss is used to determine who plays first.&#10;&#10;Special Rules&#10;&#10;Out of Bounds: The first and last columns of the playing field excluding the goal spaces are out of bounds. If the ball is pushed out of bounds, the ball is immediately moved to the center space of the same row. If the center space is occupied, the owner of the occupying socker can choose any empty space adjacent to the center space.&#10;&#10;Repeat Positions: When a position is repeated, the player that plays next gets one extra action (total of four instead of three) to break the deadlock.&#10;&#10;Static Positions: The maximum number of sockers on the edge is three. This prevents unmovable defensive positions behind the goal line or along the sides of the board. That is, positions where the offensive player can not push the ball or an opponent's socker.&#10;&#10;",

After the units are completed, they pit their team against one or more opponents. The game is like chess on steroids!&#10;&#10;The infinite combinations of weapons, movements and defenses against the other team's weapons movements and defenses makes for a unique playing experience each and every game.&#10;&#10;Unit design can take up to 2 hours for first time players, and play time can range anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. The object of the game is to obliterate the opposition and collect credits for rewards. With those credits, you can buy more units or upgrade your existing units through the roof.&#10;&#10;Strategy is the key to winning. Do you use a bunch of fast and light units or just work with a couple of super strong slow units, or go with a mix of everything? Depending on what you do and what each opponent does, you can battle for hours or you can make a fatal mistake and have things end very quickly. No two games are alike!&#10;&#10;",

Control of the land is achieved by controlling the various cities. To signify the control each city is covered with a chit which has a Spanish side and a Dutch side. &#10;At the beginning of the game the players decide on the number of rounds they will play (about 10 rounds per hour can be played, 20 to 30 round are recommended) and a die is rolled for each city. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 the Spanish side is up, on 4, 5 or 6 the Dutch side. Each player gets three leaders to control their armies and 15 units of infantry. The Spanish get an extra two units of cavalry and the Dutch two units of naval troops (watergeuzen)&#10;Each round both players roll a die. Their separate scores are the number of action points they have for that round. The combined number of both dies is used to decide on a random effect to be carried out before the round is started. &#10;Victory points can only be scored as the result of a specific random effect. For each province (there are 16 provinces with 1 to 8 cities) where one players controls all cities that player scores a victory point for each city in the province. &#10;The player with the highest roll starts the round, in case of a tie the Spanish player. Units are moved over the board by leaders, they cannot move alone. The naval units can move independently but only from one coastal city to another. Movement costs actions. A player can conquer cities by spending action points storming, starving or tricking them. A random event can cause the city to change its alliance at the start of a new round as well.&#10;Battles between armies are  a special affair: both sides take only one turn rolling dies, one die for a unit of infantry, three for cavalry and three for each point their best leaders ability is higher than the other players best leaders. First the defending player rolls the dies, scoring a hit for each 6 rolled. Then, after taking her losses, the attacker does the same, the defender taking her losses. The winner of the battle is the player who rolled the most sixes or, when both rolled the same number, the defender. The defeated player loses the entire army, both units and leaders!&#10;After the last round there is a final victory point calculation. In this calculation a point is awarded for each city the player controls, regardless of province control.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Commander-In-Chief is a fun fast-playing abstract strategy war game published by X Plus Products in which a player's Air, Land and Sea military vehicles work as a unified Armed Forces assault team to &quot;capture&quot; their opponent's Commander. The board consists of a traditional 8 square x 8 square checkerboard grid divided into two Land areas separated by a Sea area. Vehicles are restricted to movement within their assigned battlefields: Through the Air, On Land and/or In the Sea.&#10;&#10;Pieces transverse the board in a Chess-like manner.  Play evolves, turn by turn, with each player analyzing the current battlefield situation, adjusting their game plan accordingly and executing commands (movements of the playing pieces) in a collective effort to achieve the game's objective. Certain Air pieces (Bombers and Helicopters) can Go Over pieces; likewise certain Sea pieces (Submarines) can Go Under pieces. Additionally, certain pieces (Bombers and Tanks) can Block. The complete Original Release Basic Training Game Rules include &quot;Object of the Game&quot; options, &quot;Team Game Play&quot; options and &quot;Advanced Game Play&quot; options. &quot;Future&quot; options will include new movements, expansion pieces, additional damage control options, new attack features, mini wars and expanded terrains as variants to the Original Release Game Rules.&#10;&#10;While this abstract strategy war game does not include random chance, it does allow for piece enhancements both during game play and during board set up which increases come from behind opportunities and can be used to level the playing field between players of various skill levels. The game can be played one-on-one or as a social game with teams. The military theme, the terrain feature of Air, Land and Sea areas of the board and the movements of the pieces themselves relative to the military vehicles they represent give the game a real world appeal.&#10;&#10;The two Armed Forces consist of the following fifteen pieces per side: one Commander, two stealth Fighters, two army Tanks, one stealth Bomber, two submersible Submarine warships, two Helicopters, four amphibious assault vehicles (Amphibians) and one surface combatant Destroyer warship. This military themed board game, representing two Armed Forces, &quot;Supports Our Troops&quot; as the game of the &quot;Y&quot; by donating $1 to the Armed Services YMCA for every game sold.&#10;&#10;Commander-In-Chief is a 3-In-1 board game that includes Chess &amp; Checkers; these Classics are played on the dark and light colored side of the double sided game board. Additional game play options include: Tic-Tac-Toe and The Triangle Puzzle Game. Lastly, the 30 pieces that come with the game are miniatures, 30 Military Toys, designed for play with or without this board game and the 30 bases that the miniatures mount on, when inverted, become 30 Stackable Spinning Tops designed for multiple family fun games.&#10;&#10;",

If they succeed, glory and fortune will be theirs for the taking. If they fail, all could be lost!&#10;&#10;This cooperative board game experience is designed for 2-5 players, ages 10 and up. One player is the Dungeon Master who runs the villains and monsters; the remaining players are the heroes. The game includes four adventures, each one featuring a unique villain.&#10;&#10;Update, August 11, 2011&#10;&#10;Apparently Dungeon of Dread was not as &quot;exciting&quot; as Wizards of the Coast hoped for, as the company announced at Gen Con 2011 that the title was no longer scheduled for release.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Metapontum is a cooperative abstract strategy game created and promoted by Dutch designer Hans Theo Frenkel and the foundation he created, for the purpose of promoting world peace. It is played on an 8x8 hexagonal board with 16 pieces on each side, that have movement very similar to those in Chess, and are abstract as in Chess. The goal of Metapontum is for both sides to exchange their pieces from their chosen opening setup to their chosen end setup in a minimum amount of moves. On every turn, a player can either move one of his pieces or exchange one of his pieces with one of his opponent's, as long as his piece has line of sight to the other.&#10;&#10;Frenkel's web site sells various game boards made out of either cardboard, wood or stone. Frenkel claims that all games are produced under fair trade practices.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary:&#10;A basic set of skirmish-level miniatures rules for urban combat between street gangs, law enforcement, special forces, etc. Game scale is 1:1 with each figure representing individual fighters, vehicles, etc. Each turn equals 5 seconds of &quot;real&quot; time and the ground scale is 1.5 centimeters equals 1 meter. These rules are intended for use with 28-30mm miniatures but could easily be adapted to smaller scales. Individual models are assigned individual skill levels (Streetwise, Brawling, Ranged Combat) and are given an allotment of Option Points to further customize each figure. Players equip each of their forces based on an Equipment Points system which allows them to add weapons, ammo, and miscellaneous equipment. Combat rules cover close combat, ranged, and special weapons such as RPGs and other heavy arms.&#10;&#10;From the introduction:&#10;'Street F.M.' is designed to represent small-scale conflict in a modern or near future urban environment. By employing scale models to represent the combatants and their surroundings it is possible to create clashes between street gangs, criminals, law enforcers and small military units. In fact any group entering urban combat, armed with everything from improvised weapons through to rocket launchers can be covered by the system.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Another DIY product for the GWAS series, adding the French and Russian Navies as prizes of the British and Germans.  From the APL website...&#10;&#10;&quot;Different courses of the Great War might well have seen warships of the Marine Nationale or Imperial Russian Navy serving under British or German colors: taken as booty by a victorious Germany (the actual fate of Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea Fleet), seized by Britain to prevent their falling into enemy hands following the defeat of an ally, sold in the face of more pressing priorities on land or a different ending to hostilities. Transferred to the North Sea arena across which the war&rsquo;s two principal naval antagonists faced each other, the more modern of these ships could well have played critical roles in determining whether Britannia or Germania would ultimately hold Neptune&rsquo;s Trident.&#10;&#10;Prizes of War is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series that allows players to examine this question of alternate history. French and Russian ships from our Jutland and Mediterranean games are allocated to the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine, and included in a series of 10 battle and 11 operational scenarios set in and around the North Sea.&#10;&#10;Prizes of War includes 70 playing pieces (you will need to assemble these yourself) and this booklet. Playing all the scenarios in this supplement requires the included pieces plus maps and pieces from our Jutland game (and no others!).&#10;&#10;Prizes of War is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
