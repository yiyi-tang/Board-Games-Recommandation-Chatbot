If it is ladies against gentlemen, the former should have a certain number given them, or the latter should stand twice as far a way from the target.  When the players become expert, the game may be made more difficult by requiring that the balls shall bounce once on the table before going into the mouth.&#10;&#10;",

The men get a movement allowance equal to the roll of a die, and on an odd roll the player may continue with another turn. Rules for nearly every conceivable real-life soccer situation. Two egg timers are available to limit each player's time to move.&#10;However, the rules sometimes seem far-fetched and often do not give real choices to the players. This, of course, also affects the value as a training and simulation game, and the game vanished from the shops as quickly as it came.&#10;&#10;The 1987 edition contains a smaller variant of the game named &quot;Hallen-Cup&quot; on the reverse side of the board.&#10;&#10;",

However, you will lose one level per mask if they come off! Masks must be worn on your head, but not necessarily your face.&#10;&#10;The winning level must always be attained by killing a monster, regardless of what exact number that level is. And no, you can't win at Level 8 by wearing two Masks on Halloween.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Mask is a freebie from Steve Jackson Games and can be downloaded as a PDF from their e23 store.

The publisher has released a different silver piece every year since. Typically the coins can only be obtained as promo items at tournaments, game shows, or conventions. Sometimes they are included with game purchases made directly from the publisher.&#10;&#10;In December 2009, a limited number of Munchkin Christmas Coins were put up for sale. These were a pair of 2010 coins colored red and green. The same was done a year later with 2011 coins. No Christmas coins, however, were released in December 2011. The Christmas coins have additional rules above and beyond the standard monthly rule.&#10;&#10;In April 2010, the Munchkin Blue Silver Piece was included in issue #122 of Game Trade Magazine.

    "Description": "Die Kriegskunst is a Seven Years War miniatures wargaming rules set based on the General de Brigade system.  From the designer's website:&#10;&#10;One of the biggest differences is the figure scale (1=40 rather than 1=20). Then there's the way you move your units around. In GdeB the orders system means that you can't always do what you'd like and when you would like it. In Die Kriegskunst this is even more apparent, as we've made it a little harder to change orders. We've also introduced a new type - the &quot;Approach&quot; order - used to recreate those great Frederickean flank marches. Is &quot;Frederickean a word? Well, it is now! Even more restricting is the way units manoeuvre. there are no columns (well, only in really limited situations like storming breaches), and in the age of linear warfare, moving a brigade from column of march into line was a complicated business.&#10;&#10;We think we've found a way to simulate this fairly simply, but even so you really have to figure out where your troops are going and where they'll deploy well in advance. For example, a battalion in column of march (one stand behind the other) has to wheel to the right, then halt. the next turn it moves all the stands through 90 degrees, so that they no face the enemy - thereby forming a line.  Now, if you imagine doing this for a whole brigade, then for a division-sized force with one or more brigades forming a second line, and you've got some idea of how tricky the whole thing is. Of course, you can start your games in line, facing the enemy and raring to go, but we needed to produce a system to get the guys there in the first place!&#10;&#10;Other differences include modifications to the firing mechanics, a new system for firing at chargers (charging cavalry into formed infantry is rarely a smart move), and a downgrading of skirmishers. While these may sound like little more than little tweaks, they actually represent a lot of work and experimentation - trying to keep the basics of the existing system while adapting it to reflect the linear tactics of the period.&#10;&#10;Basing is the same as for other General de Brigade sets (although we use slightly larger bases ourselves - four 28mm infantry figures on a 40x40mm base). A full strength Prussian battalion is 20 figures, an Austrian one is 24, and a Russian one is 16. Heavy cavalry ride around in 20 man units, although the Russians should really be smaller due to their chronic cavalry resupply problems - 12 man for Cuirassier units and 16 for others. I just have to have more Russians to make up for the small units - and of course there's my pretty but less than effective Cossack horde...&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the mad wizard in the next county is trying to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules at the Decktet Wiki&#10;&#10;&#10;The game was originally released in 2008 with a different theme:&#10;&#10;You and your roommate have lived together for years, so your collections of geek totems have become hopelessly intermingled. There are shelves full of rare anime, cabinets full of prized board games, and so on. But now neither of you can say which is whose. Today you are both moving out and heading your separate ways, and all of your friends are here to help you pack. You want to take as much as possible, but you can't let your roommate see you packing the contested collections. With some manipulation and a little luck, though, your friends will pack them for you. It's only a short time before the moving vans arrive!&#10;&#10;",

Two rivaling mafia families are fighting for control of the city, and they use all means available.&#10;The major is corrupt, the police powerless and the villagers despair...&#10;&#10;In the game Mafia the goal, you goal is to become the new Godfather in Calozone's underworld. By placing mafioso pieces on strategic places you try to get control of 5 of the city's 9 areas before your opponent.

But beware: One smart move may create a chain reaction on the board, and the road from success to fiasco is short.&#10;&#10;Mafia may be played as an exiting duel game for 2, or as a fierce team game for 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;(Translated from the box in Norwegian)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game (the name means &quot;demimonde&quot;) was designed by the German writer and cartoonist Kurt Halbritter and was published 3 years after his death by his widow. 120 image tiles, drawn in his typical style, and 10 text tiles can be used by the players to lay &quot;tableaux&quot; or play a dominoes variant if following one of the three variants that come with the game. The images and texts range from the funny through slightly erotic to absurd. However, the author himself makes it clear that this is not meant to be a game in the first place but rather a flight of fantasy for the players: &quot;Whoever did not have to suppress his play instinct from earliest youth will know immediately what to do with the tiles, and will have a foreboding of the sinful diversity of variations.&quot; But, since &quot;the Germans always want to win something&quot; (Kurt Halbritter, but also Arno Schmidt), he provided some rules nevertheless: Demimonde Dominoes, Basic Demimonde and Demimonde Tableau. The aim is, in all variations, to get rid of one's tiles first (or not to be caught to be the last with tiles left). The tiles have a varying number of points on their backs which can be used for some kind of scoring system.&#10;The game comes in a flat, long box with a cardboard sleeve.&#10;More samples from the cover text: &quot;...tile-laying fun from the erotic flora, ... designed and drawn in colour for pan flautists, Faun girls and creation engineers&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

As the idea developed and solidified many staff and board members contributed to its final format and design.  The game pieces were painted and packaged by workshop clients.  With training and supervision, they also collated and packaged the Landmark Cards, Investment Cards, and money.  The final product was then assembled and put through a shrink wrap machine.  It is the hope of Villa Esperanza that &quot;The Pride of Pasadena&quot; will provide ongoing and meaningful work for the handicapped adults, along with representing our city in an entertaining and aesthetic way.  We at Villa Esperanza are proud of Pasadena and our contribution to the city.&#10;&#10;Object:  The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through purchasing the controlling interest in cultural and historical landmarks of Pasadena.&quot;&#10;&#10;Not from the rules:&#10;&#10;A monopoly variant.&#10;&#10;",

Plotted over a former military training camp turned into an airfield, this track has been a staple in North America since the 1930&rsquo;s. Each year, the 12 hours of Sebring take place there: an endurance race whose slightly uneven course gives drivers the chance to test the resilience of their vehicle in the hot and dry (when is it not humid?) Florida weather.&#10;&#10;The second track of this expansion offers street racing fans the chance to drive wildly in the streets of Chicago - in the East Park area, to be precise. This track offers an urban terrain which alternates between curves and straight lines. This mad race in the heart of city traffic will give drivers a chance to drive along the impressive Aon Center, one of the tallest skyscrapers of the city, to cross the Lake Shore East Park and its three tightly woven lanes (be careful about collisions!), and then rush along the inner port before finally crossing two vertigo-inducing bridges.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a collection of tribes they try to smite and make more devout by playing &quot;plague cards&quot; on them. But since you can also smite your opponents tribes, you have to be careful.

It is not a game for the conservative or squeamish and is not advised unless you are up for a game which may cause extreme inebriation and one's consequent actions we know so well so BE WARNED!!!&#10;&#10;The game comprises 52 cards - 13 sets of 4 identical cards with specific drinking related actions attributed to each of the 13 different cards.&#10;&#10;The 52 cards are placed face down, chandelier-style around an empty glass. The players then place themselves around the table with their preferred drinks. The game ensues in a clockwise direction with each person in turn flipping a card onto the table for all to see and responding to the action on the underside of the card. But beware, the rest of the players must all be attentive as there are 'reaction' cards like the 'HIJACK' card which requires every player to respond to the card as soon as possible.&#10;&#10;There is no winner to the game, only one poor unfortunate sod, who will have the misfortune of flipping the fourth and final GROG card. As the game progresses, every time one of these cards are flipped, the 'flipper' will pour a tot of his/her beverage into the glass in the middle of the table. So by the time the fourth GROG card is flipped, there should be an alcoholic concoction of at least 3 tots of whatever the respective GROG flippers' beverages were. The fourth GROG flipper (the loser) must then pour a tot of their beverage into the glass and down it (OUCH!!!) That terminates the game and you may then gather all the cards together and play again until you have had enough... (or fallen down)&#10;&#10;",

In Market Maker, you will buy and sell shares of a single company&rsquo;s stock with other players.  At the beginning of every game, the stock price starts at 100, and each card moves the price up or down.  Most Market Maker cards have a news headline on them.  These headlines represent real corporate, government, technology, economic, and other events that have affected the prices of real stocks in the market.&#10; Each player gets 2 private cards, and 5 cards are dealt face-down to the table.  The 2 private cards you were dealt are your Research Reports, and the information on them will move the stock price up or down, depending on whether the news is good or back for shareholders.  Just like the company research reports published by real analyst firms, this information gives you a trading advantage over others with less knowledge.&#10;&#10;In Market Maker, you will buy and sell shares of a single company&rsquo;s stock with other players.  To make a profit when trading stocks, you will need to buy shares at a low price and sell them at a higher price.  When you buy low and sell high, the difference between those 2 prices is your profit.  At the end of the of the game, everyone&rsquo;s Research Reports will be made public, and the final closing price will be 100 plus or minus all the cards that were dealt.  Players close out their trades with each other at the final closing price, and the person with the highest profit is the winner!&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.mktmkr.com/&#10;&#10;",

In the midst of combat the psychological heart of the game unfolds; the players must outwit their opponent by looking for tells, bluffing, and knowing their adversary better than he knows himself.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://ballz.ababa.net/deadlyharmony/game.html&#10;&#10;",

After both sides realized this stalemate results of their respective positions, the English send forward their bowmen, forcing the Scots to attack.&#10;&#10;Due to their poor position taken in the morning the Scots managed to attack ill-fated. When it became clear that the battle was going in favor of the English, Robert Stewart and the Earl of March fled, abandoning David II's battalion to face the enemy alone. Late in the afternoon, the king's own battalion attempted to retreat. The retreat was unsuccessful and David II was captured (though not without difficulty) while the rest of the Scottish army was pursued for more than twenty miles, resulting in more than 7,000 men casualties (by just 100 men English casualties!).&#10;&#10;",

Depending on his quality he will have a certain number of command points (variable by dice roll) to use in that turn. Easy things take few command points, more complex things take more points.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to play quickly, each scale ten minute turn should, with a couple of games under your belt, take no more than ten minutes of real time, so there will be less down time than many &quot;IGOUGO&quot; rule systems.&#10;&#10;",

You get 20 circular discs in a tin (like a traditional shoeshine tin, see image gallery); each disc shows a black-and-white picture and is sliced into three sectors. Three very similar game variants are described in the small rule leaflet: Free for all, team play, group play. In all variants, the disc sectors are mixed and placed on the table face down. Now players openly look at some pieces (3 per player in free for all, 2 per partner in team play); if the pieces match, i.e. show a complete picture, the player/team may keep them, otherwise they are turned face-down again and play passes to the next player (in traditional &quot;Memory&quot; fashion). At game end, each complete picture disc scores one point.&#10;The pictures come in 5 groups of 4 discs each: Symbols (zodiacs, wiring schema, sports, signals), Fonts (musical notes, handwriting, typewriter, Japanese), Small Things (buttons, paperclips, matches, tacks), Structures (millimeter grid paper, wood, knitting, honeycomb), Currency (coins, bills, stamps, cheques). A rule &quot;for experienced players&quot; recommends to award extra points if more than one picture of the same group has been collected.&#10;&#10;",

If the asked player has that fairy, one card of that fairy is given to the asking player, who then puts the pair in front of them and continues their turn by asking another player for another fairy. If the asking player does not get a fairy from an opponent they draw from the deck. If they get the fairy they had asked for, they place the pair in front of them and continue their turn. If not, then the turn passes to the left.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted and at least one player is out of cards. Whoever has the most pairs wins.&#10;&#10;",

The counters (nyi baro; literally &quot;child of bar&eacute;&quot;) are pebbles, seeds or balls made of dried mud.&#10;&#10;The game is based on much counting and calculation.&#10;&#10;Bar&eacute; was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971.

    "Description": "According to Mancala World:&#10;&#10;Cenne (literally &quot;beautiful&quot; in Tulu) is a mancala game of the Tuluva in Southern India with several unusual game mechanisms, some of which remind of the totally unrelated Ethiopian game of Lamlameta. It was first described in 1986 by the ethnologue Peter J. Claus, professor at the State University of California at Hayward (USA).&#10;&#10;The game plays an important role in the Siri cult of South Kanara. It is prohibited to play the game after the rice seedlings (neji) are in the growing fields and up to harvest time. There is an old custom in the Bant caste of playing the game by the male head's of the boy's and girl's families during the marriage negotiation ceremonies (niscaya). It is regarded a good omen if the girl's party loses. The game is also often associated in Siri legends. Another prohibition is to lend out the board overnight and gambling. More prohibitions concern the players. Sisters are not permitted to play the game together (not even classificatory sisters, e.g. a woman with her husband's sister), nor are brothers (including classificatory brothers, e.g. mother's brother and sister's son), nor husband and wife. The game is not normally played among men except in association with marriage alliance. The social prohibitions coincide with an asymmetrical relationship within families characterized by potential feelings of jealousy, competition, aggression and self-interest which could destroy the strength and unity of a matrilineal family.&#10;&#10;The Cenne board is usually made from hard, dense wood such as rosewood or ebony. The counters are the small seeds of the arnotto tree (Bixa orellana), the coral tree (Erythrina caffra) or cowrie shells.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board called mane has 14 holes (variously called guri (&quot;pit&quot;), illu (&quot;house&quot;) or kone (&quot;room&quot;)) arranged in two rows and two larger hollows at either end used for storing captured seeds. Each player owns the store to his right.&#10;&#10;Initially there are four seeds (parelu or kayi) in each hole.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes in the ensuing holes, one by one, in a counterclockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole, its contents are lifted for another lap.&#10;&#10;During a move a seed may not be dropped into a hole containing three seeds (called murte) unless the player has just one seed seed in his hand.&#10;&#10;In rare circumstances all holes may have three seeds. If the player still has one or several seeds in hand, he puts these in the hole to his far right (called atappe (&quot;heap&quot;)) without capturing them. The opponent then takes the three seeds from his heap and drops one of them in his opponent's heap, another one in that hole from which he removed the seeds and the last one in the next adjacent hole on his side, giving it four seeds, which he then captures, thus ending the move.&#10;&#10;This seed, which would become a singleton, is called jeppe (&quot;sleeper&quot;) and may not be used to begin the next turn.&#10;&#10;If the last seed in hand is placed into a murte, its contents becomes wanasu (&quot;meal&quot;), that is, all four seeds are captured and put in the player's store.&#10;&#10;Afterwards the player continues his move by distributing the seeds of the following hole.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed is placed in an empty hole, when the hole following a wanasu is empty or after an atappe play.&#10;&#10;The game is played until a player can demonstrate at his turn that in four consecutive draws he does not have to place a seed in one of his opponent's holes. That player wins the seeds that are still remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;The player who captured more groups of four has won the round.&#10;&#10;The successive rounds are played by filling the holes on the player's side with his winnings. Holes that cannot be filled are not used in the next round. It is possible, albeit difficult, to reconquer lost holes. Seeds that are not used in the round are stored as if they were captures.&#10;&#10;The game is over when at the beginning of a round a player can fill less than four holes. The phrase to claim victory is poli maipunu (&quot;plunder&quot;).&#10;&#10;",

From Mancala World:&#10;&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Daramutu&#10;&#10;Daramutu is a mancala game, which is played by village women in Sri Lanka with astonishing rapidity. The game was first described by Henry Parker in 1909. He notes about them:&#10;&#10;&quot;Without counting the seeds (...) they seem to know instinctively, perhaps as the result of long practice, at which hole it is best to begin in order to effect captures. An inexperienced person has no chance of beating them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board called olinda-poruwa has 14 holes (wala) arranged in two rows (pila). Between them are two rectangular hollows serving as stores for the captures.&#10;&#10;Initially there are four seeds (indiya, pl. indi) in each hole, usually from the Olinda creeper (Abrus precatorius).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player sows (ihinawa) the contents of one of his holes, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. The direction of play (clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the first player and then adhered to throughout the game by both players.&#10;&#10;When the last seed falls into an occupied hole, which contained three or more seeds, its contents (including the last dropped seed) are sown in another lap.&#10;&#10;A singleton is called puta (&quot;son&quot;), a hole containing two seeds naga (&quot;daughter&quot;).&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an empty hole, a puta or a naga on either side of the board, the contents of the opposite hole are &quot;eaten&quot; (innawa). The captures are collected in the store.&#10;&#10;If the opposite hole is empty, nothing is captured.&#10;&#10;A turn always ends by dropping the last seed in hand into an empty hole, a puta or a naga.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when a player has nothing to move with at the start of his turn. The remaining seeds that are not yet captured are won by the player who could move last.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who captured more seeds.&#10;&#10;",

The game of warriors, which is never played by woman, is usually played by teams of eight. &#10;It is said that the game was invented by Sindillo, the son of the first man, Maitoumbe, when he was an old man. According to a legend, he also discovered honey which then became a food of the Masai. The first European to describe En Geh&eacute; was the German Moritz Merker of the Imperial Protection Troops (Kaiserliche Schutztruppe) of German East Africa in 1904. He is also regarded to be the first ethnologue of the Masai.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board which consists of two rows of 40 - 50 holes each. The holes (sing.: en gurt&oacute;to; pl.: 'n gurt&oacute;t) are dug into the ground. Each team controls one row (sing.: ol m&aacute;tua; pl.: el m&aacute;tuan). &#10;Each hole contains at the beginning four counters (sing.: os soid; l.: es soido). The Masai take small pebbles or seeds of the ol gulangulu (Caesalpinia bonduc). Depending on the size of the board 320 - 400 counters are needed.&#10;&#10;At his turn a member of the team picks up the contents of a hole and distributes the stones (or seeds), one by one, in counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes. &#10;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. &#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. &#10;If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole of the team's own row, the contents of the opposite enemy hole are captured. If anything was captured, then the stone which caused the capture is also taken. &#10;The game ends when one team can't move. &#10;The stones which are still left on the board, are captured by the team which could move last. &#10;The team who captured more stones wins the game. &#10;If both teams captured the same number of stones, the game is a draw.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World:&#10;&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Giuthi&#10;&#10;&quot;Giuthi (&quot;to place&quot;, &quot;to distribute&quot;) is a mancala game of the Kikuyu and the Embu in Kenya. It was a popular pastime of young boys when they were herding cattle of goats. The game is almost forgotten today. There were special terms for certain moves and various holes, but no one seems to remember them now.&#10;&#10;The board was usually dug into the ground. The game was played with small pebbles or the seeds of the mubuthi tree (Caesalpinia volkensii).&#10;&#10;Giuthi was first described in 1925 by the English ethnologue Orde Brown in his book The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Giuthi is played on two-rank boards numbering from five to ten holes per row.&#10;&#10;The number of stones in each pit varies from four to nine. Four is preferred on the smallest boards, six on the medium-sized ones and eight on the larger boards. Nine stones per hole on a two-by-ten board gives the first player a big advantage and could therefore be regarded as a kind of handicap when two players of unequal strength are playing.&#10;&#10;Each turn starts with a hole that contains at least two seeds.&#10;&#10;The seeds are either distributed in the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes in the first lap of a move.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are distributed in another lap in the opposite direction.&#10;&#10;If the last seeds falls into an empty hole of your own side, the player moves again, unless he has placed at least one seed into an enemy hole during this move.&#10;&#10;If the last seeds falls in one of your empty holes and you have played into the opponent's territory (see proverb (bottom)), then you capture the seeds in the enemy hole just across and the last seed that was distributed.&#10;&#10;If this empty hole is followed in an unbroken chain by more empty holes on your side, then the seeds in the opposite holes are also captured.&#10;&#10;When the last seed falls into an empty hole of your oponent, the turn is over.&#10;&#10;A player must move if he can. He must pass, if he can't, but must move again, if he has something to play with.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no longer any moves can be made or when the board position repeats.&#10;&#10;Each player scores as many points as he has captured seeds and as he has seeds in his holes at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player who has more points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;The following board sizes were recorded by ethnologues: &#10;&#10;     2 x 5 holes. Number of seeds not given. &#10;     2 x 6 holes with 4 seeds per hole. For beginners. &#10;     2 x 7 holes with 6 seeds per hole. According to Driedger a typical starting arrangment among the Kikuyu. &#10;     2 x 8 holes with 4 seeds per hole. Said to be the most popular variant when played on a casual basis. &#10;     2 x 10 holes with 9 seeds per hole. Quite unbalanced - the first player can capture 10 seeds in the first turn without being threatened in the next. &#10;&#10;&#10;The most challenging variant that is well balanced is played on a 2x10 board with 8 seeds per hole.&#10;&#10;Giuthi proverb:&#10;&#10;You can't steal the cattle of another man without entering his land!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

They live in one of the least accessible areas of Ethiopia and many of them are heavily armed with guns.&#10;&#10;The game is a recreation of adult males who play in the shade of trees. The board is dug in the ground.&#10;&#10;Huroy was first recorded by the British anthropologist David Turton in the early 1970s who was the first European to visit them. At this time the Mursi didn't even know that they live in a country called Ethiopia.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a two-row board of six holes (holog, pl. hologunya) per row. One end of the board is called saba (&quot;head&quot;), the other end karenni (&quot;downstream&quot;). Initially each hole contains four stones (be, pl. benna, also known as benna huroin = &quot;huroy stones&quot;).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one by one into the ensuing holes. The move ends after a single lap.&#10;&#10;If, at the start of his turn, a player has a singleton and the opponent's opposite hole is occupied, he captures the contents of both these holes. Note that a capture is not effected by alighting in an empty hole.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has nothing to move with. The remaining stones are won by the player who moved last.&#10;&#10;The player who has captured more stones wins the game. Winning a game is referred to as &quot;driving a cow&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players try to achieve 10 victories called katog uli (&quot;I drive a bull.&quot;).&#10;&#10;Huroy Sayings&#10;&#10;If a player places his penultimalte stone into his last hole of the saba end and the last stone into the opposite hole, he might say karag saba (&quot;I hit the head.&quot;). At the other end of the board he says karag karenni (&quot;I hit downstream.&quot;).&#10;&#10;If a player captures just a single stone from an opponent's hole, he would say kamati lili (&quot;I am eating two holes opposite each other.&quot;). If he captures more, he would remark kamati uro (&quot;I am drinking milk.&quot;).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Isolo (according to Kalumbete also called isumbi) is the name given to three related mancala games played by the Sukuma, in Tanzania. This is the more simple one, the &quot;women's game&quot; (in fact, the girls' game).&#10;&#10;The game begins with 2 seeds per hole. (In a 4x8 grid of holes with one of the longer sides facing each player.) On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. &#10;Each player controls the two rows closer to her. &#10;Moves are multiple lap. &#10;On her turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on her side and sows them one by one on the following holes on her side, on a counterclockwise sense. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture she takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and on the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds she captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. &#10;If on her turn a player can not move (she has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) she has lost the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;That is the basic game. An intermediate form is:&#10;&#10;&quot;This is the middle (according to difficulty) one, the &quot;boys' game&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game begins with a special position&quot; Thesame board as the above but with a non-uniform starting position. 17 seeds start in the pit at the bottom right corner for each player. The adjacent pit in the same row starts with 2 seeds as does each other pit in the same row thereafter. In the middle two rows, pits with an empty pit behind them (i.e., closer to the nearer player) start with 2 seeds and the hole diagonally next to the corner starts wth 1 seed on each side. Other pits start empty.&#10;&#10;&quot;On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. &#10;Each player controls the two rows closer to him. &#10;General rules&#10;General rules are as those of women's game. &#10;Moves are multiple lap. &#10;On his turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on his side and sows them one by one on the following holes on his side, on a counterclockwise sense. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture he takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and in the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds he captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. &#10;If on his turn a player can not move (he has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) he has lost the game. &#10;Overture&#10;At the beginning of the game some special rules apply. &#10;Both pits containing 17 seeds are called ng'hana (privileged pits). &#10;During the player's overture (each player overture can last differently) seeds are sowed only on his 14 left most holes, and the contents of the ng'hana can not be captured.&#10;&#10;Once a player decides to (or must, as all other pits are empty or singletons) play the ng'hana his overture is over, he sows the seeds on the full board and all his seeds can be captured, from any pit. However, he can not capture the opponent's ng'hana as far as the opponent is still playing his own overture. &quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "K&acirc;ra is a mancala game, which is played by the Bagara in Kordofan Province, Sudan, primarily during the fasting month of Ramadan. It was first described by R. Davies in 1925.&#10;&#10;The counters are generally small balls of dried clay, called t&ucirc;b (&quot;bricks&quot;). A hole can become very full of balls, with the result that it is difficult to foresee the effect of moving its contents.&#10;&#10;According to Davies:&#10;&#10;&#10;        this explains an otherwise obscure allusion to the celebrated Sheikh Musa M&acirc;dibbo, late nazir of the Rizeigat tribe, as bahr K&acirc;ra ghar&icirc;g - &quot;a deep sea of k&acirc;ra&quot;. The nazir's reputation was that he would sit in council with his sheikhs and elders, and would listen to all their opinions, but would not disclose his own, so that the result of the &quot;meglis&quot; was as unpredictable as that of moving the contents of a very full house at k&acirc;ra.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;K&acirc;ra is rather unusual since it can be played by any number of players and seems to work very well when played by four. Each player owns three consecutive holes (called &quot;houses&quot;) and one store hole called makk&acirc;la (plural: mak&acirc;k&icirc;l). The playing holes are arranged in a circle with the mak&acirc;k&icirc;l in the center.&#10;&#10;Each house has seven balls at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in single laps and in a counter-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the move ends in an opponent's hole or in your own right-hand one, the player &quot;eats&quot; the contents of all enemy holes containing 2, 4 or 6 balls.&#10;&#10;If a player can't move, he passes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when nothing can be ever captured again. The winner is the person who captured most balls.&#10;&#10;Although not stated by Davies, according to Ralf Gering it might be a good idea that diagonally opposite players must form a team to prevent unfair coalitions during the game.&#10;&#10;",

The board is usually dug in the earth and the players, mostly adult women and men, are often surrounded by a curious crowd of spectators.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Katro is played on a 6x6-board, a very unusual size for a mancala game. Each player owns one half (upper or lower) of the board.&#10;&#10;Initially there are two stones in each hole.&#10;&#10;You must start your move in the outermost row of your side which has a non-empty hole. Singletons can also be moved.&#10;&#10;Moves are multi-lap. As in four-rank Mancala you only move on your side.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, all contents are picked up and are distributed one by one in the following holes by continuing in the same direction.&#10;&#10;If the last stone of a lap is dropped into a non-empty hole which is directly opposite to a non-empty hole of your opponent, all the contents of his hole are captured. His stones and the contents of your own hole are then distributed in a new lap starting in the next hole on your side. The following conditions must be met to effect a capture:&#10;&#10;&#10;     As long as you have a non-empty hole in your innermost row, you may only capture from your innermost row. When your innermost row is empty you capture from your central row, if this row is also empty, you capture from your outermost row. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     You may only capture opponent's stones from his innermost row as long as there are still non-empty holes. If these holes are all empty you may capture stones from your opponent's central row. If this row is also empty you capture opponent's stones from his outermost row. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a boustrophedon manner. The direction of play is either (see notation below) abcdefghijklmnopqrfedcbalkj or alkjihgrqponmabcdefgh.&#10;&#10;Notation&#10;&#10;a b c d e f&#10;l k j i h g&#10;m n o p q r&#10;M N O P Q R&#10;L K J I H G&#10;A B C D E F&#10;&#10;Players are not permitted to pass a move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no move. The player who moved last is declared winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikimanqala:&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Kiela&#10;&#10;Kiela is a mancala game played by Kimbundu (sometimes called Mbundu, Loanda or Luanda) speaking people in northern Angola. The game plays an important role in the oral literature and it is said to be a game of peace because &quot;it can turn enemies into friends&quot;. On the 5th of January, 1999, the Government of Angola instituted the Pr&eacute;mio Kiela, a tournament which now offers prizes up to 1,500 US$ for the winner. &#10;The most important source on the game is a book by Bernardo Campos. Although he uses the name kiela (&quot;puzzle&quot;, &quot;mind game&quot;) both for the game itself and also for the kind of game (i.e., mancala) in a rather confusing manner, it was possible to extract the rules from it.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Kiela is played on a board made by four rows of ten holes. Each player controls the two rows closest to him. &#10;At the beginning there are two stones in each hole of the outer rows and two stones in each of the four right holes of the inner row of each player. &#10;For a beginners game it is suggested to start playing with just one seed per hole, instead of two, in the same holes.&#10;&#10;At your turn you take all the stones from a hole belonging to your side of the board, which contains two or more seeds, and sow them anti-clockwise (i.e., you put one on each of the following holes, without skipping one, all around your two rows). For a beginners game, it is suggested that they can move even if there is a single stone. &#10;If the last stone lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. &#10;If the last stone lands in an occupied hole all these stones (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are picked up and you keep on sowing. &#10;     If this occupied hole is in the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent is occupied, the stones of this hole are captured and you keep on sowing with them starting in the hole following the one that allowed you to capture. &#10;     If the outer hole of the opponent is also occupied, you capture also its stones, and sow with the stones from both opponent's holes. &#10;When a player cannot move (i.e., all his holes are empty or contain single stones), he has lost. For a beginners game, only if all his holes are empty, as they are allowed to move singletons. &#10;Expert players may, at their first turn, rearrange the stones on their side. &quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kisolo (also called Cisolo in Kasai) is a mancala type game played by the Luba, Lulua and Songye in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Initially there are three seeds (makombo) in each hole.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot capture, he starts his turn by emptying one of his holes and then distributes its contents one by one counterclockwise into the following holes. When he can't capture (see below), he makes a new lap by distributing the contents of the hole following the hole in which he dropped the last seed in hand. The move ends when the last hole is followed by an empty one. It is either possible to capture before the actual move starts or during a move.&#10;&#10;If, at the beginning of a turn, two inner holes (one from each player) opposite to each other contain seeds, the enemy seeds of the opposite hole and, if there are any, of the enemy hole of the same file behind it are picked up and then distributed counterclockwise on the own side. The first seed must be put into the hole which effected the capture. This kind of capturing is compulsory, but the player is free to decide from which holes he captures when he has more than one choice.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole and the following hole is in the inner row and contains seeds, the contents of the opposite enemy hole in the opponent's inner row are captured and also the seeds in the outer enemy hole just behind it. Again, the captured seeds are distributed on the player's own side, starting in the hole which effected the capture (that is, straight opposite the captured holes).&#10;&#10;The player who captures all seeds of his opponent's inner holes is declared winner, no matter how many seeds his opponent still has in his outer row. The game is a draw, if a move doesn't end. Perpetual sowing occurs, for instance, if empty holes alternate with holes containing one seed, when at the beginning of the turn, no two inner holes opposite of each other have seeds.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game was first described by Henry Parker in 1909. It is almost exclusively played by women, especially at the season of New Year. An average game takes about 30 moves.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board called olinda-poruwa has 14 holes (wala) arranged in two rows (pila). Between them are two rectangular hollows serving as stores for the captures. &#10;Initially there are four seeds (indiya, pl. indi) in each hole, usually from the Olinda creeper (Abrus precatorius).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player sows (ihinawa) the contents of one of his holes one by one into the following holes. The direction of play (clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the first player and then adhered to throughout the game by both players. &#10;The first turn of the game must be commenced from one of the two end holes. &#10;A seed may not be placed into a hole containing three seeds except it is the last one sown. &#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole (any number but three) its contents are picked up and distributed in another lap. &#10;If the last seed is dropped into a hole containing three seeds, its contents including the last seed sown are &quot;eaten&quot; (innawa) and the turn ends. The captures are collected in the store. &#10;If the contents of an end hole are captured, this hole is said to be &quot;tied&quot; (baenda). A baenda is owned by the player who effected the capture. A move or lap cannot start from a tied hole. When a player sows his last seed into a baenda, his turn ends and the player &quot;sits down&quot;. Any seeds sown into a tied hole are owned by the player who made the baenda. &#10;The game is finished when a player has nothing to move with at the start of his turn. The remaining seeds that are not yet captured or trapped in a baenda are won by the player who could move last. &#10;The game is won by the player who won most seeds. &quot;&#10;&#10;",
