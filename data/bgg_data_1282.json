He then begins the first round by turning the top card of the deck face up. Every card has one large symbol in the center and one smaller symbol in a ring around the center. There are 10 different symbols and may be in one of 8 different colors. The task of all participants is to search for the icon from the center of the final flipped card on the outer circle of the other three visible cards. The paired cards must match in both shape and color. As soon as one of the opponents finds such a card, he must quickly slap his palm on it and take the card.&#10;&#10;It can very easily happen that there is no matching card on the table. In this case the next player add the central card to other three and flips over a new card to be matched with those four.&#10;&#10;The game continues by replenishing cards so that there are always at least three on the table for searching. The game ends when one player collects a specified number of cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns flipping over one card in the center of the table and each card displays only 8 of the 10 symbols shown on token. Players simultaneously study the card to figure out which two symbols are missing. When a player figures one out, she places their token with the missing symbol face down in front of them. She does the same when she does the same when figure out the second one and shouts &quot;Keetoo!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then she must flip her remaining 8 tokens face down while the other players keep searching for the missing symbols.

One pair of dice depicts a sword, a crown, and fire--each one corresponding to one of the characters. The other pair shows colors: blue, yellow, and red--again, each one corresponding to one of the characters. The game also has 20 counters.&#10;&#10;Players roll either pair of dice. If they roll the dice with pictures and each dice shows a different character, players grab for the third character not shown on the dice. Whoever grabs the character first gets one counter. If the dice match and show the same character, players grab for that figurine and the first to get it takes a counter. Play works the same way if players roll the dice with colors on them.&#10;&#10;The first player to get five counters wins! &#10;Putting hands, eyes and minds together to choose which wooden figurine to grab according to the colors and images from the roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;Simple, intuitive and fun &ndash; Fipolino!&#10;&#10;",

The beginning child looks for an animal with a one-dot from his cards, says its name and places the card face up. Who has the same animal with two dots, must place that card, the player with the third matching card (three dots) also places and may then call the next animal with a one-dot and place it, etc. The winner is whoever runs out of cards first.&#10; 2. The shuffled cards remain in a pile with their backs up and are picked up individually in turn. Everyone who gets a card with a 1 dot, puts it down after calling it out. Then the cards with two dots  may also be laid out, whoever has the third matching card may take the trio. The winner is whoever has the most cards last. If you make a mistake, you have to moan or cackle etc. depending on the animal with which you did something wrong.&#10; 3. The game can also be played like a Schwarzer Peter&quot;, the black dog is then Peter, the other two dogs are removed from the game beforehand.&#10;&#10;Each game in the order above uses slightly more complex rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PSYCHOPATH&#10;&#10;A Killer Card Game for 1 to 4 Campers and One Psycho!&#10;&#10;Psychopath is a &lsquo;One vs. Many&rsquo; card game where one player acts as the Psychopath - a deranged killer attempting to hunt down and kill the Camper players using a variety of Actions and Items at his disposal. The Camper players try to survive the Psychopath&rsquo;s attacks and hope for rescue using the Actions, Items, Allies and Skills available in their deck of cards. If the Psychopath manages to kill all the Campers, he wins the game! However, if at least one Camper survives or manages to become rescued, the Campers win! Psychopath can also be played as a Campaign, with both sides scoring points over a predetermined number of games.&#10;&#10;Psychopath is presented with a campy B-Horror Movie flavor splashed with inane commentary and featuring over-the-top, and sometimes gruesome, imagery!&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;Psychopath is played in rounds. At the start of each round all players secretly select a card from their hand to be played as their starting card and place it face down on the table. When all players have done so, cards are then revealed to show the location each players is at: the Lake, the Cabin, the Shed, or the Woods. Campers unlucky enough to be at the same location as the Psychopath enter into a Struggle with him.&#10;&#10;During this Struggle, the Psychopath and Campers take turns playing cards from their hand and using Keep in Play cards they have on the table they have previously put into play. Campers can play Allies, Skills, Items and Actions to bolster their defense, attempt to Escape or become Rescued, and to thwart the attacks made by the Psychopath. The Psychopath will play Items and Actions to cause Wounds to the Campers in order to weaken or kill them. After players in a Struggle have played all the cards they wish, Struggles are resolved with Campers losing cards from their hand of cards equal to the number of Wounds they suffered. If a Camper suffers more Wounds than the cards in their hand, they are killed! The Psychopath suffers his Wounds by discarding that number of cards from the top of his deck of cards. If, at the start of the next draw Phase, the Psychopath has no cards remaining in his deck, the surviving Campers escape and the game is over!&#10;&#10;After all Struggles are resolved, if there are two or more Campers at the same location and they are not at the Psychopath's location, they may Collaborate by giving each other Items and Allies, and by strategizing (Campers cannot otherwise discuss strategy during the game). A new round then begins with the Campers each drawing a card from the Camper deck of cards and the Psychopath drawing cards from his deck to fill his hand of cards to its starting limit. Hand management is an important aspect of Psychopath; deciding when to play cards and when to save them in your hand for later use can mean the difference between Survival and Death!&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&#10;126 Thick Game Cards (60 for the Psychopath, 66 for the Campers)&#10;    1 Rulebook&#10;    1 Nice Shiny Box including a 4-Way Plastic Divider for the cards with Extra Space to hold Upcoming  Expansions!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

Building your own Supply Stashes is smart, but it is strategic to loot your neighbors&rsquo; Supply Stashes.

New equipment and mining opportunities await amongst the incredible new terrain pieces included in this set. The gates are housed in enormous caverns large enough for all manner of creatures to come through, and the shifting colours in the energy pylons make for an eye-catching centrepiece to your gaming table. New event cards shuffled into the deck will represent the reality-shifting nature of the nearby gate.&#10;&#10;There are three Cerberosa included in the set. These vicious beasts are deadly in close-assault and take advantage of the rules for poisoned attacks, further weakening their wounded victims. Cerberosa do not roll the Knowledge Die when they attack, instead coming with their own bespoke die. Its additional effects include crippling strikes that reduce your Skill pegs, frenzied attacks that target multiple opponents, and pure brute strength, adding further poisoned hits to their attacks.&#10;&#10;The Gates of Ry&rsquo;sa includes two Talos. Like the Cerberosa the Talos rolls its own bespoke dice when attacking representing the physical effects of its powerful energy blasts. These include knocking opponents from their feet, instilling panic, and even setting their victims on fire! Talos are also very tough to kill. Getting through their rock-like armour a first time will only make them stumble &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have to hit them again before they recover to permanently power them down.&#10;&#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Game of Power and Intrigue in the Gilded Age&#10;&#10;The war of the currents is raging. Thomas Edison&rsquo;s direct current is safe, cheap and simple, but weak. Nikola Tesla&rsquo;s alternating current is powerful, but complicated and occasionally deadly. Which technology will power New York City and then the world?&#10;&#10;As the leader of a fledgling electric company you must hire staff, build generators and power lines, win bids, complete projects&hellip;and sabotage the competition. Build your Electric Empire and power the gilded age.&#10;&#10;Electric Empires is an engine-building, worker placement game set in the gilded age of New York City. A unique shared reputation mechanism balances semi-cooperative strategy with cut-throat competition. Asymmetric gameplay means different power currents require different strategies and tactics providing great replayability.&#10;&#10;Electric Empires is played over the course of 10 years (rounds) each consisting of four quarters (turns). Each turn a player may take two actions: initiating a bid on a project, hiring or assigning workers, building generators, seeking financing or playing action cards.&#10;&#10;Each year (round) progress must be made on active projects, debt must be retired or interest paid and maintenance must be performed on in-play power generators.&#10;&#10;Completing projects is the main way to gain victory points. Each project represents providing power to a historic location in glided age New York City. Project contracts are acquired through bidding against competing players in terms of how much money you want to complete the project, how long it will take you and the current reputation of your electrical current AC or DC.&#10;&#10;In addition to the workers necessary to complete a project you must build generators to supply sufficient power. These generators must be either located adjacent to the project on the gameboard or connected by powerlines which you can also build. Power can be leased either from one of two public utilities or from a competing player using the same current. Projects can be lost due to a lack of progress or malfunctions. Players can sabotage competitors' projects and potentially take them over and gain the associated victory points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning of project bidding and generator placement is necessary to build an engine that will produce enough revenue to fund your commitments and enough energy to power projects once they are complete. If power to a completed project is disrupted, victory points from that project are not counted until power is restored.&#10;&#10;Each year (round) a new &quot;Annual Forecast&quot; card is drawn which sets unique conditions for all players for the duration of the year (round).&#10;&#10;Players may choose either Thomas Edison's preferred current, Direct Current (CD) or Nikola Tesla's Alternating Current (AC). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages leading to asymmetrical gameplay. Both currents (AC and DC) also have an associated reputation or public perception shared by all players using that current. A good reputation makes winning bids and getting financing easier. A negative reputation makes succeeding more difficult.&#10;&#10;At the end of year (round) ten, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They mean to turn the mountain to the service of Chaos by desecrating its every chamber through dark sorcery and brutal sacrifice. It was Khagra&rsquo;s sister Zarshia who led the warband into Beastgrave, but they soon became trapped in a gnashing chamber. Khagra wedged her shield between the cavern floor and the encroaching ceiling before carving a way out of the rocky gullet, and since then, the brutal warriors Cragan and Razek have turned to Khagra for direction. Zarshia has not abandoned her own ambitions, however, and is poised to overturn her upstart sibling when the opportunity arises.&#10;&#10;Claim the living mountain in the name of the Dark Gods with Khagra's Ravagers. They're tough, strong, and wield sorcerous power, giving you multiple ways to desecrate Direchasm.

Players head to the Hawaiian marketplace in a race to fill their baskets. Each player controls two pawns - one that can trade goods and one that can steal goods from the baskets of other players. There's a delicate balance as players map out their acquisition strategy - trade or steal - and all the while avoiding thievery themselves! Players begin with a basket containing three items. By landing one's trading pawn (Tally Trader) on various items, a player can trade up for more valuable goods, stepping up the value of the items in his basket. Maneuvering one's stealing pawn (Shifty Shorty) onto the same space as an opponent's trader gives him the opportunity to shortcut the whole system and pick up valuable goods the &quot;easy&quot; way. Trade and steal. Steal and trade. Twists, turns, and a little bit of luck keep it close until the end. Who will return triumphantly from the market as the Big Kahuna?&#10;&#10;Contents include: Game Board, 4 Trading Pawns, 4 Stealing Pawns, 2 Dice, 4 Trading Basket Placards, 54 Item Cards.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, myself may sneak fish from other cats and run away. The ultimate goal is to convert the fish to &quot;cash&quot;. You can eat fish, but you can not keep it as food for a long time. But if you can afford it, you can buy it whenever you like, &quot;cat can&quot; or &quot;crispy.&quot; Huh! What? Do cats be interested in money? The proverbs are already old like &quot;cats small-size&quot;. Even now even cats are doing business ... ....&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 5 cards from the deck. One card is put into the &quot;field&quot; from the first player, and each trick is processed.&#10;&#10;Cards are color-coded  &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;red&quot; and three types of &quot;role&quot;. And cards has a number from 0 to 9.&#10;&#10;The card issued by the first player becomes &quot;the lead card&quot;, and only the cards that match the color are effectively processed. Cards resolution processes &quot;roles&quot; in descending order of numbers.&#10;&#10;These cards are three types of &quot;roles&quot;. &quot;Fish&quot;, &quot;Cat&quot;, and &quot;Money&quot;. If you put out &quot;Fish&quot;, put it in your &quot;Feeding Area&quot;, and if it is &quot;Money&quot;, put it in your &quot;Feeding Area&quot;. To cash.

When Korvash grasped the hilt of the old blade he found in the tomb, his mind was consumed with dark visions; promises of a world on fire, and of his enemies kneeling before him. Filled with a desire to make his dreams a reality, he submitted to the presence within the sword, becoming its willing servant. Korvash would go on to take over his tribe, and lead them in a bloody conquest of the Hillsglade. Korvash&rsquo;s confidence and power grew with every victory. But the visions never stopped, and Scornblade&rsquo;s hunger was never sated.&#10;&#10;The life of Mariusz Demont has never been easy, despite being born into nobility. A member of the Moontouched, Mariusz showed no sign of lycanthropy, relegating him to a life of service to&#10;his older, more blessed brothers. Treated with contempt throughout his life, it was during an attack that left his father Angren dead that Mariusz&rsquo;s gift revealed itself. Exploding into a rage-filled beast, he slaughtered friend and foe alike, his years of torment blinding him to his bloodlust. Despised by his own people as a traitor, Mariusz counted none his ally as he continued his cursed existence.&#10;&#10;As Kilgore&rsquo;s armies grew, so too did the strength of his enemies. Many enemies were crushed on the battlefield, but others needed a subtler touch. These enemies attract the attention of Rath, Kilgore&rsquo;s most trusted and lethal assassin. A subterran of incredible agility and ferocity, he is the deadliest weapon in Kilgore&rsquo;s arsenal, able to slip quietly into any location, and execute his target. Rath served Kilgore loyally for many years, reveling in the chaos and destruction he wrought.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Add to the roster of your Super Fantasy Brawl Champions with the Art of War! This expansion adds Sulka, Ko'lel, and Ahket to your Champions. Let&rsquo;s take a look at them! Subtle and deceptive, Sulka manipulated her people into a civil war that consumed them, profiting herself with their suffering. Her dark magics and powers over the mind left both sides of the war as putty in her scaled hands, and soon Sulka was poised to control what little remained. Beneath her rule, her people turned to foul, long forbidden magics, and conquered Khemara in short order. Her empire would rule for hundreds of years, and it would be long past Sulka&rsquo;s time that her people would learn that their success was built on the machinations of evil and greed.&#10;&#10;Akhet, the Skylord of Khemara, ruled the nation of Khemara until its dying days. A proud and noble King, Akhet commanded the skies as the bravest warrior his people had ever known, ruling the largest dynasty in the history of Fabulosa. Akhet led the charge in any battle he was a part of, breaking the enemy with his tireless ferocity. Even when a dark and sorcerous force arose to lead their most hated foe to victory, the Skylord led the charge, determined to cast down this hidden evil and bring light to the darkest hour of his people.&#10;&#10;Records of the Darkmoon Occupation of Yunkaya speak of the legendary gnome Kolel, and her fearsome mount To&rsquo;paque. Armed with her deadly blowpipe, her combination of skill, speed, and tactical knowledge was believed to have saved thousands of her people, despite the destruction of her jungle. Whilst she is regarded as the greatest hero in Yunkayan history, to the Moontouched she is the boogeyman; she who brought fear to the forests.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gone Bunkers is a strategy card game. Players take turns building the ultimate hand until someone draws a war card and cannot defeat it. The deck is made up of all types of cards such as; troops, zombies, landmines and of course nukes! Even though your goal is to survive and fight off the war cards, it doesn't mean you can't nuke the player sitting next to you and destroy half their hand.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Players take turns by drawing and playing cards until a WAR card is drawn from the deck. Once a WAR card is drawn, that player must defeat that WAR card. Be diplomatic to avoid the WAR, try to fight or be destroyed.&#10;&#10;Taking your turn:&#10;Gather all your cards into your hand and look at them. Do one of the following:&#10;1. Draw from the draw pile. If it is a WAR card you can either play Diplomacy card and avoid the WAR or go to WAR and use your troops to defeat the WAR card. You must have the same or greater attack value (attack values are on troop cards) to win the WAR. If you cannot beat the WAR card's value, you lose.&#10;2.Play a card FACE UP on the discard pile and follow the instructions on the card. Note: Zombie cards are placed in front of players not on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Winning the game:&#10;Players will take turns drawing cards, builing their armies and surviving wars. Once one person loses all their cards then the person with the highest attack value (count up your troops attack values) left wins.&#10;&#10;Gameplay variations:&#10;Fight to the Death&#10;Play until there is only one player left&#10;&#10;15 Round Limit&#10;Play 15 rounds and whomever has the highest attack value left wins&#10;&#10;Gameplay Modes:&#10;2 Player Mode&#10;Start with 7 cards each. Each time a WAR card is drawn and a player wins at WAR or plays Diplomacy, put that WAR card back into the deck at random. This will ensure a player loses without the going through the entire deck.&#10;&#10;Safe Haven Mode (Fan Favorite)&#10;Do the same initial &quot;Game Setup&quot; except before putting the WAR cards back in the deck, place two cards, per player, face down on the side. Then, complete the regualar game setup and put those extra cards, per player, on top of the deck. This will ensure that each player gets two &quot;safe&quot; turns before a WAR card can be drawn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Market Garden was a military operation fought in the Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944. It was planned by Field Marshal Montgomery as combined land - airborne operation. The airborne operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by XXX Corps of the British Second Army.&#10;&#10;The operation's objective was to create a 103 km long corridor into Germany with a bridgehead over the River Rhine, creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany. This was to be achieved by seizing a series of nine bridges with airborne forces, with land forces swiftly following over the bridges. Despite this ambitious plans, operation turned out to be a fiasco.&#10;&#10;Game covers the entire Market Garden operation. It comes with four scenarios, picturing the parts of the battle and the whole battle itself. It uses battalion scale.&#10;&#10;&quot;Market Garden&quot; uses WB-95 system, with some modifications that were necessary due to a scale change.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rival diner owners are under pressure to cook breakfast for their customers as quickly as possible. As some foods take longer to cook, you will need to plan ahead so the entire order is ready to serve at the same time. Players receive points for each successfully completed order and lose points for wasted food and incomplete or incorrect orders. The player with the most points when the flow of customers runs out is the winner.&#10;&#10;Setup   &#10;Each player chooses one diner board and places it in front of them.&#10;&#10;Sort and place the food tiles and penalty tokens into each slot of the kitchen caddy.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the customer order cards. Based on the amount of players, remove the number of cards needed and place the remaining cards back in the box (see chart at right).&#10;&#10;The first person to shout out what they ate for breakfast will deal first. Give them the chef&rsquo;s spoon and cards.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;This game is played in rounds. Each round consists  of the following actions:&#10;1. Dealer assigns customer order cards.&#10;2. All players select food tiles.&#10;3. All players cook food items.&#10;4. All players serve their customers, if they are able.&#10;&#10;After all four actions are completed, the chef&rsquo;s spoon and the customer order deck are passed clockwise to the next player, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;1. Assigning Customers&#10;The player with the chef&rsquo;s spoon is the dealer for each round. The dealer draws customer order cards equal to the number of players. The dealer then assigns one customer order to each player, including themselves. You can keep a more difficult card with the higher risk and point value for yourself or assign it to an opponent in hopes of giving them more than they can handle. All players then place their customer order cards on an empty table space within the Orders section of their diner board. In later rounds, if all the table spaces on a player&rsquo;s diner board are full, they must immediately serve one of their current customers, even if that order will be incomplete, before receiving a new customer order card for that round.&#10;&#10;2. Selecting Food Tiles &#10;Starting with the dealer, players take turns in clockwise order selecting food tiles from the kitchen caddy based on their orders and cooking times. Each player may take up to a total of seven food tiles, from up to three different food types. This is the maximum; you are not required to select more food tiles than you want or need. Take your selected food tiles, and place them in a stack on their corresponding spaces in the Prep column of your diner board.&#10;&#10;3. Cooking Food&#10;All players cook their food at the same time. When everyone is ready, the dealer for the round announces, &ldquo;Cook time!&rdquo; Now, starting with the top row and working your way down, move all food tiles on your diner boards one space to the right. Keep each round&rsquo;s stack of tiles together as they move across the board. Some food types do not need to stop in each column. When a tile reaches a space with an arrow, slide it across the arrow until it reaches the column indicated. Once food items are in the Ready to Serve spaces, they can be used to serve any combination of orders (see Serving Customers section).Any unserved food in the final column of the Ready to Serve section will be moved into the Trash column during cook time.&#10;&#10;4. Serving Customers&#10;Players may serve their customers during actions 1 or 4 using any food tiles that are in the Ready to Serve area. When you are ready to serve a customer&rsquo;s order, move the food tiles from your Ready to Serve area and place them on the corresponding spaces of the customer order card to check that you have the correct food items.&#10;&#10;End of Game &#10;Complete the round in which the last customer order cards have been assigned. Then the game enters the final phase. Still taking turns going clockwise, each player has the chance to select one last set of food tiles to place on their diner board. Cooking then occurs as normal. The final phase then continues with all players cooking their food and serving their remaining customer orders (repeating  actions 3 and 4). The game ends once all customer order cards are removed and all food tiles have been served or moved into the Trash column.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Players total the scores from their served customer order cards and subtract any penalty tokens received to determine their final scores. The player with the most points wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest penalty tokens wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the five highest-point customer order cards wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shapes and lines are essential building blocks in our visual vocabulary. If you look, you will see rectangles, squares, cones, triangles, circles, straight lines and curved lines in everything around you. The ability to identify basic shapes and how they relate to each other is the foundation for understanding and solving more complex geometrical and patterning problems.&#10;&#10;Asymbol provides you with 47 unique shapes to pick from as you assemble things, beings, places and events/activities to challenge others to guess your vision!&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;Players take turns being an Asymbler (builder) by drawing a card, choosing one of the two subjects and using the various shaped pieces to create their subject. At the same time, the other players try to guess what is being created. The correct guesser and the Asymbler each earn a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Place all 47 Asymbol pieces in the middle of the play area.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the card deck, and place it facedown next to the Asymbol pieces, creating a draw pile.&#10;&#10;Give each player a pass token to be placed near them.&#10;&#10;Hand the scorepad and pencil to a player to keep score for each round.&#10;&#10;When starting the game, determine how many rounds to play before the game ends. A round ends when each player has had the chance to be the Asymbler.&#10;&#10;The first player to name a shape starts as the first Asymbler.&#10;&#10;Make sure the Asymbler can reach the pieces and has enough space in front of them to build.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;On your turn as the Asymbler, draw the top card from the deck, keeping it hidden from the other players, and choose one of its two subjects.&#10;&#10;Pass Token&#10;If both subjects are unfamiliar or too challenging, you may use your pass token to discard your current card and draw a new one from the draw pile. After using the token, return it to the box. Each player has only one opportunity to use their token as an Asymbler, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Categories&#10;When you are ready to start, announce the category of your chosen subject.  Only share the category and not the subject you are going to create.&#10;&#10;Assembling and Guessing&#10;To create your subject, use any number of the Asymbol pieces from the play area. You can create with pieces lying flat or by building vertically. Moving the pieces is allowed to show motion and help portray your subject. You may not speak while you build, but making sound effects is allowed. You may use body language (nods and hand gestures) to indicate if a player&rsquo;s guess is on the right track or not. Once you begin to assemble, all the other players can start guessing. They guess at the same time and can continue to make guesses until someone&rsquo;s guess is correct. There is no time limit, but you may end your turn if you feel like no one can correctly guess the subject. Otherwise, the turn ends after a correct guess, and play continues clockwise.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;The first player to correctly guess the subject gets a point. If multiple players guess correctly at the same time, they all get a point. As Asymbler, you also receive a point for successfully creating a subject that another player could recognize. If there are no correct guesses and you choose to end your turn, then no one scores any points that turn.  Return all the pieces you used to the play area, and place your card in the discard pile. Play continues clockwise with the next player becoming the Asymbler, drawing a new card, announcing a category and creating their subject with the pieces.&#10;&#10;End of Game &#10;After the agreed upon number of rounds has been completed, the player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the players share the victory.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
