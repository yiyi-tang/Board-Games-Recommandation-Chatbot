    "Description": "The Bottled Imp Game is a card game for 2-6 players. The object of the game is to be the player holding the Bottled Imp Card at the end of the game's allotted 8 rounds.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with 5 cards in their hand. One of the players (nobody else knows who) has the Bottled Imp card. The number of cards they are permitted to hold is denoted by their 'Life Dice', it begins at 5, but can go up or down from 2 to 7.&#10;&#10;In each round players get a turn to lay any number of one type of card, then draw back up to their allotted hand size. The card types and their affects are:&#10;&#10;Dagger = Reduce and opponents Life Dice&#10;Pie and Ale = Increase your own life dice&#10;Spyglass = Look at an opponent's hand&#10;Lockpick = Blindly take one card from an opponent's hand&#10;Wild/Coins = Wild card&#10;Bottled Imp = Win the game&#10;&#10;After each player has taken a turn the round is over. This happens 8 times, recorded on a D8, then the game is over. The player holding the Bottled Imp Card at this point is the winner.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple, but in reality keeping track of where you think the Imp is and timing when to make a play for it provides some very interesting decisions and a tense atmosphere.&#10;&#10;A good game for a party or warm up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Gandouchi is a traditional event that takes place during the Doll Festival particularly in the prefecture of Gifu. Children visit nearby houses and ask to view that home's doll display. After viewing the dolls, they receive snacks and sweets from the residents of the home &mdash; comparable to the tradition of Trick-or-treating on Halloween in some Western countries.&#10;&#10;In Gandouchi, you want to arrange hina doll cards in your hand the best way possible. All the cards start spread out face down on the table. On a turn, you reveal two cards, then add one of them to your hand or exchange a card in hand for one of these cards. Any exchanged card and the card not taken are turned face down again, so pay attention to these cards and watch what others pick up!&#10;&#10;At game's end, players reveal their hands, scoring the most points for having a wide range of colors and types of cards.&#10;&#10;",

At least, that&rsquo;s one side of it. The set also offers a group of new units, hex tiles, and interior overlays that you can use in your own scenarios or battle mode games.&#10;&#10;You get 18 monk miniatures in 6 different poses together with 4 multi-figure bases, and 6 stat cards. All of these monkish types are playable in the battle mode, as well as the Ars Nova scenario.&#10;You also get 7 unique, double-sided hex tiles, and 7 building interior overlays. The hex tiles can be mixed in with any others you may have to expand your options and size of playing area. The building interiors offer you some choices for existing buildings, changing the way some familiar types work. This means that you won&rsquo;t always know what a building is until you enter it, adding a sense of exploration and mystery to even a simple battle.&#10;&#10;Finally, for the Ars Nova scenario itself, you get 1 Suspect sleeve, 8 Suspect cards, 20 Event cards, 80 Trial cards, 1 sand timer, and 30 tokens. &#10;Playing the scenario is straightforward. It uses the normal rules with some additional mini-games to represent the trials you have to go through to gather your evidence. &#10; Also worth noting is that this scenario includes no combat at all.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Chakra is a game of territory, capture, and flow that exercises and improves your lateral thinking, spatial reasoning, serialization, and more. You will learn how to extend, trade-off, circumnavigate, and consolidate gains along subtle curves and beautiful shapes.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of game pieces (stones): black and white. Black plays first and traditionally played by the the less experienced player. Like Go, each stone is placed on an intersection of crossing lines. Unlike Go, the board is made up of twelve interlocking circles and an outer rim that functions as a thirteenth circle.&#10;&#10;The player's goal in Chakra is to create as much &quot;living territory&quot; as possible by the game's end. Players create living stone groups by connecting chains of stones around two or more &quot;eyes&quot; (empty intersections). In each turn, a player will optionally pass or place a stone on an empty intersection, after which liberties are counted and any captures removed. The player may then choose to slide another stone on either of the two circles it resides on, with stones of either player blocking movement. Liberties and captures are then counted a second time.&#10;&#10;",

About 99,7% of the world&rsquo;s population is dead, cities have been razed to the ground and all infrastructure is lost.&#10;&#10;But still, hope is not lost.

    "Description": "In this roll-to-move game, players are competing to get the best possible jobs. The first player to get a combination of jobs that pays $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game play: On a player's turn they roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spots around the board. The player then picks up the job card corresponding to the spot they landed on, and place the card in front of them. The player then records the amount of hours worked, and earns the income from the job. It is then the next player's turn. This repeats until one player has accumulated enough jobs to earn $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours.&#10;&#10;If a player gets a new job card that would put them over 200 hours worked, they need to either discard the card, or replace one of their other job cards with the new card.&#10;&#10;On their turn, after rolling their dice but before moving, a player can try to gamble to try and steal someone else's job. If the player decides to gamble, they re-roll the dice and attempt to get the same result. For example, if the die roll of the their first roll was 8, then they would try to re-roll the dice to get 8 again. If they are successful, they can take any job card from any other player. If they are not successful, then they must pay a penalty fee to the &quot;Employment Pot&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules suggest that any penalty paid to the &quot;Employment Pot&quot; should be paid with real money, and the winner of the game gets to keep any money in the &quot;Employment Pot.&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

After that, everyone draws 5 cards from their deck and the player to the dealer's left begins.&#10;When it is their turn, players draw a card and then play any number from their hand to the middle discard pile, face up. The card they play must match the one in the middle, either by its color or the expression on the ghost's face.&#10;If the player has emptied its hand (playing all its five cards), he-she may draw 5 other cards and continue its streak.&#10;When the current player is unable to discard a ghost from its hand, the turn is finished and the next player plays.&#10;The game contains Rainbow ghosts that can be played at any moment during the player's turn to change the color of the pile to the player's choosing.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his ghosts win, to get rid of a ghost, match the color or expression of the current top card of the pile. If nobody can play cards anymore, the player with the fewest cards wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You have now also become new colonists who want to tame the landscape and make it your new home.&#10;&#10;Each colonizer works to create their settlement town and grow its prestige by adding to it.  Colonists build new parts of their small town and expand it into a large city, to build their reputation as being the greatest pioneer of the land.&#10;&#10;You must build your town into a glorious city before others colonize the new land first and become its new king.  Be wary of other pioneers though, for they want to become the new king of Runikend too.&#10;&#10;The colonizers will attack other pioneer villages before they are built into big cities, and raze their new buildings to the ground.  The pioneer king-to-be must conquer their enemies before they are attacked and defeated by them.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;Grow the reputation of your settlement to attract more inhabitants and grow a village into a large city to become the new King of Runikend.  Reputation is earned by adding prominent structures and other notable parts to your settlement that have prestige value.  You win the game and become the King of Runikend if you have built a large city (earning 30 prestige points or more) at any point during the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To do that, the active player must roll dice and determine what kind of actions to take during the turn: 1) buy towers and strategically place them along the path, 2) attack the Orcs from an existing tower, or 3)discard a die and reroll all of the remaining dice. In addition to the Orcs, players must also deal with constantly cycled Event Cards that can help them or hinder them during the turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either: 1) Wave 5 of the Orc assault is completed. If the Castle has at least 1 Life remaining, the players win, or 2) the Castle takes damage greater than or equal to its Life and is destroyed, in which case the Orcs win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the first phase, each player places 5 cards in his hand and can play special cards that change the course of the game, such as stealing the opponent's turn, double the winning prize, exchange all hand cards between 2 players or cancel any of these effects. In the next phase, the turn owner chooses a card from his hand, puts it upside down on the table and will have to decide between asking a question about the card to an opponent of his choice (flag/location/capital) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the statistic he chose, each opponent will have to pick a card from his hand and put it upside down on the table, to win the duel. This adds suspense, bluff and fun on each turn, forcing the player to carefully choose his plays. At the end of the turn, the winner receives as prize x cards from the opponents hands, depending on the special cards played, the duel type (question or statistic battle) and player count.&#10;&#10;Many educational/general knowledge board games lack the fun and socialization offered by CardsLab. It's an 8-80 trivia &amp; strategy game designed with a simple mechanics that can easily put 3 different generations playing at the same table. Also, without noticing, we are learning much faster than by reading a book.&#10;&#10;CardsLab - Improving Knowledge Through Gamification.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Newsroom is a worker placement game where you get to manage your own international media outlet. The aim of the game is to publish your newspaper editions earlier than other players thus gaining the trust of your audience and of the advertisers and boosting your global presence as an International media outlet.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the round, news come out in different countries around the world in different fields (politics, economy, sports, culture). Each story is associated to countries with the roll of dice. Players have in their disposal a Press team and send its members to cover some of the stories, by interviewing people and getting their news copy back in the paper. &#10; Each edition is divided in 4 blocks (newspaper columns) and has to cover at least 10 content points which derive from the news pieces that journalists bring back or, later in the game, from advertisements. Once the edition content is complete, the paper goes to the editors while journalists are free to get some more news stories from around the world.&#10;&#10;After the editors have checked your story, the copy moves on to printing and is published. Its time to collect money, to pay your Press team and to hire better journalists, or more editors or printers to get your next edition even faster. Remember, the competition in the media is fierce and if you lose time the other media outlets will get your story out and it will then be worth nothing to you or your audience.&#10;&#10;Based in the queuing theory, Newsroom is an easy to learn but hard to master worker placement- economic management game where speed and effectiveness determine the winner. Much like in the real media world!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In your hand it is considered to be a card with black, white, green, red, yellow, and blue colors. It can be played onto any family tree, and must immediately receive an inheritance marker after being played. Until it leaves play it counts as a black card and a white card in addition to the color of that inheritance marker. The inheritance marker may not be removed until the Ghost Legend is dismissed.&#10;&#10;The Fae Legend behaves similarly to the Ghost Legend, except for the differences between Ghost and Fae cards. When the Fae Legend is played onto a player's family tree, that player must then swap it per normal Fae rules.&#10;&#10;The new Wanderer Guardians and Fae Watcher can be shuffled into the deck of Immortals to provide additional variety.&#10;The Wanderer Guardians have more flexible unlock tracks, allowing you to unlock them in either 2 or 3 steps.

Once the Heirloom is restored, your youngest Hero gains the Fae's Lost trait. This does not cause any additional swapping to occur when playing to that spot on your family tree.&#10;&#10;The Skald Watcher has a flexible unlock track that requires you to have a Ghost or Fae on your tree, followed by a Skald. Do not use this card if you are not playing with Ghosts/Fae and Skalds. Once unlocked, the Skald Watcher allows you to use any of the four basic 1st-generation embellishments.&#10;&#10;",

Three human Factions: The Confederation of Sol, the Outer-Worlds Alliance and the Praetorans of Mars have been fighting for domination of the solar system with space fleets from their bases orbiting Earth, Mars and Titan.&#10;&#10;Now with the perfection of the FTL hyper drive, Scout-ships are finally able to explore distant stars. Earth, Mars and Titan have agreed a truce in order to settle colonists in new star systems far from our star.&#10;&#10;With a small fleet of ships, you must seek out and settling habitable worlds, but you would be wise to hire warships from these factions to protect your Outposts, for the future of these colonies will be beyond the control of Earth.&#10;&#10;Send out your Scouts to explore new systems, send out your Transports to bring back rare minerals and gasses to finance your fleet. Hire warships from the Confederation, Alliance and Praetoran navies for your private fleet.&#10;&#10;Build Outpost ships and finally Colony ships to settle worlds and claim the title of Star Lord!&#10;&#10;In the game you will upgrade your starting deck of Scout ships and Basic Transports with a fleet of warship cards from the three space faring factions. You can buy Outpost ships to build Outposts and later upgrade these to Colonies on suitable worlds you have explored or else capture them from other players. You may control 4 systems at any time by deploying your ships there.&#10;&#10;Objective: Control 4 Victory stars. Each Outpost is 1 star, Each Colony (upgrading Outpost) worth 2 stars. This means you win immediately when you control a Colony on 2 worlds, or an Outpost on 4 worlds.&#10;&#10;The main USPs for Star Colonies are:  &#10;&#10;     Area control (of star systems). Deploying ships to defend or to trade: carrying over unused credits, but you take a risk: extra Credits or nothing if system is seized.  &#10;     Flip discard to draw deck (not shuffle!) so build order stays intact. In the advanced game we add Infiltrators as deck manipulators.  &#10;     Interaction: ability to intercept an attack (with cards from hand) or to target specific star systems and deployed enemy ships.  &#10;&#10;&#10;The full game works just as well with 2, 3 or 4 players. Players can start with a more peaceful tutor-mode game before the full on strategy game with the full card set.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players place tide pools, each containing a critter, and seek to create roads to the tide pool by matching compatible edges. Some tide pools will disappear faster than others as rising waters threaten shallower pools. As players build out a unique set of tide pools they may also block off any player who seeks to create a continuous path. Play time can range from 30 to 45 minutes depending on skill level.&#10;&#10;To play, download the two zip files containing the rules and fully colored game assets. To play you also need road sticks, such as these https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/stick-orange. For our play tests we used orange, blue, purple, and green sticks, however, any color is suitable. If you do not have sticks on hand, you may cut out rectangular pieces of colored paper(smaller than 1 by 1/2 inch) and use those instead, perhaps even folding them into tents for an easier time picking them up.&#10;&#10;If you really like the game, you can also order hard copies of all the assets here: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/turning-tides?dept_uri=&amp;dept_name=.&#10;&#10;&mdash; Nastia Garachtchenko&#10;&#10;",

In a Travel journal, he writes of this extraordinary experience.&#10;Become travelers and follow his steps around France, Germany, Switzerland or Italy, to discover countries through Montaigne&rsquo;s eyes, meet people he encountered and think with his mind&hellip; Until King Henri III calls you back to Bordeaux, as he did with Montaigne asking him to become the city&rsquo;s mayor, then you will have to end your journey and go back to the South West of France as fast as you can.&#10;&#10;This is a multi-purpose card game for 2 to 4 players from 8 years old.&#10;The players manage their best hand cards they will pose in front of them, deploying the many discoveries of their trip (gastronomy, meetings, visits or reading the Montaigne books ...), while observing the choices of other players.&#10;Voyages avec Montaigne offers many mechanics interlaced in a simple and fluid way. Opportunism, interaction and anticipation make the pleasure of a game that suddenly makes one of the greatest French writers of all time very close.&#10;&#10;In the game Voyages avec Montaigne, players place cards face up next to the last card they placed, on a line from left to right. This line represents their journey.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players take turns with 1 action among 3 : &#10;&#10;     Travel : place a card from a different city AND pay the cost of the travel (0, 1 or 2 cards discarded)&#10;     Stay : placing a card of the same city AND pick 1 new card&#10;     Get supplies : not placing a card AND pick  and 2 new cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can discard a figure met during his journey to take another action OR take a card from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;2 travelling rules must be respected :&#10;&#10;     At the end of their journey, players must return to Bordeaux and have placed at least on &laquo; Citation &raquo; card form each of the 3 books of Montaigne&#10;     Players cannot go back to a city they have already been.&#10;&#10;&#10;During their journey, players take one of the Bonus tile available as soon as they reach the objective first or do better than a player who had already achieved the objective (5 discovery bonus, 4 book bonus).&#10;&#10;When the &laquo; King&rsquo;s call &raquo; special card is revealed, all players must go back to Bordeaux as soon as possible, rules are thus modified :&#10;&#10;     Action &laquo; Stay &raquo; is not allowed anymore&#10;     Players cannot travel to a city that would take them further away from Bordeaux.&#10;&#10;&#10;First players returning to Bordeaux get bonus, As soon as all players but one have returned to Bordeaux, the last player only has one turn left to play.&#10;&#10;Bonus tiles are awarded to players : most cities visited, the most different theme cards, the most different characters encountered, largest stay.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The fans may have disapproved at first, but after the Elfheim Eagles nudged out Nurgle&rsquo;s Rotters to win Blood Bowl XX they became known as one of the finest passing play teams to ever grace the pitch.&#10;&#10;This multi-part plastic kit contains the components needed to assemble The Elfheim Eagles, an Elven Union Blood Bowl team. The team consists of 6 Linemen (4 of which are actually Linewomen), 2 Blitzers, 2 Throwers and 2 Catchers, each of whom are as impressively-cheekboned and beautiful as you might expect from an Elven team. The heads and shoulder pads are interchangeable between the miniatures, meaning your team can look unique.&#10;&#10;There are a host of extras in the kit &ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins and 6 balls, 4 of which are encrusted with opulent gemstones. Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases and an Elven Union transfer sheet.&#10;&#10;",

Players explore the house and collect items upon entering an empty room. Items can be used to help gather information, attack other players, or replenish lost Health.&#10;Whoever accomplishes their hidden agenda first, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Killer Dinner is a party game that will create a new social dynamic each time it&rsquo;s played.

    "Description": "The throne has remained vacant for far too long, demons assault the city, and the people have become desperate. You have travelled far to arrive in the city of Bloodstone. The desperate situation in the city has forced the Council to reach out to the powerful Demigods in hopes of finding a new ruler. You have five days to gain the favour of the council and the people. They are eager to be impressed.&#10;    Your paths to victory are numerous: complete quests to gain favor and influence; slay the demons that spawn each night and harvest them for the riches that lay within; amass great wealth and purchase symbols of status to impress the masses. &#10;        You are not the only hero to see this as their opportunity. Others have journeyed to the city and will fight to impede your progress at every turn. Can you win the favour of the Council and become the next Ruler?&#10;&#10;Demons and Demigods is a deep strategy game with immense replayability. In fact, no two games will ever be the same.&#10;&#10;Players can all play with the same faction abilities by playing as &quot;Civilians&quot;, or each player can choose to play as a Demigod - a unique faction with special abilities and Rages. Play as a Warlock, Earth Elemental, Giant, or one of the other unique Demigods.&#10;&#10;Throughout 5 days, players will track their time using a unique and intuitive time track. This track consists of 24 spaces. Each player begins with 12 time before the Midnight Oil ends their day, but through upgrades it is possible to improve Ambition and start the day with more time. Each movement through the city and actions at a building costs time, so plan your route and day wisely. Whoever has the most time remaining in the day will always play next - so player order is dynamic. Once you enter the Midnight Oil your day will end.&#10;&#10;Players move their characters throughout the game board using a one-of-a-kind worker placement mechanic. Your character blocks building action spaces. When you move, the building action space becomes available. Each game includes 9 randomly placed buildings. Depending on your strategy and immediate needs you may want to visit the Butcher to gain Bloodstones, or the Blacksmith to buy gear. You may wish to travel to the Market to make some important trades, or maybe you need to visit the Grand Palace to improve your influence. During all of this, your character is also tasked with slaying the demons that lurk at buildings and playing quests. Slaying demons and playing quests allow a character to gain influence at a building. This is tracked through a dynamic area control mechanic which makes use of a character's energy. Quests are also assigned to 1 of the 5 council members. Each member has specific themes attached to the quest, and at the end of the game, you are rewarded for having a variety of council members showing. This means you must diversify your strategies in order to impress the entire council.&#10;&#10;Each day players will try to improve their engine to maximize the income at Day's End. They do this by unlocking dormant cubes and visiting the Philosopher's Study for upgrades. Spend the Bloodstones you have collected from slaying demons to upgrade your character. Some upgrade examples are: Income (silver, gold, energy regeneration, etc.), and Ambition (more time).&#10;&#10;Your character starts with 18 energy cubes. These cubes are incredibly dynamic and will be used for combat with demons, upgrading abilities, area control influence, and more. How you manage your energy will greatly affect your chances of success.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game players will score points based on their demon slays, influence, council support, and resources.&#10;&#10;Can you be the next Ruler of Bloodstone?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the 7th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012), Gameshop Gladiators (2013), Gameshop Adventurers (2014), Gameshop Expansions (2015), and Gameshop Collector (2016).&#10;&#10;The Mirror Universe employees of Unlimited Games have come to our reality to battle gurus Kylie, Candra and Andrew for control over the Games Unlimited store. Only one game team will reign supreme!&#10;&#10;To Win: Place all your active Guru markers (any remaining on the board) on any of the gray marked spaces in your opponent&rsquo;s home row or remove all of your opponent&rsquo;s markers.&#10;&#10;Setup: Place the board between players and orient it so that one player is facing the 3 Games Unlimited Gurus and the other player their mirror duplicate Gurus from Unlimited Games. The row closest to the player is their home row. Each player receives &#10;3 Guru markers in a matching color. Place these markers, &#10;1 each, on the 3 gray spaces on your home row. Shuffle the &#10;4 Action cards and, without looking at them, flip half the cards over to their opposite side. Deal 1 card face up in front of each player and place 1 card to the side of the board. The 4th card is removed from the game. The first player will be the one who has most recently looked in a mirror.&#10;&#10;Play: Each player has an Action card that displays a possible move for any of their markers. There is a 3rd card to one side of the board that cannot be used by either player during their turn. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they move 1 of their active Guru markers (Note: Active Guru markers are the ones remaining on the board) according to the Action card; they then replace the card they used with the 3rd card. The other player then moves accordingly, and exchanges their card with this new 3rd card - the card the first player just used.&#10;Moving a marker on top of one of an opponent player&rsquo;s markers removes that opponent&rsquo;s marker from the game.&#10;&#10;A player may stack a maximum of 2 of their pieces on any space except the center space. A stack prevents either stacked piece from being captured.&#10;&#10;Moving your active Guru markers to the home row spaces of &#10;your opponent wins you the game.&#10;&#10;As long as one of a player&rsquo;s markers remains on the center space on the board, that player may, during their turn, flip their Action card over to its opposite face to introduce a new move into the game.&#10;&#10;Action cards should be oriented with the name of the action at the bottom of the card. Each card shows the player&rsquo;s marker in the middle of the card and indicates which spaces, either forward, backward or to the side, to which they may move their marker. Below this diagram, the action on the other face of the card is displayed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each core box in the wave will be complimented by a separate campaign book. It is flexible enough to include use for play in eras with man where the Aliens were also present.&#10;&#10;The miniatures will start with the Starspawn of Cthulhu, as they engage the Elder Things for domination of the newly formed planet. We want these miniatures for ourselves, so will be sculpting and printing all of the races regardless. So the Mi-Go and the rest are in the pipeline.&#10;&#10;Miniatures will include resin masters for collectors, and are done in 28mm for most popular ranges. Additionally they scale nicely for 15mm and 6mm gamers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
