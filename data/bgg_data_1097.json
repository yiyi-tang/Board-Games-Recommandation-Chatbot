Formed in 1942, and after almost two years of rigorous training, Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, dropped into Normandy, France, on D-Day, June 6th, 1944. By the end of the war, Easy Company was known as one of the best small units in the European Theater of Operations. The men of Easy Company have been immortalized in the book and mini-series Band of Brothers; now their story is played out in the dynamic medium of the Lock 'n Load Tactical system.&#10;&#10;The We Stand Alone expansion module contains 15 scenarios, covering battles from the daring assaults on Brecourt Manor and Carentan, in Normandy, to the desperate defense of Hell's Highway and The Island, during Operation Market Garden, to the frigid foxholes of Bastogne and Noville, during The Battle of the Bulge. The scenarios can be played individually or in three five-scenario campaigns. Thirteen of the 15 scenarios are new designs, with two revised scenarios, plus a Brecourt Manor variant. Three new Maps, including winterized and revised Maps, bring the dramatic landscape of these battles to life: Entrenched German artillery positions in Normandy, an elevated dike and a watchful windmill in Holland, and chilly cratered forests of the Ardennes provide the setting; it's up to you to provide the leadership, heroics, and actions needed to win victory for the brave American paras or the obstinate Germans they faced.&#10;&#10;The men of Easy Company were elite soldiers. Whether in the heat of battle or when battling the elements between contact with the enemy, they fought for each other. They fought for victory. And they fought for survival. Join the fight!&#10;&#10;Requirements:  To play We Stand Alone &ndash; Battles of Easy Company you must own Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical &ndash; Heroes of Normandy and we highly recommend the Heroes of Normandy X-Maps or 4K X-Maps.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mythos of Legends is a tabletop wargame of grand strategy involving gods, mythical beasts, legendary heroes and mortal soldiers. Players choose their faction from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Dark Age Pagans, Ancient Egypt and Eldritch Abominations. Each faction has a unique roster and playstyle, further affected by the player's choice of deity.&#10;&#10;The Mythos Board is the domain of the gods. Each player has one 35mm scale deity model which affects the rolls that they need to make on the battlefield. By way of example, soldiers that follow Ares will fight more effectively in combat than those who follow Hades, but Hades' followers are much tougher to kill. Each deity also has unique abilities called Divine Interventions, such as Osiris resurrecting friendly models or Loki stealing the enemy's dice,  meaning that overall the player's choice of deity has a massive effect on how their army performs. The gods are locked in their own struggle of wills and moods as they move around the Mythos Board. Their position grants further bonuses to their followers depending on what stats the player thinks are most important at the current moment in time.&#10;&#10;The soldiers, beasts and heroes fight on the battlefield in the name of their deity. Legendary Units such as the Lernean Hydra, Julius Caesar and Ragnar Lothbrok are represented by 15mm scale miniautres, while ordinary soldiers are sculpted in 10mm on ranked bases. Players secretly assign their units order tokens and then activate them alternately, carrying out the order. Success or failure comes from dice rolls based on four stats - Wrath, Wisdom, Swiftness and Determination - with the number of dice to be rolled based on the unit's profile, equipment and the position of the patron deity on the Mythos Board. The deity's stats determine the roll for a success.&#10;&#10;The turn structure is set up so that players roll off for priority, move their deities and attempt divine interventions, secretly assign orders to their units, carry out their orders alternately and then finally take break checks and check for victory conditions as determined by the scenario.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The rolls count as follows:&#10;4 blanks  = 4 points&#10;4 symbols = 3 points&#10;3 symbols or 3 blanks = 0 points (kaika)&#10;2 symbols and 2 blanks = 1 point (yol&egrave;)&#10;&#10;When a lalo changes from the sixth nayico to the opponent half of the board, it has to pass a circle (lapel). Any lalo who lands directly on the lapel has to remain there till the player rolls a yol&egrave;. On the lapel no lalo can be caught. Several lalos may occupy the lapel at the same time.&#10; The player who manages to catch all 7 opponent lalos wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Distances on the colorful charts are listed for both 15mm and 28mm.  Developed over several years in conjunction with wargamers, re-enactors and ACW historians.

Fatique tracking sysem monitors fluctuating fighting strengths, putting premium on fresh units from reserves or by resting front line units.  Easily implemented command system emphasizes the relationship between divisional commanders and their brigadiers.  Special full-color deck of 50 &quot;crisis cards&quot; interjects drama and uncertainty to the battlefield.  The critical effect of supply issues on the battlefield is dealt with cleanly and effectively.  Lots of color throughout the text including many shots of nice looking games in progress.   Ratings for EVERY general on both sides who fought in the ACW - over 1,000 entries.  Continuing onlline support will be provided.  2 scenarios included: the first and second days of the 1862 Battle of 7 Pines in the peninsula.

    "Description": "IN THE TRENCHES (ITT) system designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&#10;&#10;Devil Dogs 2 Faith &amp; Sacrifice is an expansion/battle pack for Tiny Battle's In the Trenches: Devil Dogs. It adds counters for both the US Marines and German's, including tanks and four scenarios covering battles between them in the last year of the war, each with its own map.&#10;&#10;The list of the 4 scenarios - which each include 1 to 3 alternate scenarios:&#10;&#10;1. The Farm: &quot;As the troops in field-gray uniforms emerged from the woods and began their assault across the field, prone Marines spread out across a small ridge made sight adjustments and windage estimations. The Marines of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, lying in the grass at Les Mares farm, readied their Model 1903 Springfield rifles and laid out five-round stripper clips of .30-06 ammunition beside them for easy access.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Advance on Vierzy: &quot;On 17 July 1918, the Marines and other Allied units marched through rain and mud near Soissons. Early on the morning of 18 July the 5th Marine Regiment began a major offensive by sweeping the Germans from Translon and Verte Feuille Farms. The swift advance was halting only after the enemy managed to reinforce their defense line running south through Vierzy. After regrouping, the Marines were ordered to advance on Vierzy later that afternoon.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Carnage at Bouresches: &quot;After the costly gains in Belleau Woods and near Lucy, Marine forces turned their attention to clearing the Germans from Bouresches. The depleted 5th Marines, having sustained heavy losses in an open ground assault near Lucy approached Bouresches from the woods to the West. The 6th Marines had been ordered to aid the attack on Bouresches from its position near Triangle Farm.&quot;&#10;&#10;4. Action at Blanc Mont: &quot;The first week of October saw heavy fighting and left both Marines and other allied units stuck well forward of supporting forces. Nicknamed 'The Box' by Marines since they were forced to defend against counterattacks from all sides. On the 7th and 8th of October Marines, with support from other units pushed into St. Etienne to take out the fortified MG positions and escape 'The Box'.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

You 'll get to know the hard way of life in those days and experience, how a normal mayor by the name of Raiffeisen started alleviating misery and distress of normal people in 1845 and developed his concept of the cooperative idea, exactly in line with his motto &bdquo;What can't be done alone, can be done together&quot;.&#10;&#10;During the course of time, this cooperative idea co-founded by Raiffeisen, has spread all round the world and since 2016, has been declared by UNESCO as &bdquo;Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of 8 puzzle boards, which when together form a large landscape map. Here, the players travel through the villages where Raiffeisen implemented his ideas. Different fields of work present times of waiting, because the tasks set can only be overcome together. Players experience through 53 fields, what Raiffeisen undertook against hunger and misery. Those players falling behind are taken by the hand of solidarity and given the chance to carry on playing. Players with &bdquo;Solvency Problems&quot; are given financial help through solidarity. Single moves mostly affect the other players, so that all participants are ensnared in this exciting journey through time &mdash; right from the beginning, all the way through to the end.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, there is not only one winner and one thing is for certain: this lively game is lots of fun and imparts to children as well as grown-ups lots of interesting facts about Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and the times he lived in. Game board size and length of play can be decided upon. Decide how much time you have and then take the plunge into Raiffeisen's World for as long as you like: one, two or even for three hours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; A Glimpse of Luna (GoL) is a collectible card game that connects two worlds - the physical and the digital. Based on a fantasy world of our own creation, the collectible cards can be played in the traditional sense at a table but can also be brought to life digitally. Playing and trading cards is possible on both interconnected platforms. A glimpse of Luna is a 2-player strategical trading card game that combines new elements like movement, range and troop strength into the TCG/CCG genre.&#10;&#10;You start by choosing one of the available races and then you build your deck.  It is not possible to use different races in your deck. Each race has diverse types of playable character-cards. The highlights are certainly the heroes and guardians, which both play an important role in this game. The game is played by turns. Each player starts with 3 fight moral points. The ultimate goal is to destroy all of your opponents fight moral. This can be achieved in three different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Destroy your opponents hero (-1 fight moral point)&#10;     Destroy your opponents guardian (-1 fight moral point)&#10;     Destroy 5 character-cards of your opponent (-1 fight moral point) &ndash; multiple times possible&#10;&#10;&#10;We created this game with the basic principle &bdquo;Easy to LEARN, Hard to MASTER&ldquo;. A Glimpse of Luna&rsquo;s basic mechanics are simple to learn and by gaining experience you are exploring, learning and mastering many new strategies. It was our objective to create a game with mechanics, that feels similar to a real battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is a contract game for the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.&#10;&#10;The game is meant to increase the awareness of the general public that some germs can be found in unexpected places, that some activities are pretty harmless, while others carry various degrees of risk.&#10;&#10;For those who are interested, the scientific content of the game can be found on a dedicated website &ndash;www.krobs.ch&ndash; or at the back of each card where a RQ code leads you to the appropriate page.&#10;&#10;It is however a game first, where you try to complete 3 columns of cards in front of you, each adding up to 15. You try to achieve this before your opponents, and sometimes also try to slow them down with microbes cards if they are careless.&#10;&#10;On their turn players may play up to 2 cards before drawing only 1. Those cards can be Activity cards that bring you closer to your goal (3 columns of 15 points) or Microbes cards that attack the opponents who have &quot;risky cards&quot; showing on top of their own columns. Sometimes a turn consists of only refreshing one's hand.&#10;&#10;If a player is attacked, they have to reveal a disease card of the corresponding color and see how severe the attack was. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're sick for a while, and every so often you may even die on the spot...&#10;&#10;The first player to completes their columns secures the victory, a mix of good timing and lucky draw.&#10;&#10;",

The shorter the shot, the more control a player has. After the cards are applied, they place their ball token on the aimed spot and the next player goes. In between rounds players draft the cards used in that round for future use. When players make it in on each hole, they move to the next. When all players finish a hole, the last player to finish gets to keep that hole card for future use. The game ends when the first player makes it into the 9th hole. For a full 18 hole game, score is kept and the game is reset for the 'back 9' at this point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In order to achieve this goal, players travel around Gensokyo looking for material to publish in articles, delivering them back to the residence of the tengu before their rivals.&#10;&#10;Potential material for each article is found across the map of Gensokyo, and players must race their way to the scene in question. Player actions, including movement, are performed by rolling a single die, and comparing that result to the corresponding action card on the indicator board. At the start of each turn, players must replace any action card on the board with one from their hand. In this way, players can use their strategy to modify probabilities to their favor at the right moment.&#10;&#10;When a player has collected all the articles on the board, if they can return to the residence of the tengu, they become the winners and the stars of the Gensokyo newspaper convention.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Home to Wood-elves, giant spiders, and the armies of Dol Guldur, the dark and enchanted forest has played a prominent role in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game ever since the release of the Core Set. Players have trod its twisting paths, camped long nights beneath its dark canopy, and survived myriad encounter with Orcs, Spiders, Wargs, and haunting magic. But if you think you've seen it all by now&mdash;you'd be wrong.&#10;&#10;Beginning in September, Mirkwood gets an all-new look with The Woodland Realm. A custom scenario kit designed expressly for this year's Fellowship Event, The Woodland Realm follows upon&mdash;and builds upon&mdash;the unique adventures shared by all those who attended Gen Con Indy and set forth on The Wizard's Quest.&#10;&#10;Like The Wizard's Quest, The Woodland Realm lets you step over the line for a moment and play the role of Sauron. You'll assemble a quest and an encounter deck, and then you'll unleash its evils upon anyone brave or foolish enough to travel through Mirkwood!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a WWII roll-and-move game that encouraged Japanese children to think of potential military roles.&#10;&#10;Five children are shown in the lower right, and each one follows a distinct training path through the many images of military life shown on the board, leading to one of five service branches: Infantry, Artillery, Signals, Armor and Air Force. The winner is the first player to complete training in their chosen branch.&#10;&#10;The game included in an edition a children's magazine published by the Asahi Shimbun media empire. The back of the game sheet shows other pages of the magazine, and there are center staple holes showing that it was a centerfold pull-out.&#10;&#10;The absence of any naval roles shows that this game was army-sponsored, and illustrates the deep divide between Japan's land and sea forces at the time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

With access to an abundance of herbs and fungi found nowhere else in the world, they create and trade their remedies and poisons for the wares of other clans. Yet, in their cunning, they are keen to keep the most potent and arcane of their creations for themselves. Due to their whimsical and often wayward nature, many of the more stoic clans view the Kitsune as unreliable rogues, but their friends simply see them as wise tricksters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
