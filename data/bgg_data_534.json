The characters are represented by a series of stats from which to extrapolate combat. The stats are generated randomly. Combat is conducted through a series of dice rolls and counter rolls to determine if one character hits another. Armor, weapons and skills can effect the outcome of each dice roll. Once a hit is scored, damage is determined. Once a character has exhausted his life points, the character is dead. The player creates a character. The character enters the arena. The character fights until dead.&#10;&#10;",

Through this interlocking, twenty four concave triangle playing spaces emerge.

Twelve playing pieces are light colored for one player and twelve being dark for the other.&#10;&#10;One player chooses the players&rsquo; colors, the other chooses who will move first. Players alternate taking turns exchanging playing pieces on the gameboard with one &#10;another until the object of the game is achieved.&#10;&#10;With six of their twelve playing pieces, the first player to fully occupy one of the gameboard&rsquo;s seven circles before their opponent does is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

So, rolling a 1 and a 6, the player can form 16, 19, 61 or 91. All players check their card and if they have the 2-digit number, they can cover it with a counter. The player who first covers all the six numbers on his card wins the pot.&#10;&#10;",

All three piles are placed face down on the board, along with a pile of stock certificates, each bearing the name of a different major company and a $1,000 face value. Each player puts $100 to start in the Broker space.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players roll 2D6. On a 3-6, they draw a Bear card. On a 7-11, they draw a Bull card. Either variety may offer an opportunity to take a Speculation card. On a 2 or 12, they collect all cash and stock in the Broker space, and each player then pays another $100 into the space.&#10;&#10;While some cards call for cash or stock to be paid to or from the Broker or other players, most provide a market up or down number. This does not affect the value of any stock, however. Each player has a scorecard with a metal clip that starts at zero and can move from -20 to +20. Each time the player's market hits +13 on the way up and +20, he draws a free stock certificate. He loses the same at -13 and -20. The winner of the game is the first to accumulate $7,500 in cash and stock value.&#10;&#10;This Depression-era game has a clear upward bias: players draw Bear cards only 39% of the time, with the remaining rolls being positive; and 60% of the Speculation cards are positive. As the slogan on the game's rules puts it: &quot;Big Winners, Big Losses, but Losses are Quickly Regained&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Just as in the &quot;Street&quot; itself the time to buy and sell is fraught with uncertainty, so in this game it is puzzling to determine whether to take a trick with a 1-point boost to score and be &quot;sure&quot; -- or hold your best card for a 2- or 3-point &quot;Win&quot; -- perhaps to be forced, as often happens, to take a loss of 2 or 3 points because you held a &quot;good card&quot; too long.&#10;&#10;Parts =&#10;&#10;Cards in Blue, Red, Green and Violet&#10;12 Counting Cards with &quot;Win&quot; or &quot;Lose&quot; and one &quot;Mystery&quot; card.&#10;Cardboard chips in yellow, green, blue and red.&#10;&#10;",

A good way to play is for each player to generate several wrestlers and fight a series of bouts at one sitting.&#10;&#10;Each player rolls a six-sided die for each of five characteristics- Speed, Agility, Strength, Weight, and Balance- to generate their character. When battling an opponent, certain stats are cross-referenced with any of 8 wrestling moves: Charge, Attack, Step Aside, Slap, Lever, Lift, Push, and Pull, in order to determine a result.&#10;&#10;The game was included in issue #64 of Dragon Magazine.&#10;&#10;",

At this point that player &quot;cries&quot; for the young by making the sound of that animal. The idea here is that the mother of the set is calling out for her young. When this happens, any player in possession of &quot;young&quot; cards of that specific animal type must give them to the crying player.&#10;&#10;The first player to 60 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each card contains 1 number, 1 color, and one suit, making 125 cards, 1 for each number/color/suit combination.&#10;&#10;This deck can play many games. (14 are currently published at with more to come when I sell 100 decks.)   But all games take advantage of the fact that it's a 3 dimensional card.  Play 3D versions of Crazy Eights, Memory, Spite and Malice, Speed, Poker, Rummy, Blackjack, Cassino, Euchre, Tic Tac Toe, and 2 different versions of Klondike Solitaire.   Plus there's 2 games which cannot be duplicated with regular cards.&#10;&#10;One is a 3-variable trick-taking game where you want to take certain cards but not others,Circles are worth positive points, but are the least powerful suit, and squares are negative points but the most powerful suit in terms of trick taking.  But Number rank and color team declarations take precedence over suit.   Can be played cooperatively, 2 on 2, or 4 for themselves.  Most net positive points wins.&#10;&#10;The other game is an elimination card game where the object is to give someone six of the same number, color, or suit to eliminate them, and to be the last one standing.   Blacks, Blobs, and Question Marks always bring its owner closer to elimination.   And you can play offensively on your opponents cards, or defensively to make it harder to eliminate you.   A near perfect chess match with cards for 2 players, a game of negotiations if played with more.&#10;&#10;Coming soon: 3D versions of 2 competitive solitaires, Thirty-One, Go Fish, 2 Versions of Egyptian War, another version of Spite and Malice, another version of Speed, Pope Joan, and Eleusis.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with 6 plain ceramic hexagonal pieces, including 5 hexmen and 1 (taller) hexcellency which starts on his hexdom space.  The winner is the player who either first moves his hexcellency to the hexdom on the opposite side of the board or whose hexcellency is the last hexcellency remaining on the board.  A piece must move in a straight line not blocked by other pieces.  A piece may be immobilized (&quot;hexed&quot;) or released from a hex by certain configurations of other pieces.  On a later move, a hexed piece may be removed (&quot;captured&quot;) from the game.  A player is eliminated from the game if his hexcellency is captured.&#10;&#10;From the game box top: &quot;the Cerulean Hexman moved swiftly into position and engaged his hexray.  The Citronian was instantly hexed.  Powerless and immobile, he unwillingly released the Alizarian Hexman form his certain fate.  He again activated his hexray.  The Citronian Hexcellence was paralyzed, ensnared hopelessly, just as victory was within his reach.  His Hexdom had been conquered&hellip;&quot;&#10;&#10;Hex was published in 1994 as a &quot;limited First Edition&quot; of one thousand copies.  It did not include actual hexrays.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pentaplane is a three-dimensional board (five stacked 5x5 square grids) on which several games can be played:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pentaplane-Aircraft. A &quot;rudimentary&quot; game (the designer's word) in which each player controls a single piece representing an airplane and attempts to shoot down the opponent. Moves are plotted in groups of five. The planes move the same as the rooks do in the later games.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pentaplane-Checkers. This is played much like standard checkers, but the pieces move diagonally between boards, not on the same board. Some spaces on the boards have dots to facilitate diagonal movement, which is always from dot to dot or blank to blank.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pentaplane-Chess. This has a number of differences from standard Chess besides the board. There are no kings of queens, instead there are monarchs, and they can only be obtained by promoting pawns. Pawns can move backwards as well as forwards. The bishops move the same way as the pieces in Pentaplane-Checkers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Super Pentaplane-Chess. Pentaplane-Chess but with a much greater variety of pieces: a president which can move along flat diagonals, a hopper which must jump over another piece when moving, missile versions of pieces which can destroy other pieces at a distance, bomb versions of pieces which can blow up and destroy a 3x3x3 area, etc. Players agree on which pieces are allowed before the game. They do not have to use the same set of pieces. Note that the new pieces introduced here are not included in the Pentaplane set.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pentaplane V. This game is not included in the rulebook, but is available online (see the Links section). This is a modified version of Super Pentaplane-Chess with some differences in the list of pieces.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A successful name means moving a space.  Players are limited in time to call out a successful name by a unique timer.  The timer works by releasing a ball at the top of a ramp leading to a circular funnel type pit.  It takes approximately 10 seconds for the ball to settle into the center pit.  Players start with 4 dice and work down to 2 dice near the end of the board.  A category die is also included when the players have advanced far enough on the board.  First to the end wins.&#10;&#10;",
