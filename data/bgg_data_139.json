As Threshold squads progress through a broad range of scenarios, they will gain new abilities and equipment through an option-filled advancement system. Be wary though! The opposing Lurkers can tailor their forces to match Threshold&rsquo;s level each game, selecting from over 50 devilish monster profiles lifted straight from the pages of the Mythos to present Threshold with a nearly limitless variety of challenges. As you advance, the injuries will mount, followed by the inevitable onset of madness, assuming your operatives remain stalwart and don't fall prey to the insidious temptation of darkness...&#10;&#10;Journey into fear and beyond madness!&#10;&#10;",

During six negotiation rounds and three deductions rounds, players attempt to achieve their agenda and guess the goals of other players.&#10;&#10;During negotiations, a leader chooses whether to settle, tax, mine, conquer, or &quot;black hole&quot; five different planets while the other Councilors attempt to influence the leader's decision. This happens while a two-minute sand timer is running, and after it runs out, all players except the leader vote on the proposal. If it passes, all players advance (or not) on the influence track, depending on how well they did during the negotiation.&#10;&#10;During deduction rounds, players attempt to guess certain goals held by the other players. Correct guesses earn influence coins for you, while incorrect guesses earn coins for your opponent.&#10;&#10;The more players can negotiate to achieve their agenda and deduce what other players' goals are, the more likely they are to advance on the influence track and become the new de facto ruler of the Council.&#10;&#10;",

It uses a fast action card (FAC) system where each card drawn indicates what kind of action is taking place. Each quarter, you'll draw up to 10 FACs that generate scoring opportunities, rebound possibilities, free throws and player substitutions. Once you understand what each type of action does, the gameplay is pretty quick. Each FAC will usually ask you to check whether the active player on the home or away team has a particular quality. If they do, the team will either score on offence or prevent a score on defence. Once a quarter is completed, the number of scoring successes for each team will then generate a match score that tallies up with normal basketball scoring. After four quarters, if the scores are less than four apart, there is a Final minute phase where furious action can take place to derive a final score. Otherwise, if the score isn't close, you ignore the Final Minute phase.&#10;&#10;",

Frenzied dashes down polished corridors with howling mobs of beasties in hot pursuit. A kicking and screaming Penny being carried off. Again. A desperate battle for time as the Professor prattles inanely, &quot;Maybe we can reason with them&quot;.&#10;&#10;The mutants come in three flavors: normal, radio-active and leader. Map and set-up are randomized for re-playability (there are movable Wall counters). The game is played in 10 turns; victory for either side hinges on control of the Tech Room (where a gate to an unpolluted Earth-like planet has been opened, hopefully allowing the &quot;normies&quot; to escape the muties). Optional rules allow for hidden movement.&#10;&#10;Includes 5-page rulebook, 25&quot; x 12&quot; board, 133 counters, reference card.&#10;&#10;Also the title of a simplified version having the same title.

You may patent brand-new parts in the Patent Office, look for rejected, volatile pieces of machinery in the chaos of the Junk Yard, try to gain an edge through the Back Alley, and finally build your prototype in the Workshop. All this just to please the two investors who are doing the rounds of the different engineering outfits, and who will be evaluating your rickety mess of an automobile. Good timing, keeping an eye on your competitors, and even a dash of luck are all you need to succeed in this business.

This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of France to march through Belgian territory against Germany...&#10;&#10;The GUNS OF AUGUST simulates the first three months of WWI in the West, when mobility reigned and the fate of France hung in the balance. Game mechanics compensate for players&rsquo; 20/20 hindsight to encourage historically accurate play that makes &ldquo;sense&rdquo; in game terms while avoiding a &ldquo;straight jacket&rdquo; of special rules to force irrational play. Players maneuver corps and divisions through 9-mile wide hexagons in turns that span three days each. Chit pull activation, along with modest movement point allowances, generates a highly interactive game. Combat uses artillery and rifles to reveal the comparative strengths of the opposing armies. Optional rules for variable set up and fog of war counters shroud the game in uncertainty and increase replay value.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The lamps are going out all over Europe.

    "Description": "The math game Got It! &ndash; which had a working title of Fermat &ndash; accommodates as many people as fit around the table. What they're looking at on the table is a 6x6 grid of cards, with half the cards numbered 1-14 and the other half bearing mathematical operators. To set up the game, these cards are placed randomly checkerboard-style, with numbers and operators placed adjacent to one another.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously, with players trying to find a five-card formula that results in the number shown on a goal card, with goals ranging from 1 to 40. The solution must consist of orthogonally adjacent cards, though not necessarily in a straight line, and a player can't use a card twice in a formula. If a 12 is turned up as the goal, for example, one might find &quot;8+4x1&quot; in the grid, then shout out &quot;Got It!&quot; Players can mentally insert parentheses into a formula, so &quot;7+2x3&quot; can result in (7+2)x3 (=27) or 7+(2x3) (=13).&#10;&#10;The first player to shout with a correct formula &ndash; and the grid might contain many &ndash; claims the goal card. The player who collects the most goal cards wins!&#10;&#10;An easy version of Got It! can be set up for younger players, with a 5x5 grid that contains only the numbers 1-9 and only addition and subtraction as mathematical operators.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Tiny Woodys, you secretly play a certain animal role, which is assigned randomly and face down at the beginning. This can be a squirrel, a wild boar, a hedgehog, a bunny, a magpie, or an owl. Each animal is looking for something specific and must try to be faster than the others.&#10;&#10;In each of the four seasons, hide the cute little &quot;Woodys&quot; such as leaves, mushrooms, minerals, trees, herbs, and tree fruits. For example, if you got the magpie, you have to try to find four different minerals. However, always try to keep your identity secret from the others! Strategically and cleverly place your cards on your collection spot and use the extra powers on the Woody cards to get to your goal. But be careful as fierce weather and mean fellow players will put obstacles in your way. Who is who? And what are they collecting? The game remains exciting until the end, and you will soon find out. The winner is the player who completes their task first!&#10;&#10;Tiny Woodys is normally for 2-5 players, but in expert mode it's playable with up to six players.&#10;&#10;",

These are very common, used in normal everyday speech, but the words are usually of foreign origin. And to describe a Katakana word, a Japanese person would normally use other Katakana words. The aim of this game is to discover the hidden Katakana word, but without using Katakana words to discuss it. For Japanese speakers, this is quite difficult. As an analogy, try to explain a worker placement game, but without using any game words. As soon as you say 'meeple', or 'VPs', you've lost.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system similar to Insider. A player secretly identifies the hidden Katakana word from a deck. This player is the master, and tries to guide the others to identify the word. If a player gets it correct, the master gains 1 point, and the guesser becomes the master. But if the master gets called out for using a Katakana word, the accuser gains a point and becomes the new master.&#10;&#10;The artwork for the game is by the publisher and design group Decoct Design.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;Our fellow friend Bob. He loves the Japanese language.&#10;&#10;While studying the language, he just realized, that many foreign-origin words were not translated, but accepted as is, as a Katakana word.&#10;&#10;Looking up the Japanese dictionary, he found out many of the Katakana words themselves were described using other Katakana words. &quot;Now I have to create my dictionary of Katakana words, which never uses Katakana for a description!&quot;&#10;&#10;That was the beginning of the creation of the Bob-Dictionary : Bob Jiten(&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#150; &#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#179;).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#231;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#230;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#137;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#168;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#231;&#157;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#232;&#190;&#158;&#229;&#133;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#170;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#190;&#158;&#229;&#133;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From publisher:&#10;&#10;What is it?&#10;&#10;In Septikon we have tried to re-create a retro-futuristic atmosphere which was popular in games like Fallout and BioShock. The players take role of the owners and leaders of orbital mining battle stations, which are hunting for rich uranium deposits in an asteroid belt.&#10;&#10;Since there is not enough uranium for everyone, the players have to fight with other space explorers for every asteroid. By using a rich armory of defensive and offensive measures and a loyal crew of their own clones, the player will have to survive a terrible battle and do everything to be first to put the other player out of action.&#10;&#10;This game is completely unique. Imagine a turn-based game in the Tower Defence genre, where you must not only protect your own prosperity, but also send waves of attackers in your opponent's direction!&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;&#10;The station is not automated, which makes it much more reliable but at the same time requires a crew for manual operation. The player rolls a die, which determines the distance that one of his obedient clones can travel to the required section, to activate a piece of equipment or a weapon which is installed there. The choice of clones and the goal will depend on the current situation and the player's long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;The station is completely autonomous. The player can mine and process resources, carry out repairs, defrost new clones to increase the size of his crew &mdash; but it's not that easy when you are being attacked by your opponent's entire battle force, and you want to teach them a lesson...&#10;&#10;The player wins when he puts the other player's station completely out of action.&#10;&#10;Why should I play Septikon?&#10;&#10;&#10;    It's original. Are you looking for something new? We can guarantee that you have never seen a game like this one!&#10;    It's well developed. Like a good brandy, our game was in development for 12 years &mdash; that's 12 years of constant testing and thousands of matches played.&#10;    It's dynamic. Sid Meier said, &quot;A game is a series of interesting choices.&quot; Septikon will not overload or bore you into a stupor. Of course, the player has something to think about every turn, but he has only a limited number of optimal choices. That means that you won't spend too much time waiting your turn.&#10;    It&rsquo;s multi-faceted: Consider a whole range of strategies that all deserve to be tried out:&#10;        Burning. Burn through the opponent&rsquo;s battle station with your lasers, cutting him off his supplies, ammunition and oxygen.&#10;        Suppression. Destroy his battle sections and maintenance modules, block his shooters and stop him from recovering.&#10;        Landing. Attack your enemy with a squad of fully armored and equipped BioDrones. Let them rip through his defenses.&#10;        Exhaustion. Destroy your opponent&rsquo;s strategic resources with quick targeted attacks and sneaky diversions, and while he is trying to recover, create an invincible army.&#10;        Massacre. Focus your entire production on creating nuclear charges. Suppress the opponent&rsquo;s defenses and drown him in a nuclear fog.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;&#10;&#10;    24 clone figures (in two different colors). Each one of them will obediently carry out all your orders and activate different station modules.&#10;    160 wooden cubes, representing resources which will be needed to run the station and keep it safe: Oxygen, Metal, Rockets, BioMass, Energy, BioDrones and &mdash; obviously &mdash; Uranium;&#10;    4 nuclear Rockets for those who like it hot;&#10;    8 satellite tokens and 8 Energy Shield tokens &mdash; efficient measures for launching your own space-to-space grid;&#10;    80 damage tokens &mdash; during the space battles stations will take a lot of damage, and many sections will be competely put out of action;&#10;    1 huge game board with two stations and some space between them;&#10;    2 six-sided dice, which in this game are called Random Number Generators. A single roll at the beginning of the turn will determine the &quot;time period&quot; which the player can use this turn.&#10;    2 books &mdash; One, consisting of just 2 pages, contains the Intro Game Rules, the other, the full rules (8 pages).&#10;&#10;&#10;How did the game come to life?&#10;&#10;Igrology is one of most successful Russian board game developers. We have created 18 products, many of which are constantly being re-published. In 2011, we have sold over 100,000 copies in total in Russia.&#10;&#10;Now we are facing a new task, to bring unique ideas to the international games' market. Septikon is the first and very important step for us in that direction.&#10;&#10;Septikon was created by the Russian game designer Konstantin Seleznev and polished by 12 years of work and thousands of matches. In 2011, Igrology noticed this original game at the Moscow Games Convention &quot;Igroteka Avtorov&quot;, where all other publishers did not pay a lot of attention to it due to its very unusual concept and seemingly complicated game board.&#10;&#10;The Igrology team, together with the game author, spent almost a year creating a setting, fine-tuning game rules, and polishing the design. Now, we have the pleasure of bringing it to all board game fans.&#10;&#10;During the next year we will be releasing the first expansion, as well as an iPad version of Septikon.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bohnanza: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel is a dice game in the Bohnanza family. Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect ten Bohnentalers wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows five orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &mdash; say, three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &mdash; requiring, say, a three-of-a-kind plus a rare bean &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the five bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and two of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then they reroll any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, they complete as many orders as they can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, they can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of three. When a player harvests the order card, they draw a new card and use that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card they already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &mdash; and not dice already set aside &mdash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much as their opponents might benefit from their turn more than they do.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected ten Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel features the same gameplay as W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, but uses fewer dice, has only five orders on a card instead of six, lowers the victory threshold, and has a few other changes.&#10;&#10;",

The players are divided into the Investigators and one Guardian who plays against them.&#10;&#10;In the 5&times;5 maze created in the box by the Guardian, the Investigators each start from a different point and try to be united. The maze cannot be seen by the Investigators, so they try to advance&#10;with the help of mapping and deduction, which require discussion and cooperation with other Investigators.&#10;&#10;As the mapping proceeds, the time limit becomes shorter and the Guardian grows more powerful.

Along the way, if they lose tricks, they can upgrade their cards to the trump suit.&#10;&#10;In many trick-taking games, players get dealt a hand of cards, assess the strength of their hand, and then make their bid. This game is the reverse: players are aiming for a fixed number of tricks, and they can adjust the strength of their hand by upgrading their cards.&#10;&#10;This game is set up so that each hand at least one player will go over the ideal number of tricks. You can make your hand stronger, but it might cause you to have too strong of a hand!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The suspects are a bunch of incognito babies who try to sneak them out of the mansion. Can you expose your opponent's secret identity and hide yours? Retrieve five bottles of milk and win the game.&#10;&#10;Baby Clues is a deduction game. Every turn you have to expose a little bit of your identity to plan your escape. Every player receives a secret identity as well as an object they hate. For example, the vampire baby doesn't like garlic, the robot baby doesn't like water, and the dirty baby hates soap. On your turn, you have to pick up objects, but you can never pick the object you hate. Choose your items wisely because every card you collect discloses valuable information about your secret identity.&#10;&#10;During the game, you constantly have to try to find the balance between unmasking your opponents and picking up all the objects you need to escape. Both give you the opportunity to score points. If somebody tries to unmask you, but they make a mistake, you also score a bonus point, so a little bit of bluffing can also come in handy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Suleiman the Magnificent is a game covering the massive battle on August 29th, 1526 between the Ottoman Empire and the army of the Kingdom of Hungary that eventually resulted in the fall of the latter kingdom and the disappearance of Hungary as an independent country for 400 years. The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.&#10;&#10;Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.&#10;&#10;Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle.

    "Description": "Lielow is a a two-player game invented by Michael Amundsen and Alek Erickson in the summer of 2021. The goal is to kill the enemy king.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a chessboard and each player needs a large supply of stackable checkers in their own color. In addition, they will need one token each &ndash; called the &quot;crown&quot; &ndash; that can be placed on top of a stack to mark it as that player's king. Initially, 8 checkers of each color are placed exactly where the pawns start out in Chess. There is no king in the initial position.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Each turn, you move one of your stacks in a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line a number of squares exactly equal to the size of the moved stack. (Note: The size of a stack is the number of checkers in it &ndash; not counting the crown.)&#10;&bull; If the stack lands on an empty space, it grows by the addition of 1 checker of your color.&#10;&bull; If the stack lands on an enemy stack, the enemy stack is removed and your stack shrinks down to 1 of your color (unless it was already of size 1, in which case its size simply does not change).&#10;&bull; It is not legal to land on a friendly stack.&#10;&bull; Jumping over stacks is allowed.&#10;&bull; Stacks may also jump off the board, thereby removing themselves from the game.&#10;&bull; Passing is not allowed (i.e. you must move a stack each turn).&#10;&#10;The position of the crowns change throughout the game, and is determined by the following rule:&#10;&bull; After each move (both your own and your opponent's), if your biggest stack is uniquely tall among your stacks, put your crown on that stack. There is no other way the crown can change heads. The stack with a crown on it is your king.&#10;&#10;You win if your opponent's king is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, represents 3 minutes in the match, each Player plays 1 Action card face down. Attacker may play Dribble / Pass / One-Two, Defender may play Press / Block / Anticipate / Tackle.&#10;&#10;Reveal both cards. If Defender can predict Attacker's action, Defender has taken the ball successfully. If not then Attacker may execute the action, it can be a Shot on Goal, move the ball one Area forward, and/or get a Star (bonus for Shot on Goal).&#10;&#10;The Tackle card is very powerful because can defeat both Pass and One-Two actions, but if Attacker plays Dribble then it's a Foul: Defender must discard the Tackle/Rebound card until the end of the half and Attacker gets a Free Kick or Penalty.&#10;&#10;The ball will go back and forth as each Team tries to find an opening to make a good Shot on Goal. A Shot on Goal: Defender holds 6 Chance cards in front of him (so he can see the cards), then the attacker will take the card one by one, up to the Shot's Strength. It gives a thrilled, scared feeling when the Attacker's hand moving from one card to another to choose. &quot;Don't pick this, don't pick this&quot; or &quot;take that one, take that one&quot; will echo in Defender's head, and the eye contact will add another layer of bluffing.&#10;&#10;Let the game begin. FWEEEEETTTTTT!!!!&#10;&#10;Soccer 17 is easy to play and carry, exciting, and has a strong soccer feel. Plus you can make tournament or league easily.&#10;&#10;",

The forest is a dark and lonely place.

Only the vampire can see what's going on around them. The hunted players have the navigate the board through touch and memory only!&#10;&#10;Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter differs from Nyctophobia in that the hunter player takes on the role of vampire instead of the axe murderer or mage in the original game. The vampire can control the familiar and the player who is leading them out of the forest, leading to tricky situations for those in the dark. The game includes two pre-set maps for players to work through while they're trying to rescue the NPC familiar and return them to the car without anyone dying.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arvuutin is a new kind of trivia/estimation game from Onni Games!&#10;&#10;The main idea is that players answer to each question by playing number cards from their hands. On his turn, a player chooses a question from one of the question categories. After the question has been read out loud, all players choose their answer by playing cards face down on the table. All answers are revealed simultaneously. Each question has an answer between 1-100 and player's answer is the sum of the numbers he played. The player whose answer is closest to the correct answer, wins the question card for himself/herself but loses the number cards he/she played. Players may also play 'pass'-card and skip the question, but get to draw new number cards instead.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players calculate their scores: players get points from won question cards and from hidden score cards that are dealt in the beginning of the game. During the game, players may influence what is the value of each question category at the end of the game - category's value depends on how many questions has been asked from that category. The game comes with eight question categories, from which five are chosen for each game. The player with the most points at the end of the game, is the winner!&#10;&#10;Arvuutin offers a fast paced and fun trivia-experience for all people!

    "Description": "The Rhineland Crisis War, 1936-37, designed by Joseph Miranda,is a strategic-level simulation of intermediate complexity that covers an alternative World War II in Europe, one that began in 1936. The assumption is, when Hitler ordered his army to march into the Rhineland, the Allied powers, instead of appeasing him, ordered their armed forces to resist. The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.&#10;&#10;Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.&#10;&#10;Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month. Units of maneuver are corps and armies.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover: crises, political collapse, reinforcements, replacements, terror bombing, railroads, fog of war, airpower, naval and amphibious operations, weather, neutrals, the Soviet Union, armistice and surrender, the Spanish Civil War, expeditionary forces, airborne units, air transport, fifth columns, alpine units, and anti-aircraft units. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. Axis Player Turn&#10; A. Axis Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Axis Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Axis Movement Phase&#10; D. Axis Combat Phase&#10; E. Axis Rally Phase&#10; F. Axis Crisis Phase&#10;II. Allied Player Turn&#10; A. Allied Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Allied Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Allied Movement Phase&#10; D.

The goal is to cleverly manage your energy, earn as much cash as possible, get cool new gear, increase your reputation on the streets, and back the villains that will be the most beneficial for you in order to get as much victory points as possible.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they will combine two actions by drafting an action cube from the game board and place it on an action space on their crib board. Actions include going to The Dojo to increase your energy, shopping for new gear at The Supermarket, earn a little extra at the local Diner, or mixing things up on the game board at The Nightclub. Players can also go hustling on the streets and advance on different hustle tracks for all sorts of rewards and compete for the top spot.&#10;&#10;But most importantly, players will use their actions to commit to different daring villain schemes by placing energy markers on them to increase the chances of success and rewards. Each villain has a unique deck of schemes with a special theme and game mechanic offering different risk and rewards for every round. So players will have to consider carefully which ones to support&hellip; Will you take a risk with Kid Random's schemes for a potential bigger reward, go trade with Jolly Butcher, or play it safe with The Doctor?

    "Description": "Disciple Detective is a deduction game for 2-5 players. Each player begins with a handful of Disciples that only the other players can see. Individuals must use their deduction skills and intuition to determine what Disciples they have. Players may take notes on the back of their cards with a dry erase marker to help determine which disciples are in their hands.&#10;&#10;The cooperative version of Disciple Detective has the group trying to deduce all of the Disciples in the deck before running out of Clue Tokens.&#10;&#10;At the start of a player's turn, the player must decide which of these three actions to take:&#10;&#10;1.  Give a Trait Clue &#10;2.  Order Players&rsquo; Hands&#10;3.  Guess a Disciple&#10;&#10;When giving a Trait Clue, the player looks at the other player's hand, selects a Trait such as which disciples have a known origin, and then touches each card having that trait.  For ordering other players' hands, the player orders each other player's hand by selecting the cards in chronological order.  To guess a disciple the player raises one of their cards and tells the other players what disciple is in hand.  If correct, they discard the disciple and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;Some disciples have quirks, special rules that must be followed when giving clues, and these Quirks will make it more difficult to deduce the disciples in a player's hand.  For example, James and John always want to be first and second when ordered. Peter, on the other hand, will run to the end of the line when ordered.  Judas will just lie about his traits.  Bartholomew will remove the quirks from the other disciples in a player's hand, but that is actually not that helpful.&#10;&#10;A Clue Token is used up every time an action is used, unless a player correctly guesses one of their disciples in which case the player may either take a free action or take back a Clue Token.  If at any time the team runs out of Clue Tokens, the players all lose.&#10;&#10;In addition to the cooperative version of Disciple Detective, there is also a competitive version where each player has their own group of Disciples to deduce before the other players deduce their own.  Players actions are similar to the cooperative version except clues are received instead of given.  The first player to deduce their starting group of disciples wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the victory in North Africa, Allied planners readied a new campaign.  It was aimed at the so called &lsquo;soft underbelly&lsquo; of Europe.  A bold plan to knock Italy out of the war and drain Axis units from fighting on other fronts. Beginning with the invasion of Sicily in July of 1943, the Allies pressed the enemy, but there was nothing soft about the bloody fight. The drive to Messina in Sicily, the landing at Salerno, the beleaguered beachhead at Anzio, through all the Allies pushed on towards Rome.  Countless river valleys and fortified lines favored the German defenders and stymied the Allies at every turn.  The Volturno River, the Rapid River, the Liri valley, the Gustav Line, the Caesar Line, all of these names proved a deadly challenge to the Allies fighting to control them. The drive up the Italian Peninsula was costly for both sides and dragged on until the end, which occurred May 2, 1945 with the formal surrender of all Axis forces in Italy.&#10;&#10;Old School Tactical Volume IV brings the exciting OST system to this challenging theater of WW2.  It brings British forces into the game to battle German and Italian units in difficult terrain.  Vickers machine guns,  Commandos,  Bren guns, PIATs and sticky bombs will see action in the game on the side of the British.  They also have an allotment of vehicles including Sherman and Churchill tanks.&#10;The German and Italian forces counter with many panzers including the Marder III and Elefant.&#10;A large map of beautiful Italian countryside is designed for players to contest the many exciting scenarios included in the playbook.&#10;&#10;Two players contest each scenario using counters representing the soldiers, guns, and vehicles that fought these desperate battles. On each turn, play goes back and forth between the sides as Impulse Points are spent to enable a player's forces to act. When the battle is over, casualty and victory points are tallied and a victor is declared.&#10;&#10;Infantry target other soft units and attack using their Firepower value against the target&rsquo;s Defense value.  The attack can be modified by Leadership, support weapons and terrain effects. When things get intense, Assault moves into enemy hexes result in deadly Close Combat.  Dice rolls are made using the Infantry Combat Table, and results are implemented.  Attacking armored vehicles requires a roll to hit the vehicle.  If a hit is scored, the Firepower value of the attacker&rsquo;s gun is used against the target&rsquo;s front or flank defense value.  Dice rolls are made using the Vehicle Combat Table and results are enforced. Vehicles may also use their HE Firepower value and secondary armaments directly against soft targets using the Infantry Combat Table.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anagrams is a game where players reveal letter tiles one at a time, claiming any word as soon as they can make it. Once a word is in front of someone, other players may steal it by making an anagram of it which introduces other letters from the pool.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Snatch and Scrabble Scoring Anagrams. Published during the same time frame as the 1877 Word Making and Taking. A version of this game using the word &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; in its title was published by Thomas Whittaker in New York on or before 1875 and was called &ldquo;The Game of Anagrams&rdquo;. With Parker Brothers and McLoughlin Brothers both releasing Anagrams games in 1890, this likely reflects the expiry of the 17 year patent period that existed at the time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Many editions of the game have been sold and exact rules vary, but one version runs as follows:&#10;&#10;The players shuffle the letters in the &quot;pool&quot; thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.&#10;&#10;Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.&#10;&#10;Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.&#10;&#10;When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.&#10;&#10;Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.&#10;&#10;Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.&#10;&#10;When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.&#10;&#10;If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;",

All cards are dealt to the players, who are on two teams of two.&#10;&#10;Due to there being two of each card, the first card played is the high card (if the Ace of Spades is played first, it would beat the other Ace of Spades if it was played during the same round).&#10;&#10;Unlike Euchre, where there is a turned-up card that dictates what is trump (trump being a suit that beats all other suits, with the Jack of the suit being the highest, the other like-coloured Jack being second highest, then Ace, King, Queen, 10 and 9), each player bids how many tricks he/she thinks they can take and the what they want as trump. Valid bids are suits and no trump. No trump means that there is no trump suit and Aces are the high card for each suit. Each player bids once, with the person to the left of the dealer starting and the dealer ending the bidding round. Whoever has the highest bid starts the first hand.&#10;&#10;Play starts with the starting player playing one card face up. Following players must follow suit if they can, otherwise, they can play any card they want. High card takes the trick and dictates who starts the next hand. Play continues until all cards have been played (each player will have 8 cards).&#10;&#10;Each team counts the number of tricks they took during the round. The team that won the bid must have at least the number of tricks they bid to score. Otherwise, they lose the number of points bid (if they bid 4 and only took 3 tricks, they lose 4 points). It is possible to have a score in the negatives. The non-bidding team scores a point for each trick they took.&#10;&#10;Teams can bid lone hands, requiring them to take all 8 tricks. If they do, they can score extra points. If they don't they will lose those points.&#10;&#10;After each player has dealt twice, the game is over. The team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Ten scenarios are provided, five historical and five balanced &quot;tournament&quot; situation. Scale is 600 yards/hex.&#10;&#10;Gunfire and torpedo fire are figured in &quot;factors&quot; per turret, with all guns of the same caliber firing on a single target rolling once, using a range-modified ordered-pair of dice against a table, for number of hits. The location of each hit is then determined by another ordered-pair roll against another table.&#10;&#10;Each ship has a damage sheet showing its gunnery and torpedo layout, and giving number of factors for each turret/mount. It also serves as the damage record sheet for the ship, and specifies armor thickness over protected locations (e.g. belt, primary turrets, secondary turrets, bridge). A ship sinks when its last hull box is marked off.&#10;&#10;The game is basically set up for two-player ftf, but short rules for PBM, moderated two-player, and moderated multi-player are provided.&#10;&#10;&#10;The second edition, Iron bottom Sound 2 (note post-WWII spelling of title), was published by Moments in History in 1998.&#10;&#10;Some significant rules changes (torpedo rules in particular) and a different scenario mix.

    "Description": "Decision at Kasserine: Rommel's Last Chance, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by Vance von Borries first published in 1983, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. Hailed by many as of the premier entry in the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series, this two-player operational level simulation covers the WWII German and Italian offensive in central Tunisia which took place in mid-February 1943.&#10;&#10;This edition of Decision at Kasserine features a super-sized map and counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.&#10;&#10;On the morning of February 19, the Germans launched their attack through the Kasserine Pass. Heavy damage was inflicted on the Allied forces, causing the Allies to retreat 50 miles. Despite these losses and setbacks, Allied forces and reserves managed to regroup and hold on February 22, launching a massive artillery attack to halt the German advances. Faced with his own overextended supply lines and an Allied force that was now being reinforced, Rommel withdrew and ordered all Axis units to concentrate on defending the German-held coastal areas. Had the German-Italian army succeeded, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened, thus possibly delaying the Allied invasion of Europe.This offensive was the last major Axis effort which offered a realistic chance to reverse their fortunes in North Africa.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature edition of the classic Vance von Borries game goes beyond a mere culmination of the forward strides made with subsequent games published in the series; it now features a major update to the game system that will be implemented in future game releases of the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series. In terms of superior physical presentation, all aspects have been upgraded, including super-sized components; larger game map and 5/8&quot; counters. Some of the enhancements made in this edition include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Super-sized components feature 5/8&rdquo; counters and two game maps with large hexes&#10;&bull; Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork&#10;&bull; Supporting charts convey more information at a glance for ease of play&#10;&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts&#10;&bull; Updated the Order of Battle based on new information and analysis&#10;&bull; Fixed the original deployment and OoB based on archival information&#10;&bull; The rules treatment is all-new with a full re-write backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions. Some rules were simplified, others enhanced.&#10;&bull; Redesigned treatment on air units, armor bonus, and strongpoints in combat and a clarified treatment on the artillery rules&#10;&bull; New rules cover infiltration movement, combat evasion and retreat options&#10;&bull; New optional rules cover mountain units, certain reinforcements, Allied artillery concentrations, and considerable Allied command problems&#10;&bull; Many all-new historical notes can be found throughout the rules presentation&#10;&bull; Three new scenarios have been added&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (no hidden units; variable German victory conditions)&#10;Time Scale: 12 hours per turn&#10;Map Scale: two miles per hex&#10;Unit Scale: companies and battalions, artillery batteries or groups&#10;Players: one to two, best with two&#10;Playing Time: 3-8 hours depending upon scenario&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Two map sheets&#10;Three countersheets (5/8&quot; size)&#10;Rules booklet with updated Historical Notes&#10;Three player aid cards&#10;Three order of appearance display cards (Axis &amp; Allied)&#10;One six-sided die&#10;Box and Lid&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Wars Labyrinth uses the same basic game play as Ravensburger's decades-old title The aMAZEing Labyrinth. Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!&#10;&#10;To this basic game, Star Wars Labyrinth adds one twist &ndash; a Darth Vader variant in which a Vader token starts the game on a designated tile. Whenever a player has a card that includes a small Darth Vader icon, that player needs to reach the desired symbol with Vader instead of his own token. As a result, multiple people might be trying to move Vader at the same time. Who wields the Force with enough power to bend Vader to his will?&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Labyrinth&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Supply Lines of the American Revolution: The Northern Theater, 1775-1777 was a surprise hit for publisher Hollandspiele and designer Tom Russell. Popular with grognards and logistics nerds alike, it secured a nomination for the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Wargame. This hotly anticipated standalone sequel covers the second half of the American War of Independence, and shifts the scene to the Southern colonies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas.&#10;&#10;It's more than just a change in locale, however; this game has a very different feel and emphasis than its predecessor. Both sides have much smaller armies with far fewer resources. The South, after all, is really a very minor theater: the British are chiefly concerned with holding onto their Caribbean possessions, particularly with the French, Dutch, and Spanish circling around those profitable islands, while George Washington is obsessed with taking back New York. Unsupported, Cornwallis must attempt to pacify the southern colonies one at a time while coming to grips with the slippery colonials, while avoiding being trapped himself. Maneuver is central this time around, thanks to new and utterly unforgiving siege rules.&#10;&#10;And while this operational cat-and-mouse chase dances across the colonies, partisan warfare rages as both sides seek to win hearts and minds. Crown Loyalists can greatly extend Cornwallis's supply lines, while daring Patriot Militia can harass the redcoats with Raids.&#10;&#10;To win this game and the war itself, you'll need to master irregular warfare, operational maneuver, siegecraft, naval affairs, and, of course, and perhaps above all, logistics.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As was the case with the first game, With It Or On It (2019), The Grass Crown is a fresh, innovative taken on familiar material. The primary unit of maneuver is a &quot;Wing&quot; which itself consists of ten or so individual counters. Losses can be resolved by flipping the individual unit that was attacked, or by flipping any unit adjacent to it. Unrelenting pressure in the right places can prompt a Rout Check, causing the line to collapse. As the result of a single attack, multiple units can find themselves in your dead pile.&#10;&#10;This simple but compelling theme sees many variations thanks to special rules that chart the evolution of Roman warfare, and contrasts them with the rigid Greek Phalanx, the sophisticated army of Hannibal, and the ferocity of the Gauls.&#10;&#10;The ten battles are: Heraclea, Asculum, Trebbia, Zama, Pydna, Second Citra, Vercellae, Pharsalus, Thapsus, and Munda.&#10;&#10;",
