One of these is flipped open, showing a dictionary of an alien language. The other cards are placed in a row, with the spaceship card between two other cards.&#10;&#10;The players now discuss their plan, using only the words on the dictionary card. Afterwards, they simultaneously lift 1-5 fingers. If the overall number of fingers matches the number of the sector card before the ship, they advance by one position. If not, the last card of the row is removed. The ship escapes to safety when it reaches the front of the row and is destroyed when there are no cards behind it.&#10;&#10;",

There are three different game pieces players can use, each with unique rules and behaviours. Pieces move along the grid 1 square at a time, and can land on top of one another, forming stacks up to 3 pieces in height. Generally, only units on top of stacks can move, meaning players can block their opponent by landing on top of their pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player aims to win by moving one of their pieces into the other player's target square on the board, marked with a coloured target symbol.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the description&#10;&#10;",

She has limited supplies and is hoping for a miracle.&#10;&#10;By nature she is an extrovert and a fatalist, but possesses a strong charisma. She is not a loner, though all witches tend to limit their associations with the mundane world. In her youth she was a house slave of a human family in the metropolis of Gory, and she hated every moment of it. Witches always focus their powers on one aspect of magic or another; hers being transmutation and transference.&#10;&#10;The grotto is a lush underground cave heated by a hot spring. It&rsquo;s limestone walls sheltered the coven for centuries, but now the insectoids have burrowed their way in, and it&rsquo;s usefulness to Aisha has passed.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes:&#10;&#10;Hero: Aisha, the Uncanny Shapeshifter.

During a players turn, that player can take up to two actions out. Actions include movement, repairing, and attacks. Attacks include shoving, which moves the target a number of spaces, as well as melee and ranged attacks. Most attacks result in a limb point check, for instance when punching the point value of the strongest arm of the attacking robot is compared to the targeted limb of the defending robot and a higher value on the attacking part leads to the defending robot losing one hit point in the targeted limb.&#10;&#10;Doing damage to opponent robots, as well as holding the center area of the board gives points. The first robot to gain 24 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The highest bidder pays tokens to the player who rolled the dice (or the bank if the highest bidder was the rolling player). The highest bidder has a chance to re-roll dice, and then chooses cards from their hand and/or table which match (some of) their dice. These cards are placed face up in front of the player.&#10;&#10;Once the player is done, the player refills their hand up to five cards, and the table is refilled up to eight cards. The turn then passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;If, at the end of a turn, a player has five cards face up in front of them, the game ends. End score is calculated by combining the point values of the face up cards of each player and the remaining tokens they have. The player with the highest point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The Map of the Realm is always different and compiled by players from 48 tiles, before the game begins. Each Cult has an unique advantage throughout the game, moreover, additional artifacts will grant other powerful advantages. A player's turn is as short as possible, to keep everyone interested: each player throws the dice, chooses one action and performs the effects of that action. The main goal is to gather resources: converting villages or finding powerful artifacts. Luck plays its role in this contest, a dice is used at the beginning of each turn, and each player can sometimes draw cards from three different decks: Artifact Cards, Ruin Cards or Debate Cards. Sacrifice tokens can be obtained during the game and used as extra dice points. The game ends when a player has enough resources to perform the Ritual of Ascending at the King's Castle and becomes the Prophet, winning the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&quot;Welcome to the epic world of religious doctrines, where everyday events may help shape the world to come.&#10;You start this Game of Truths as a Lost Soul, longing for spiritual fulfillment. As soon as the doctrine is revealed to you, set forth to spreading it among the villagers. Some of them may prove too resilient to new ideas, so you may have to use powerful artifacts to help you on your holy quest. As your popularity rises, your tasks will become easier, but be warned that your competitors may challenge you at any time.&#10;Who will emerge as the True Prophet of the Realm?&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

The game is composed by 3 stages in which you have to build your very own robot, build the arena and filled with traps and last but not least....fight!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you have to choose at least one of three available actions: move, attack or push your enemy against walls and traps to deal damages!&#10;&#10;The game takes from 30 to 40 minutes per game, with simple and easy to learn rules. ULTRA is a fast-paced game and was designed primarily as a party game that can be enjoyed both from non-boardgames players and hardcore players (we all need a party game in our library!).&#10;&#10;ULTRA can be played as a single match or, if you have multiple players, tournaments can be arranged!&#10;&#10;Unlike others Robot/Wargaming boardgames ULTRA has unique features that you won't see in other boardgames.&#10;&#10;We made up a tailored draft mode that allows you to build your robot relying not only in lucky but also in strategy.&#10;&#10;You have to build your own Arena and fill it with different traps, each game won't be the same!&#10;&#10;Dead players can still play! As a dead player you can perform one out of three actions to change the course of the game!&#10;&#10;As mentioned before, after building you robot through the draft, you have to build the arena by just placing the tiles on table following just one simple rule: each tile has to be connected with at least two squares. Then traps will be randomly picked up and placed by each player wherever they want. Now it's time for players to put the robots into the arena and that's it! You're ready to fight!!&#10;&#10;During your turn you have to perform at least 1 action from 3 available: &#10;&#10;     Attack: Use your main weapon to deal damage to the enemies by rolling dice &#10;     Move: Use your movement points to move around the arena &#10;     Push: Use your movement points to push enemies against walls or move them into traps. If you kill an enemy you will receive 1 Gear Point but, if you have all your Gear Points, you won't over-exceed them. &#10;&#10;&#10;You're dead? Don't leave! Because you can still have a role in the game! As a &quot;dead player&quot; you have to perform 1 action between moving a trap to a free square in the arena or swapping a trap in the arena with another one not in the arena.

Luckily for him that he brought his distress beacon. Beep.. Beep.. The Beacon&rsquo;s signal went wide and far, and even a spaceship way out there received the emergency call. Now Heroes from all parts of the world are heading to the signal to be the first to escort the King out of the dreadful waters. Swip Swap Heroes: is a casual Tile based board building game, where the aim of the game is, to be the Hero that leads the lost King, back to safety. It might sound easy enough, but you will have to battle Trambambolins, Selfie Sticks, Monsters, other Heroes and much more in order to accomplish glory and fame in the kingdom of Baffleburgh.&#10; In the Tile-laying game Swip Swap Heroes: There are monsters, utility and mechanical tiles to build with, and four Teams to choose from: the Space Monkeys from outer space, The deep diver Nemo and his Octopus, The Pirate Sisters and the Nerdy Adventureres, they all bring a set of unique Tiles to the game. Each player controls a Team of two Heroes. These Teams compete against each other by setting traps, pushing each other over the edge and manipulate the sea by placing Tiles.&#10; In Swip Swap Heroes: your goal is to be the first Hero that brings the King back to safety, by getting to him, and carrying him back to your Team Island, or by holding the King when the enough Sand Tiles have been placed. The King starts in the center of the board (5x5 Tile Layout), and the four Team Islands are placed in each corner.&#10; Each player has 3 dice in their own color, which are used to determine who goes first, and for resolving battles. In Swip Swap Heroes:, each game starts with building the Sea, 20 of the 70 adventure Tiles are evenly handed out between each player. The first player starts by placing the first Tile face down, then the player to his left places a Tile, and so on. When all twenty Tiles are laid down, the race against the tide begins. You have to remember where you placed the helpful Tiles that you have planned to move on and evade your own traps!&#10; On your turn, you have two Heroes that you can act with, each of them can choose between two actions: move or build. When moving on a Tile, it is revealed and resolved. Entering traps or getting pushed over the edge by another player sends your Hero back to your Team Island, where your Hero will be ready again on your next turn. When encountering another Hero, a battle begins, each Hero rolls their dice against each other, the one with the greatest outcome wins, and the opponent falls into the Sea. When you win a battle against another Hero or monster, you earn Fame, Fame are one time use dice that you can collect and choose to use in need. Mechanical Tiles can help you move quickly into the center and the more the board is getting reveal the more strategic it becomes, should you move or build on top of your opponents path and send him into a trap or maybe you should let him get the King and then push him into the Sea?&#10;&#10;The tide rises every time a Sand Tile is placed on top of certain used Tiles such as a Treasure Tile, When the last Sand Tile is placed in the sea the tide has fully risen and the Hero carrying the King at the end of that turn wins the game. Swip Swap Heroes: is a game that you grow into, the more you play, the more familiar you become with the Tiles and their combinations, it is a ever changing Sea, with new strategies and challenges in every game, enjoy and have fun.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The legends of the Three Kingdoms say that the Tengu were men, once. Their pride in life cursed them to exist after death as demons, bound to protect the forests and mountains they once claimed to own. Hybrids of man and bird, the Tengu are incredibly swift, aggressive, and very territorial. More than one man has fallen victim to their razor talons for daring to despoil the Tengu's hunting grounds with mining, logging, or simply existing where one should not be. The sight of a Tengu is seen as presaging rebellion and war, the earth itself rising up against the enemy.&#10;&#10;Despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, the Tengu are not entirely hostile. There are even rumors that they help train the Torakage, explaining the latter's swiftness and stealth.

Anonymous behind leering demonic masks, these hardened warriors are experts with the ten sacred weapons of Wxu-Shu. Only on the orders of the clan are these weapons used, as to do otherwise is punishable by death.&#10;&#10;The Brothers are recruited from the lower ranks of the Three Kingdoms, those who will serve loyally to lift themselves from the constant toil of their daily lives. They are trained rigorously, rewarded with wealth and prestige, and seen as tools of the clan.&#10;&#10;Their oni masks no only make them even more fearsome in battle, but also prevent Brothers from being identified on the street. As a method of passive control, it is highly effective. Throughout the Three Kingdoms, and these days in Malifaux's Little Kingdom as well, no one speaks ill of the clan in case a Brother is nearby.&#10;&#10;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic.

More than once a clan member has been accosted by the little poppet, who with a deliberate tilt of its mask reminds them that their mission is not yet complete.&#10;&#10;Shadow is the embodiment of the clan's ideals; silent, honorable, and deadly when necessary. Wielding a small but razor sharp blade with surprising accuracy, and with the shadows concealing clan members on its silent command, Shadow protects and aids the clan as it sees fit.

    "Description": "In Manimals: Tierpark Hellabrunn, which features animals found in that particular zoo, players compete to find as many animals as possible with a certain characteristic. To start play, shuffle the animal cards, then spread forty of them on the table so that everyone can see them. Flip over one card, see the characteristic identified on this card, then race to pick up all animals that feature this characteristic. Once everyone has finished picking up cards, check all the cards collected to see whether anyone made a mistake; if so, that player must return the mistaken card and one correctly collected card.&#10;&#10;Players repeat this process six more times, first laying out three more cards from the deck each time, then they see who has collected the most cards and won!&#10;&#10;",

Or stick it to your rivals with challenging twists to make them suffer. Be sure to peg your opponents with the foam ball when their time is up, or they&rsquo;ll never stop! This rude, rowdy party game will get your mind in the gutter and your friends rolling on the floor!&#10;&#10;Contests:  500 Doubles-Sided Cards, 24 Twist Tiles, 1 Sand Timer, 1 Ball, Instructions.&#10;&#10;How To Play:&#10;&#10;1)  Separate into two teams.  If you have an odd number of players, make the teams as even as possible.&#10;&#10;2)  The cards have a green side and a pink side.  Select which color will be used for the entire game.&#10;&#10;3)  Shuffle the Twist Tiles and create a face-down draw pile.  Each team draws one tile.&#10;&#10;4)  Select which team will guess first and which player from that team will act first (the Actor).&#10;&#10;5)  Start the timer!&#10;&#10;6)  The Actor draws a card adn acts out the word or phrase.&#10;    Acting Rules:  &#10;    You cannot say words or make any sounds with your mouth.&#10;    You cannot mouth any words or write any letters in the air.&#10;&#10;7   The Actor's team shouts out guesses.  When a teammate guesses the card, the Actor draws another card and keeps going.&#10;&#10;8)  At the end of the turn, collect the cards that were correctly guessed and put them in a score pile for the team.  Any cards that were not guessed are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;9)  Now it's the other team's turn.  Continue taking turns, alternating teams, and selecting a different actor each time.&#10;&#10;Twist Tiles:  Mess With Your Opponents&#10;&#10;Correctly guess cards with a Twist icon to earn tiles that will sabotage the other team or give your team an advantage.&#10;&#10;1) At the start of a turn, the team that's not guessing may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.  Then the guessing team may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.&#10;&#10;2)  Read each played tile out loud and follow the rule written on it for the entire turn. (Rules affecting the Actor may be suspended in order to draw and read cards, but must be followed when acting out the card.)&#10;&#10;PASS ONE CARD:  These Twist Tiles do not need to be played at the start of the turn.  If the guessing team has one of these tiles, they may play it at any time in order to skip a card.&#10;&#10;3)  At the end of the turn, the guessing team draws one Twist Tile for each correctly guessed card with a Twist icon on it.&#10;&#10;4)  Review all of the Twist Tiles earned that turn.  Select ONE to keep and discard the rest.&#10;&#10;5)  Create a discard pile of any played or discarded Twist Tiles.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile.&#10;&#10;NOTE:  There is no limit to the number of Twist Tiles a team can have.&#10;&#10;THE BALL:  The Timer Doesn't End The Turn - You Do!&#10;When the timer runs out, any member of the throwing team (the team that is not guessing) may throw the ball at the Actor.&#10;&#10;- If the actor dodges the ball, they may continue acting out clues and scoring.  The throwing team has to keep taking shots!&#10;&#10;- If the Actor is hit with the ball, the turn ends.&#10;&#10;- If the Actor catches the ball, the turn ends, but the guessing team draws an additional Twist Tile before selecting one to keep.&#10;&#10;THROWING RULES:&#10;&#10;- Not in the face!&#10;- Inf the ball misses, a member of the throwing team must retrieve the ball and return to their original seat before throwing it again.&#10;&#10;Note:  The guessing team may warn the Actor when the timer is getting low, but they cannot interfere with throwing.&#10;&#10;WINNERS!:  After all players have had a chance to act, count up the cards in each team's score pile.  Whichever team has the most cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;Note:  If one team is larger, one member of the smaller team will be the Actor again, so both teams take the same number of turns.  Want a longer game?  Have everyone be the Actor two or three times before counting your score.&#10;&#10;DELINQUENTS:  At some point, someone is going to screw up.  Here's what to do...&#10;&#10;- If an acting rule or Twist Tile rule is broken, the card being acted is removed from the game and the guessing team cannot score it.  The Actor draws another card and continues their turn.&#10;&#10;- If a throwing rule is broken, the throw does not count.  The throwing team must throw again.&#10;&#10;- If the guessing team intercepts the ball or interferes with a throw, the turn immediately ends.&#10;&#10;",

A zombie outbreak has happened right in your town.&#10;Its time to scavenge for gear and hope you do not run into to many zombies!&#10;Will you be the last and only survivor of the Apocketalypse?&#10;&#10;Apocketalypse is a quick and fun dice elimination game, with a few cards thrown in for good measure. Each player selects a random character that has a skill that will hopefully keep them alive, such as extra dice or rerolls.&#10;&#10;Each turn players scavenge and are dealt a random card that is either gear or a zombie. You then roll a number of attack and zombie dice, based on the characters skill and what gear or zombie card they scavenged. If you&rsquo;re lucky and roll well you heal or escape from the zombies, if you&rsquo;re roll isn&rsquo;t so lucky zombies will take a bite or two and you&rsquo;ll loose your health tokens.&#10;&#10;The last player with health is declared the Survivor of the Apocketalypse and wins!&#10;&#10;The whole game fits nice and neatly into your pocket so you can take it anywhere you go!&#10;&#10;",

Cards are powerful when possessed in numbers, but only the first player to discard them all wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game of Kingship uses an 80 card deck ranging in card values from Ace to King and contains 3 various suits (Light, Dark, and Terra). Players must compete against their opponents to become the first player to use (or lose) all of their cards. Anyone familiar with the popular card game &quot;Crazy Eights&quot; with be able to jump into a game of Kingship right off the bat. Match the suit or number value to play a card and trigger its awesome card abilities! It is important to remember however that the closer you are to victory, the greater the chance you will become a target. That is why it's often a good idea to remain passive at the start and wait for another player to make the first move. For once a Queen is declared, any player may acquire Kingship, and from there, they can literally change the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The first of the final 3 trilogy games in the Shadows Upon Lassadar world&#10;&#10;This is a short, two player, battle-line style game in which the remaining Elder Wardens of Lassadar and their followers try and stop the incursions of Shadowmajik from the boundaries between dimensional planes. Events take place after the wars against the Grayking and Raven Consort and the invasions of the Barons of the South. Damage due to spell casting has caused rifts and tears between dimensions.&#10;&#10;Setup: &#10;Players choose who will be the Shadowmajik player and who will represent the Wardens of Lassadar. The Location cards are shuffled and 7 are dealt face up in a row between the players. Rotate the Location cards as required so they are all in the same orientation with the Location name readable to the Warden Player. The remaining 2 cards are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A Player card is given to each player. They should orient it toward their side of the Location cards - Wardens or Shadowmajik.&#10;&#10;Players each take 4 dice and all 4 of either the white or black cubes.&#10;&#10;Play: &#10;Players take simultaneous turns in a round, competing in battle at the current Location card (as designated by the yellow cube marker) and contesting over it. Both players place one hand at the top of their Player card and then players roll their respective 4 dice and keep them hidden behind their hand. Dice are placed adjacent to the four corners of their Player cards.&#10;&#10;2 Dice are Battle dice and are added together as the base Battle Number in that location.&#10;&#10;1 Die is the Power die and may be used to gain additional Mana or Shadowmajik points on a player&rsquo;s track (the die value is divided by 2 and rounded up for the total Mana or Shadowmajik gained). A player may never possess more MP or SP than the maximum (6) listed on the track.&#10;&#10;1 Die is the Casting die and may be used to cast a spell as listed on player card. A player may cast a spell equal to the die value or exactly one value below die value and must pay the listed MP or SP to do so. Certain spells show a Resonance icon next to the die face. If the current location has a matching Resonance icon those spells cost 1 less MP or SP.&#10;&#10;You may not use a Power and Casting die on same turn. Only one of these dice will be placed on a corner as an active die.&#10;&#10;Both players then reveal their 3 placed dice.&#10;&#10;The player with the stronger Battle Number will place and/or move a cube on their respective track on the current Location card a number of spaces. This is calculated based on a nomograph table.&#10;&#10;Players only have 3 cubes so, with 7 Locations, they must decide where to deploy forces and which Locations to contest.&#10;&#10;Once a Location is won (when a player&rsquo;s cube moves to highest space on their track) that card will be slid towards the winner and they gain control over it. That Location will not be contested over again. The players take back their cubes from the card to their general supply. Location cards should be slid to fill in the gap left by the now controlled location.&#10;&#10;After each round, the losing player decides the next location to move the yellow cube to.&#10;&#10;Game End: &#10;Play continues until one player has gained control over 4 Locations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Politics is our life.&#10;&#10;My vote, my voice, my beliefs determine my daily life and decide my life. When you make the right choice, the world moves in the right direction. The more I have more interest, the more transparent the politics. If we want a world where common sense is common, we must respect the importance of politics. And a small board game, Political World, that moves such a politicized book into a real sense of humor can make it easier and more fun for people to come into politics.&#10;&#10;Basic rules&#10;Polytical World is basically a marble type game that moves on a dice and can be played from a minimum of two to four (recommended). All players start as members of parliament. The board includes a total of 24 arcades including starting lines and TV discussions, including districts that reflect real politics.&#10;&#10;20% approval ratings in 5% increments will be substituted for currency and can be obtained using event cards and power cards. The approval rate certificate is held by the NEC, which replaces the bank, and when the NEC declines, it begins to take over and take away from other players. If you are in prison and lose your approval rate, you will be eliminated.&#10;The event card is the core of the game. It is a 72-card that combines the political and social issues of Korea with satire and humor. There is a variety of events and humor, including the approval rate certificate, loss, and imprisonment. The latest issue is updated every year for each edition.&#10;&#10;When the presidential election comes back every 12 months during the contest, the person with the highest approval rating is the president. The president has powerful power and gets the rest of the rest of the players.&#10;The victory condition is to win the president three times in succession, to become the president, to purge the remaining players, or to become the president and have a 100% approval rating.&#10;It may be strange at first, but once the game is started, you can find yourself embroidering a chopper to become a president and defeat another player. This is because, unlike the conventional possessive games, the three-dimensional and extraordinary feelings of power and dominance can be felt.&#10;The game continues until one last winner is left. There are a number of factors, including the rules outlined above, the remorse of the conscience, and the privilege of the president. Please feel it directly at the Polytical World 2016 edition.&#10;&#10;",

As players build their business empire, they will also gain or lose Trophies depending on their presence in each sector and whether they dominate it.&#10;When a player holds a set number of Trophies the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;During the game, each player found or raid companies in different sectors of Orcs industry: Tourism, Smuggling, Totemology etc.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of 10 sectors that assembles randomly for each new game. That gives a good replay rating as sectors will have different value and will affect on each other.&#10;&#10;Companies in different sectors provide a special ability of the sector. For example, a leader of a Totemology sector will get an ability to send a crisis to an opponents sector. That also gives a variety of tactic decisions.&#10;&#10;Another important part of the game - Influence Cards. It is hard to get it, but these cards are really powerful and can destroy your opponents plans and becomes even more devastating in various combos with sector abilities.&#10;&#10;Finally, the main concept of the game lays in the interaction of all player. It makes a player to be involved in the gaming process even during the opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;",

Doing all that you have to acquire your business reputation symbolized by the Stars - special game chips - that's how you score your points. &#10; The game board represents 11 industries (agriculture, telecom, raw materials, etc). Each industry is marked with a die roll number. Each move players throw dices, the roll of the dice denotes an active industry in which players can bid for a company (private or public), start start-ups or sell their companies. Each player who owns a company in the industry marked with the number rolled or in a neighbor industry receives profit. &#10; There are three decks of cards: options, events and crises. Option cards give additional advantages to a player, event cards hit all the players (negatively or positively) and crisis cards may turn your profit into a loss. &#10; Main features:&#10; &#10;     A unique compound game board. Each time you will have a new game!&#10;     You won't get bored waiting for your turn, each move players interact with each other. &#10;     Each move you have to make decisions: how to invest in the industry (buy a company or set a start-up), when to increase your financial leverage, sell your company in a crisis industry or increase your share when prices plunge&#10;     Two game modes: a quick game (30 minutes, good for playing with kids) and a full game (1,5-2 hours).&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

First introduced by the Republic during the Clone War, the All Terrain Recon Transport, or AT-RT, has since been co-opted by the Rebel Alliance to aid their war against the Empire.&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: Legion &ndash; AT-RT Unit Expansion includes a single new AT-RT miniature for you to add to your Rebel army, complete with three different gun attachments that can be attached to your miniature.
