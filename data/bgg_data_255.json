    "Description": "The newest Harry Potter Board Game allows players to take the roles of their favorite Harry Potter Characters and enter the magical world of the Dueling Club. Players may travel from class to class in order to learn more powerful spells with which to duel opponents or they may venture to the common areas of Hogwarts and procure magical items that may help during a duel.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a mover (Harry, Hermione, Ron or Malfoy) and a matching spell book. When a player enters a classroom, they may take a spell card and load it into their spell book. Each player can perform every spell, but some students are more proficient than others with certain spells. The Spell Books &quot;de-code&quot; the spells and tells players how well their characters can cast spells.&#10;&#10;But be forewarned, students can only duel in the designated dueling club area in the center of the board. If players challenge each other outside of the dueling club, they may test their skills in one of three wizard games.&#10;&#10;Be the first player to defeat all other players in the dueling club and be the ultimate wizard!&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to be the last player with cards. The player with the MacGuffin card will frequently win the game, but holding onto that card can prove quite difficult! Also, because there are 23 cards in the deck and players are always dealt an equal number of cards, there will always be some cards that are not in play. Figuring out which cards are missing is part of the strategy!&#10;&#10;Who has the MacGuffin? Will the Assassin take out The Crown? What did the Garbage Collector find in the trash? What will The Thief steal, and from whom? To the shrewd, all may become known, but sometimes all you can do is Shrug.&#10;&#10;",

The six-sided dice feature blue, red, yellow, and green symbols on four faces, along with a wizard on a fifth face and a jester on the sixth.&#10;&#10;At the start of the round, the seer places a circle on their bid for the round on his score sheet, a bid that specifies a color and a number from 1-5, e.g., blue-4. In turn, each other player places a bid that differs from all other bids placed this round. The seer then decides what color wizards will count as for this round.&#10;&#10;The seer then rolls the seven dice up to three times, keeping as many dice as they like after the first and second rolls. If a non-seer's bid is met after the first or second roll, then that player places an X through their bid. If the seer has rolled three times or made their bid, all players stop. If at this point anyone has made their bid, they X the circle; otherwise they write the difference between their bid and the number of that color rolled on the dice in the circle. Instead of writing this difference, a player can cross off the number of jesters showing on the dice in the jester row, assuming the number is from 1-5 and the player has not Xed this space previously.&#10;&#10;Whoever bid the highest amount in a different color than the seer becomes the seer for the next round. The game lasts multiple rounds, ending once one or more players has nine Xs in their bidding area. Players then score points, earning 1-5 points for each successful bid and losing points for the differences they recorded. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Wizard W&uuml;rfelspiel includes ten spell cards that you can optionally add to the game. Each spell alters the results of the die rolls or bids in some way.&#10;&#10;",

There are five different draconic races, each of a different color: red, blue, yellow, green, and purple; and one all powerful prismatic Queen, the mother of all races. Each of the draconic races is subdivided into three basic age groups: drakes being the youngest, dragons being middle age, and wyrms being the oldest of all. The older the beast, the more powerful and greedy it becomes.

Everyone has an important role. No bystanders in this game! Too often, social deduction games begin with random accusations just to get the ball rolling.

The problem? You don&rsquo;t have a car, but as karma has it, neither do the others.&#10;&#10;You must hitchhike your way there using planes, trains and automobiles&hellip; and the occasional bike from the thrift shop. Hey&hellip; it was 99 cents! &#10;On this journey through the continent, you&rsquo;ll hop into cars equipped with NOZ, turbos, and furry dice. You&rsquo;ll encounter some crazy drivers who might occasionally be drunk and take risky jumps just for the hell of it. You&rsquo;ll wish for awesome upgrades to your lift, but the others are wishing just the opposite.&#10;&#10;On your turn, they&rsquo;ll be praying evil things upon you. Whatever they can think of to hinder your speed. They&rsquo;ll throw old ladies and moose if they have to. They&rsquo;ll send birds in your engine or just simply wish for you to crash and burn. But don&rsquo;t worry, their turn will come and vengeance will be sweet.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll have to strategically manage your limited hand size and choose which deck to draw from. Will you draw transportation cards to hopefully get the best ride in the game? Or will you draw some karma cards to boost your current ride and slow the others down.&#10;While on this awesome road trip, you&rsquo;ll have to choose your path, or let the driver take you further on his own path. The GPS will determine this. You&rsquo;ll have to stop at train crossings and travel through snowy hills, sandy deserts, big cities and farmland.&#10;&#10;The race also has two levels of play. You can play the regular way, which is with the special ability text of the cards, or the Junior way. In the junior level, simply play without the text and use only the numbers. This will help young players learn simple math, strategy, and have fun while doing so.&#10;&#10;But just when you thought the race was over, there&rsquo;s more to come&hellip; expansions with new maps, more vehicles, more upgrades and of course&hellip;more mayhem are already in the works.

    "Description": "Each card is illustrated with shapes and numbers.  The game play is simple - just match the shape or number on your card with the shape or number on the previous card.  The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner! Like Uno without the special cards!&#10;&#10;There are five suits: stars, circles, squares, crosses and triangles. You can change suit by laying the same number as has been laid in the suit you lay down yourself. Also, the card numbered 20 (WHOT Card) can be used to change from a suit to any other suit at any time.  When the first person has finished, the others count up how many penalty points they have on the cards they have left in their hand. (Star cards count double as indicated by the second smaller figure in the small star). More recent decks also give the suits different colours, stars are blue, circles yellow, crosses red, triangles green, and squares purple.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Whot! was invented (but, apparently, not patented) and trademarked by William Henry Storey, of Southend-on-Sea, England in 1935. It was first marketed by the company Storey &amp; Co of Croydon, which he set up in 1930, but was soon acquired by Waddingtons of Leeds, and was popular in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Microgame #21 in the Metagaming Microgames series is a wargame module meant to be the character-combat engine for a &quot;Starleader&quot; RPG that was never produced.  It concerns combat in the &quot;30th century of the Space Era (SE)&quot; between defenders and attackers aboard a &quot;Kyrathan 'Royal' class warp yacht&quot; named (conveniently enough) the &quot;Trek Heaven.&quot; It's a hex-and-counter game, but has character sheets; players can allocate resources to create characters as they would in an RPG.&#10;&#10;The official rules offer four scenarios, designed to ease the players into increasing complexity and role-playing elements: &quot;The Rescue of Princess Rulian&quot; (one rescuer trying to save the kidnapped princess vs. one terrorist), &quot;Krotic's Treasure&quot; (one rich guy and three thugs vs. four pirates), &quot;Random Piracy&quot; (three crew and one die worth of passengers vs. eight or fewer pirates), and &quot;Random Raids&quot; (all conditions GM- or player-designed).&#10;&#10;Approximate playing time is very fuzzy -- obviously the &quot;Rescue&quot; scenario will play much more quickly than a complex user-designed &quot;Random Raid&quot; with lots of role-playing. The maximum number of players isn't necessarily 2, but all of the official scenarios assume only 2 sides or factions. To support more players, teams or special user-designed scenarios would be called for.&#10;&#10;",

B Games seek to teach values and principles about building a more fair and sustainable world, in a fun way. Some of these principles are: Acknowledging a new meaning of success, promoting collaboration, environmental awareness and protection, and social development among others.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game is a 4 to 5 player game where each player is a farmer who has come to a land full of opportunities to develop in a sustainable manner plots of land. Although each player is competing with other players to win the game, collaboration, trust and and holistic approach to growth are quintessential to progressing in the game. Thus players compete and collaborate with each other as well as become accountable as a group for the common resources that impact the whole system. The game ends when one or more players reach a total of 7 B points. Yes!, in a Granjeros game there can be one or more winning players simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Granjeros is a turn based game fashioned under European style boardgames. That means that although one player holds his turn, other players play along actively while not in their turn. There is always something to do wether you it is your turn or not.  The central hexagon is where the water well is located. The water well is a key element of Granjeros gameplay as it influences all players in every turn and will determine the conditions for harvesting and selling crops. Inside the water well you will find 7 water buckets.&#10;&#10;Each turn has the following structure &amp; steps:&#10;&#10;a) Take a bucket of water out of the well (put it in front of you).&#10;b) Throw the 8 harvest dice. Check for &quot;pairs&quot; of vegetable/fruits.&#10;c) For every pair, reward each player the corresponding vegetable/fruits and number according the type of plot he has [orchard, barn, farm or industry].&#10;d) Invest resources [land, technology, farmers, seed] to develop your plots either individually or in collaboration with other players.&#10;e) Negotiate and dialogue with other players to plan for future developments. &#10;Regardless that it is somebody else's turn all players are entitled to negotiate and dialogue at all times during the game.&#10;&#10;Every time you evolve your plots, either individually or collaboratively, to higher level of development you will earn B points. First player(s) to reach 7 B points win the game!&#10;&#10;",

Can the Luftwaffe overwhelm the RAF? Can the allies hold the line in France? Who will win the Battle for the North Atlantic? You decide as armies from both sides are formed by your decisions and battles are executed at your command. The future of the civilized world hangs in the balance!&#10;&#10;Battlecards is a card game in which you and your opponent(s) build up forces and conduct battles in many of the great conflicts in history. This particular starter set deals with the Western European Theater during World War II. The game consists of a Conflict deck of 50 cards, 47 Arsenal cards for the British forces, and 47 Arsenal cards for the German forces. Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponent&rsquo;s homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.&#10;&#10;Taken from the game box and web page.&#10;&#10;",

There are five levels of difficulty - the time allowed to drop each piece is less at the higher levels. The 60 plastic pieces slide down grooves in the clear window, and you flip levers on the edge to show when a row is complete.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Chim&egrave;re, each player plays a magician in the court of a King who has decided to give his Kingdom to the best Court Magician. Each magician now has the task of convincing the King that they are the best Court Magician. To do this, they organize a grand tournament of magic with various competitions. For each contest, players must make a fabulous creature composed of a blend of three real animals. These chimeras then compete in various events to determine the best magician.&#10;&#10;The three-ingredient creatures are created simultaneously by all players drawing from the three decks of creatures before them, placing the cards facedown on one of the four contest areas before them. (Each player possesses a large square representing each of the four contests in their personal play area.) Once players have chosen their three ingredient creatures for each of the four contests (twelve in total), they may switch ingredient creature pieces between their four different contest tiles.&#10;&#10;Contests may include mud-wrestling, funniest creature, battle to first blood, potato bag race, and the prettiest creature. Only four are chosen from the deck of available contests, and only the players in first and second place in each contest receive points. The first player to complete their selections for all four contests may declare they are finished, putting a time limit of 30 seconds for all other players to complete their choices.&#10;&#10;Voting takes place between players to see who has the best creature featured in each contest.&#10;&#10;Three rounds are played with the aforementioned steps, with creature and contest cards being reshuffled and redrawn. Each round is roughly 10-15 minutes, totaling to 30-45 minutes per game.&#10;&#10;",

Pay attention to the color, this is YOUR chicken!&#10;2 - Designate someone to be the score keeper. This person will keep score during the game using the included Score-Keeper and pencil. Write each player's name in the Score-Keeper.&#10;3 - The youngest player takes the Target Disc first. They will be the first to throw the disc and their Flickin' Chicken.&#10;&#10;PLAYING EACH ROUND&#10;1 - Flickin' Chicken is played in 9 rounds. The person with the lowest score after nine rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;2 - At the start of each round, throw the Target Disc as far as you can. For the first round, the youngest player throws first. For subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round, play paper-scissor-rock, flip a coin or other tie-breaking ritual to determinate the thrower. Greco-Roman Wrestling is not reccomended.&#10;&#10;3 - Taking turns, and starting with the Target Disc thrower, each player throws their Flickin' Chicken at the Target Disc, trying to land any part of their chicken on the disc. If you land any part of your Flickin' Chicken on the Target Disc on your first throw, this is a &quot;Pollo-In-One&quot;. Everyone should congratulate you, as it's quite a feat.&#10;&#10;4 - After everyone has thrown, it is now time for your next throw (if needed). The player whose chicken landed furthest from the target disc will go next (throwing from where the chicken landed) continuing with the next furthest player, so forth and so on.&#10;&#10;5 - Repeat this until everyone has landed any part of their Flickin' Chicken onto the Target Disc. Once you hit the target disc, remove your chicken from play. Keep track of your throws as each throw is equal to one point.&#10;&#10;6 - When every player has landed their chicken on the target the round is over. It is now time to score the round.&#10;&#10;7 - Repeat the above until you have played all nine-rounds.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;1 - The target Disc has 2 sides, a Bonus side and a Penalty side. Each round is different depending on which side of the Target Disc is facing up after it lands!&#10;&#10;2 - If any part of your Flickin' Chicken is TOUCHING the center white circle of the Target Disc then score accordingly and as follows:&#10;&quot;Penalty +1&quot; - Add one point to your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Penalty Circle.&#10;&quot;Bonus -1&quot; - Deduce one point from your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Bonus Circle.&#10;&#10;3 - After determining if any Bonus or Penalty points apply to a players score, write their score in the Score-Keeper using the including pencil.&#10;&#10;4 - After 9 rounds of play, tally up the players' scores. The player with the lowest score wins! (from the Rules-book)&#10;&#10;",

The White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game in a quick, light family card game.&#10;&#10;In the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list. However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you &ldquo;play your cards right&rdquo; you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!&#10;&#10;Each player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their &ldquo;attic&rdquo;. There is one &ldquo;White Elephant Party&rdquo; for each card in a player&rsquo;s attic.&#10;&#10;For each &ldquo;party&rdquo; a player &ldquo;brings a gift to the party&rdquo; by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.&#10;&#10;This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played. At the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the player&rsquo;s final score. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players must explore the layout (which will differ with each play) to find items that provide them useful powers, and also their Safe Things.  Dark Hallways within the Sanitarium will spawn shadows, which will in turn chase the players.  Getting caught by a shadow might earn you a hallucination.  Hallucinations...are bad.&#10;&#10;The enemy of the players is time.  The deck of item and event cards is the timer for the game -- when it runs out, everyone still inside succumbs to their madness!&#10;&#10;Sanitarium is fast-paced and easy to learn.

Mines can be laid to defend outposts and star bases, but can be swept aside with mine sweepers.  Cargo can be captured, and sensors can be jammed to help cloaked ships infiltrate further.&#10;&#10;Each scenario (battle) is resolved as follows.  In the first phase, each player secretly writes down the movement and actions of his units.  The orders of both sides are then simultaneously resolved in the following phases.  After the moves and actions have been resolved, the players repeat the cycle, secretly plotting their orders and openly enacting them.  Combat actions are resolved by rolling dice and consulting the effects from tables.  Play goes on until the scenario's duration has elapsed or a side's Victory Conditions have been met.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brezhnev&rsquo;s War: NATO vs. the Warsaw Pact in Germany, 1980  enables two players to game the first month of a hypothesized communist invasion of Western Europe sometime between the fall of Saigon and the start of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. It was during that period the conventional &ldquo;correlation of forces&rdquo; between the two hostile alliances most favored the communists.&#10;&#10;The scenario portrayed is the one that was most anticipated and feared by NATO&rsquo;s intelligence analysts at the time. That is, despite their knowledge of the existence of Soviets plans to begin such a war with massive chemical and nuclear strikes, the West&rsquo;s military planners gave those schemes little credence. They knew the Soviets understood such a strategy would bring on immediate nuclear retaliation by the West. That would&rsquo;ve ended the war as quickly as it began &ndash; mostly likely along with all of civilization &ndash; with no winner identifiable.&#10;&#10;What was feared then was, one fine summer day, the Soviet units in East Germany would move out from eating breakfast in their mess halls and roll across the border into West Germany. It would&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;come as you are&rdquo; kind of war, the aim of which would&rsquo;ve been to blitz across Germany &ndash; using only conventional weaponry &ndash; in under a month.&#10;&#10;The Soviets would then have called for a ceasefire before any nuclear or chemical weapons had been detonated or the massive economic power of the Atlantic community brought to bear. With that, West Germany &ndash; the geo-strategic lynchpin of NATO in Europe &ndash; would&rsquo;ve been neutralized and its Ruhr industrial area &ndash; then as now, one of the most important manufacturing centers on the planet &ndash; entirely wrecked. That would&rsquo;ve caused a shift in the global balance of power in favor of the Kremlin, setting them up to deliver the knockout blow later.&#10;&#10;The 50&rdquo; x 35&rdquo; map covers the core area of the Federal Republic of Germany at 6.66 miles (10.8 km) per hex. There are 352 large-size (5/8&rdquo;) unit counters, representing the divisions and brigades immediately on scene at the time, along with the masses of other units that could&rsquo;ve been sent as reinforcements. Each of the 10 game turns represent three days of real time.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence uses the classic fight-move or move-fight structure. Special rules account for heliborne units, Spetsnaz, the ultra-elite Soviet Eighth Guards and Guards Airborne Armies, East German and Czechoslovakian disloyalty, ranged Soviet artillery divisions, air power, supply, the criticality of Frankfurt for US operations, paradrops, German territorials, electronic warfare and variable Soviet victory objectives.&#10;&#10;The overall system is simple, at about 6 on the 1-10 scale. Two experienced players can get through a match in about four to six hours.&#10;&#10;",

Noteworthy is the unusual board, which features hurdles whose bars can be moved up and down to any of four numbered positions.  When you clear a hurdle, you reset its bar to the position corresponding to the die's *bottom* facing (i.e., the face opposite that which you just rolled). &quot;What happens when it's a 5 or 6&quot;, you say. Cleverly, this is never an issue because the &quot;5&quot; has been replaced by a horseshoe symbol (with special rules) and the &quot;6&quot; is of course opposite &quot;1&quot;, and 1 is never sufficient to clear a hurdle.&#10;&#10;",

Alchemist Academy is a hand management card game relying on 2 decks of cards, a Spell Deck and Shop Deck.&#10;&#10;The game includes 23 different spells within the spell deck, which consists of 64 cards in total. Along with 6 different component cards which are required in different variations when casting a spell, this deck consists of 120 cards in total.&#10;&#10;Each class (round) players attempts to cast spells on each other and themselves to increase their grade (score). Each of these spells require the correct components in order to cast it. These components are drawn from the Shop Deck.&#10;&#10;Some spells are quick and easy to cast and only require 1 or 2 common components to be cast, however these only give the caster a small bonus. Other spells require rare or unique items to be cast and while this might take longer to obtain the right components, the resulting spell is far more powerful.&#10;&#10;If the spell is successfully cast, there will be some sort of effect and the player who cast the spell gains points.&#10;&#10;",
