    "Description": "Game billed as &quot;a complete Napoleonic miniatures system in a box.&quot; Note that the title is bad French; the correct title would be La Petite Arm&eacute;e.&#10;&#10;Box contains three two-panel mounted, green-flocked boards combining to measure 3' x 2'.  Game includes a selection of terrain to use on these boards to create battlefields, including six different hills, two different villages, two different farms with farm fields, hedgerows, stone walls, roads, streams, rivers, two forests and a bridge.  Roads, streams, and the forest footprint are in colored felt.  Buildings are painted and cast from resin.  Tree bases are magnetized for secure storage inside the box.&#10;&#10;Boxed set includes rules, charts, two rulers, two ten-sided dice, casualty/morale caps, command/rally counters, deployment/dummy markers scaled to unit base sizes, objective/line of communication markers, and two fully painted, based and flocked Napoleonic armies.&#10;&#10;Each army consists of four line, one light and one elite infantry brigade; two light and one heavy cavalry brigade; three foot and one horse artillery batteries; and one General with two separate lieutenants used for command extension functions.  Each brigade includes a flag of its nationality.&#10;&#10;Infantry is mounted four to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing about 2200 men.  Cavalry is mounted two to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing around 700 men.  Guns are mounted individually, one crew member for a field/horse battery and two crew for a heavy gun.  General is mounted with a foot figure; lieutenants are mounted individuals.&#10;&#10;Figures in the standard starter set are painted &quot;Risk&quot; figures from the &quot;shako&quot; edition of Risk.  Additional painted brigades representing helmeted cavalry, lancers, etc. may be ordered from the producer.  Supplemental terrain boards and terrain elements are also available.&#10;&#10;The rules are playable and concentrate on command and morale.  Units out of vision distance or line of sight are initially represented by hidden deployment markers, revealed as units come within sighting range.  Units may also be assigned to off-board flanking forces and/or reserves.&#10;&#10;Initiative is determined each turn, as are available command points for each army.  Command points may be used either to activate units for movement and combat, or to rally shaken or demoralized units.  Army command diminishes as brigades are demoralized or destroyed.&#10;&#10;The game system allows for considerable expansion and accommodates multiple players on a side.  Entire large battles can be gamed using this system and additional unit, but an interesting game can be played with as few as four or five brigades on a side.&#10;&#10;",

In other words, it's a game, not unlike checkers or chess, but one that can be played with game pieces or other objects that you probably already have at home.&#10;&#10;The first player decides which of their small pieces they would like to move first. In order to actually make the move, the player first takes one of their LARGE tokens and places it onto the square to which they intend to move a SMALL token. (The proposed square must be directly adjacent to the original square, touching on any side or corner) They then move their small token from its current position to the new square; placing it on top of the newly placed larger token. Then the next player takes his turn, etc. A player may move one of their small tokens onto a square already occupied by one of their own or one of their opponent's small token. In this case, the player does NOT place one of their large tokens in advance of the move, but simply places their small token on top of the other small token already in place. If this move is onto an opposing piece, that piece is not captured, but effectively blocked. Until the player on top moves their small token, the piece below may not move.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner until one of the two players is able to Triangulate three of their own small pieces on a single square on the board.&#10;&#10;",

In order to achieve this, Pavilion Cricket consists of three separate games:&#10;&#10;1. Domestic Cricket&#10;      This game covers domestic tour and one-day matches in England, Australia and the West Indies. A typical county match takes approx. 15 min. to play.&#10;&#10;2. One-Day Cricket&#10;      This game covers One-day Internationals and Domestic finals. More detailed than number 1., a typical game takes approx. 60 min. to play.&#10;&#10;3. Test match Cricket&#10;      This game provides a ball-by-ball simulation of a full five-day test match. As the most detailed of the three games, each day's play takes approx. 90 min. to play.&#10;&#10;By using a combination of the three games, a full season or tour may be played on an ongoing basis.&#10;&#10;The Teams Book provided details full squads of players for a broad range of teams; falling into three categories: Domestic, Current International (early 1990's, but later Team Books are available), and Modern Greats. The inclusion of the Modern Greats teams allows many previously unresolved debates to be tested. For example, how would the awesome South African side of 1970 perform against some of the great West Indian sides of the 1980's?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Original Rodeo Hexagame, a dice and bet game for the whole family&quot;&#10;&#10;In turn, each player competes in of 6 Rodeo disciplines, whilst the others place bets on the outcome. An active player can earn good money by successfully completing the task at hand, but the real money will be made by the onlookers who wager wisely.&#10;&#10;Cowboys who enter the hexagonal rodeo arena will be randomly assigned one of 6 events: Bull-Riding, Bronc-Riding, Barrel-Racing, Calf-Roping, Team-Roping or Steer-Wrestling. These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.&#10; The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.&#10;&#10;Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.&#10;&#10;On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.&#10;&#10;This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain. The suggested lowest age is 6, which might be a bit young to fully understand the complexities of even simple betting odds. There is no real upper limit to the amount of players that can join in, and the more the merrier the betting. But if all cowboys want their own piece, then 6 is the maximum number of entrants.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Animal Tracks, Make Tracks to Collect the Animals&quot;&#10;&#10;A 4x4 grid is surrounded on all sides by 16 tiles with animals on them. Each tile shows a picture with a type of animal, either pigs, hens, sheep, or cows. Players get 2 track tiles each, which are placed (one each turn) on the grid to create connections (roads) between the animals. When a player places a track tile so that it connects 2 animal tiles of the same type, then those animal tiles are removed from the board and placed on that player's scoring stack. Empty spaces are filled with animal tiles from the draw stack, each player also draws a new track tile at the end of the turn and play continues until all animal tiles are collected or all track tiles are played. Track tiles may be placed on top of each other, and matching sets of animals may only be collected if the connection is made by establishing a new(!) route between them.&#10;&#10;Each animal tile has one to three animals on it, and each player's end score is equivalent to the total amount of animals on the gained tiles. The one who collected most animals is the winner.&#10;&#10;What appears to be a very simple tile-laying games with an appealing farmyard animal theme is quietly hiding a rather clever maze game that challenges children on multiple fronts. There are only four different track tiles in the game, yet there are so many ways to place these that a bewildering amount of new routes have to be considered. Visualizing the one that would connect two identical animal types, let alone spotting the most profitable one can be a challenge even for adults.&#10;&#10;But kids love tiles, and kids love puzzles, and the rules are so intuitive that they easily get engrossed in an entertaining game. The best children games do far more than simple entertaining, and by having to match identical animals, create new routes between them, and consider the relative value of two matched tiles (2 hens and 3 hens is better than 1 sheep and 2 sheep) half an hour of fun is well spent indeed. There are 68 animals on offer, so even determining the final scores can be a quick math lesson.&#10;&#10;The suggested age range is from 7 upwards, but it is such a good bridging game that it would suit even slightly younger children. For kids at the younger end of the spectrum, it might be simpler to settle for &quot;whoever has the highest animal stack wins&quot;, but even then there is enough left to make this a game worth considering.&#10;&#10;Also known as &quot;Dierensporen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Pistes d'Animaux&quot; in French.&#10;&#10;",

As allies of Ho Chi Minh's fighters against the Japanese, it is clear that the U.S. had several choices in Indochina. The decision to back the French, attempting to regain control of the region, led to America's eventual involvement, and all the consequences thereof. The war that ended in 1973 had led to all of the following: 57,661 U.S. servicemen dead, 2 million Vietnamese dead, the first military defeat for the U.S., internal turmoil in the U.S., distrust of the government and military, the devastation of much of Vietnam, and many other things. Is it possible the war could have turned out differently? It is up to you to decide...&quot;&#10;&#10;Now YOU can take over where &quot;Nixon&quot; failed! Send them 'Tin Soldiers' far away FROM the grounds of &quot;Kent State&quot; et al, and unto the &quot;killing fields&quot; where they belong. Using your 'A&amp;A' pieces along with some others, then you too can attempt to &quot;rectify&quot; the situation in Southeast ASIA, where the &quot;domino effect&quot; concerning 'Communism' was at its height! SEE if the &quot;Bombing Cambodia&quot; Campaign would have truly been 'effective', OR perhaps an EXTRA couple 100-thousand 'Troops' might have &quot;done the deal&quot; instead.

    "Description": "In Andedammen each child controls a colored duck filled with 'eggs' (round wooden balls). The ducks must then move along a narrow path around their pond to get to a large nest in the middle. But next to each section of the path is a small nest, and if another duck ends up on a space where there is already standing a duck, he pushes that one onto the nest next to the path. The duck having been pushed onto the small nest will then loose an egg (it will fall into the nest). The winner is the duck ending up with most eggs when getting to the large nest in the middle of the pond. It is possible to have more than one winner in this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A dice game described in the premier issue of Gameplay Magazine (February 1983) played on a 7 square by 14 square board. The dice are not rolled, but instead moved around the board as pieces. Each player starts with six dice. one of each pip-strength from 1 to 6 in opposite corners of the board.&#10;Pieces move horizontally or vertically the number of spaces shown on the top face of each die, or one space more or one less. If moved more or less the value, of the die is changed to show the actual number of spaces moved.&#10;Units can be eliminated from play in one of three ways called &quot;eliminating,&quot; &quot;capturing,&quot; and &quot;fourwalling.&quot;&#10;&quot;Eliminating&quot; is landing on an opposing piece by exact count, removing it from play.&#10;Pieces are captured by placing opposing pieces on either side, adjacent, and replacing it with a die of the opposing player's color.&#10;&quot;Fourwalling&quot; is blocking a piece from moving its required number of spaces in every direction. Fourwalled pieces are removed from play.&#10;The object of the game is to eliminate all opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Seven half-map scenarios, six full-map scenarios, game scale is 350 yards, per 5/8&quot; hexagon, with each Game Turn representing 30 minutes. The Basic Rules were added for younger players.&#10; Very accurate and comprehensive, the game includes rules and counters for Federal Naval Vessels,  Confederate Trains,  Federal Engineers,  Leaders,  Ammunition Depletion,  Damaged and Destroyed Bridges, and  Captured Cannon.&#10;  &#10;The Basic Game is a fast playing simulation of advancing along the narrow roads and through the thick coastal forests and swamps of southwestern South Carolina.  The Confederate player must choose the right times to fall back, or risk being overwhelmed by the Yankee aggressor.&#10;  &#10;The Advanced Rules include Skirmishers,  Hidden Movement,  Breastworks and Fortifications, Tides and Naval Grounding, and  Alternative Federal Landing Sites.  Individual cannon types are represented in both field and naval artillery units.  Ammunition usage is an important aspect of command decisions.  This is a very well-researched wargame.&#10;  &#10;The Sequence of Play is a variation of the Original GBOCW System, with Fire Combat, including any Defensive and Return Fire, taking place before Charge Combat.&#10;     This game is an excellent simulation, and an enjoyable game as well, and was the best gaming effort by the leading historian of these particular engagements.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The four years of brutal warfare on the Eastern Front brought the political troops of both sides into front-line fighting. Formed to control civilians rather than fight armed enemies, the Soviet NKVD and the much larger German Waffen SS each committed mass murders in the name of ideology and from simple animal barbarism. Knowing their well-deserved fate if captured, they often fought with suicidal fanaticism.&#10;&#10;Sinister Forces brings background articles and scenarios covering these troops and their battles to the Panzer Grenadier game system. It is not playable by itself, but requires Eastern Front to play most of the scenarios, and Afrika Korps or Desert Rats to play all of them.&#10;&#10;Scenarios take place on the Eastern Front. The SS troops are of generally lower quality than the corresponding German Army pieces of Eastern Front, reflecting the lower standards of training and recruitment for these political formations. Background articles place the scenarios in the full context of the war in Russia.&#10;&#10;New weapons also appear. The SS wield huge 220mm mortars seized from the French army in 1940, French-made B1 heavy tanks, B1 tanks converted to carry flamethrowers, Soviet-made T-34 tanks, and new forms of transport: light SPW 250 half-tracks and fast Volkswagen personnel carriers, the famous Kubelwagen.&#10;&#10;There are SS units included of high combat value: special pieces and scenarios for the Norwegian ski battalion and for the Finnish SS battalion.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Afrika Korps: The Desert War &#226;&#128;&#147; Platoon Level Combat in World War II: A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Desert Rats&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dangerous Parallel is an instructional game that was created in 1969 by the Foreign Policy Association and published by Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.  In the game students are divided into small groups of 2 to 6 members, each playing a ministerial role in the government of six nations that correspond roughly to the real-life participants of the Korean War conflict.&#10;&#10;The nations are:&#10;&#10;Inland (N Korea)&#10;Outland (S Korea)&#10;Transania (Soviet Union)&#10;Hameel (China)&#10;New Zenith (the West)&#10;and Nordo (India, the Third World?)&#10;&#10;This game was originally released as a seven box set. Each nation receives its own box (as named above) of briefing materials. In addition, the Control box contains materials for the instructor to moderate the game.&#10;&#10;In Dangerous Parallel, there are a number of different scenarios.  The one that I played is essentially the same as the Korean War.  Inland invades Outland who are aided by New Zenith.  After a vicious and successful counterattack, the players are asked to make the next move.  Will, for example, Hameel aid Inland, risking nuclear war if Transania becomes involved.&#10;&#10;Each country has the following ministers:&#10;&#10;Chief Minister&#10;Defense Minister&#10;Political Minister (Minister of Interior, or Police)&#10;Foreign Minister&#10;Foreign Intelligence Minister&#10;Economics Minister&#10;Minister of Information&#10;Several Ambassadors&#10;&#10;There is a requirement that the Foreign Minister is not the Chief Minister to allow for espionage.  Also, you can allow for multiple roles for each participant.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A one-on-one book game with a sci-fi/adventure theme.  Each player is a champion of their star-faring race, trying to find pieces of the Ancient Robot, a powerful and dangerous artifact of a lost civilization.  The pieces of the Ancient Robot are scattered throughout the galaxy, and the players move from system to system to find them by choosing which page to turn to.  In their quest, they will encounter all sorts of harrowing adventures, battling or befriending strange monsters, collecting strange new items to improve their abilities, and may even run across each other....&#10;&#10;The premise, as described by the books:&#10;&#10;A million years before mankind invented fire or the Cybrtrons first oiled their gears, the Ancient Ones ruled the universe. For reasons lost in the mysteries of time, the Ancient Ones channeled all of their galaxy-spanning efforts into the building of one huge robot. There were twenty star systems in the realm of the Ancient Ones, and each one of the twenty was given the task of building one part of the massive robot.&#10;&#10;The project was soon completed, the twenty parts constructed. The Ancient Ones had to bring the twenty parts to one central location and assemble the robot. But something went wrong -- perhaps a war between the systems, perhaps attack by some alien race. The Ancient Ones vanished. All that remained were the scattered parts of their robot.&#10;&#10;One million years later, two parts of the Ancient Robot were recovered in different areas of the Milky Way galaxy. A team of humans discovered one part of the Ancient Robot in the year 2289 A.D., while exploring the planet Pluto. The Robot provided mankind with the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart marked with the location of the other nineteen parts.&#10;&#10;At the same time, a civilization of robots also discovered a part of the Ancient Robot. Called Cybrtrons, they had overthrown their soft-skinned creators centuries before. They are now determined to rule the galaxy! The Ancient Robot part also gave the Cybrtrons the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart revealing the location of the other nineteen parts.&#10;&#10;Both civilizations immediately decide to go in search of the Ancient Robot. Records of the Ancient Ones reveal that the Ancient Robot has the capability to design and build technological devices that will advance mankind a thousand years. The Ancient Robot is also capable of destroying anything in its path! With this device, the Cybrtrons know they can conquer the galaxy!&#10;&#10;Both civilizations are sending their best pilots into space to search for the Ancient Robot. The Cybrtrons and the humans have become aware of each other. The search for the Ancient Robot has turned into a deadly race.&#10;&#10;YOU are the leader of one of the two groups assigned to find the Ancient Robot!&#10;&#10;Part of the series of 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tickityboo(tm)  is a game similar to Stubborn(tm), but with hexagonal tiles, and more of them.  The hexagonal tiles mean that each tile has six large triangles, each of a different color...Stubborn has only four large triangles and hence only four colors.  Each Tickityboo tile is therefore a member of 6 different numerical series.  &#10;Despite its increased intricacy, Tickityboo is begun just like Stubborn, by placing the specially marked Starting Tile face up on the table.  Each player  then takes 9 tiles blindly from the remaining total of 143 tiles still face down on the table.   When there is more than one player they take turns, but unlike in Stubborn, in Tickityboo each player becomes &quot;vulnerable&quot; if they cannot place a tile, and the another player can move an overlooked tile, and discard one of their own tiles to the vulnerable player's pile. &#10;Like the other games in the &quot;Mining Order From Chaos&quot;(tm) series, Tickityboo is a great solitaire game.  It supports up to nine players, however, to make an engaging pastime for a small party or a third of a normal classroom.&#10;&#10;",

If a player tries to occupy a previously occupied space, there is a challenge which is resolved with a 2-die roll-off with the higher roll winning.&#10;&#10;The game includes a grid board and 52 markers per side, all on light cardstock that needs to be cut out.&#10;&#10;",

When a piece is played it must touch at least one piece of the other color and must have at least two squares touching other pieces.&#10;&#10;The object is to completely surround one or more opposing pieces with your pieces and/or surrounded empty space. If all pieces are played without this happening players move pieces on the edge of the playing area using the same rules.&#10;&#10;If players play a series of games, the winner of a game scores a point each surrounded piece.&#10;&#10;",

The grid must contain ten wires, one in each row and one in each column.

They win if they are correct or produce a grid with the same number of wires in every space as the correct grid.

The boldest of these are that the price to purchase a property landed on is doubled, and that a property may not be mortgaged but can instead be sold back to the bank for its &quot;mortgage value.&quot;  The game is changed immensely - it is no longer advisable (or even possible) for a player to buy outright every property landed on, and properties frequently go up for public or private auction.&#10;&#10;In effect, this variant forces the players to make more difficult decisions, reducing the game's luck factor in favor of more emphasis on bidding and negotiation.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Monopoly&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the role of Scoop, an ice cream vendor promoting &quot;his surprise ice creams.&quot;  Four wooden ice cream cups are used to hide stacks of three wooden counters each.  Each wooden counter represents a scoop of ice cream in a particular flavor--vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or mint--with all of the scoops of a particular flavor being hidden under a single ice cream cup.  The cups are then switched around--from 4 to 8 switches per round depending on what the players agree on beforehand--and the first player to Scoop's left tries to guess which cup a particular flavor (it's a little unclear from the rules, but apparently Scoop selects the flavor to be guessed) is under.  If they're correct, they get one of the &quot;scoops&quot; of that flavor, and they become Scoop (i.e. they get to switch the cups around) for the next round.  If they're incorrect, they lose one of their &quot;scoops&quot; from a previous round (if available) and the player to their left gets to guess.  Players have the option of passing if they don't want to risk losing a &quot;scoop.&quot;  At the end of the round (after either a player has guessed correctly or all players have passed or guessed incorrectly).  All of the cups are lifted and any lost &quot;scoops&quot; are returned to their respective stacks.  The game continues until all of the &quot;scoops&quot; have been won.  Cups with no &quot;scoops&quot; under them remain in the game.  The player with the most &quot;scoops&quot; (wooden tokens) is the winner.  The game comes with attractive wooden components, and ice cream vendor's hat to designate Scoop, and a sturdy box that's really quite a bit larger than necessary to hold everything.&#10;&#10;",

Her house had finally crushed their greatest rivals, and now nothing, no one, stood in their way of taking complete control of the city. A dark elf warrior casually walked up to her and bowed, as was custom among her people. A lower caste member of the dark race must always pay nominal respect to those of higher rank and birth.

That was the law of the Dark Elves, that was the way of the people of the Spider Queen.&#10;&#10;This is the game of Web of Tears, a game of politics, intrigue, struggle and conquest. Web of Tears allows players to take control of a Dark Elf noble house, where they then must compete with other Dark Elf houses as each tries to achieve multiple victory conditions and goals. Can you train your nobles to their ultimate in skill, or will you need to amass a great army of slaves and skilled warriors. Maybe you will need to work the political side of the social order and have yourself proclaimed the queen of the city.&#10;&#10;Web of Tears uses a unique system of influence peddling, intrigue, political plotting and all out war to allow players to interact in the nastiest of ways.&#10;&#10;Can you out smart, out fight and out survive your foes?&#10;&#10;The game comes with everything you need to have a great couple of hours of fun.&#10;Over 30 Noble Cards, showing each of their skills and levels of ability.&#10;40 spell cards covering both Arcane and Faith based magic.&#10;80 Special Ability cards covering Warfare, Arcane, Faith and Stealth based skills.&#10;Over 30 Market Cards&#10;6 Noble Houses to play, each having its own special powers and victory conditions.&#10;A massive playing area, which shows the Dark Elf city and its may locations. &#10;And a massive amount of counters&#10;&#10;",
