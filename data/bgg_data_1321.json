Super Showdown! card game, two to four players are villains competing to capture all five members of The Aquabats, the world's greatest superhero rock band.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three types of cards: Monster cards, Action cards, and Aquabats cards. Monster cards have colors and power levels. Each turn, a player plays a Monster card and draws a new  Monster card. If the card played is of the same color and a higher power level than the card previously played, that player may draw both a Monster card and an Action card. At the start of a player's turn, a Battle card or Epic Battle card may be played, challenging one player or all players respectively to a showdown. Each player in the battle must play a Monster card, and the winner may take an Aquabat card from the table or, if none remain, steal one from the defeated player.&#10;&#10;Shrink Ray cards enable a challenged player to diminish the power of an aggressor; X-Ray cards allow one to peak at another player's hand; Antibats cards foil the winner of a battle from taking a loser's Aquabat card; and Steal cards can be used to acquire another player's Aquabat card without a battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player acquires all five Aquabat cards or until War is mutually declared, in which case the winner of a single round Epic Battle is declared the game's victor.&#10;&#10;",

You own a territory if all stones adjacent to points in that territory are of your color.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty point adjacent to at least one stone in that group.&#10;&#10;To flip a group is to replace all its stones with stones of the opposite color.&#10;&#10;To suppress a group is to remove all its stones from the board.&#10;&#10;Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of points in your territories, plus komi (see below) if you play White.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, pass or place a stone of your color on an empty point. If this stone is part of a group with liberties, suppress all enemy groups without liberties. Otherwise, suppress your group without liberties and flip all enemy groups that had no liberties before the suppression. In the latter case, at least one group must be flipped for the move to be legal.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either both players pass in succession or a player flips or suppresses the last enemy group on the board. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. The button is used to avoid ties.&#10;&#10;If, after a board play, the same board position appears for the third time with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. A pass is not a board play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsConvacu: The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. If you have no other moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. If, at the end of a turn, there is a group touching the two opposite board edges of its color, the owner of that group wins.&#10;&#10;",

Upon building a complete hand, the player scores a point for each small portrait in their hand. The first player to 20 points wins.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps four cards in their hand. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discards of other players. Trying to build a set of matching cards in hand is a puzzle, with each card having one large portrait and one to three small portraits. If your turn ends without creating a completed hand, discard one card face up in front of you. Be careful, because other players will be able to choose from your discards, but you cannot.&#10;&#10;",

We also need enough depth to make the games play out like your favorite Science Fiction Shows. We had a lot of success from 2004-2010 between the Babylon 5, Noble Armada and Starfleet license that Mongoose Publishing had. So like me, you might have a closet full of Starship Miniatures that you would like to interact with each other.&#10;&#10;Included in the game are rules and weapons to make it &quot;multi-verse&quot; for your own IP, but also includes ready to go Generic Ships and Lists if you want to play in our Universe. In addition to the Data Cards you can photo copy out of the rulebook, we also have Generic Starship Cards you can download here and on our website. Sized to conveniently be the size of a playing card so you can slip them into a conventional card sleeve with a backing card.&#10;&#10;Some of the basics are a basic distance movement value, to keep it simple. But to add some tactical flare, there are both Arcs of fire on weapons - as well as - Arcs where the Hull value on a ship differs (the sides or the rear usually).&#10;&#10;As a gamer I have really enjoyed the break from reality that Starship Combat games offer. Working on the &quot;Wolf 359 Combat Simulator&quot; for Last Unicorn Games in the early 2000's, and later with Mongoose in their playtesting and development of the (3) &quot;A Call to Arms&quot; games. It is my hope that through modern production technology, I can bring these rules to life and you can join me in enjoying this sort of Non Electronic Tabletop Wargame.&#10;&#10;This will be our 3rd self-published release, and I hope you will join us in playing it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This book is a stand alone product that does not require any other purchases from us to use your own miniatures collection. Everything you need is right there to play without days of making up your own stuff.&#10;&#10;These mechanics been a fun and quick way to play Science Fiction and Modern games with our friends since 2005. We even adapted it to work well in a Victorian &ldquo;Colonial&rdquo; setting with a few tweeks. These rules ARE NOT an exact replica of the weapons and equipment of any Era, nor a Hollywood enhancement, but rather to provide a reasonable simulation for enjoyable gameplay.&#10;&#10;Quickly about the mechanics... Each figure has a certain number of &ldquo;actions&rdquo; each round &ndash; in addition they can also react during the enemy&rsquo;s play. This produces a less static game, but also one that is not so fluid people are never sure where things stand.&#10;&#10;This book contains all the Rules you need to play on 4 page large font handy flow chart. As well as a comprehensive Weapons Chart from Spears to Fusion Cannons. In addition are Generic Unit cards you can copy out - or download from our website or facebook - to slip into a standard playing card sleeve for east reference. Not to mention sample Army Lists, Scenarios, and so forth to keep you busy for a little while.&#10;&#10;Our goal is to provide you enough material to actually play with, so you do not have to make things up on your own. Our website will contain other fan made products to official support for the game. IE: More scenarios and unit cards.&#10;&#10;Thanks to modern publishing techniques, we will be finishing up the following OPTIONAL &quot;Setting Books&quot;. Each will include our own world &quot;fluff&quot;, specific Unit Cards tailored to the era, Scenarios, and even some old school Terrain tips and Miniature suggestions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Our &quot;Victorian Era&quot; setting book will cover my favorite Era of play. From 1870 thru the 1930's across those various Historical periods up through World War 1. Even a dash of information if you prefer to play Victorian Science Fiction. It will contain some of my unpublished materials from the &quot;Battlefield: Evolution&quot; book that would have covered this topic. &#10;     Our &quot;Science Fiction&quot; setting book will cover man to man, and man to alien, combat in the near and far future. Scenarios and ideas to cover our own Universe, as well as suggestions for your own. &#10;     Our &quot;World War 2 to Modern&quot; setting book will cover from World War 2 up till the 1990's. It will handle both the Historical needs of those games, as well as, the ability to play &quot;Pulp&quot; action around your favorite stories and comics with lots of blue and red lasers. Including a cross over of our Solo play and Co-Op play material from &quot;Zombie-a-go-go&quot; before the Tidalwave of Zombie games. &#10;     Our &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; setting book will go hand in hand with the &quot;Xothic Wars&quot; products that I co-designed. Each chapter will cover each one of the races covered with Unit Cards, Scenarios, and suggested miniature ranges. &#10;     Our &quot;Ancients and Fantasy&quot; setting book will cover things like my favorite Roman historical period, to any range of Fantasy settings and variants. &#10;     Our &quot;Black Powder&quot; setting book will cover Samurai, Pirates, and from the Seven Years War up through the American Civil War. It will feature my campaign for the 1860-1962 skirmishes in the American Southwest. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To win, you&rsquo;ll have to successfully assemble all the components needed to build the best houses: Lots, Financing, an Architect and Materials. You&rsquo;ll also need to add some custom features that buyers want, such as a swimming pool or sun deck.&#10;&#10;During the game, you&rsquo;ll compete for the above components and features by playing hands of 3-card poker. However, since this is a friendly competition, the &ldquo;pots&rdquo; are not winner-take-all. Instead, the winner of a round will gain two components, while his/her opponent will gain one &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the winner&rsquo;s decision. Close attention to your needs and your opponent&rsquo;s needs is required. Your goal is, ideally, to build each house with the same level of components: fair, good, better, best; this is not always easy. Additionally, land in the Tri-Valley is a bit scarce, so you&rsquo;re limited to five housing starts. Also, card management in the form of &ldquo;what to play now and what to save for later&rdquo; is an important factor in winning the game.&#10;&#10;This is the second game in a series using the 3CP Game Engine, which employs custom cards and a deck of standard playing cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Print &amp; Play cards available in Files section.&#10;     Professionally produced card deck available at thegamecrafter.com SOON.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players start at the center and use move cards to make their way to one of the outer edges of the board to collect an artifact or power core. Once collected it's kept for the remainder of the game and the player is teleported back to the start. Artifacts give powerful abilities, but do not contribute to winning the game.&#10;&#10;Players get to choose two actions for their turn. They can choose any combination of placing a tile, using a move, and/or drawing a card. Placing a tile allows players to change the path to their advantage or to block their opponents. Using a move can only be done if the corresponding paths are connected. Drawing a card can result in a move card or an ability card.&#10;&#10;Cryptodome is a free-for-all game for 2-8 players ages 14 and up that can be played in about an hour. Three types of cards allows for a simple risk/reward system that players can strategize with as the game goes on. Games change in dynamic based on the number of players and the strategies that players tend towards. Players tend to collect up to two artifacts near the beginning of the game and then use them to collect three power cores more effectively.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter pre-launch page is up!

The launch consists of different stages that must be successfully passed.  To pass each launch stage players take turns randomly drawing from a special hand of cards that is determined by the Development Cards acquired during the Build Phase.&#10;&#10;The game is won if players successfully launch and land their rockets during the Launch Phase.  The game is lost if the rocket explodes during launch, or if too many construction accidents happen during the Build Phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns, starting with the youngest player.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player bets one to three tokens, adding them to the pot, then rolls the dice one by one until they either quit or bust by rolling over 21.&#10;&#10;If a player quits, they receive a payout depending on what they rolled. 16 or fewer has no payout. 17 through 21 gives a payout of 1 through 5 times your bet, respectively. A street (rolling one through six) gives you the entire jackpot. There is no dealer to try and match your roll.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the pot is empty, and the winner is the player with the most tokens.&#10;&#10;Unlike other black jack dice games, this game uses regular six-sided dice, as opposed to ten- or twelve-sided dice or dice that use suits or the letters J/Q/K/A.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
