After the draw pile is exhausted, the common pile is flipped over and the cards in it are sorted by ingredient until an order comes up.  If there are enough ingredient cards to fill the order, the player scores it.

    "Description": "Age of Rail: South Africa, title #4 in the &quot;Iron Rail&quot; series by Capstone Games, is a new version of 2011's South African Railroads, which was an extensive re-development of Pampas Railroads' sister game, Veld Railroads. Your goal is to have more money than anyone else, and you earn money by holding shares and getting dividend payments from railroad companies.&#10;&#10;After an initial auction for the first shares of these companies, players take turns, choosing from one of four different actions: build track, develop settlement, offer stock, and pay dividends. These actions are limited; only one dividend action exists, for example, so when a player chooses this, the action remains blocked until that player's next turn, at which time they must choose a different action. Two &quot;offer stock&quot; actions are available, and three &quot;develop settlement&quot; actions; &quot;build track&quot; is an unlimited action and can be repeated on the next turn.&#10;&#10;When players buy stock, the spent funds go into the company's treasury and can be used to build track. By developing settlements, you increase the value of stations, and a railroad's income increases when it links to stations. When dividends are paid, the company's income is divided by five (the number of shares) and paid to the owner of those shares, which might be the company if not all the shares have been offered.&#10;&#10;After the sixth dividend, the game ends &mdash; but that final divided includes bonuses based on the number of company links and is paid out solely based on the number of shares issued, not all of the shares in existence.&#10;&#10;",

Players in the role of the Merchant are out to cut deals and line their coffers in a quest for untold riches. As the Thief, that player is attempting to pilfer coins from the Merchant, while earning infamy and the respect of the secretive Foxtail Gang.&#10;&#10;The coastal city of Trieste is a flurry of trade and activity, but where there's power, there are always those who will compete to grab as much of it as they can. Conflict erupts in the streets, shops, and back alleys. Only one can truly rule Trieste. Will it be you?&#10;&#10;",

You then use these cards to play a trick-taking game with all other players, with none of you knowing the true value of any card played until the end of each trick. Your neighbor's preference rank is the card's strength. Card 1 is highest and 0 is lowest, but if 1 and 0 appear in the same trick, 0 wins.&#10;&#10;Because you are playing with someone else's favorite things, each trick provokes unique insights into your fellow players and sparks interesting conversations. Does Paul like Power Rangers more than Anthony likes Banana Milkshake or Archie likes Italian Disco? These are the deductions and judgement calls you'll need to make in My Favourite Things.&#10;&#10;",

The further you advance your flag, and the more men who survive the Antarctic winter at the end of the game, the more prestige your expedition receives. This requires careful management of crates, food and camps: without supplies, your explorers will not survive.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds over a series of rounds. Within each round, players may make as many moves as they like, from those available, with each additional move becoming increasingly dangerous. In more detail, each turn, players may take an action (which involves taking a risk die from the action board, adding the die to their dice pool, then taking a corresponding action), or they choose to pass. Actions include moving explorers and crates, hunting for food, collecting research, and building camps. After completing an action, the active player rolls all the dice in their dice pool. High numbers result in exposure, the loss of supplies (crates and food), explorers being incapacitated, and even death. Exposure results can be offset by explorers remaining together (company) and the building of camps.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all players have passed. At the end of the round, a weather card is drawn that may cause additional attrition, then the next round begins. When the pack ice card is drawn from the weather deck, one last round is played and the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, each player receives one of the eight silhouettes (which are numbered 2-8 with one blank), while three silhouettes are placed in the center of the table as suspects and the final silhouette is dubbed the victim. (With three players, the #2 is removed from the game.) You have to determine which suspect is the culprit, either to accuse him or to lure the other players into accusing someone who's innocent!&#10;&#10;All players secretly look at their silhouettes, then pass them right, then look at the new silhouette they received. The first player of the round secretly looks at two of the three suspects, optionally swapping the victim for one of these suspects. This player then places a colored accusation marker below one of the suspects. The next player looks at the two suspects not just marked with an accusation marker, then places a colored accusation marker of their own, covering any markers already beneath that suspect. This continues until all four players have placed an accusation marker, with each player not being allowed to look at the suspect just accused.&#10;&#10;The round ends, and players reveal the suspects. Who's the culprit? The suspect bearing the highest number &ndash; except if the #5 is among the suspects, in which case the suspect with the lowest number is guilty. (The suspect with no number is always innocent.) Anyone who has accused the correct suspect receives their accusation marker back. Any markers incorrectly placed are flipped colored-side down and given to the player who owns the marker on top of the stack. The first player token rotates clockwise, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn if a player has eight or more tokens &mdash; or has no tokens &mdash; then the game ends, and that player loses.&#10;&#10;Earlier editions of In a Grove supported 3-4 players, while the 2021 edition contains slight changes to the rules and components to allow for play with 2-5 people.&#10;&#10;",

The ability to change orders will be reduced and it will be more difficult to &ldquo;recall&rdquo; formations, once launched. Initial planning will be an important feature, as befits a Napoleonic battle of such a scale.&#10;&#10;In addition, &lsquo;fog of war&rsquo; has been further developed and will be part of the main rules. Players will share some of the uncertainty experienced by the actual commanders, as to what precisely they are facing.&#10;&#10;Initial play tests have shown that Rising Eagles continues to provide a tense and exciting game play, with strategic battle planning assuming a greater significance than the &lsquo;slogging match&rsquo; of Waterloo.&#10;&#10;",

This game covers the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex. Each turn is a day, units are generally companies.&#10;&#10;Bastogne comes with special rules for road marching, Team SNAFU, barrages, and air strikes - but is built around a quick-to-play, simple-to-learn framework. Bastogne has three scenarios: an introductory scenario covering the Battle for Noville, a medium-sized one covering the Battle for Longvilly, and the withdrawal of Team Cherry plus the counterattack by the 501st Airborne Regiment, and the campaign game itself covering the whole action in a jam-packed 10 turns. A number of variants have been provided so you can experience the game over and over looking at fresh insights.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: One day&#10;Hex: 400 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Battalion&#10;&#10;Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)&#10;Playing Time: 4+ hours&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;",

The board is composed of hexagonal tiles that are either half valley/half mountain, two-thirds valley/one-third mountain, or vice versa. The tiles are extremely thick so that you can grab the mountain section of the tile and pluck it from the board. Six villages sit on the perimeter of the game board, each corresponding to one of the primary or secondary colors. Each village has a random demand tile in it that shows two colors, one in high demand and one in low demand; neither of these colors can match the color of the village.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you may first rotate one unoccupied tile; by paying two dye resources from your personal supply, you can rotate a second tile. You then must move each of your llamas at least one space, but you can move them further if you desire and if the terrain allows them to do this. You rotate tiles to create long paths of valley or mountain so that ideally your llamas can travel far with each move.&#10;&#10;If you move a llama into a village, you trade the dye on that llama. If the dye you carry isn't in demand in that village, you simply trade that dye for the dye from the village, say, green for yellow. If the dye is in demand, then you add 1-2 dye of that delivered color to your personal supply (depending on whether the demand is low or high), then you place a dye matching the color of that village on your llama. If you collect a color in your personal supply and don't have it in your scoring track, you can place it in your scoring track. No matter what, you replace the demand tile in that village, making sure the color of that village isn't on the demand tile.&#10;&#10;During a turn in a village, you can hand in four dye from your personal supply to acquire a new llama that is then placed in that village with a dye from that village on its back. Each llama moves on your turn, and you can have at most three llamas.&#10;&#10;As soon as you have one dye of each of the seven colors on your scoring track, you win.&#10;&#10;To hold the demand tiles, the game includes a handmade fabric bag from Bolivia and Peru, which supports the local community.&#10;&#10;",

Six pirate ships lie in wait on sea, ready to pillage the rich ports or to rob the booty from other ships.&#10;&#10;The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board. If only two or three players are playing, the safe havens in the vacant color(s) are treated as normal sea spaces.&#10;&#10;The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.&#10;&#10;The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf. And what is the greatest temptation for a Caribbean pirate? Rum of course, barrels full of rum!&#10;&#10;In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.&#10;&#10;The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Fort Sumter is a two-player Card Driven Game (CDG) portraying the 1860 secession crisis that led to the bombardment of Fort Sumter and the American Civil War. Fort Sumter is a small footprint game (11x17&rdquo; mounted map) that takes approximately 25-40 minutes to play. The game pits a Unionist versus a Secessionist player. Each player uses the area control mechanic pioneered in Mark Herman's We The People design and immortalized in Twilight Struggle to place, move, and remove political capital. The location of political capital determines who controls each of the four crisis dimensions (Political, Secession, Public Opinion, and Armaments). After three rounds of play, the game culminates in a Final Crisis confrontation to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;The heart of the Fort Sumter design is Mark's CDG system where you use Strategy cards for their value or historic event to acquire political capital from the crisis track. Political capital tokens are used to compete for control of the twelve map spaces. Here the likes of William Lloyd Garrison, Sam Houston, Jefferson Davis, and Harriet Beecher Stowe walk on stage, while the Southern states dissolve the Union.&#10;&#10;The twelve map spaces are grouped into the four dimensions of the crisis. You gain a victory point each round that you control a dimension&rsquo;s three spaces. For example, the Armaments dimension is characterized by Federal Arsenals, Fort Pickens, and of course, Fort Sumter. In addition, each round you score a victory point for controlling your secret objective space. But beware; either player can score active objective spaces. At the end of the dual Presidential inaugurations (round three) a new Final Crisis mechanic drives the game to its hotly contested conclusion.&#10;&#10;Utilizing a new Final Crisis Series mechanic, you may accelerate the crisis by breaching zones (escalation, tension, final crisis) that yield bonus political capital. However, beware, as the first person to breach the final crisis zone gains political advantage, yet loses victory point ground. Each game ends with a Final Crisis, where cards set-aside during the three rounds complete your final political maneuvers that determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die?

    "Description": "The Cost is a challenging economic board game that places players in the role of a company whose interest is in the asbestos industry around the world. Players compete to make their fortune by concentrating or diversifying in the various aspects of the industry such as mining, refining, and shipping. Whoever ends the game with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four rounds, but it might end early due to health and safety regulations that shut down the industry by eliminating all areas in which they can act. In each round, players begin their turns by selecting a country in which to execute their actions. This selection triggers an event within it, in addition to having an effect on its economy.&#10;&#10;Players then use a unique system to draft three actions at once for the round. These actions can be a mix of building mines, building refineries, gaining government subsidies, establishing railroads, and establishing ports. Once all players have executed their actions, they may convert their money (i.e., victory points) into specific country resources, with each country having its own conversion rate.&#10;&#10;A player's industry then goes into motion with mines producing raw asbestos, refineries refining that asbestos, and railroads and ports transporting these goods around the world. Players may also have a chance to invest in their own companies to gain an edge. When players mine or refine asbestos, they must choose to either maximize profits for short-term gains or sacrifice their hard-won money to minimize deaths, thus sustaining the industry.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To get rid of these fanged fiends faster than the neighboring villages, use your residents' special abilities and your powerful secret weapon: a silver coin.&#10;&#10;Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...&#10;&#10;Silver Coin is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.&#10;&#10;Silver Coin can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by B&eacute;zier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;Reluctant Enemies: Operation Exporter: The Commonwealth Invasion of Lebanon and Syria, 1941, is small game meant to serve as an accessible introduction to the Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;).  It is one map, with 60 or so combat units (both players) in action at any given time.  This allows for a pace of play not possible with the previously published OCS monster games. Regardless of the reduction in scale it remains an OCS game with all features relevant to the system.  In this game there can be wide open, swirling, DAK-like battles in the desert (with some: limited armor forces), river lines to break, and very rough, mountainous terrain to contend with. The British have the possibility of an amphibious invasion.  Naval shore bombardments, by both sides, can be important in the early part of the campaign. There is a small but significant air campaign.  As always in the OCS, supply constraints make each player feel he may be on the edge of disaster.&#10;&#10;This campaign remains a footnote in WWII history even among many knowledgeable enthusiasts.  However, given the nature of events in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations during the first half of 1941, this campaign was arguably the hot spot in the world at that moment in time.[...]&#10;&#10;The Vichy were well equipped and organized. They put up stiff opposition, and counterattacked with great effect. The Commonwealth and Free French forces, at first, were stopped cold. Ironically, it was the failure of Operation Battleaxe (June 15) in the Western desert that allowed reinforcements for this campaign from the Western Desert and a resumption of the Commonwealth offensive. After Damascus fell, Beirut was seriously threatened and with Indian 10th division troops (along with Habforce) moving on Aleppo and Homs to the North, the Vichy proposed an armistice to end the fighting.&#10;&#10;The armistice was signed on July 14. However, this result was far from certain. Here you can examine why.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 to 2 days&#10;Hex: 2.5 miles / 4.0 Km&#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 1  22&quot; x 32&quot; full-color map&#10;One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS series rulebook&#10;One 24-page Reluctant Enemies specific rulebook and designer notes&#10;One 16-page OCS starter guide booklet&#10;One 4-page OCS rules summary and explanation booklet&#10;Two 4-page OCS charts and tables booklets&#10;Two set up charts (1-sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In AD 1096, hope fills the air like a bird's song after a long winter, the seeming endless road of the Dark Ages may soon come to an end. For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.&#10;&#10;Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!&#10;&#10;The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.&#10;&#10;Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While playing Extraordinary Adventures: Pirates, you become a pirate captain sailing three ships through the Caribbean in search of rich merchants to plunder and friendly ports in which to trade your booty for riches.&#10;&#10;In more detail, you have one ship on each of the three &quot;tracks&quot;, i.e., pathways through the Caribbean Sea. On each turn, you play three cards from your hand to move your ships. Your cards have a basic movement number, and often a secondary action. You may use one or the other to move your ships down the track or gain special advantages.&#10;&#10;Each of the three tracks winds through the Caribbean islands toward your ultimate goal: the Spanish Treasure Galleon at Trinidad. Along the way, there will be detours that lead to merchant ships that may be plundered, and towns that may be visited to cash in your plunder for treasure. Plundering merchant ships and visiting towns also allows you to recruit more crewmen (cards) for your crew (deck). The better your deck is, the faster that your ships are able to move, so deciding when to take detours for plunder and recruiting and when to sail on toward your ultimate goal is an important decision that every pirate captain must make.&#10;&#10;The first pirate captain to reach the Treasure Galleon at the end of any track ends the game. Each pirate ship scores points based on what place they finished on each track, as well as for the treasures earned by selling plunder. The richest captain goes down in history as the Pirate King!&#10;&#10;",

In the game of CODA players try to crack each other's &quot;code&quot; - a sequence of secret numbers.  Guess an opponent's secret number and it is revealed (by knocking it down).  Guess incorrectly and you must reveal one of your own secret numbers!  On each turn, a new number enters play, which helps you to narrow the possibilities and grow your own code.  Common sense, intuition and your &quot;detective&quot; skills will guide you to success.&#10;&#10;From me:&#10;&#10;There are two sets of tiles (similar to Stratego pieces without the soldiers) numbered 0-11.  One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.  If he chooses not to then he places the picked piece in his code, in sequence, but does not reveal it.&#10;&#10;Play continues until only one person has a piece standing.  When the new tiles run out, just keep going without drawing tiles.&#10;&#10;Belongs to a series / trilogy, containing:&#10;&#10;    Bernini Mysterie&#10;    Da Vinci Code&#10;    Salomon's Dilemma&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But the local animals aren&rsquo;t quite prepared for their group photo and are scattered about. When calling them over one by one to line up in front of your lens, they may just bring along a friend or two to really help you fill out your photo. Then position them in the best spots to create a charming photo worthy of the best photographer of Loco Momo!&#10;&#10;Loco Momo is a competitive game featuring drafting, tile placement, and set collection elements, falling under the broader mechanic of &ldquo;tile drafting.&rdquo; Players first choose an animal tile, and based on its unique movement, the animal moves to a different clearing, potentially allowing you to take even more animals of the same background color. Players then place your newly obtained tiles on your scoring board, which scores points based on specific arrangements (e.g., number of identical/different animals in a row, matching animals vertically, linking background colors, etc.). Like any good drafting game, take which benefits you most, but maybe keep an eye on what others may need! But distinguishing itself from others in the genre, Loco Momo offers an approachable theme and (family) friendlier atmosphere as the scoring system removes some of the bite of &ldquo;hate/spite&rdquo; drafting.&#10;&#10;",

Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&#10;&#10;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

The game is heavily Euro-inspired: It uses a tactical card-based combat system and takes lots of strategic planning to use your available actions to optimal effect and become the most notorious pirate of your era.&#10;&#10;Each playing will vary as you randomly reveal five of ten vastly different victory conditions: One game, you'll be rescuing your lost family, the next you might have to conquer enemy ships and fortresses or face the hideous Kraken.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses two of the revealed conditions as their personal goals. After all players have chosen, they set-up the fully modular board, each of them trying to find a constellation that optimally supports their hidden agenda. Then they outfit their modable ship miniatures, select their starting abilities and equipment and set sails to fight, conquer, trade, loot, hunt for treasure and much more.&#10;&#10;During play, every achievement is rewarded with victory points. The game continues until all five victory conditions have been met. There's a final scoring in which players collect extra points if they managed to achieve the goals they chose, and highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A subtle blend of headology, magic and, of course, the all-important cup of tea will see our heroines tackle everything from a sick pig to a full-blown invasion of elves. Each player tries to be better at everything than the others, while also cooperating to prevent crises from escalating.&#10;&#10;Life can be tough for a young witch in Lancre. Fear not, however, as some of Terry Pratchett's most famous characters will be on hand to aid your quest. Along the way you'll meet Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick, as well as a rich supporting cast of familiar faces from the Discworld series. When things get really tough and you feel you are turning &quot;Black Aliss&quot;, you can always have a cup of tea with one of your fellow witches.&#10;&#10;The Witches can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.&#10;&#10;",

When a deadly toxin suddenly infects you and everyone in your lab, you must work quickly to share your research and discover the Antidote before it's too late.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns deciding what action all other players take: either discard from their hand or trade research with other players.

Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of &quot;down-time&quot; between turns.&#10;     Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game. If you think you know the answer you can speed the game towards its conclusion. If not...well, don't hold your breath! No one is going to wait for you to figure it out! This element adds a feeling of tension and excitement.&#10;     Multiple levels of player interaction: Even a &quot;wink&quot; or a &quot;nod&quot; can have meaning in this game if you are trying to learn or pass information between players. At the same time, a blatant statement such as &quot;Blue formulas are toxic&quot; may have no meaning at all, but everyone will judge you by your actions (everyone can see the cards you choose to discard). &#10;     Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty what the Antidote is by the end of the game. This means the revealing of the Antidote is often a surprise.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Barbarossa uses six different kinds of cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Supply Cards: These provide points to buy other cards from the open card pool. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Unit Cards: The use of these cards require &quot;Operation Points&quot; (Each turn you start with one Operation Point) and deliver the military strength to attack cities or strategic positions (or in other words gain victory point cards).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Operation Cards: They give you a one time bonus in different forms. After use they are not just discarded but put out of play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deploy Cards: They stay in the players play area and deliver bonuses in different forms every turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Target Cards: The cities and strategic positions which deliver VPs, also if you conquered strategic positions it becomes easier to attack cities.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Event Cards: If you attack the Target cards an event is drawn and stuff happens.&#10;&#10;&#10;Like all of Arclight's deck construction games, the illustrations are provided by famous Japanese fanzine artists.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;    El Alamein&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There is a preferred school (trump suit) and the strongest gladiator from this school wins the bout.

Players must follow the initiating school if possible, or they may &quot;challenge&quot; by matching the strength of the last gladiator played, immediately changing the preferred school to that of their gladiator!&#10;&#10;Players compete to collect gladiators with positive crowd favor and avoid those with negative favor. The player with the highest favor at the end of the round earns 1 crowd support.

Players then start shaking the igloos to find one that matches the number of beads shown on a card.  When a match is found, the player marks that igloo with a colored chip and places it on the card with the same number.  If the guess is correct, that player receives the card (worth points) as a reward.  If the guess is incorrect, that player loses the chip used to mark the igloo.  The game is finished when one player has no chips left, or when all of the cards have been claimed!&#10;&#10;Although the appearance of Igloo Pop is quite silly, it takes a steady hand and well-trained ear to be able to determine how many beads are inside an igloo.  The sound and vibration when shaking each igloo is slightly different, allowing skilled players to judge the contents quickly and accurately.  Also, a risk/reward system is introduced in the cards: cards with several numbers are easier to guess, but are worth less points; cards with a single number are often difficult to guess exactly, but are worth more points.&#10;&#10;Background story, from the back of the box:&#10;The young ice giant has a big problem: he wants to buy fish sticks, but he cannot remember how many and he has nine shopping lists in his basket.&#10;&#10;So he goes from igloo to igloo and shakes each. In each he listens to the delicious fish sticks bouncing off the igloo walls. When he thinks that the igloo in his hand has the same number of fish sticks as one of his shopping lists, he takes it home.&#10;&#10;When he gets home, there are no fish sticks in the igloo. Instead, wild and laughing Inuit children tumble out of the igloo. Excitedly they shout, &quot;Shake us again!&quot; &quot;That was great fun!&quot; &quot;This is super&quot;, thinks the young ice giant. &quot;Now, I have found some new friends to play with!&quot; And, he promptly forgets all about his shopping lists.&#10;&#10;",

The map is divided into rectangles.&#10;&#10;Four starting rectangles are chosen by drawing location tiles. These areas are allocated one of the four differently colored types of empire counters. Each turn, players can play tiles corresponding to locations on the map. It's mandatory that these are next to tiles that already have an empire counter on them. The new location receives an empire counter depending on already present adjacent ones. Thus the four empires expand during play, as more and more tiles receive their empire counter. The size of the empires will vary from game to game.&#10;&#10;Players also need to build galleys to control tiles or travel to locations and found a city there. Building and traveling must be paid for with appropriate cards. These are dealt each round, some may be kept and traded. Spend them to your best advantage.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game players score points for controlling tiles. The amount of points depends on whether a city or galley controls the rectangle and how big the empire is to which the area belongs.&#10;&#10;",

Who will take over the Infinite City?&#10;&#10;Will you place the capital next to the port, claiming both as your own? Will you use the transit station to move another player&rsquo;s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?&#10;&#10;Infinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.&#10;&#10;Infinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.  Each player is awarded points for contiguous groups of at least three tiles controlled by him at a rate of one point per tile.  Some tiles have a point value number in the corner; players receive the number of points indicated for such tiles that they control.  Also, some tiles have silver rings; the player controlling the most of these receives one point per such tile.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favors sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotions to become craftsmen or even the guild master.&#10;&#10;Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.

The nomadic hunter-gatherers who had laboriously earned their place on Earth organized into small groups, differentiating social roles, building the first settlements, and initiating a great revolution. Scientists call this period &quot;Mesolithic&quot;, and this game talks about those people.&#10;&#10;In MESOS, you are the leader of an ancient tribe, and as such, your role is to nurture the growth of your tribe by adding new members, ensuring its sustenance, constructing buildings, and addressing unfolding events. Each round, you must place your totem pawn on the offer track, then following the pawns' order on the track, you will acquire character or building cards and add them to your tribe. Each card has specific effects and may earn prestige points (PP) as you construct specialized buildings and prepare wisely for the events you will face.&#10;&#10;Whoever manages to bring the most prestige to their tribe wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle For Souls is a card game pitting the seven archangels of heaven versus the seven princes of hell in a fight for the eternal souls of humankind.&#10;&#10;In the game, 1, 2, or 4 players choose the side of heaven or the side of hell. Each side will battle for 28 souls, which are worth victory points. Players add holy or unholy points on the souls in play based on how they use temptation, virtue, sin, intercession, holy relic, unholy relic, angel and devil cards. Earn enough holy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to heaven, earning the side of good victory points; earn enough unholy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to hell, earning the side of evil victory points. If a soul does not earn enough holy or unholy points and is reaped, it goes to purgatory where its victory points are not counted.&#10;&#10;Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player's arsenal. Influence on souls can be spent for more powerful cards that have special abilities, and allow a player to gain souls more quickly.&#10;&#10;Many strategic decisions impact play. Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.&#10;&#10;Sin, Intercession, and Relic cards can be purchased for beneficial effects at the cost of holy and unholy points. These help to make for deep gameplay and excellent risk-reward scenarios. Invest in these cards to strengthen your position.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Some say Anansi is a trickster, but he is a spider for sure and sometimes even a man. Let me tell you why he is also known as the &quot;Keeper of Stories&quot;: One day, Anansi decided to gather all stories and become the wisest of all. After many years, he finally had all the stories in the world, but poor Anansi did not feel any wiser. Eventually he realized that true wisdom is not achieved by keeping knowledge to yourself, so he decided to share his stories and inspire people with them &mdash; and believe it or not, that was how this game was made!&#10;&#10;In the trick-taking card game Anansi, you have to be smart about which tricks you are trying to get. Each trick represents a story, but stories untold are worth only a little. If you can acquire followers &mdash; by playing a card not to the trick, but for its indicated number of followers &mdash; you can match up your followers with stories to inspire them, and inspiring all your followers should always be your goal because this grants you the trickster's favor and sweet bonus points.&#10;&#10;Note that cards played to gain followers can affect the trump suit, which means that the trump can change several times in a game. It is up to you to adapt to the new situation!&#10;&#10;Anansi is in the same game line as Spicy, with the game box and card backs being decorated with a special metallic print in purple. For such a rich and cultural theme, publisher HeidelB&Auml;R Games paired up with Nigerian artist Dayo Baiyegunhi and South African artist Emmanuel Mdlalose to create a unique and colorful look for the story world of Anansi.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For generations, the fertile Hiddenlands were shared by the peoples of the Five Realms. The Elves, Mages, Dwarves, Halflings and Humans lived peacefully with each other, though they increasingly engaged in fierce competition for the prosperity and glory of their respective nations.&#10;&#10;And so it was that when the divisiveness threatened to break the thousand-year peace, the Goblin Hordes from across the sea unleashed a devastating surprise attack, and the peoples of the Hiddenlands could not unify quickly enough to repel them. Remnants of each of the realms fled by ship, until they at last discovered a new, unoccupied land upon which they could begin building their civilizations anew. The old rivalries would remain, of course, but perhaps this time, their competition with each other would not welcome disaster. It was a time of hope, a time for exploration and construction, and a time of renewed competition in a new world they called Pandoria.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;gamer's game&quot; 'Pandoria', players discover this new land by placing tiles, and they claim its territory and resources by placing their people. When a type of terrain is completely surrounded by other terrain, every worker on the borders of that terrain gains its resources. Although more than one civilization will usually benefit, each player tries to gain more than the others. Mining gold gives you income to buy cards that have two options: buildings and spells. Acquiring wood allows you to build that side of the card for permanent advantages, while mining crystals gives you the power to use the card for its one-time spell instead. Excess resources can be converted into prestige Points, and some buildings can generate more. When the new land has been fully explored (all tiles have been placed), the player with the most prestige is declared the most powerful nation of Pandoria and wins the game!&#10;&#10;The game includes a streamlined beginner game, as well as expanded rules for the complete game that includes asymmetrical player powers.&#10;&#10;The second edition from 2024 has the following changes: &#10;- The game board is double-sided&#10;- The 5 realms are newly designed&#10;- the cover is brighter/friendlier&#10;- the cards have a little different size&#10;- some realm characteristics are revised&#10;- the rule book has 4 pages more&#10;- the starting player tile is newly designed&#10;Find everything here: https://www.irongames.de/wordpress/index.php/the-games/pandoria-2024-2/&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Invoke minor creatures to flip over a tile or push a row, creating the correct patterns to summon more and more powerful ones.  Eventually, you'll build a horde of Servitors who can chain flips, pushes, and switches together; rearranging the entire grid to your whims.  Change the skies, summon a Great Old One, and win!  The game is won by acquiring 10 points first, which can be done by summoning many small creatures or going for Great Old Ones.  Creatures which give more points tend to require more complex constellations.  The night sky is represented by a 5x5 field of objects.  It can be manipulated by moving a row by one object (cycling through), flipping one object (both sides have different objects), and switching two neighboring objects. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game was released in German in October of 2008. Steve Jackson Games released the English version in August of 2009. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The sergeant hangs the phone up. &quot;Multiple hostages, numerous bombs. We're up.&quot; We grab our gear, prep the robot and load the van. It's go time...&#10;&#10;An unknown terrorist organization is on the rise, looking to spread fear while profiting from the chaos they release. You, your fellow members of the Retro City Bomb Squad, and your trusty Bomb Squad Robot are the only barriers in the way between those dastardly villains and the innocent civilians of Retro City. Lives are at stake &mdash; and time is ticking &mdash; so let's go!&#10;&#10;Bomb Squad is a cooperative game in which 2-6 players are members of a team operating a disposal robot with the mission to disarm bombs and save hostages. The players work together, racing against the clock to provide the appropriate instructions for the robot to achieve their mission objectives. Bomb Squad features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Real-time play: Players each take a turn in clockwise order and are free to take as long as they want on their turn. However, there is a timer counting down in real time until the bombs will detonate, so players will want to be as efficient as possible. &#10;    Hidden Card Information: Players hold their cards so that the fronts are facing the other players, which requires that players give each other Intel to figure out which cards they have in hand. &#10;    Limited Communication: While players have their cards up and visible to each other, players are allowed to communicate only via the Intel they give each other, which provides hints about the cards they have in their hands. Table talk about which cards are needed, or where the robot should go, and giving implied hints about which cards to play are prohibited.&#10;    Co-operative game play: The players all work together, winning or losing collectively as a team.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SEAL Team Flix is a fully co-operative or solo tactical dexterity game that pits 1-4 players against the forces of terrorism. Taking inspiration from several military-themed first-person shooter video games, SEAL Team Flix incorporates flicking, dice rolling, and character standees into an exciting, unique combination that will have the whole table standing up.&#10;&#10;The game has two modes: campaign and skirmish. In campaign mode, players embark on an eight-mission non-linear adventure. Individual SEALs will get promoted several times over the course of the campaign...if they live. In skirmish mode, simply play one of the 17 missions as a standalone set-piece.&#10;&#10;SEAL Team Flix is an objective-based game, with primary and secondary objectives which need to be resolved to successfully complete each mission. For example, in some missions, you must locate and acquire intelligence against the terrorist organization Gaia's Hope. In others, you must disarm time bombs or rescue hostages. While you are given intelligence at the beginning of each mission as to the number and nature of the objectives that need to be completed, every game will be different because you will never know where on the map they are until you physically locate them with your SEALs. The game's difficulty scales both with the number of SEALs playing as well as with three optional difficulty levels.&#10;&#10;IMPORTANT ERRATA: Somehow the Sentry positions were left off the printed boards included in the game. You can see images of the correct Sentry Position placement on pages 6 and 10 in the rulebook, but you can also download the Sentry Errata PDFin the files section, which contains enlarged images of the maps and their sentry positions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Portuguese canning industry developed throughout the 20th century, going through periods of great splendor and of extraordinary importance in the social fabric of communities close to fishing centers. After the huge growth due to the immense supply of troops in Europe that World War II brought, the industry went through a period of stability with the consolidation of the quality of the products and the establishment of markets abroad.&#10;&#10;Lata (&quot;tin can&quot; in English) is the name of the raw material for the containers in which the fish is packed, and it also turned out to be a popular designation for the product. In this game, players manage local canning companies in the 1950s and produce and sell the famous canned sardines or canned mackerel, the two main canned fish in the first decades of the industry, before the appearance of the very popular tuna.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over six rounds. In each round, players buy a batch of fish, tomato or olive oil, which they then can use in their factory. These preserves will then be sold to markets. This operation will result in money that will be used to buy scorecards and increase the factory's production capacity.&#10;&#10;The order in which each batch of raw materials is chosen is given by an auction of action points that players secretly make by sliding their disk to the left on the action track of their individual board. Whoever gives up more opportunities for action chooses the best lot, but it is clear that having more possibilities for action is vital to produce more and reach the best markets!&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points (VP), which are awarded at the end of the game by the scorecards, wins.&#10;&#10;Lata is the second game in the &quot;Quinas Collection&quot;, following the success of Caf&eacute;, the first game in the line.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monster Chase is a cooperative memory game for players 3 to 7 years old. In the game, monsters creep out from under the bed and try to surround it. Each monster is only afraid of one toy that will banish it to the closet amongst the ten that are available to be found. If the players successfully send all the monsters to the closet before they can close the circle around the bed, they win! Otherwise, the monsters are declared victorious.&#10;&#10;In game terms, face-down cards are placed on the table with tiles then placed around these cards. To start, a card is revealed that depicts a monster and the toy it's afraid of. In turn order, each player must now find the toy that scares off this monster, with the toy being hidden in the face-down tiles. If players make three mistakes when searching for this toy, a new monster appears with a different toy needed to scare it away. Once all the monsters are out, you have only three chances to win by getting rid of all the monsters.&#10;&#10;The rules offer different difficulty levels to adapt to player experience and/or maturity, such as one tile that shuffles the other tiles around and one tile that instantly brings out a new monster.&#10;&#10;",

D&#197;&#141;butsu Sh&#197;&#141;gi, which means &quot;animal shogi&quot;) is a simple version of Shogi. Both players have only four pieces &ndash; chick, giraffe, elephant and lion &ndash; and they're trying to either catch the opponent's lion or move their own lion to the other side. The board is just 3&times;4 squares, so the game is rather short, aimed mostly at getting children interested in Shogi &ndash; but even if you're an adult, the game is enjoyable. As for how to play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The giraffe moves like a rook, but moves only one space.&#10;     The elephant moves like a bishop, but moves only one space. (Interestingly, in Xiangqi and Tamerlane Chess, the elephant moves precisely two spaces diagonally.)&#10;     The chick is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Shogi, and is promoted to a full-grown chicken, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;     The lion is analogous to a king, except that he can win essentially by promoting, as long as it doesn't leave him in check.&#10;     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!&#10;     Unlike in Shogi, you can drop a chick for mate or have two chicks in a column.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Statis Pro baseball game includes individual pitcher and batter cards for an entire baseball season. A full 9-inning game generally takes 30 minutes or less to complete.&#10;&#10;Begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicates which positions a player is allowed to play, and for how many games that player played at each position during a full season.&#10;&#10;Each at-bat is simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) is drawn to determine a PB number which is then compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card; this determines if the pitcher&rsquo;s card or the batter&rsquo;s card is &quot;in control&quot;. Then a new FAC is drawn to generate a random number to determine the result from the player's card who was &quot;in control&quot;. Each of the 98 FAC has four results&mdash;two per side, one right-side up, one upside-down and also features special PB results to simulate clutch batting, clutch fielding, unusual plays (e.g. dropped third strike, ejections, etc.), and injuries.&#10;&#10;If an out is made, an out chart appropriate to the runner situation (e.g. Bases Empty, Runner on Second, etc.) is consulted to determine the outcome by drawing an additional FAC (or two, if the out result has a chance of error to be checked).&#10;&#10;Charts on the playing board support managerial choices such as sacrifice bunts, hit and runs, stolen base attempts, etc. For these, no PB number is determined; simply consult the FAC&rsquo;s random number and follow the chart&rsquo;s instructions which usually involves consulting players ratings appropriately (e.g. base runner&rsquo;s stolen base rating, catcher&rsquo;s throwing ability, etc.).&#10;&#10;Production of the game was halted after the 1992 baseball season on account of a royalties dispute between Avalon Hill and MLB. While the Avalon Hill Statis Pro Baseball game is no longer in production, it is possible to make your own player cards using the Statis Pro Baseball card formulas provided with the game. Moreover, PDFs of fan-made seasons and teams can be found online either free or for purchase.&#10;&#10;",

Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members.&#10;&#10;In this negotiation game, each player represents one member of the UN Security Council and will both present and be presented with different proposals.&#10;&#10;In each round, one player acts as the UN Secretary General, presents a proposal to the Council and presides over a negotiation period that lasts no more than five minutes. The proposal will affect five issues &ndash; military, currency, etc. &ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him. All players openly negotiate on what they need in terms of points and bribes in order to vote for that proposal.&#10;&#10;After at most five minutes, the Secretary General closes negotiations by banging his wooden gavel, then players vote yes or no on the proposal. Any &quot;no&quot; vote kills the proposal, as in the United Nation's actual Security Council &ndash; but vetoing a proposal costs a player points, so he might prefer to look for deals that will enable him to say &quot;yes&quot;. The Secretary General scores a bonus when his proposal succeeds, so he and others who will benefit might be willing to negotiate to make the proposal sweet for all.&#10;&#10;After each player has served as Secretary General once (twice in a three-player game), each player scores based on bribe money on hand, points scored from proposal cards, and how well the player fulfilled the secret agenda card he received at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",
