    "Description": "In this game, players manage stores in New York City.  Stores are established in spaces on the apple-shaped board, and players manage their inventory by holding onto cards representing goods.  These cards are purchased from warehouse spaces and frequently change hands since a player is obliged to purchase a card whenever he or she lands on an opponent's store.  The maximum price which may be charged for an item depends on the number of floors in a store, so players are constantly expanding their outlets.&#10;&#10;The game deals with more than just cash -- every player gets a balance sheet used for tracking bank loans and credit with other players.  Credit limits are determined at the start of the game and affect the length of the game -- a $300 limit is recommended for an hour-long game, while $500 can last two hours or more.  As players reach their credit limits and are unable to pay back their creditors, they go bankrupt and drop out of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the normal flow of buying and selling, the game features board spaces and cards that spice up gameplay with random events.  There are also some special transportation spaces (taxis and subways) which allow players a little more control over their movement to add variety to the normal rolling and moving.&#10;&#10;Big Apple obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Monopoly, but it's not just a retheming -- there are enough differences to make it distinct from its more famous predecessor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Summary&#10;An abstract game in which the numbers 1-16 have to be arranged into rows, using five auxiliary columns and careful planning.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;Each player tries to lay three new rows, each of them starting with 1 and ending with 16, with all the numbers in between in their correct sequence. The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;Each player gets 48 number tiles (three sets of numbers 1-16) and arranges them in three horizontal rows from 1 to 16. One player is selected as the caller, shuffles his/her tiles and draws them one by one from a bag. He/she calls the number drawn. Each player takes that number from one of his/her horizontal rows. If it is a 1, he/she can start one of his/her three new main rows. If it is any other number, it has to be placed in an auxiliary column first.&#10;&#10;Each player may have up to 5 vertical auxiliary columns of any length. There must not be any gaps (i.e. tiles must be placed directly below one another), and tiles must not be rearranged later. Tiles need not be placed in sequence, but they should be placed in a way that allows for efficient removal to construct the main rows. Tiles may only be taken from the auxiliary columns starting at the bottom (not in the middle or top), and main rows can only be started when a 1 has been called.&#10;&#10;Each of the three new rows has to be started with a 1. The tiles have to be placed in correct sequence here. A 3 can only be placed after a 2, and so on. Tiles can be taken from the auxiliary columns (without being called again) as soon as the number at the bottom directly follows one at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows. E.g. if there is a 3 at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows and a 4 at one of his/her auxiliary columns, the 4 may be taken and placed next to the 3 in the main row. Tiles can be taken from the bottom of the auxiliary columns as long as they are in matching sequence.&#10;&#10;The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game. If no player is able to complete all three rows by the time the caller calls the last number, the player with the fewest tiles left wins instead.&#10;__________________&#10;&#10;One of Ravensburger&#039;s Traveller-Series games.&#10;&#10;",

Second is it ships with two actual Scribner dictionaries for checking on answers.  Finally is how it constrains someone just about to win...  There is also a handicap system.  So this Canadian publisher seems to have worked out a slightly more sophisticated system to the same fun we know as Balderdash, but added enough additional stuff to make it a bit more strategic in play and more educational to boot.&#10;&#10;",

Now one of the two players starts by taking one up to three (which can be choosen) matchsticks away. The other player does this as well and so on. The player who takes away the last matchstick loses the game.&#10;&#10;Winning strategy: The person who starts will be able to win the game, when the amount of the beginning isn't x * 4 + 1 (where x may be every natural number). When this is the fact and the person who plays second is smart, he'll win (read what to do). But what to do when you (person who starts) can build a winning strategy?&#10;&#10;Take away a specific amount of matchsticks (1 up to 3 of course), so the amount of matchstick still on the sheet is x * 4 + 1 (where x may be every natural number). Now make sure that in two steps (so one turn of you and one of your opponent) four matchsticks are taken away. Which means that when your opponent takes away 1, you take 3, when your opponent takes away 2 you take 2 as well and when your opponent takes away 3 you take 1. Now your opponent will always lose the game.&#10;&#10;To try this strategy out you can play the game online: http://www.schoolbits.nl/extern-spel-13b.html&#10;&#10;The computer starts, but doesn't directly take the winning strategy. When you make a mistake on your first turn, the computer will take the winning strategy after this turn.&#10;&#10;",

It is about warfare - the weaponry, the armor, the tactics, the respite, the strengths and weaknesses of participating warriors, and the suspense and mystery of an unknown outcome.  A typical game can last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours.  It is for two players, and, best of all, Feud is played with two standard decks of playing cards!  This makes Feud cheap!  And sometimes free, (the best kind of game), if you already have the cards lying around.&#10;&#10;Feud is initially quite complex.  No one can master the concepts of Feud by playing just a few games, let alone the subtleties.  Once you have played it enough though, you will not only find it enjoyable, but rather simplistic and easy.&#10;&#10;To ease new players into the game, a set of Basic Rules is outlined first.  Play several games of Feud with the Basic Rules.  Once you have grasped them soundly, the Advanced Rules will bring the true excitement of Feud to light.  Though we have called them &quot;Advanced&quot; rules, they are just an extension of the Basic Rules, and complete the game's symmetry.  If you find yourself having fun with just the Basic Rules, or Basic Feud, no worries!  Many people enjoy Basic Feud more than Advanced Feud, or True Feud.  But we urge you to try out True Feud if you have enjoyed basic Feud, especially if you like games with higher degrees of skill and lesser degrees of chance.&#10;&#10;",

The board is composed of a 12x12 grid with a line of six starting/home squares parallel to and centered along each edge of the board. The players place their six pieces in these squares at the start of the game. In addition, each player has a seventh piece, which is slightly larger, known as the Priest of the Bow.&#10;&#10;The object is to cross the board and occupy the opposing home spaces, capturing as many men as possible on the way. Moves are made one square at a time along diagonal lines, with the pieces being placed at intersecting points. The pieces may not be moved backward.&#10;&#10;When two pieces surround an opposing piece, it is captured and removed from the board. The first captured piece is replaced by the capturing player's Priest of the Bow, which has the ability to move either on the diagonal lines as normal, or at right angles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skat may be played by 2, 3 or 4 players. It is similar in mechanics to Sorry! with dice in place of cards and marbles in place of movers. The players roll a die in hopes of throwing a 1 to leave their start space in the moulded plastic game base. Traveling the track of the board, it is a race to see who can get all 4 of their marbles into their home first. When you land on a space occupied by another player you call out &quot;skat&quot; and send that player back to their starting spot.&#10;&#10;In a 4 player game, you can play as teams with the goal of getting the 8 team marbles back prior to the other team. Once a player has all 4 of his in the home spaces, he can begin to move his partners marbles.&#10;&#10;Another version of the game is Wild Skat, using an extra hole in the center of the board. This extra hole allows you the opportunity to cross the board in fewer moves, but increases your chance of being &quot;skatted&quot; by your opponent.&#10;&#10;",
