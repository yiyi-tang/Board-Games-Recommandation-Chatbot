    "Description": "Operaci&oacute;n Barbarroja (Operation Barbarossa) is a strategic wargame that portrays the Eastern Front during World War II. The game recreates the combats between the German and Soviet armies between 1941 - 1945.&#10;&#10;In 1987 NAC released a series of mini-wargames consisting in this and two other titles (&quot;Infanter&iacute;a&quot; and  &quot;La carga de la brigada ligera&quot;). Their boxes, boards and pieces were obviously of a smaller size than NAC&acute;s regular games, and also their prices (I seem to recall that I paid about 700 pesetas by then).&#10;&#10;Contents were: a 24x38 cms board, 112 counters, a tray for them, a special die, sheets and rules.&#10;&#10;The game was conceived for two players, being its duration from about 30 to 120 minutes and its difficulty 5 in the NAC scale (high).&#10;&#10;Counters could be organized in groups. The pieces within them were put aside on the grouping sheets, and numbered group counters were moved on the board. This was the first time I saw this method in a NAC game. They were really getting better and more &quot;serious&quot; comparing to the first ones they published...&#10;&#10;",

Although written with 28mm figures in mind the rules are stand-based and so easily translate to any scale of model. The rules cater for many popular basing methods so there is absolutely no need to re-base your figures to be able to play Crusader.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the rules is the concept that you are representing units of troops in battle rather than individual warriors. Dispensing with the traditional phases within a turn the unit-based mechanics allow for a fluid game that simulates the quality and training of troops rather than the abilities of a few super characters.&#10;&#10;The rules have been created with the flexibility to allow armies from widely differing time periods to fight against each other through the use of a consistent points system. So if you want to fight William the Conqueror's Norman Army against Alexander's Macedonians feel free!&#10;&#10;",

A player passing through such a location may examine the card and if he has a matching Police Notice may take it and place it in front of him. Players may pick up further police notices by visiting police stations.&#10;&#10;When all the cards have been claimed, the player who has recovered the highest value wins.&#10;&#10;",

Soldiers can be used by both sides, while siege machines and counter-measures are obviously only useful for the attacker and defender respectively.&#10;Gameplay is supported by a simple plan that shows the castle and the status (ok/destroyed) of its parts. The keep is the innermost part, so the attacker has to destroy several parts (e.g. moat, walls) before he can land the final blow. For each part a special action card and siege machine is needed. There is also a mechanism for starving the defender out.&#10;After a game is won (attacker: starving out the defender or destroying the keep, defender: holding out for four weeks), roles switch.&#10;The game was originally planned to be extensible, but I've never seen one.

Flames and death followed as the mounted warriors charge was broken by the great beast of scales and wing. The victory did not last long though, as the high lord Wizard cast a mighty lighting bolt to strike the dragon dead, it falling out of the skies and crashing into the front lines of the goblin hoards.&#10;&#10;Lord Yar cringed at the carnage that was already sweeping over the battlefield. The two great mages would both continue to throw their forces at each other, cast spells and counter these magics with their own powerful spells. By the end of the day, Yar doubted that anyone would be left alive.&#10;&#10;This is Mage Wars, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. Mage Wars is a fast, fun game of magical conquest and war. Can your forces defeat your rivals before they grind you under their boot?

Gathered together, these different editions will create a massive game system which will devour hours of your time, so be warned, this game can be additive.&#10;&#10;This first set covers the forces and magic of the Arch-Mage and the Vile Warlock Lord. Each set comes with enough counters, map tiles and goodies to play, and when combined with other sets you can create a massive game system where several players can struggle for control of the magical realms of Mage War.&#10;&#10;",

As the stones flew into the mist filled night they stopped their flight and hung before the young wizard, spinning about each other in a magical dance. With the Runes now ready, Jord called the spell to mind and began to chant the rites of summoning. With a blast of multi-colored light and a puff of foul smelling smoke, a green furred wolf leaped out of the magical doorway the rune stones had opened. Standing nearly as tall as the short mage, the wolf growled and then bowed its head in obedience to its master.&#10;&#10;Turning, Jord commanded the great wolf to leap at his foe, a minor conjurer who had challenged Jord to a duel. Jord only hoped that the wolf he had just summoned would be enough to finish the other mage off, as that was the last of Jord&rsquo;s runes stones and so the end of his own magic.&#10;&#10;This is Runes, a game of magical battle, spell casting and summoning.

Each player has an army of 12 pieces (one General, two Knights, two Cannons, two Chariots, and five Soldiers);  unlike the parent game, there are no Guards or Elephants.  The rules are the same as XiangQi except that soldiers may move and capture one space to the side from their first move.  There is no river to cross and no promotion. In addition, except for the General, no pieces are restricted to the fortress.&#10;&#10;In the Leopard variant of Mini XiangQi, each player also has two leopards.  Leopards move one space orthagonally or two spaces diagonally.  They are allowed to capture only when making the two-space move. When making the two-space move, the leopard may jump over a piece (friendly or enemy) on the intervening point, although the jumped piece is not captured.  Leopards are stronger pieces than elephants in standard XiangQi because they are capable of reaching any space on the board.&#10;&#10;",

A &quot;Higher/Lower&quot; marker is placed between the piles.&#10;&#10;In front of each player, there are 2 stacks - a face down draw pile and a face up discard pile.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all cards are dealt to players, so the only stacks with cards are the player draw piles.&#10;&#10;Cards must be played onto the stacks in sequence - D on top of C if going &quot;Higher&quot;, C on top of D if going &quot;Lower&quot;. Cards may also be played onto another player's discard pile if it is 1 higher or lower than the top card. A player's turn ends when he draws a card that cannot be played anywhere - it is then placed in his own discard pile.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who gets rid of all their cards first (discard piles are recycled).&#10;&#10;Other players can challenge a move by shouting &quot;Rubbish&quot;. All players give 1 card to a validly challenged player, or to the challenger if wrong.&#10;&#10;To encourage a noisy game with lots of challenging, the rules suggested that players play quickly in order to make mistakes.&#10;&#10;The game consists solely of the marker, the cards and the rules.&#10;&#10;The rules say that whilst any number of players is possible, it is best with 4-10 players.&#10;&#10;",

Bonnie Prince Charlie's Scots have been victorious in every encounter with the forces of the 'German Usurper' George II since the Jacobite flag of rebellion was raised at Glen Coe on August 19, 1745. Now as the fog lifts off the sodden moorland at 11 AM, 4500 claymore-armed clansmen, most having not eaten nor slept in a day and a half, stand to as the red-coated ranks of 9000 troops of the government army march into battle formations. As the cannon of both sides unleash grapeshot, the Duke orders his troops forward, confident in their fire discipline. The Scots, outnumbered 2 to 1 in bodies but possessing the spirit of a lion in every Celtic breast, launch themselves into an attack borne by their battle ferocity that has been victorious in every contest of arms for the past year. The throne of Britain has just been laid on the scales of combat.&#10;&#10;Culloden contains:&#10;one 11&quot; by 17&quot; map;&#10;140 die-cut backprinted 1/2&quot; counters;&#10;8 pages of rules and scenarios;&#10;Just Plain Wargames Folio Format&#10;Cover Artwork by Adrian George&#10;&#10;",

The rent increases if the business has one or more retail outlets or an office tower.&#10;&#10;It will be helpful to compare this game to it's cousin, Monopoly; &#10;- there is no element of bidding for un-purchased properties, although players are encouraged to &quot;make your own deals!&quot; &#10;- Money paid for Socks or Bonds cards is put in the centre as a jackpot for landing on the Free Parking square&#10;- On rolling doubles, a player may move the the token the sum of both dice, or double that amount.  The player does not get to roll again after rolling doubles.&#10;- There is no payment for passing Go on each lap of the board, so financial resources are more limited.&#10;- Players pay $100 to get out of Court (Jail).&#10;- The game ends when one player becomes bankrupt.&#10;&#10;The game is very commercial.  The board and the Stocks and Bonds cards read like advertisements for local businesses. They often include real world addresses and phone numbers.  There are two Coupon cards included with the Stocks and Bonds cards that appear to be intended for use as real-world coupons at those businesses.&#10;&#10;",

This time, in July, from the 13th to 23rd, the German front at the Koltov area shattered from the weight of the Russian 3rd and 4th Tank armies breaking through a narrow 3-4 km gap in the German lines. As the 8th and 1st Panzer Divisions counterattacked, Russian aircraft filled the skies and wreaked carnage upon the 8th Panzer. Further north, a large German pocket had been created, which attempted to breakout. As German forces were tossed into the relief effort, the front shattered like glass. The 16th Pz and 20th PG Divisions but could barely hold their positions as the two massive Russian tank armies streaked for the Vistula River!&#10;&#10;This unique game has both players secretly issuing orders (five to select from) to each one of their formations. When revealed, a player's plan may be enhanced or wrecked depending on the orders issued to the opposing formation! It captures the reality of war quite well. Combat losses are in strength points. The German has a hard road to hold in this game as the Russian tank armies exploit the Koltov gap that is always created. The Russian also has some hefty victory conditions that require most objectives on the map to be in their control. The further west they move, the easier the situation is for the Germans.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 11x17&quot; full color maps&#10;Three single-side printed un-mounted countersheets (576 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&#10;One 21-page rulebook&#10;Five Player Aid Charts&#10;&#10;Player Provided: Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;",
