Brawlers may pick up mugs, bar stools, bottles of alcohol, and even barrels to smack possibly drunken enemies. It is based on the normal &quot;roll over target number on D20&quot; mechanic used in many games.Damage is rolled on D6. Though drinking can be helpful, you gain a light addiction, which can lead to more drinking, more addiction, and more fun!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subtitled &quot;Simple Air To Air Combat in the Jet Age&quot;.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook introduction:&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules are intended to provide a very simple and fast-moving wargame using any scale of modern aircraft models available at present, in conjunction with a hexagon grid. The size of grid will obviously depend upon the scale of models used.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To keep the game simple, much of the fine detail of air combat technology has been left out. Modern air combat is highly technical, but there is insufficient hard evidence to suggest the precise relative position of technology and pilot skill. Most writers on the subject are at pains to point out that the pilot's skill is still a significant factor, and it the skill of the player, rather than the technology that I have tried to emphasis here. Obviously, technology cannot be ignored, and in most cases I have tried to reflect the main differences in generic types of weapons and aircraft. Feel free to tinker if such detail that is available is insufficient for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules have designed with the wars of the 1960s and 1970s specifically in mind. They therefore exclude some of the more spectacular weapons developments of recent years.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is mainly 2-dimensional, although there is a simplified height- band system to represent general operating heights. A fully implemented 3- D system would be much more complex to operate, and a lot slower in play, and for that reason has not been provided here.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is intended to accommodate medium numbers of aircraft, and a single player should have no difficulty in handing 3-5 aircraft at once using the basic rules. The campaign rules are a different matter, however, and there is a separate section on those.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subtitled &quot;Wargame Rules for London Firefighting 1940 - 41&quot;.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook introduction:&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a low level operational game about firefighting during the London Blitz in 1940/41. The basic premise is that the player(s) represent fire officers trying to combat fires and deal with emergencies in the critical period of the first London Blitz of September 1940 to May 1941. It is a &lsquo;tactical skirmish&rsquo; game - with individual models representing individual vehicles, and stands of figures representing small groups of fire-fighters and emergency workers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It also requires a model (or at least a detailed ground plan) of the appropriate scale or the buildings involved. To keep the game manageable I have defined buildings as covering a number of &lsquo;zones&rsquo; - both vertically and in area - and these might cover more than one floor of a building, and ignore much the detail of the internal layout. I have done this to make the game reasonably fast-moving and to keep it simple - there is a wealth of detail; that could be represented, but in my view this would slow the game down considerably.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This game is unusual in that there is no &lsquo;enemy&rsquo; played as such. Player cooperate to solve a difficult (or even insoluble) problem with limited resources - I guess this could be called a &lsquo;multi-player solo game&rsquo;. The opposition comes in the form of randomly generated bombs and fires and damage that occur according to the games&rsquo; simple fire propagation model.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The concept has been inspired (if such is the word) by the continual media coverage of such regrettable events throughout the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fundamental to this game is a sort of 'Theory of Riots; which is that a riot is one, violent, expression of deep-rooted unrest by members of the civil population. The causes of riots are not the subject of these rules, merely the events following their start.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is intended for use with 25mm or OO/HO scale models, with a crowd of 150 or so figures and 40-50 police/security forces; there is no reason why the game should not be played using 1/300 scale models, or even 1/32! (provided of course that the other scales are changed as appropriate).&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The preferred way of playing the game is with one or more umpires and a group of say, 4-6 players (but there are other ways of setting up the game - see later).The players all represent the Security Forces and are given a copy of the SF Rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In practice, depending on umpire experience, we have found you need one umpire for every 3-4 players - there is quite a lot to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This game can also be played quite successfully as a solo game. To be most successful played solo it needs plenty of time to work through all the actions.&quot;&#10;&#10;This set of rules was originally released in 1983. A revised edition was released in 2001.&#10;&#10;",

If a telephone is available it must be unreliable.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The basic player team is probably a Brigade HQ - but with a few more players it can be expanded to a division of 2-3 brigades.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules are simplistic and built around a few, hopefully easy to remember, die rolls - because umpires will need to spend time writing as well as adjudicating.

Players control significant leaders - the key samurai of a clan, who in turn have contingents of fighters under them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules are intended to simulate some of the smallscale&#10;conflicts that went on from time to time in Japan.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There are many sets of rules that simulate the epic battles of the Sengoku era, and a number of games about individual skirmishing. These rules are intended for situation in between these two scales.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There are many examples of fights breaking out between smaller families or clans - or even between factions within a clan. These fights might involve only a few hundred fighters - too small to be counted as a battle - too big to be a man-to-man skirmish. In this game, players are significant individuals - leaders with great martial skills - and they have a following composed of their friends, family, vassals and servants.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This means that the composition of the force controlled by a player can be highly varied.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules are written with 15mm scale figures in mind - but there is no reason why they can&rsquo;t be adjusted for other figure scales - or even played with cardboard figures or counters depending on the sort of resources you have at your disposal.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Katana To Yari is Japanese for &quot;Sword and Spear.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a detailed game of tactical combat designed to be played with miniature figures on a hex grid. Figures represent a single warrior or horse, with each warrior being rated for six characteristics.&#10;&#10;Numerous weapons are described in the rules, including both melee and ranged weapons. Ranged combat covers firearms, archery, and makeshift missile weapons. Melee weapons have defined &quot;combat engagement zones&quot;, a spread of hexes in which the weapon can be used against an opponent. The defensive value of a weapon is also rated base on the relative hex from which an opponent's attack originates.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules, such as they are, are the results of around 20 years of messing around with 'samurai skirmishes' set in old Japan. The rules can be used either to play simple one-off games, or as the combat element of a role-playing game according to your taste.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In designing the game I was faced with the usual dilemma concerning personal combat rules reflecting the detail of using the colourful variety of exotic weapons to be found in Japan. Games which try to cater for a blow by blow resolution of combat are usually slow moving and unwieldy - and rarely, if ever, cope with group actions. For these rules I decided to concentrate instead on movement and positioning and reduce the clash of blades to a simple comparative die roll.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To do well in this game you need to ensure that you understand the strengths of your own weapon and the weaknesses of your enemy - proper positioning is vital, outnumbering essential. In an equal man-to-man fight the results are usually fairly unpredictable, and can swing suddenly and disastrously one way or another.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The singletons are triangular and can interlock with/capture enemy singletons at which point they form a doublet.&#10;&#10;A doublet can move any number of empty spaces in any direction, but can only be moved by the owner of the covering piece.&#10;&#10;A king is presented as 2 interlocking singletons of the same color and can move 1 space in any direction. Instead of moving, the king may abdicate his crown (covering piece) to another same-coloured singleton any number of empty spaces away in any direction.&#10;&#10;An enemy piece is vulnerable to capture if three or more tips of the attacker's colour point towards it in unobstructed line of sight; one of these pieces must make the capture. Singletons can only capture enemy singletons, which they cover to form a doublet. Doublets and kings can capture any enemy piece by replacement to remove them from the board.&#10;&#10;A player loses if their king is captured, cannot move or abdicate, or if there are less than three pieces under their control.&#10;&#10;There is also a three player variation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OP COM: Operational Map Combat in World War II.&#10;&#10;A set of detailed rules for running an umpired, double-blind World War II wargame for two players or teams. Written orders are issued by the players and the results are resolved by the umpire. The players represent command staff at division level or higher. The units controlled by the players are at least battalion sized and each game turn is a half day. The map scale will vary by scenario.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules started out as a set of guidelines for the operational megagame Operation Market Garden. This game was run twice, once in 1988 and again in 1993. In the course of these outings, the rules altered and benefited from considerable feedback from participants. The game system I offer here is a distillation of that feedback from users, together with additional thoughts and research.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is intended as a generic map gaming system for WW2 operations in the Western Europe Theatre, that is, covering operations from Normandy to the Baltic. With some alteration they might be suitable for the campaigns in Italy, although the terrain and operational practices make that theatre sufficiently different to make a rethink of the rules a good idea. The rules are not suitable for the Eastern Front or the Far East. The underlying assumptions vary far too much.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Operation Market Garden was a large and complicated operational game. It involved forces down to battalion level and headquarters up to Corps. When running such a game there is a lot to bear in mind, and the game system has to be robust in order that things progress smoothly. Of course, these rules do not need to be used only in the context of a full sized 100 player megagame -&#10;there are plenty of smaller operations that they could as easily be used for in the context of a club game for half a dozen players.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In addition to the reasonably straightforward aspects of ground combat the rules consider the problems of air-ground operations (both close support and airborne operations) and logistics (hopefully not quite as boring as some folk make out!).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The central theme is wealth; there are treasures with abilities, cards that interact with treasures, and powerful expensive cards. (Source: http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=361 )&#10;&#10;From the back of the box: &quot;Ah, money. There's nothing like the sound of coins clinking in your hands. You vastly prefer it to the sound of coins clinking in someone else's hands, or the sound of coins just sitting there in a pile that no-one can quite reach without getting up. Getting up, that's all behind you now. Life has been good to you. Just ten years ago, you were tilling your own fields in a simple straw hat. Today, your kingdom stretches from sea to sea, and your straw hat is the largest the world has ever known. You also have the world's smallest dog, and a life-sized statue of yourself made out of baklava. Sure, money can't buy happiness, but it can buy envy, anger, and also this kind of blank feeling. You still have problems - troublesome neighbours that must be conquered. &#10;But this time, you'll conquer them in style.&quot;&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;",

It is written for use with 20mm/25mm figures and a good source of large numbers of plastic zombies are the ones form the board game Zombies! (they also glow in the dark). The balance of the rules is on the assumption that the survivors are very heavily outnumbered, maybe 20 or 30 to one overall. Ideally the playing area should be fairly close - like an urban or wooded area - with plenty of places for the zombie hordes to lurk in ambush.&#10;&#10;In the set up there should be a number of concealed hordes - in basements, behind fences, down sewers etc. These are triggered by player action and attack. In addition there will be small groups or individual zombies scattered about the playing area.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It has scope for role playing, planning and playing with matchstick cannons and toy soldiers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To work best it needs around 10 people ideally in a club setting (ie. A hall and several tables), though it will work with less, down to two players and one table (if you just play the battle game part).&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The players are divided into teams of 2. There are enough briefings for six teams, though it is easy to ad teams. Ideally you need an even number of teams, but that isn&rsquo;t essential.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is played in three distinct phases: 1. The Arms Exhibition - buying the weapons for the next war. 2. Evaluation and Doctrine - testing the new weapons and deciding how they will be used. 3. Battle - the acid test of both equipment and doctrine.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Battle phase consists of each team matching a force of miniature infantry figures against another team's matchstick-firing model cannon. The cannons are acquired by the team's by way of an auction held during the Arms Exhibition phase. A team's model cannon must be operated in accordance with the doctrine drafted by the team during the Evaluation and Doctrine phase of the game.&#10;&#10;",

These can be divided up between player teams as appropriate (see below). It is recommended that players who use these rules regularly stick to one or other of the protagonists on a permanent basis. This will encourage greater identification with the cultural and technological characteristics of the two sides.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The rules and structure aims only to be internally consistent, and players have to determine tactics and actions based solely on the briefings and rules presented to them - they have no &lsquo;historical reality&rsquo; (whatever that is) to appeal to.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game draws heavily on Judeo-Christian source material - particularly medieval notions of hell and demonology - for its inspiration, but it is not intended to be a realistic depiction of the similar elements of that belief system, and any offence caused to Christians is entirely unintended and accidental.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The key thing to remember in playing this game is that it takes place in an alien environment that is truly incomprehensible to mortal humans. What you see and experience is only your feeble mind attempting to make sense of the unknowable. If it seems like some sort of weird hallucinogenic dream then perhaps that is the nature of the world we are simulating.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is played on a table-top using toy soldiers. Absolutely any toy soldiers can be used, from any period and any scale from ancient Egyptians to starship marines. The terrain is a representation of the landscape of hell. Hell is what you make it, so there are no guidelines - anything that fits your conception will do. Sometimes we play using multiple tables, each representing a Circle of Hell - but much depends on how much space you plan to take up and how many players are taking part.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

(When playing with three or four players, each player has only one set of spiders numbered 1-8.)&#10;&#10;To start the game, neutral flies and the player pieces are placed randomly around the web. Everyone but the first player can then swap the position of two of her spiders. Each turn, a player must make a capture by moving one of her spiders onto an enemy piece (or a fly). Spiders can move over friendly spiders and empty spaces, but not enemy spiders.  A spider can capture an enemy spider that has the same number of legs or fewer legs. If a player can't capture, she passes for the turn, but take actions in the future if captures become possible.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one player has 8-legged spiders, or neither player can move. The player with most 8-legged spiders wins; in the rare case of a tie, you look at the 7-legged spiders, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

Fight using magic, in direct combat and with strategic sophistication to prevent extinction.&#10;Tarascon is a rpg-style board game designed for the Yvio console. You take the role of one of four dragons, each with different values in attack, defense and speed. Seated in the cave of Tarasque you'll have to pick up a dragon egg and take it to a nest. After a short while Yvio will inform you that there's a hatchling hiding in one of the rune chambers. Search for it and take it out of the cave to win the game (difficulty could be set to 2, 3 or 4 eggs, too).&#10;During game play you will have to level-up your character, fight creatures and you can take on quests that the console is offering. You have to consider each decision wisely because the cave will start to crumble at some time during the game. If all the chambers are destroyed before one player fulfilled his task all players lose and Yvio wins.&#10;&#10;",

This may be a simple &quot;last man standing&quot;-battle, or a scenario containing certain tasks, such as to escort an important person or to defend a special building for a certain time.&#10;Types and numbers of terrain pieces that are placed on the field, depend on the chosen scenario - the most common types are woodland, hills, roads, houses and fences.&#10;&#10;",

Want to bet?&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board showing a track of 60 spaces between &quot;start&quot; and &quot;finish&quot; and 3 places for certain piles of cards. Additionally the box contains 126 cards (66 &quot;Pfiffikus&quot;, 30 &quot;R&uuml;ffel&quot; and 30 &quot;Belohnung&quot;), 64 reward marker, 1 bag made of cotton, 8 wooden figurines (4 girls and 4 boys, each in blue, red, yellow and green), 2 wooden dice (one to use and one for replacement) and a rulesheet.&#10;Looking at the components it seems to be a fair simple game of &quot;Roll and Move&quot; (sorry, I don't have the rules). I guess that the shuffled cards have to be placed on the corresponding place on the gameboard from where a card is drawn and read to the player who ended up on a certain space. Each space of the running track shows one of 3 symbols: a question mark, an exclamation mark or an explosion bubble.&#10;The question mark belongs to the Pfiffikus-cards. In this pile you find action cards giving you a special task to perform (like balancing a figurine on your left foot while walking once around the room) or question cards. The player receives reward chips for giving the right answer or fulfilling the action task.&#10;R&uuml;ffel-cards are showing the exclamation mark. On them you find a description of what you might have done wrong (like wasting energy etc.) and the punishment you receive (lose markers, go back etc.).&#10;Cards for Belohnung (meaning reward) are showing the bubble. They are listing exemplary behaviour and a reward for it.&#10;Seems to me that you are winning when you reach the finish line and have more reward markers than the others.&#10;&#10;",

Recommended reading for this are the Conan books, Tolkein's Middle Earth books and Terry Pratchet's Diskworld books.

    "Description": "Hell on Wheels: Platoon Level Tank Tactics Game.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate the tactics and command and control problems facing individual tank troop/platoon commanders. Of necessity, such a game cannot expect to cover fully all aspects of tank combat at this level, and therefore I have chosen to gloss over the detail of the tank gun Vs armour battle, in favour of a more detailed communications and reactions system. Everything is very simple, but it is very difficult to do the simplest things.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game requires a minimum of two participants, Control and Player. The Control determines a fixed (or semi-fixed) defence for the player to fight through. Since such actions are likely to be fast and furious, there is often plenty of opportunity for Player and Control to swap roles. The Player is the commander of a single tank troop/platoon of whatever type the scenario dictates. These rules are written with the European campaign, 1944 in mind, but the structure can be applied to almost any tank engagement, with some small modifications.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;With more players, there is scope for larger games of up to squadron level, preferably with different units with their own terrain model. The back-to-back, two sided game&#10;is also possible, but not recommended, since the detail necessary for correct interaction slows the game down considerably, and in my tests, the presence of a 'live' enemy made absolutely no difference to the players. It is recommended that when playing the higher level games, the ratio of 1:1 Player to Control is maintained if possible.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 1/300, 1/200, or 1/76 scale tanks. Each turn represents about 20-40 seconds. Each player represents one platoon/troop commander.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tank Duel is an umpired, dual blind Tactical level miniatures wargame of a battle between two opposing tanks. Two four-player teams represent the opposing tank crews, portraying the commander, gunner, loader, and driver.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate, in a simple but realistic way, the problems confronting the crew of an individual tank in combat. To make the game even more difficult, the action takes place between two or more crews, in a sort of stylised 'duel'. Obviously, such one-on-one duels practically never took place, but these games are intended more as a sort of teamwork game, to illustrate a point. There is no reason why the game cannot be expanded to take on larger actions of up to troop level.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Any scale of model can be used, although it is important that the turrets of the tank models can be rotated independently. For reasons which become apparent later, 1/200 is probably the smallest practical scale, and 1/72 or 1/90 are probably the ideal scales.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is vitally important that the terrain scale is the same as the model scale, ie. for 1/72 the ground scale would be 1&quot; = 2 metres.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each 'bound' of activity takes 4-5 seconds of real time, and represents approx 10-15 seconds of game time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each player represents one crew member.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Carthaginians were lead by Hannibal's less famous brother, Hasdrubal, and the Numidians by King Syphax.&#10;&#10;Sophonisba is Hasdrubal's own daughter offered in marriage to Syphax to ensure Numdia's continued loyalty after the defection of their cavalry general, Masinissa.&#10;&#10;To play Sophonisba and the Battle of Great Plains, you will need SQPR &quot;II&quot;, the second edition rules (from 1994). &#10;The needed counters can be found in SQPR and in the module counter sheet included in C3i #4. (Some counters from the War Elephant and Africanus modules are reproduced in the C3i that players without those scenarios can play Sophonisba.) The Cannae map from SPQR is also required as it resembles the Great Plains battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

They are to remain there for two turns 'because of the trade in Christian slaves which is carried on there', but they can be released by the arrival of another player on the same square.&#10;&#10;",
