    "Description": "Looper is played on a toroidal board represented by a square grid. Only orthogonally adjacent cells count as adjacent. (Thus, there are no diagonal connections.)&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player places 1,2 or 3 black stones on any vacant intersection. Alternatively, on his/her turn a player may announce &quot;take&quot;, after which the opponent continues with white and the taker with black, alternately playing single stones onto empty intersections.&#10;&#10;Black wins by making a global loop. White wins by preventing this.  A global loop is a string of connected stones that circles the torus (either horizontally, vertically, or both horizontally and vertically) and connects back to itself.&#10;&#10;A full guide to rules and tactics is here: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/178192/looper-rules-and-tactics&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game-of-6 is an abstract strategy game for two players that can be played on a grid paper sheet, using pens of two different colors. (it's an evolution of classic Connect6). Rules:&#10;1. The player that opens the game places one dot of his/her color in a cell. In all the following moves, each player places consecutevely two dots in any empty cell of the grid.&#10;2. A player that aligns (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) six (or more) of his/her dots wins the game.&#10;3. Each time a player completes a closed polygonal with his/her marks, all the internal cells take that color. A closed polygonal is any closed path connecting dots of the same color, each adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally to next one&#10;4. The grid cells, once colored, are blocked. They cannot change their color even when they are enclosed in a new polygonal of the opposite color and do not take part to any alignment of dots. If a move generates both a closed polygonal and a winning alignment, the latter is prevailing and the game is over.&#10;4.2. A player turn is made of two separate moves: if the first one closes a polygonal, the internal cells must be colored before the second move is performed.&#10;4.3. A player can always enlarge an existing polygonal by adding new dots &#10;5. A player that colors six (or more) cells wins the game. It's not necessary that the six cells are enclosed by the same polygonal: the winning number can be made adding up spatially separated colored cells.&#10;When the game is over, the winner gains six points and the loser one point for each cell he/she was able to color.&#10;A match is composed by six games, to be started alternately by the players. The winner of the match is the player with the most game victories, and in case of a tie, the one who scored the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to acquire certain combinations of board properties or to break your opponent(s) either with your skillful play at the Two Card Poker table or by charging outrageous rents when they visit your gambling establishments.

In each round one player flips single tile, while other players don't look. Then, the others have to guess the flipped tavern segment.

With enough clues the real Twardowski can be selected from the suspects list. The game ends when one of the players is sure he can catch the wizard.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;Introduction&#10;Monopoly: The Materials Edition was developed by PhD students from the Advanced Metallic Systems Centre for Doctoral Training. The students developed the game as part of a public engagement project which aims to raise awareness of materials science and engineering and engage people with the world of metallurgy.&#10;&#10;From the rear of the box:&#10;The game is played just like traditional Monopoly but instead of purchasing property, players buy different materials as they travel around the board. Materials including metals, ceramics, polymers and composites all feature in the game. Investing in research and development enables you to buy labs and research centres to upgrade your material to a more advanced technology, for example turning steel from paperclips into skyscrapers!&#10;The property cards provide a brief description of the technology. Those with red backs are aimed at upper GCSE and A-Level students and the blue cards use simpler language for younger students (~KS3).&#10;&#10;PROPERTIES&#10;BROWN (naturals)&#10;Wood / Rubber&#10;LIGHT BLUE (polymers)&#10;Thermoplastic / Thermoset / Biodegradable&#10;PINK (ceramics)&#10;Chalk / Clay / Sand&#10;ORANGE (Steels)&#10;Plain Carbon / Stainless / Speciality&#10;RED (Light Metals)&#10;Aluminium / Magnesium / Titanium&#10;YELLOW (base Metals)&#10;Zinc / Copper / Nickel&#10;GREEN (composites)&#10;Ceramic / Polymer / Metal Matrix&#10;DARK BLUE (premium)&#10;Uranium / Platinum&#10;STATIONS&#10;Recycling Station / Manufacturing Station / Processing Station / Extraction Station&#10;UTILITIES&#10;Water Works / Electricity Company&#10;TAXES&#10;Income Tax / Super Tax&#10;&#10;",

It does not repeat the extensive historical or bibliographic information already found in 1870, however.&#10;&#10;Each well-researched scenario includes complete orders of battle, historical notes, map, and alternative scenarios; they range in size from relatively modest battles of a couple of divisions to multi-corps debacles.  Well-illustrated with contemporary artwork and terrain board pictures; a one page color quick reference sheet is included.  Approximately 65 pages, spiral-bound, full color.&#10;&#10;",

Stats are compared - dice rolls and boost cards are added. If the defender wins the attack is over, if the attacker wins he has a shot on goal.&#10;&#10;At half time managers can change their tactics and their playing line up before battling out the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;After careful selection of squads and tactics the matches play out quickly with a net full of drama, personality and goals a plenty. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game introduction:&#10;&#10;Orion Cluster is a space wargame in which each player explores and colonises stellar systems and wages war on aliens with other players as opportunity and his skill allow.  The board was designed with seven players in mind, but more or fewer can be accommodated easily.  The spaceships used are severely limited in range and must frequently be serviced in order to remain operational.  Consequently base location dominates considerations of strategy.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;Orion Cluster was designed for long-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and uses a referee to execute planned player turns; it derives several concepts from Diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game board is made up of a hex grid measuring 17 hexes across and 18 hexes down, references by a letter/number system.  In play, the grid is toroidal (movement off one edge enters the opposite edge)  Forty-two hexes are identified as containing numbered stellar systems.&#10;&#10;Turns comprise one half year of operations and primarily are focused on moving units on the grid and spending economic points, which accumulate based on how many star systems are controlled.  Units include Fleet, Coloniser, Fort, Transmitter, and Base types.  Movement is considered simultaneous; turns which end with opposing units in the same hex are resolved by combat with results primarily determined by superior unit numbers (some randomization is used in certain situations).&#10;&#10;Alliances between players may be formed and violated at each players' discretion.  A player wins the game by controlling 60% of the entire economic value of the game at the end of any turn.&#10;&#10;Orion Cluster was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 54 - Jun 1979).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Be whoever you want to be...without knowing who you are!&#10;&#10;Get followers and socialize in this crazy offline social network for Alter Egos.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple. You have 200* characters on board, insane and hilarious, some of them explicit. The idea is that all of the players are part of a social network for Alter Egos, where everybody can be whoever they want to be. However, there is a catch - you don't know what your profile image looks like, so when you describe your Alter Ego story it will probably sound crazy and a lot more fun to all other players (because they can see your profile image).&#10;&#10;When presenting your Alter Ego story be creative, present your &quot;self&quot; in the most fun way you can and tell everybody what kind of person you are looking for. Then all other players will choose a card from their hands and will suggest a match to your Alter Ego story. You will be the one to choose your friend, soulmate, drinking buddy, partner in crime or a date!&#10;&#10;The main objective of the game is to collect as much winning tokens as you can. The one with most tokens wins the game, because more people have liked his or her Alter Egos.&#10;&#10;Wait! You can win the game instantly even in the first turn!&#10;Each card has a different colored symbol at the top left corner. Each card has a perfect match card with the same color symbol somewhere in the deck.&#10;When the cards are presented to the Alter Ego and he picks the winning card, if this card has a symbol matching the symbol of the Alter Ego's card, the owner of the selected card wins the game automatically. No matter which round of the game it is!&#10;&#10;*We have designed 180 characters, the other 20 will be suggested by our backers. We will choose the best ones and will include them in the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary&#10;DICE WIDE SHUT is a roll-and-write game that includes erasable markers and game boards. Try to fill the columns with checkmarks to score without bursting any rows!&#10;&#10;In this game for 2-5 players, you'll use 3-6 red dice and 3-6 blue dice along with a single purple die no matter the player count. Each player has their own erasable game board with a red grid of dice faces at the top of it (with the red faces reading 1-5 as you go across a row) and a blue grid of dice faces at the bottom (with the blue faces reading 1-5 as you go down a column). On the right-hand side of each grid is a column of 6s; the 6s are grayed out and not considered to be part of the red or blue grid.&#10;&#10;To start a round, one player rolls the dice. The starting player then chooses either red or blue, then chooses two dice numbered 1-5 or a single die numbered six in the named color. The purple die can be picked up whether you choose red or blue. After you take the die or dice, you check off empty die faces in that half of your player board that match the numbers taken. One exception: When you take a 6, you can check off a 6 in either the top or bottom of your board.&#10;&#10;If you create a row of five horizontal checkmarks in the red or blue grid, then you must place a line through all of these checked die faces. Boom! Bad news! If, however, you have a checked 6 in that same row, you can choose to cross out the checkmark instead of placing the final check in the row and blowing it up.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice have been claimed, then the next player in clockwise order from the starting player becomes the new starting player and begins a new round. As soon as one player has three filled columns in either the red or the blue grid, each other player takes one final turn (assuming enough dice remain), then the game ends. Players then score points for each column depending on the number of continuous check marks in that column; three separate checkmarks in a column in the red grid is worth 3 points (1 point for each check) while three continuous checkmarks is worth 6 points. An empty space or a crossed-out line breaks the continuity. Whoever has the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;DICE WIDE SHUT is a dice game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you have two 5x5 squeare grids. Each round, the first player rolls certain number of dice. During your turn, you take one or two of them. For each die taken, you check a space of the same number of pips in one of your square grids.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you score points according to how long vertical lines of coninuous checks you made in your grids. However, if you were forced to complete a horizontal line of five checks, all vertical lines on that grid are considered to be split by the horizontal line, resulting fewer points scored.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, but because of the split-line rule, sometimes you will find it difficult to make decisions.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;DICE WIDE SHUT&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;(1)&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#129;(2)&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#229;&#136;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#231;&#174;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#184;&#166;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#231;&#182;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#168;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#139;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#152;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#150;&#145;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#138;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#174;&#185;&#230;&#152;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

The operations are principally naval and give the Persian army the opportunity to intervene directly. Hellespont uses the great mechanisms of the series with some adjustments necessary for its specific scale&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Game scale : One strength point (SP) represents, according to the type of units, 1 trireme, 100 cavaliers, 150 hoplites, 200 peltasts and acontistes (light infantry) or 250 archers and rebels.&#10;One game turn represents one months of real time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game introduction:&#10;&#10;Head to Head Soccer is a game played with cards and two dice.  A schematic board may be used as well.  Using the cards, players manipulate the position of the ball on the playing field and attempt to shoot at the opponent's goal.  Dice determine the outcome of shots, corner kicks, free kicks, and so on.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;Head to Head Soccer was designed to support in-person as well as postal play (play-by-mail).  The time noted here (30 - 40 minutes) assumes in-person play by experienced players.&#10;&#10;The board is presented as a schematic to visual play but need not be used as an actual play surface.  It is divided into the familiar zones of soccer with letter designations for the zones.  The game is played between two players who alternate taking turns.&#10;&#10;Players begin by drawing eight cards from a standard pack of French playing cards; three cards are revealed and five are held.  Cards may be played from the hand or from the tabled three.  Not all game actions require a card play, but played cards move to the discard.  Cards determine what types of passes, defensive plays, fouls, and shots may be attempted - the correct card must be available to make the desired move.  A series of tables enumerates which card values, or greater, must be played to attempt various moves in or from various zones.  Because some cards are visible to the opponent, some candidate plays also are known.  Each player's hidden cards, however, complicate planning and anticipating.&#10;&#10;A few specific actions - for example, making a corner kick - are determined by die throw rather than cards.  This method prevents &quot;certain&quot; scoring in various situations, replacing a card play with an element of chance.&#10;&#10;Head to Head Soccer was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 69 - Nov 1980).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game introduction:&#10;&#10;Fantastic Quest is a game for two players, one acting as the &quot;evil&quot; guardians of a treasure, the other as a group of heroes and wizards seeking this treasure (the &quot;explorers&quot;).  Both players record the location of their forces on a square grid (such as graph paper), using paper and pencil.  The explorer player searches the area by moving and calling out the position of his men, and by using magic spells.&#10;&#10;The guardian, with limited ability to move, attempts to kill the searchers or at least prevent them for as long as possible from finding the treasure.  When an exploring hero or wizard occupies the same square as a guardian monster, a die is rolled to determine which is killed.&#10;&#10;Turns alternate until the treasure is captured or, rarely, all explorers are dead.  Usually two games will be played at the same time, with players alternating roles, and the winner of the match will be the first player to succeed in his explorer role.&#10;&#10;Including set-up time, one play lasts no more than half an hour.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;The board is a simple 10 x 10 grid with rows enumerated by letters A - J and columns enumerated with numbers 1 - 10.  The board is not actually used as a play surface, and each player may maintain their own annotated grid.  Turns are played simultaneously, with each player secretly noting moves and then openly executing them in a determined order of precedence.  Most &quot;units&quot; move and occasionally engage in conflict with opposing units - however, wizard units may cast a variety of spells that perform specific, unique functions.  A few of the guardian units also have special abilities.&#10;&#10;The explorer player wins by finding the treasure and moving a unit to it; the guardian player wins by destroying the explorer's units.  If two simultaneous games are played, the player who first finds and reaches the opponent's treasure wins both games.&#10;&#10;The game includes a few optional rules that complicate play but allow for more unit flexibility.  A method also is presented that allows for play without dice by combining random numbers selected by each player - this method also is suitable for postal play (play-by-mail).&#10;&#10;Fantastic Quest was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 73 - Mar 1981).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hercules Cluster is simple, multi-player, designed specifically for postal play, including as one of the characteristics a low number of turns.&#10;&#10;The board represents a sector of the galaxy which is peopled by six distinct races each of which has developed its own form of space travel.  Each race has already spread across three star systems and is currently poised to continue its expansion into the remaining neutral systems.&#10;&#10;Movement is simultaneous and hidden.  A [referee] is needed to run the game.  Each turn players will receive reports on the occupants of any hex in which the player has units or systems.  Builds of new units are ordered at the same time as moves, but occur before moves.  Units may be used on the same turn they are built.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;The board is a hex-shaped grid of offset squares, measuring 13 x 13 at the widest and tallest.  Players start around the edge of the board with vacant/neutral systems concentrated in the center, forcing play to proceed inward and leading rapidly to conflict.  The initial setup is known to all players.&#10;&#10;One player wins by gaining control of a majority of neutral systems.  However, each game has an unknown, randomly determined turn limit (13 - 17) which usually occurs before complete player victory - the leading player at the end of the last turn is declared the winner; ties are possible.  Each turn provides a number of points for unit building based upon the number of systems under control.  The game presents a wide variety of unit types, selectable by the owning player and limited by cost.&#10;&#10;The game was designed for short-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and requires a referee to execute the programmed player turns.  Hercules Cluster was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 78 - Aug 1981).&#10;&#10;",

A single player may play as Nature, influencing the weather, wildlife, and special events that the other players must endure throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The Great Wide Open is an Asymmetrical Competitive and Cooperative Survive and Escape board game. &#10;Each passing day is an opportunity for Nature to shift the environment that the Survivors attempt to progress in. Survivors will explore and discover resources, items, and special events allowing each game to form its own story. Triggered by in-game events, a Salvation Card will be drawn that describes how the Survivors can get back home. If the Survivors can fulfill the requirements of the card, the game is won. If they die in the progress, Nature prevails.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A card is set aside, such as the rear half of the bulldog, shares and plays according to the known rules of &quot;Black Peter&quot;. Matching front and rear halves can be stored. Whoever keeps the head of the bulldog as the last card, gets the name of the animal.&#10;2. Players are dealt with the cards that are placed face up on the table. The player sitting to the left of the dealer may now begin to trade. He asks a player who has an animal half that he wants to own, whether he gives it to him, and which card he wants instead of him. The interviewee is now allowed to trade with another player. If someone does not want to trade anymore, because he can not get anything suitable, his left neighbor can continue. It is exchanged until nobody wants to exchange more. The aim of the game is not to collect the animal halves, but to invent as fantastic as possible new species of animals. At the end it will be decided who has put together the most beautiful animal and which name it should receive.&#10;3. Of course, you can also set up new adventurous species on your own. Bull Medar and Naspferd, Papafant and Warzengei, Antibarsch and Nilguruh, and many others. By the way, 484 different animal combinations are possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is unusually complex for a 19th Century educational and set-collection game. Its 40 cards are individually numbered (in historical order) and grouped in sets of four. Each card has a date at the top, a title name and date, and then three events, the first political and the other two marks of &quot;social progress&quot;, each with its own date. The date at the top is the mean or average date of the three events on the card.&#10;&#10;The rules provide for four variations: Historian; Biographer; Librarian; and Steps of Progress. In each case, the deck is fully dealt out to the players. The player to the left of the dealer chooses one card from his hand, and reads out part of its content. Depending on the variation, this could be the name at the top and/or one or more events.&#10;&#10;The other players in turn submit one of their cards face down, aiming to have the date at its top as close as possible to the mean date of the card read. The player who submits the card closest to the target card's date collects all the cards, and players who were off by more than 100 years pay an extra penalty card. If everyone misses by 100 years or more, the card's reader collects them all. The winner of the game is generally the first to accumulate 20 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;One variation involves an additional set of &quot;group cards&quot;, which show the four individuals in each of the ten groups. In this version, one player acts as &quot;umpire&quot; who keeps the deck reads to the group the mean date and three events of one card at a time. The rest of the players, using the &quot;group cards&quot;, write down a name they believe closest in time to the mean date. The closest guess wins all the cards named from the deck.&#10;&#10;",

Can we do that? With me possibly getting slightly more than half? After all, when the mountain of sweets has run out, whoever has the most sweets wins!&#10;&#10;In &#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#183;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#143;&#173;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#232;&#153;&#142; (That Man, Going Halfsies), players start with a deck of 76 cards, with the values ranging from 0-8, along with a few 11s, and with the numbers 2-4 appearing most frequently. Shuffle the deck, then place ten cards on the bottom of the deck at a 90&ordm; angle from the other cards.&#10;&#10;For the first turn, the active player (&quot;elder brother&quot;) reveals the top card to all players, then takes that card in hand along with three other cards. The elder brother then splits the cards into two face-down piles, offering one pile to a younger brother (the player on the left) and keeping the other pile. If younger brother accepts the split, the elder brother places their cards aside in a scoring pile, then the younger brother takes their pile into their hand, draws cards to fill their hand to four, then becomes the elder brother and offers a split with the brother on their left.&#10;&#10;If the younger brother doesn't accept the split, then reveal the cards in the two piles. If the elder brother kept the larger share for himself, then you get to split that elder brother's share in half, discarding the larger half (if you can't split it evenly) to punish him for being unfair. If the elder brother's share was only a single card, then discard that card.&#10;&#10;If, however, the elder brother had split the pile evenly or favored the younger brother, then the younger brother's pile is split in half or discarded as punishment as described above. The elder brother keeps their share, then retains their role as elder brother, with the next player in clockwise order taking the role of younger brother. The elder brother reveals the top card, etc.&#10;&#10;When you start drawing from the ten cards that had been turned 90&ordm;, continue play until the player to the right of the first elder brother has either received a share in the role of elder brother, or doubted what was given to them, then resolved that situation. Everyone then tallies their points to see who collected the most sweets!&#10;&#10;",

Assassins, tricksters, and temptresses may appear to thwart your plans.&#10;&#10;If you play a lot of chess, Randy can freshen the game with it's new spin. If people of two very different skill levels are playing chess, Randy can level the playing field and make the game exciting for all players. If you never liked chess, maybe... just maybe... you'll like RANDOM COPING CHESS!!!&#10;&#10;Random elements are added to the game when cards are drawn. Cards are not played by individual players - rather, a player rolls a die before each turn. If the die comes up a 1, a card is drawn. The card describes the elements that are added to the game, changing the rules of the game as it is played.&#10;&#10;",

From a distance and at any point in time, Dunestar appears like a mirage-like shimmering beacon, a symbol of hope as much as it is an easy-to-find target for the Blight.&#10;&#10;Speaking of the Blight, it manifests itself more visibly in Dunestar than in Aegis through black tendrils that can spread to all things, living or not, and the surrounding sands are now the tomb of many a warrior who have chosen to brave their fear and take the fight to the darkness itself.&#10;&#10;The Locations of Dunestar are fully compatible with those of Aegis: this means you can mix and match Locations from Sands of Dunestar with those present in the Guildmaster and Agent sets; of course you can also play a setup with only Dunestar Locations.&#10;&#10;There are no new core game rules in the expansion but each Location and Advancement adds their own twists and new mechanics to Edge of Darkness.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes the shaft of a shovel, hoe or similar hardware-store implement is used, which makes a thicker, heavier bat. The only other item needed to play is a ball. In my youth stickball was played with many types of balls &ndash;- tennis balls, &ldquo;pinky&rdquo; balls, &ldquo;pimple&rdquo; balls, &ldquo;pimple-star&rdquo; balls and sponge balls. Sponges lasted the longest.&#10;&#10;Then there was the field, which could be anywhere. Most of the time it was a place with a wall where no one lived. A schoolyard was usually the best location, but not always. A box was chalked onto the wall representing the strike zone. If a pitch hit inside the line or on it, a strike was called. Due to his vantage point the pitcher often called balls and strikes, and arguments were common. A fly ball or liner that went different distances yielded singles, doubles, triples and home runs. There were no bases to run. Baserunners were simply tracked inside everyone&rsquo;s heads. Foul territory was decided beforehand.&#10;&#10;Any number of kids can play stickball, but it&rsquo;s usually two or three per side. In the driveways of city blocks a white, hollow plastic ball with a hemisphere of slots was commonly used, to prevent broken windows. Neighbors still complained, though, when it rattled their windows during dinner hour. In this version balls and strikes weren&rsquo;t called. You got one swing per at-bat (and could wait for &quot;your&quot; pitch), although it typically took two fouls to make an out. Two to four players would commonly face each other in &ldquo;backyard&rdquo; stickball.&#10;&#10;In Big Time Stickball, two players face each other in a streamlined version of the pastime. Nine innings are played just as in baseball, with the players alternating in the roles of pitcher and batter.&#10;&#10;First, the pitcher chooses one of five pitches to throw: fastball, curve, screwball, riser or sinker. Then the batter tries to anticipate what the pitch will be, and commits his swing to it. He can choose to swing normally or for the fences. A card is drawn from the game's 70 result cards, and the pitch and swing cross-checked to determine the result of the at-bat.&#10;&#10;If the batter correctly anticipates the pitch he has a great chance of a hit. Conversely, if the batter looks for a riser and the pitcher throws a sinker, his chances for a hit are slim and his strikeout chances are greater. An optional rule allows the batter to &quot;take&quot; pitches and try for a walk. House rules are easy to implement, enabling players to customize the game as they wish. Batter up!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Wunderkammer you take on the role of a Collector on the hunt for strange and exotic items to populate your Cabinet of Curiosities.&#10;&#10;You will compete in seven rounds of auctions, trying to procure rare and unusual pieces like marvelous mechanisms, bizarre artifacts and eerie medical oddities.&#10;&#10;Setup of the game is relatively quick and straightforward. First, each player is dealt an equal number of Money Cards, of which there are four denominations. Then a deck of Item Cards is placed in the middle of the table, within everyone's reach. Points Tokens, Priority Tokens and the Dealer Token are placed near the Item Deck as well.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of four Phases:&#10;&#10;1. Evaluation Phase&#10;A number of Item Cards equal to the number of players are turned over. During this phase players assess the value of the cards relative to how it can earn points for their personal set of Item Cards, called the Cabinet.&#10;&#10;2. Auction Phase (auction mechanic)&#10;During the Auction Phase, players will use their Money Cards to make bids to acquire one Item Card for their Cabinet. However, in this style of auction, players don't declare a bid on a specific Item Card, rather they bid to win the highest 'Priority' among their competitors. Priority is the order in which each player chooses an Item Card in the next Phase. This means that a player cannot be entirely certain what card their opponents are trying to obtain.&#10;&#10;Starting with the Dealer of that round, each player takes a turn to either bid or pass. If they bid, then they will place an amount of money greater than the last player's bid on the table.&#10;&#10;If the player instead chooses to pass, they may not participate for the rest of that round's auction.&#10;&#10;Passing is actually what determines Priority for the round: the first player to pass in the Auction Phase will be the last player to choose an Item Card during the Curation Phase. The second player to pass will be the second last to choose a card, and so forth. Priority tokens help keep track of this order.&#10;&#10;When all of the players but one have passed, the Round will transition to the Curation Phase.&#10;&#10;3. Curation (Tile Mechanic)&#10;In the Curation Phase, each player will choose one of the Item Cards in order of Priority, as determined in the Auction Phase. When all of the players have chosen a card, they will add it to their Cabinet by placing it on either the leftmost or rightmost end of the series (in the case of the first round, they will simply place the card in front of them). Item Cards are never placed above, below other cards in the Cabinet. Furthermore, once placed in the set, cards may not be moved or rearranged in any way.&#10;&#10;In order to earn points, a newly placed Item Card must share one or more Category icons with its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category between adjoining cards, one point is earned.&#10;&#10;4. Appraisal Phase&#10;In the Appraisal Phase, players will count the number of categories shared between the newly added Item Card and its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category, a point is earned; the player will then take an appropriate number of Point Tokens and place them between the two cards to track score.&#10;&#10;After the Appraisal Phase has ended a new round begins (unless it was the seventh round, see below). The player that won the highest Priority in the last round becomes the Dealer for the new round (and receives the Dealer Token).&#10;&#10;After the seventh round the game ends, and players add up all of the Point Tokens in their Cabinet. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Z Gate Crashers is a 1 to 5 player monster hunting adventure (card game), where the goal is to survive an onslaught of invading monsters. Using various combinations of weapons and bonuses, players try to dispatch the monsters.&#10;You and up to 4 friends are a band of mercenary monster hunters. Your job is to contain the evil abominations that come crawling out of large filthy stinking holes in the ground.&#10;&#10;You and your team are deployed behind protective energy units called GATEs.&#10;These GATEs are powered by a new energy source that&rsquo;s harvested from killing the nasty monsters, called Soulbits.&#10;Soulbits are your lifeblood and your currency. You use them to keep your GATE energized, and you protected from attack.&#10;You can also trade in the soulbits you earn, for more weapons and bonus cards, to help you defeat even more nasties.&#10;&#10;The object is simple, you&rsquo;ve got to survive.&#10;But more than mere survive, a successful GATEr needs to thrive by harvesting as many soulbits as possible.&#10;The Player with the most soulbits at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all of the players or all of the monsters are dead.&#10;&#10;Monsters are distributed in Wave cards, that show the different types, distributions, and amounts of each invading wave of monsters.&#10;During their turn, each player draws a wave card, and using monster cards and monster-life tokens, they line each up to create the monster attack track.&#10;&#10;Monsters typically emerge at the hole and during initiative, take a varied number of steps to get closer to the gate and do damage.&#10;&#10;The player (typically) has first-attack initiative. Using acquired weapons and bonus cards, in various stacked, chained, offensive, and defensive combinations; the player tries to kill as many nasties as possible and collect those soulbits.&#10;&#10;The monsters next get their move and attack actions, using initiative tokens.&#10;An initiative token is placed under the monster card that will next act.&#10;The initiative token (typically) moves sequentially down the track (and back around), with monsters getting 4 such actions in a &ldquo;Normal Difficulty&rdquo; game. The location and move-direction of the initiative token along the monster track can be altered based on certain Wave Cards.&#10;&#10;When a monster card has initiative, all monsters on that card get to move (one step closer to the gate) and then if able, attack. &#10;All monsters attack when at the gate but do so in a variety of different ways and with differing effects.&#10;The player rolls to save against an attacking monster. A successful roll gains the player a bonus soulbit, but a failed roll will incur (sometimes cumulative) damage to the gate. &#10;During initiative, some monsters also get a bonus attack that they take regardless of their distance from the gate.&#10;&#10;If a player survives, play moves on to the next player to see how they do.&#10;A recovery session is granted at the end of each round, allowing players a chance to buy more loot, recover from various effects, and trade with other players.&#10;&#10;Game difficulty and experience are controlled in the distribution of wave cards, allowing for highly dynamic and varied gameplay.&#10;When wave cards run out, play continues in the same order until either all players or all monsters are dead.&#10;The player with the most soulbits, at the end, wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

He also skillfully wields the Naginata favoured in the North, rather than the Yari; which is standard issue in Ryu. A life long soldier, Hiryu is a firm believer in rank and file fighting. He understands the ebb and flow of the line and is at his best in battle when fighting shoulder to shoulder with his fellow Ashigaru.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
