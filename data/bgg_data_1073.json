    "Description": "A fast-paced card game about the consequences of the choices we make. Your goal is to run a successful and sustainable business, sourcing palm oil products for supermarkets. Palm oil can be found in 50% of packaged goods on your supermarket&rsquo;s shelves, often with devastating consequences for the environment. Build the reputation of your brand by bringing more responsible products to market, reinvesting your profits wisely, and winning awards to edge out the competition and emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you'll have to outbid your competitors to control the sources of palm oil most valuable to your market. Match Source Cards to Product Cards in order to sell - hopefully for a profit. Each round plays differently, with various regulations and consumer trends to account for, and different awards up for grabs. At the end of the game, the player with the best Reputation from awards and profit will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;What if we really cared how our products are sourced? Would supermarkets, with all the power they have, start to behave differently? From farmer to consumer, Tradejack provides an overview of the supply chains that bring products into our homes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A print and play WW2 wargame for two players and solitaire that takes around half an hour to setup and play.&#10;&#10;The game sets a small squad of British Airborne against their German enemies in a series of small skirmish scenarios. The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.&#10;&#10;The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the British Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the British Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).&#10;&#10;The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.&#10;&#10;The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. &#10;Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.&#10;Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.&#10;&#10;Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points. These can be used to force the enemy to re-roll a dice against one of your Infantry Counters, but should you loose you will have less Bravery Points for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Solitaire Game&#10;The Solitaire takes the key gameplay from the two player game such as Combat Resolution and Movement etc and layers in specific Solitaire rules, AI for the opposing German forces and special Solitaire scenarios.&#10;&#10;The Solitaire game features a full and simple AI to handle the opposing force, that will take you step-by-step to which order the enemy counters should be activated and their actions.&#10;&#10;",

Each special calculation created by the two adjacent sides of the Tiles following the gameplay rules either adds or subtracts a certain amount of points to your Game Score.

It can also be played without, which requires more thinking because of the many possibilities present in any given moment during gameplay. Therefore it is recommended to use the Play Field Elements until a player becomes strategically aware of the many possibilities the game has to offer.&#10;&#10;Research in neuroscience, human behavior and interaction and music didactics has been conducted in order to construct the methods and mechanisms behind Aromat. It contains beneficial aspects in terms of brain training and musicality training, which are achieved in a fun and engaging way.&#10;&#10;Aromat is a collectible game that starts out with the &quot;Basic Set&quot; and expands through a system of &quot;Extension Sets&quot;'&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game of time and space, where quantum mechanics decides the cards you are dealt, but you decide the outcome. You now have the chance to craft powerful machines, use wondrous items and collect valuable treasures and artifacts.&#10;&#10;The game can be enjoyed by both newcomers and veterans, and although it can be easy to learn, it can be tricky to master. Amassing the most points by the end of the game determines the winner. Timing and the choices you make can be the difference between a winning and losing strategy. Every turn is a chance to snatch victory from your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is themed in a steampunk setting with elements of futuristic to implausible designs. A quick-paced tactical card game for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Simple Game&#10;Dark War uses a simple system, based on a single rule. Anytime you role a 4 or greater you get a success. That success might mean you pump two AK-47 rounds into a werewolf, or that your nurse heals a team member, or a witch gains control of a weak-minded soldier, forcing him to fire on his comrade. What varies are the dice that you use. When building your own character, you assign a fixed number of dice (4 x D4, 3 x D6, 2 x D8) to seven attributes--Shooting, Melee, Speed, Intelligence, Charm, Will, and Dodge-- to determine what type of individual you control. The more dice and the better the dice assigned to an attribute, the greater chance you have or rolling successes. But the customization doesn't end there. You can use experience points to buy Kickers, such as &quot;Rifles,&quot; which adds an extra D6 when firing a rifle or &quot;Power of Prayer&quot; that allows a character to heal a teammate within two squares. Two many options? Just choose a group of pre-generated characters from the bestiary, slap them on the provided map, and have at it. Or, if you prefer, you can fight out one of the three, included skirmishes&#10;&#10;Obviously attributes such as Charm and Intelligence can be put to great use when roleplaying, but Dark War's unique Action Cards ensure they are relevant even when fighting a quick skirmish.  For example, when an opponent activates a character you can slap the Fear Action Card on them, forcing them to pass an Intelligence test or lose all their actions. Other Action Cards can reload a weapon, add a die to melee, or even heal a wound.&#10;&#10;When the fighting breaks out, characters determine initiative by rolling a combination of their Speed and Intelligence dice. The total determines when they act (higher is better, obviously) the number of successes determines how many Actions they have. Simple, fluid, and highly interactive.&#10;&#10;Many RPGs say &quot;Here are the rules, now go buy your own stuff to play with.&quot; Dark War is different. In each game you get the core rule book, 18 Action Cards, a 17&quot; x 22&quot; battle map depicting a West German village, and 70 1&quot; square counters that include Russian and American soldiers, civilians, werewolves, vampires, witches, dead folks, zombies, and more. Better still we include a handful of stands, enabling the counters to functions as standees. It's like having your own set of Dark War minis. Furthermore, the rules include three ready-to-play skirmish scenarios (In the Beginning, Stranger Things, My Enemies' Friend) and a beginning-level, one to two session adventure titled, The Escape, complete with generated characters.  When we say &quot;Ready to play,&quot; we mean it.&#10;&#10;It's a small unit skirmish game, it's a roleplaying game, it's straight-up fighting or weird war combat. It's whatever you make it. It's the Dark War Roleplaying game.&#10;&#10;Frequently Asked Questions&#10;Can I play the skirmish game solitaire? Sure, you just have to play each side to the best of your ability.&#10;Can I use my own miniatures? Of course you can. You can use your own minis, terrain you have made, 1&quot; square battle maps that you have bought, or even hex maps. Nothing in the game precludes that. The difference in Dark War and many RPGs is that you aren't REQUIRED to buy that. We give you everything that you need.&#10;&#10;",

Pierre-Paul Riquet is tasked with coordinating this gigantic building project but he needs your help.&#10;&#10;In the shoes of one of his engineers, you mission is to build as many sections of the Canal as you can, using available resources the best way possible. Players compete to measure the manpower necessary for each section and earn recognition from Pierre-Paul Riquet. But sudden reinforcements could change the game!&#10;&#10;When the Canal du Midi is finished, the player with the most recognition points for the sections they helped build has won the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;Canal du Midi is a quick game played over 9 rounds in about 15 minutes. Players have 9 worker cards, representing varying amounts of manpower. Three of these cards are taken up into their hand, three are open on the table in front of them, and the remaining three form their draw deck. They also get 2 coins.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a single section of the canal is revealed that is to be build this turn, and players bid a secret amount of manpower to help complete the section by playing one of the cards from their hand. If the total amount of manpower is enough to complete the section (i.e. beats the target set by the card), the player(s) who bid the most receive recognition points. However, before the section is awarded, all players get the opportunity to spend one of their coins to call up reinforcements. After players have decided whether or not to do so, each player spending a coin may draw a random card from the discard pile, and add the manpower on the card to their bid.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, players draw a new card to bring their hand size back to 3 (if possible). They can draw either the top card of their drawing deck (blind), or one of the 3 open cards (which will get replaced by the top card of the deck). Play continues until all 9 sections have been built (or at least started, if the manpower fell short), and players have played all of their cards. Whoever has the most recognition points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Many hundred years ago, in the country across the sea and mountains lived an ancient eastern nation. They were ruled by cordial and gracious Emperor who was the main reason of their stable and peaceful existence. To proceed the Emperor&rsquo;s graceful time people believed in him and served him. On the other hand, the Emperor had many foxy enemies. One day, the emperor received an invitation to the marriage ceremony. Betrayers immediately took advantage of the situation, attacked the emperor with poisonous liquids and killed him. The Emperor has gone. Your day is now to make your mark on Eastern History! A man leaves behind marks that associate his name with symbol of either admiration or hatred.&#10;&#10;Number of players: The design of this mystic game based on Eastern History where 1-6 players act as heir to the throne. Those that were not frightened showed courage and determination and reshape the history of the East.&#10;&#10;Time required: A single game takes approximately 15-20 minutes per player. Eastern Mystery is a well-ordered, complex and smooth game. In other words, the game is intuitive and simple enough for new gamers to be able to jump right in with plenty of tasks to complete. Additionally. By giving in the player becomes an underdog, and hunts down his fellow players.&#10;The board shows an ancient carpet with original eastern features and players take turns rolling dice on 18x6 grid to conquer six different thrones.&#10;Six different Characters, particularly different Tiles and their relationships define the game as a rule-based system specifying what there is, how the player can interact with them. Points are awarded for collecting sets of thrones, and in the end of final set the player with the most points becomes the winner. &#10;Eastern Mystery uses simple rules, but involves various tasks such as &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; &ldquo;Flying carpet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jinnee&rdquo; our famous figure: which is very curious about all and interested in your curiosity as well! The more you play the more nuances you will discover. The player who gains the maximum number of thrones in the end will be crowned as the winner! &#10;Prove your worth in an intense duel against an intricate game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rack Patrol is a solitaire, tactical-level, card-driven submarine war game. You take on the the command role of a single Gato-class submarine during WWII, on the hunt for Japanese targets in the Pacific.&#10;&#10;The game is entirely card-driven. The operation cards are held in your hand or set on the table as a draw deck. You will be instructed frequently to draw a card from the operation deck in order to determine the outcome of a given action or to gain other information. You earn victory points at the end of a patrol based on the ships you have sunk during that patrol.&#10;&#10;A single patrol (round) only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, due to the round/patrol-based structure, and because every patrol is an independent session of play, you can easily play longer, campaign-style games across multiple sittings. The game can be entirely packed up and put away between patrols. Simply record your running score at the end of any patrol and resume the game later.&#10;&#10;There are many great submarine games out there already; what makes Rack Patrol unique is its size and portability. The entire game is played with a single deck of cards and one small player board. It takes up extremely little surface space. In fact, you could play the whole game while laying in your rack, whether that means you're aboard a submarine, or your sleeping partner already rolled over and knocked out, and you still want to get some gaming in.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Japanese attack on the Island of West Timor, in the Dutch East Indies, was anticipated by the Allies as early as late December 1941. Soon after the start of the war, Sparrow Force, comprised mostly of Australian troops as well as some from the Dutch East Indies and Great Britain, occupied West Timor and began preparing defensive works.  This would allow a defensive island fortress between the expanding Japanese Empire and Australia.&#10;&#10;To assault and secure the island, especially the airfield at Penful, the Japanese planned an amphibious assault supported by an ambitious paratrooper air-assault by the 1st and 3rd SNLF (Special Naval Landing Force) Battalions. The resulting fight for West Timor resulted in a confused and bitterly fought battle that ultimately resulted in the destruction and capture of the majority of Sparrow Force, one of the largest and most tragic defeats in Australia&rsquo;s military history. The Japanese paratrooper force was also savaged in the fighting, with nearly half of their number killed, seriously wounded, or missing. Those surviving paratroopers were dispersed throughout the Pacific in different commands and never performed another combat jump in the war.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

    "Description": "Refugees are human beings. The journey doesn&rsquo;t end with arrival in a new country. This educational tool explores themes of belonging, identity, discrimination and culture in a hands-on experiential way.&#10;&#10;Refugee Journeys is based on a simple &quot;snakes and ladders&quot; game concept - players move forward, backward, or miss turns based on the cards they draw or the spaces they land on. Cards include integration experiences of real refugees, drawn from academic research, news and media, and the game creator's personal experiences. Examples are: &quot;You are 65 years old. You want to learn English, but the topic is always about finding a job. Move back a space.&quot; &quot;You were sponsored to a rural area, where there is no bus transportation. You always have to ask for rides. Move back two spaces.&quot; &quot;Your child has made a friend at school. Move forward a space.&quot; Players move through the game using an &quot;Identity card&quot; which details their country of origin, family background, housing situation, gender, and many other identity markers. As they move through the game, their identity influences the path they take. For example, one space on the board says, &quot;Are you Muslim? Move back 2 spaces.&quot; The game critically highlights experiences of discrimination and profiling.&#10;&#10;While the goal of Refugee Journeys is for players to move from the &quot;start&quot; to the &quot;finish,&quot; the real purpose of the game is to establish a space for critical conversations about refugee experiences, integration, and the intersectionality of identity. To this end, after every experience card is played, players choose a discussion question from options printed on the board to talk about as a group. The discussion questions cover topics related to identity, injustice, policy, and allow for players to share their personal experiences with the topic.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warblog offers over 500 print and play modern war hex and counter games.&#10;&#10;The game covers 1945 to date period with current wars covered.&#10;&#10;Many of the games offer exceptional replay-ability, whilst some are simply to analysis and learning.&#10;&#10;With over 500 games, there are games to suit most timeframes. You can find small games that might only take 30 minutes to play, but you can play it multiple times, playing for the best of three or best of five. Other games could be described as monster games that will literally take a very long time.&#10;&#10;A key feature of the system is its simplicity. They games are designed for people that have a penchant for moving the counters about and not having to wade through large rule sets. Further, as the games are mostly situational, ie not operational, lines of supply and command are not critical, although some games do offer leader units and there are leader rules. The game has been designed to be failsafe from the ground up. This means you just move the counters about, observing movement allowances and terrain etc, but if you don't understand surround rules or terrain defence effects, its not that important, just play anyway. But if you want to tighten things up, there is a deep set of mechanics, including unit mix/matching, that is gaining a bonus for armour versus infantry stacks with no armour or mechanised etc.&#10;&#10;The game includes all unit types including air and sea units with a wide range of additional units types for air defence, insurgents and irregular activity.&#10;&#10;The scenarios are all historic and players are encouraged to learn their history and to even criticise the orders of battle and terrain arrangements as doing so is only further developing your own historical understanding and helping the War Blog team to help other people similarly.&#10;&#10;The scenarios also encompass current events, so if you have an interest in following world events you can use War Blog to do so.&#10;&#10;Many of the scenarios included are largely unstudied and certainly not common knowledge, and this whole library of scenarios is always on the increase with scenarios being updated with new intelligence and new scenarios added.&#10;&#10;The game is currently under development and the rule set could well branch out to encompass features not covered on the online version which can readily be added to a paper based procedural rule set, for example, hidden movement and political intervention. Further, experienced players are encouraged to add their own rules up.&#10;&#10;Many of the scenarios are unbalanced and there mainly for situational analysis, for example, in a educational environment. However, even in situations where a player might not stand a chance of winning, players can set house scoring based on how long a player could hold out and how they play in comparison to the historical timeline.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If there is a secondhand smoke on that card, other players who fail to smoke will also receive a lung marker. Even though they were not able to smoke, the lungs slowly become black and bring everyone closer to death.&#10;&#10;When only one person is still alive, the game ends and the player who smoked the most cigarettes will win.&#10;&#10;",

You will need to defeat shadows, and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain the precious gold that you need to buy Food for your troops and recruit additional Knights.&#10;&#10;Wizard: you will be working with dwarven miners to gather the finest arcane crystals buried deep in the mountains.  These crystals power you spells but you will also need to kill shadows and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain gold that you need to to hire them.&#10;&#10;Ranger: you will be summoning powerful beasts and scouring the forest and crafting the most perfect arrows to aid you on your quest to defeat the shadows of the spire.

    "Description": "What in the Wild is a game system consisting of a deck of 120 cards and rules for 5 different games. Cards contain plant and animal species and the food, water, shelter, and space they need to survive. Much as with wildlife conservation in the real world, the games of What in the Wild focus on cooperation, collaboration, or side by side competition rather than head to head competition. Each game was designed with children and families in mind, and most have variants that let you ramp up the challenge as players get older and are looking for more strategic gameplay.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Match It! A memory game where you explore the different types of habitat elements and which species use them.&#10;&bull;    Connect It! A cooperative game of map building to construct a resilient ecosystem before time runs out.&#10;&bull;    Slap It! A fast paced race to assemble habitat for as many species as you can.&#10;&bull;    Group It! A push your luck set collection game.&#10;&bull;    Build It! A collaborative game of habitat creation.&#10;&#10;What in the Wild was designed to complement the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division&rsquo;s &ldquo;Go Wild for Michigan&rsquo;s Wildlife&rdquo; curriculum for kindergarten through 5th grade. A core element of the curriculum is introducing students to common wildlife species they may encounter and increasing their understanding and appreciation of these animals. This forms the heart of What in the Wild, and its games put their primary focus on fun, engagement, interaction, humor, and challenge. In a classroom setting, it&rsquo;s a tool for teachers to use to extend student understanding of course content. For a family, the emphasis is on providing fun games that the youngest and oldest members can enjoy together.&#10;&#10;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

And all of that while you are trying to use the force on a piece of paper, with a straight face on.&#10;&#10;After some playing time and a couple of successfully performed challenges you may get cocky, as anyone would, which is usually when other players will use one of their special abilities to put you back in your place! It is not uncommon to get yourself in a situation where you have to perform more than one challenge simultaneously. One second you are trying to be the funniest, the next you are trying not to die of laughter because one of the players decided it was a good idea to call their mom at 3 in the morning to tell her they were arrested!&#10;In this game you are competing to outplay everyone in a creative way and be the funniest, bravest and most resourceful. Perform the challenges successfully, delegate unwanted challenges tactically, use the active and passive abilities to your advantage and be the first to gather one of the cards of each type and unlock the Final Challenge!&#10;&#10;Players draw a card and reads the challenge out loud.

If children try to pair up dominoes with different values they&rsquo;ll realise immediately.&#10;Thanks to the effective checking system, they can play fractions and decimals dominoes independently, even with the tables they don&rsquo;t know perfectly, without needing the constant supervision of an adult.&#10;Each game is divided into three levels of increasing difficulty and you can choose to play with only the dominoes belonging to the first level, only those from the second or the third level, those form the second and the third level together or the whole pack.&#10;Dominoplay is a fun didactic tool and is ideal for encouraging inclusion: by carefully choosing the groups of dominoes all children can learn and have fun!&#10;&#10;Dominoplay &ndash; Fractions and decimals provides exercises on fractions and decimals, using pictures as well.&#10;&#10;",

For example, if the players know northern Italy very well, central Italy a little but, and southern Italy/islands not at all, all 24 of the northern Italy tiles can be selected, only 8 from the first level of the central Italy group, and none from the southern Italy/islands group, for a total of 32 cards in all.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Weltindor's Stones is a fairly simple game to win, despite it actually being lightly complex. The board is set up with nine platforms, each of which is split into a 3 by 3 grid. The platforms are all set out about 3 inches from each other, and connected by bridges, which are 1 tile long and create choke points. The corners are elevated about 1 inch off the ground, which gives an advantage to the player on them by giving them a higher chance to attack successfully. Each player is given a corner and the board to the left of the corner. The corner itself is named the lead board. On each of that player's platforms, there will be one stone, which can be moved by other players by having three individual units on the same tile as that stone. The overall point is to get 5 stones to your lead board.&#10;&#10;A single turn consists of placing five units and moving them as a group or single unit 5 times. A move can also be spent attacking an adjacent square. Different units have different abilities, such as being able to attack from 2 tiles, or moving 2 tiles at once.&#10;&#10;5 basic soldiers can come together to form a barracks, which essentially acts as a factory allowing extra units to be placed at the beginning of your turn. Barracks have to be hit 5 times to be destroyed. The leftover neutral platform in the middle acts as free land to establish barracks for anyone who can get there.&#10;&#10;Action cards are abilities that cost mana (You get 1 mana at the beginning of your turn.), and can be played whenever they are needed, not specifically on your turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fight by Caesar&rsquo;s side as he wages war for mastery of the Roman World upon battlefields soaked in Roman blood.&#10;Regretfully we cannot tarry, as did Caesar, in the arms of Egypt&rsquo;s beautiful Queen Cleopatra, but we can join him for the concluding battles of the Civil War in Africa, where we shall at last confront Caesar&rsquo;s relentless opponents together with the armies of that inveterate enemy of Rome, King Juba of Numidia.&#10;With this supplement for Hail Caesar we invite you to come, see and conquer for yourself in a series of new scenarios representing key battles in the career of Julius Caesar. We take a detailed look at the armies of Rome and her enemies, and we consider the lives of some of the greatest Roman commanders of them all, together with suitable rules to represent them on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storm in the East: Operation Barbarossa depicts the largest and most dramatic military campaign in recorded history: the German invasion of Soviet Russia. Germany and its allies had almost five million men deployed in three army groups along the 800 miles of the Soviet border. As dawn broke on 22 June 1941, the first Axis formations crossed into the Soviet Union and smashed through units charged with defending the border. Taken completely by surprise, many were captured or killed while asleep in their barracks.  As the dawn bled into a new day, the Luftwaffe bombed airfields in western Russia destroying much of the Soviet air force on the ground, and German bombers attacked cities from Riga in the north to Odessa in the south.&#10; The invasion had achieved a total strategic surprise. At first, Stalin and the Soviet High Command were in a state of denial.  It was many hours before they accepted the reality of the situation and started issuing orders allowing local commanders to re-group and mount counterattacks.  Their paralysis only added to the chaos and confusion of the Soviet units at the front. It looked as though Hitler&rsquo;s confident prophesy to his generals was going to be realised: &ldquo;You have only to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.&rdquo; &#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;But it didn&rsquo;t. Four months later, the Soviets were still fighting tenaciously and the character of the war had changed. In sight of Moscow, the Axis blitzkrieg had run its course: a war of manoeuvre and mobility had become war of attrition; a bloody slog as autumnal rains heralded rasputitsa and roads became quagmires. The vision of a rapid victory envisaged by Hitler had vanished.  &#10;  &#10;The historical outcome of Operation Barbarossa was the consequence of fateful decisions and extraneous events which conspired to produce a campaign unsurpassed in drama or scale.  We hope Storm in the East: Operation Barbarossa does justice to History by presenting players with  difficult strategic problems and choices which faced the Axis and Soviet High Commands, and to Reality by demonstrating that the historical result was only one of a number of equally plausible outcomes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Its hull is comprised of sheets of bonded titanium able to withstand conventional ballistics, as well as laser and plasma fire. Its only real weakness is when confronted by dedicated anti-tank weaponry. It employs a sophisticated sensor array which assists ground troops to be more efficient with their tactics, relaying battlefield info to the ground commanders over their headsets.&#10;&#10;The weaponry of the M577 can make it a very dangerous foe to get close to. On the top of it is a retractable Boyars PARS-150 phased plasma cannon turret. The barrels on this thermal kinetic cannon alternate their fire so as to not overheat, allowing the weapon to blast its enemies continuously if need be. A Republic Electric RE700 20mm gatling cannon is mounted in the front of the vehicle, which is able to switch between caseless HEAP rounds and what is affectionately known as ?Beehive? Anti-Personnel Flechettes. Finally, it is also armed with an automatic light mortar which is mounted on the roof of the carrier to be used against foes that have dug into tough defensive positions.&#10;&#10;The interior is very roomy and in addition to the driver and section commander, it can also carry weapons and other stowage, as well as up to thirteen additional personnel in yoke harnesses restraints, allowing for it to be used in orbital combat drops when carried by a UD-4L Dropship.&#10;&#10;Box set contains:&#10;&#10;1x multipart resin APC model&#10;1x Heist gamemode leaflet&#10;&#10;",

Each player is dealt 10 cards of the 40 cards that does not include the red Strip Tease suit (which are divided into two face up stacks as &quot;points&quot;: 12-7 in one and 1-6 in another one - 13 face down), and the dealer declares if he wants to Defend or Prosecute based on his dealt hand, the other players do the same in turn - until there are two on either side.&#10;The Defenders will try to get the Strip Tease act, by getting their stack moved from 7 to 12 thus revealing the 13th Strip Tease card, the Prosecutors try to avoid the strip tease show to be made by moving their cards on the Theatre's stack to make the stripper more dressed.&#10;&#10;The game is then played in partnerships over three to four rounds (Trails) where you play in suits. However Defence can always play a Theatre (Green) card as a trump and Prosecutes can always play a Court (Black) card as trump card. If you can not follow suit you can either play a trump suit (to Object) or play a Prudie (Blue) card.&#10;Highest card wins the trick and places their top Strip Tease card on the other team's pile.&#10;&#10;The second variant of the game is played without the Joker, but depending on players can also be wither Paul Pry and Constable cards.&#10;Here you try to avoid taking tricks containing the Theatre Manager (Three months prison), Procecuter (two months prison) or any Strip Tease card (one months prison).

    "Description": "The World&rsquo;s First Open Source Quantum Board Game. Master New Galaxies in Your Quest to Construct a Quantum Computer!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Quantum Universe, Captain!&#10;&#10;Congratulations, your captain has retired and left you in charge of his galactic shipping business! Now it&rsquo;s time to make some upgrades as you embark on a journey to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race.&#10;&#10;Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. Learn about quantum computing as you work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe, avoid detection by the defense mechanisms left behind by the ancients, and rebuild the quantum computer.&#10;&#10;Think you&rsquo;re up for the challenge?&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. The goal is to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race. Work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe &ndash; Centarious, Superious, and Entanglion &ndash; in a quest to collect eight quantum computer components. Be careful to avoid detection by the planetary defense mechanisms guarding the components!&#10;&#10;Game concepts&#10;Entanglion was designed to expose players to several fundamental concepts in quantum computing:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computation.&#10;     Superposition is when a quantum system may exist in a probabilistic combination of multiple states at once.&#10;     Entanglement happens when the state of one qubit correlates with the state of another qubit.&#10;     Measurement is the process of observing the classical value of a qubit.&#10;     Error happens when random noise in the quantum system perturbs the measured value of a qubit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Entanglion also exposes players to the different kinds of hardware and software components involved in building a real quantum computer.&#10;&#10;Turn overview&#10;Perform one of the following actions on your turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Navigate. Play one engine card in engine control to navigate around the galaxy, and draw a replacement. You may only play engine cards for your own ship.&#10;     Exchange. Discard one engine card from your hand and draw a replacement..&#10;     Retrieve. Roll the Entanglion die to attempt to retrieve a quantum component if one is present.&#10;     Event. Play an event card from your hand (if you possess one).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players may not pass their turns, they must perform one of the actions above.&#10;&#10;Detection rate&#10;The detection rate determines the difficulty of successfully evading planetary defenses. The detection rate token is used to keep track of the current detection rate. When a player&rsquo;s spaceship has been detected by orbital defenses, or a player&rsquo;s away team has been detected by ground defenses, the detection rate is increased, making it easier for each planet&rsquo;s defenses to detect the player in the future. The game ends when the detection rate reaches the final level (designated with an X).&#10;&#10;Orbital defenses&#10;Planets in Entanglion are protected by orbital defenses that scan for ships looking to plunder the quantum components hidden there. It is possible to evade these defenses using your quantum engines. If you are detected, however, your navigation system will automatically take evasive maneuvers and jump to a random planet in the Centarious system. This jump triggers a quantum event.&#10;&#10;Game end&#10;Players immediately win the game when they have collected all eight components of the quantum computer. Players immediately lose the game when the detection rate reaches the end (X).&#10;&#10;",

This game is about creating and fine tuning the most difficult choices in order to split your friends right down the middle!&#10;&#10;All players start with a hand of five cards, each with a different scenario on, and during a round each player gets the chance to be the 'chooser', picking two cards to present to the others as a choice. All the other players must then ask at least one question to define the rules of each choice, with the goal of the chooser being to answer them in such a way to make them even more difficult to choose between. When a player has made up their mind, they take a 'decision card' and can no longer contribute to the discussion, and when all decision cards are gone, an immediate vote takes place. If the players split their votes as evenly as possible, the chooser wins!&#10;&#10;This is as much a discussion mechanic as it is a game, focusing as much on creativity, humour and considering the implications of each situation as it does on winning!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "La Belle Lucie is one of the harder solitaire games to play, having a lot of &quot;luck of the draw&quot; in place. It's other names are &quot;The Fan&quot;, &quot;Three Shuffles and a Draw&quot;, &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, and/or &quot;Trefoil&quot;.&#10;&#10;It's a single player card game where the point of the game is to transfer all cards from the tableau to the four foundations. The only action taken by the player will be moving a card from one &quot;fan&quot; of many, to another one in descending order (e.g. 7 of clubs on top of 8 of clubs)&#10;&#10;From the start all cards are visible in the tableau, but this doesn't mean the game can be won with strategy. More times than not, the game will not be beat because of unlucky draws. Such as kings being the top card of fans, or higher cards being on the bottom of the fan while the higher card of that suit is on top of the fan.&#10;&#10;",
