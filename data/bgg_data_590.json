Players throw the color die and place a corresponding piece on their turn.&#10;&#10;2. Players separate out the cylinders equally between them.  Then on their turn, they throw only the numbered die and place that many cylinders.  Any cylinders that fall off the surface are added to that players collection.  The first player to run out of pieces wins!&#10;&#10;3. Players throw both dice and must place the number of pieces of that color.&#10;&#10;4. Players use only the color die.  The color of each cylinder corresponds to a point total.  The points are proportional to the sizes, so six white pieces are the same height as one blue, for example.  On a players turn they throw the color die and can place any equivalent size of pieces on the surface.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The hugely popular Pop music trivia game now available also as a travel version! The game contains 100 question cards &ndash; the questions deal with songs, singers/bands, lyrics and competitions both from the days gone by and today.&#10;&#10;Unlike the basegame, the travel edition has no board at all; each player is given a page off a pad, which has six 'pyramids' (good for six games) made of 9 circles in the colours of the four question categories - three categories have 2 circles each, while one has 3 circles, and this varies from pyramid to pyramid. In the middle is a white star which is the final game-winning question. Each time a question is answered correctly, one circle of the category in question can be crossed off, and the goal is to fill in one side of the 'pyramid' and then answer the final question correctly. The category is decided directly by a die-roll (5 or 6 means player's choice). Otherwise rules are the same as the basegame.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;BackgroundIt is the middle of the 19th Century, and China is about to descend into a period of chaos and rebellion.  Weakened by a decade of humiliation from foreign powers following the Opium War, the Qing Imperial Government is at odds with itself about how to rule the country.  One side argues that China should adopt Western practices and institutions in order to level the playing field abroad.  The opposition claims that China must continue to stand defiant of foreign influence and forge its own path.  At the same time, a failed Confucian scholar in a desolate region of the South has recently proclaimed himself a high place in a foreign religion--the younger brother of Jesus Christ.&#10;&#10;So moved by his visions, he begins gathering followers to act against the government whose Confucian ideals had ranked him so poorly.  The pool he draws from consists not only of those who had been downtrodden and forgotten by the massive and corrupt governmental bureaucracy, but also wealthy families who believe a Han Chinese national could lead their people much better than the foreign Manchu from the North, who had conquered China almost two centuries before.&#10;&#10;This prophet's name? Hong Xiuquan&#10;&#10;His mission?  To expunge the Manchu demon rulers from the Han kingdom and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on Earth.&#10;&#10;The eventual death toll?  Over 20 million.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Heavenly Kingdom of Greater Peace--Taiping.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game InformationThe Scramble for China is a two player war-game set in the most destructive period of the 19th century, the Taiping Rebellion.  You either play as the Taiping, a pseudo-Christian movement that is sweeping South and Central China and wishes to topple the Manchu-run government and create a new culture for China, or the Qing dynasty, an incompetent gigantic imperial administration that is trying to hold the country together and stop the momentum of the Taiping.&#10;&#10;Players progress through the game using cards drawn into their hand; the cards either have an event written on them or a number of Action Points, and players take turns playing cards one at a time.  Action Points allow the players to recruit armies(colored blocks), form up troops into different types of units and attack the enemy.  During the course of the game both players can call upon foreign soldiers to get the edge in battle, and the Taiping will try and meet up with rebels in nearby provinces to add manpower into their army.  Victory goes to whichever side has the most victory points at the end of the game.  Most victory points are earned by holding red city spaces at the end of turn 8, but the Qing player gets bonus points for every city never lost, and the Taiping player for every rebel piece picked up.&#10;&#10;A third Non-Playable faction exists in the game through 'The West'.  'The West' steals points from the Chinese players for every foreign unit on the board at the end of the game, randomly receives points for how much attention it is paying to China through 'The West' deck, and earns points from player card events and Chinese casualties.  It is very possible that both Chinese players will lose and the West triumphs, so Chinese players must be weary in how they utilize foreigners...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Breakdown of Mass is the next installment for System Vector, which is becoming a favorite game of mine in general. &#10;The expansion does not focus much on a large amount of new units or system cards. Instead, it adds more depth to the game it's self by adding more elements to game play and strategy. The expansion includes 6 new high-resource system cards, a Black Hole system, and an Unknown system. &#10;In addition to these, the game also features a new building aspect, where you can build structures such as factories, science institutes, and mobile shipyards. Each of these structures improves different aspects of your empire, making the games focus wider and your empire larger. With these buildings also come the chance to research and develop new technology and advancements in your empire. There will be a military technology tier, and an economical technology tier. These tiers will have 2 options per level of advancement. This will give players 4 Research Management Cards and 48 Research counters (12 for each player).&#10;&#10;That makes 13 new cards to print out, which at 25 cents a print, comes to $3.25.&#10;&#10;8 System cards (including the Black Hole and Unknown System)&#10;4 Research Management cards&#10;1 Research Counters sheet&#10;&#10;I am really excited to be getting another System Vector game off the ground. I am lucky to be able to pop things like this out within a couple of days, while still being able to test play Armed Legion AND learn/play RftG. fun fun.&#10;&#10;",

Beneath the drawing is a cryptic clue to look for something in the drawing - for example, the drawing might be of two boxers fighting, and the cryptic clue might be, &quot;spot the drink&quot;. The answer is &quot;punch&quot;, which is something depicted in the drawing and which is also a drink.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is for each player to see all 18 cards, and solve as many of the clues as they can within a set time.&#10;&#10;Good production values - cards are heavy duty and well printed - but limited replay value, as once you have worked out the clues on each card there is no point in playing the game again as you know all of the answers. Simple pleasures for simple folk.&#10;&#10;",

All Players are setting there Pizza Express Central on a field with a &quot;2&quot; marked in the Center. The Numbers represented the Amount of Fees you must pay to the owner of the Building (Landlord?) every Round. The Starting Player rolls two dice on the random Events Table. Then he rolls for the field where the Pizza Couriers, must deliver their Pizzas. Every Player has one starting Courier. The first one is roling a Die to determine the Number of Crossing Points, his Driver could move this Turn. After this he moves his first driver as Near as Possible to a field with a Number rolled as Target field. If he reachs a crossing point adjacent to the target field he is earning the Printed Number multiplied with 100. These are the Pizza Units or PU (PE in German).  But not PUs are the Target of the Game! The Victory depends on Victory Points based on Quality, Price and a Cutt throug rate of Delivery Times from the Pizza Orders.&#10;&#10;I Personally like this Game but the realy simple Grafics of the Game had once avoided any succes on the Market.
