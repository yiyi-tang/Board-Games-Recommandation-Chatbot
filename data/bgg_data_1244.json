    "Description": "A unique board game for the entire family, about the impact of deforestation on the Orangutans of Borneo and Sumatra.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a shocking sight, as the game board unfolds on the table. A beautiful area of rainforest has been cut down to make way for yet another palm oil plantation. The very center of the deforested area has been spared as it is host to trees producing smelly durian fruit. The exploiters of the future plantation simply could not stand the smell and left this small group of trees alone. Contrary to the loggers, Borneo orangutans love durian fruit, but their access to the trees has now been cut off. Orangutans nearly solely travel through tree tops, swinging elegantly at impressive speeds. They hardly ever travel over the ground, so how do they now get to their favorite meal in the rainforest? You can help them, by growing back the rainforest.&#10;&#10;Role the dice to determine your action for each turn. Actions include placing a new rainforest tile, introducing an orangutan chit, moving a rainforest tile, or moving an orangutan chit (1 or 2 moves).&#10;&#10;Players aim to create a path for their orangutans to swing to the durian trees in the center of the board. They have to avoid blood pythons and can make use of other orangutan tiles or chits (including those of opponent players), which will help them move faster towards the durian trees. The first player to feed all of his/her orangutans, by occupying the durian trees, wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, players will move (if they wish) and then choose an action: trade items, revive another hero, rest up, or search the area. When searching the area, the hero could find treasure, the level key, a foe to battle, or even a trap.&#10;&#10;While battling foes and each level boss is encouraged in order to obtain higher levels through experience gains, once the key is located, the players can proceed through the door to the next level. A new board is generated, a new boss is drawn, and things get a little bit more difficult.&#10;&#10;By the time players reach level five, the foes and level boss are extremely strong (this difficulty increase is directly related to the number of players in the game). The game ends when the boss on level 5 is defeated or when the boss on level 5 has knocked all heroes unconscious. Heroes Vs. Foes is a fully-cooperative game, so all players will win or lose together.&#10;&#10;The standard edition offers 10 heroes to choose from (each with their own unique abilities, stats, and boons), 8 bosses, 27 foes, 57 items, 9 familiars, and 9 traps, making the possibilities of game play figuratively limitless. The game provides a mix of tabletop role-playing game and old-school dungeon crawler board game mechanics to generate a full campaign with long-term decisions while allowing all players to take part in the action. It has a moderate learning curve made easier with the more background in TTRPG and traditional dungeon-crawler stats and mechanics. Once moving, the game easily plays itself and provides difficulty and teamwork for even the most avid players.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Destroy your enemies, gather your fish, and gain arcane magical dominion over the seven seas!&#10;&#10;Fish N Ships is a quick combat &amp; hand-management card game set in a fantastical world of swashbuckling seafarers. In Fish N Ships, each player takes on the role of a pirate who must follow the compass points on their scrolls in order to find the legendary fish and gain unique magic powers. Players fire cannons at each other, steal one another's cards, hoard treasure cards to claim special abilities, and play powerful Tide-Turner cards that can change the course of the game entirely.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four cards from the draw deck and a secret goal card listing their unique combination of treasure cards needed to win the game. The moment a player takes possession of the cards listed on their goal card, they immediately win and the game ends. Players may steal cards from each other's hands by engaging in battle, and could easily lose everything if sailing into battle unprepared. To mitigate (but not completely eliminate) the risk of losing their treasure cards, a player may choose to place a card face-up in front of them, making the card &quot;Locked down&quot; and immune to the effects of battle. The more treasures a player has locked down, the more special abilities they may claim. Special abilities (such as &quot;+1 to Attack&quot; and &quot;Draw from discard pile&quot;) can only be claimed by one player at a time, encouraging players to race to be the first to claim the most desirable powers.&#10;&#10;Fish N Ships uses a structure that rewards planning while also encouraging quick adaptation of play strategy. Players are never eliminated (even if they run out of cards) &amp; are given equalizing bonuses if ganged up on repeatedly. Powerful single-use &quot;Tide-Turner&quot; cards are included in the deck that can be used outside a player's normal turn-actions to disrupt an opponent or bolster a winning streak. Once used, Tide-Turners are removed from the game, encouraging players to use them wisely.&#10;&#10;All gameplay mechanics of Fish N Ships are designed to encourage player interaction, either through battle or theft. It is statistically impossible for a player to collect all the treasures listed on their goal card by solely drawing from the deck. Though a player may choose to play a pacifist for most of the game, they will be forced to fight an opponent eventually.  Combat is structured so that neither party will have an immediate advantage (other than the surprise of the initial attack) and the game encourages players to be prepared for battle at all times.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Then they roll a die for their own movement, with which they can move in any direction, around or up and down the pyramid levels. If a moving adventurer is in a space adjacent to another adventurer, they can help that companion to move up (or down) the levels. Also, leaving treasure on the path distracts the advancing Apes (but only temporarily).&#10;&#10;Can your intrepid explorers get to the apex of the pyramid to be rescued?

The type can impact the ability to get certain types of accounts.&#10;&#10;The board is a layout of Manhattan with players starting at Grand Central Station. Each city block is a square (actually a rectangle as it represents the short and long blocks in Manhattan from 42nd to 56th and from York to 5th Ave). The blocks contain the name of prospective advertising accounts with an entrance on one street or a Fluke. Movement is in any direction but must follow the one way streets.&#10;&#10;When landing on Fluke you draw a card. When landing on an account you may solicit the account by drawing a card based on whether the account already has an ad agency. The odds of getting the account are 50/50 if it has no agency and 1/3 of stealing an account. You can protect your accounts from being stolen by adding a &quot;creative team&quot; (Spend more money when winning the account and make less when getting commission since you have to pay the team).&#10;&#10;Accounts have names based on real companies such as Croke, Hineykins Beer, Sunka Coffee and you can never have 2 accounts for similar products at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

Create challenges for your opponent to find out whose dog has the most moxie in the end!&#10;&#10;Loosely based on the real world dog sport of Earth Dog, the game Dirt Dog has players leading their dog through underground burrows to try and track down quarry.  Badgers, foxes, rabbits, and others are all things for your dog to chase.&#10;&#10;Play begins with players drafting obedience cards, which are used to help their dogs overcome obstacles within the burrows.  One player then constructs a burrow for the other player to run.  While running the burrow, both players may use obedience cards to make the challenges easier or more difficult for the dogs.  Failing to meet a challenge saps some of the dogs moxie, which is needed to make it through the burrow and defeat the quarry at the end.  The dog with the most moxie at the end of the round wins that round.  Best of 3 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Dirt Dog is playable as either a head vs head game or team vs team.  Team games have 2 players per team, called a brace.  Players in a brace help each other successfully run through burrows to try and make sure they make it to the end with more moxie than their opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pack o&rsquo; Dogs is a quick 2-player card game featuring unique artwork of 40 dogs and 4 cats. Both players flip their cards over for simultaneous play. Form packs on the table with a hierarchy of determining which card is best when. The dogs form their packs with dogs of the same size, or dogs of neighboring sizes in the same color. Cats are unique, befriending the smallest and the largest dogs in their color, as well as other cats.&#10;&#10;Pack o&rsquo; Dogs has two included versions in the rules: the Base Game and the Complex Game.&#10;&#10;The Base Game has a little less strategy than the Complex Game so it is perfect for first time players, younger kids, or when you simply just want a faster more relaxed game. The scoring is based on the number of cards you have in your score pile and the game ends when you reach the bottom of the deck (no reshuffling the discard pile). The score pad is not used for this version.&#10;&#10;The Complex Game requires more strategy than the Base Game. It involves planning out your moves, remembering what cards you know your opponent has, and which cards have already gone past to determine the best card to play. The game consists of a best of 7 rounds (i.e. first player to win 4 rounds ends the game, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily win the game). The score pad is used to write down your points for each round and tells you which rounds give you bonus points. You get bonus points for winning streaks and for winning the later rounds, so winning that final round could turn the whole game around!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Deck of 45 Cards - 4 colors (white, red, black, yellow) of various sizes (numbers 1-10 and a cat, for each color), and 1 treat card&#10;6 Reference Cards - 3 for each player for quick rule reminders&#10;1 Score Pad - 20 sheets with 3 games per sheet (60 games total)&#10;1 Rule Sheet&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can you arrange your letter tiles to make the highest-scoring crossword grid?&#10;&#10;In Word Hustle, after a letter draft during setup, you'll press your luck and roll your dice to gain more letter tiles. Then, you&rsquo;ll race against others to make a high-scoring crossword grid. Over three rounds, you&rsquo;ll try to maximize the scoring power of your personal letter set to win. Word games like Word Hustle &ndash; that let you move your letters around to find words &ndash; are incredibly satisfying.&#10;&#10;In this word game, you won't be sitting idly waiting for your turn. There's simultaneous word-building and player interaction in each phase &ndash; you can steal or share letters and make strategic moves to win.&#10;&#10;Word Hustle&rsquo;s unique challenge of having to make new and better words with the same letters each round means the game gets MORE and MORE exciting. It turns out, the human brain loves this challenge. Word Hustle will lead you to consider moves like:&#10;&#10;&bull; Should I steal that valuable tile or go for more tiles for myself?&#10;&bull; Should I make words quickly and put pressure on my opponents or take my time and make high-scoring words?&#10;&bull; Can I outscore my previous round using the same letters but new words?&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after three rounds is the winner, unless they are challenged to an Ultimate Hustle! In the optional Ultimate Hustle, the winner hands over their letter set to see if their final round score can be outdone&hellip; But, it won't be easy &ndash; the challenger only has two minutes and can&rsquo;t use any of the words the winner used in the game.&#10;&#10;",

We wanted to produce something different than a standard tuck box of suited cards and also steer away from the classic 'trumps' format - although good for sports stats, there isn't much variety and this needed to be more original.&#10;&#10;In short, you try and build your best 5-a-side team from a deck of current and classic players and score goals/points by having the team that totals the most stars at 'Kick-off'. More on mechanic and rules below.&#10;&#10;Gameplay summary:&#10;You are dealt 5 cards each&#10;players take turns to draw a player card, then a referee card&#10;the aim is to build a legitimate formation of GK DF MF MF ST, at that point you can initiate a Kick-Off, where all players&#10;lay their cards down and the player with the most stars total scores a goal, first to 5 goals wins. But the Referee cards are designed to make that tricky and fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

These cards are combined into small decks in a manner that uses randomization and fixed elements to form an Encounter. The same Encounter can play out differently each time it is played because of the randomization of the cards, forcing the player to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances. This also makes each scenario highly replayable.&#10;&#10;Unlike most games that use a board with spaces or miniatures on a playing surface, in Split Second the playing area is abstracted using cards to represent the battlefield. &#10;Ranges aren't measured in physical distance, but instead cards are placed into Areas that are split up by Area Divider cards. &#10;Movement between objects isn't made in any linear measurement, but in movement points as the combatants anchor themselves to and then move away from objects in the battlezone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to end up with the most sheep of your color.&#10;&#10;There are 12 2x2unit tiles (called &quot;sheep&quot;) comprising 2 sets of reversible tiles with black sheep on one side and white sheep on the other, having Black: White ratios of {6:1, 5:2, 4:3, 3:4, 2:5, 1:6).&#10;&#10;One set black-up is randomly mixed with the other set white-up and then randomly dealt out in a ring enclosing the 9 central points of a go board, forming a pen.&#10;&#10;Movement&#10;On a turn, Sheep always move a distance of exactly 5, and if not forming a flock, they then flip over. They are allowed one change of direction per move.&#10;&#10;The game has two phases: 1) Dispersing from the pen, 2) Flocking together.&#10;&#10;1) Dispersing from the pen,&#10;During the Dispersing phase, priority is given to moving sheep that have the most length of shared edges. The sheep must move to reduce the total length of connections, and the number of touching corners. The Dispersing phase ends when no sheep are touching each other.&#10;&#10;2) Flocking together.&#10;During this phase, the sheep may move next to one another. When they end up sharing more than a corner with other friendly sheep, they form a flock and are not required to complete the turn with is flip. Flocked sheep no longer move and may not be flipped.&#10;&#10;It is not allowed to repeat board positions during play (for example by returning a piece that the other player just moved)&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the sheep are in Flocks.&#10;&#10;Note: Many thanks to Dale Walton for all of his suggestions and concise wording of the rules.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Gift Edition includes Practice, University Course and Guild of Alchemists. In addition, in the box there are also bonus materials that are absent in the regular editions of the game: the Alchemikote creature card and alternative sequences for creating the Philosopher's Stone for the Alchemists Guild.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the card game Potion-Making: Practice, players take on the roles of apprentice mages studying in a Magic School. Each player tries to gather the necessary components in order to produce magic elixirs, powders, talismans and even magical creatures. For each completed creation the player scores points &ndash; and the harder the task, the more points a player scores.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 76 cards, with each card featuring one of 16 elements on its bottom half and a magic formula or spell on its top half. Each player start the game with four cards in hand, and four cards are laid face-up in the &quot;Desk of Elements&quot;; players can use these public elements to complete a formula in hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws until he has five cards in hand, then he plays one or more cards from his hand. He can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discard a card onto the Desk of Elements; he scores one point if that element is not currently present on the Desk.&#10;    Take elements on the Desk to complete a formula on a card in his hand. He scores points equal to the number shown on the formula, then places the element cards face-down over the bottom half of the card so that all players can see the formula. His turn then ends.&#10;    Use one or more previously completed formulas, along with any elements required and available on the Desk, to complete a more difficult formula. He can use formulas in front of himself or other players to do this. Any elements under formulas reused this way are returned to the Desk. Any opponent who loses one or more formulas this way scores half the points of the more difficult formula just completed. The player's turn then ends.&#10;    Plays a spell from his hand to take a card from the desk into his hand, to decompose one completed formula or to transform one formula into another. After playing a spell, he must take another action, which could be playing another spell.&#10;&#10;&#10;After the deck runs out, players continue to take turns until no one has cards remaining in hand. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The planet is in a climate crisis. For decades governments have ignored it. Now it&rsquo;s up to a group of city mayors to sort it.&#10;&#10;Carbon City Zero: World Edition is a race against the clock, where players juggle their common goal (of collective survival) with local priorities. And that&rsquo;s just the start of it. From how people get from A to B, to what powers their cup of tea, every decision is a climate decision. These mayors have their work cut out for them - will they avoid climate chaos?&#10;&#10;Carbon City Zero: World Edition is a revised second edition of the climate action game Carbon City Zero. This edition is a collaborative deck-building game for 1-4 people in which players develop a sustainable city by greening transport, transforming industries, getting citizens on board, and showing world leaders how it&rsquo;s done. Each player starts with an identical deck, buying additional cards from a shared marketplace to create a more sustainable city. But you need to negotiate, working together with cities around the world. Balancing the need to generate income with reducing carbon, players can follow numerous paths to victory, but collaboration is key. You&rsquo;ll need to bring together governments, industries, and the public. And if you can&rsquo;t bring carbon levels to zero before it&rsquo;s too late - we all lose. The stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with the original rules for competitive and solo play.&#10;&#10;In the collaborative and solo modes players win if they can bring the carbon level to zero in eight rounds or less, while in competitive games it's a race to zero - first there wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Roll up that Map, 1805 in Germany, The Ulm &amp; Austerlitz Campaigns&#10;&#10;A series of small but pivotal engagements around the Ulm region allowed Napoleon to cut off nearly all routes of escape from Ulm and strategically surround the city. The Austerlitz Campaign is arguably Napoleon&rsquo;s most effective campaign, culminating in one of the greatest successful gambles of military history. It is the campaign which introduced La Grande Arm&eacute;e to the world, a highly trained, highly motivated, flexibly organized military system which was the culmination and extension of military evolution to-date.&#10;&#10;Roll up that Map includes everything you need to begin recreating both phases of Napoleon's brilliant 1805 German campaign: organization, maps, historical briefings, and uniforms.&#10;&#10;     Two campaigns,&#10;     Nine scenarios,&#10;     Twenty-seven maps,&#10;     Over 600 uniform images created especially for inclusion in this series and offering!&#10;&#10;&#10;Sit under the sun of Austerlitz&hellip;&#10;9 scenarios covering both the fight for Ulm, leading to the Battle of Austerlitz:&#10;&#10;     Wertingen&#10;     Haslach-Jungingen&#10;     G&uuml;nzburg&#10;     Elchingen&#10;     Amstetten&#10;     D&uuml;renstein&#10;     Sch&ouml;ngrabern&#10;     Wischau&#10;     Austerlitz&#10;&#10;&#10;The Roll up that Map Campaign Guide is compatible with Et sans r&eacute;sultat!

Having determined that the Spanish government did not hold the confidence of its people, and realizing, due to lack of both will and ability, it would never fulfill its responsibilities of allegiance to France, Napoleon determined plans must be made. Upon discovering agents of the Spanish throne discussed Spain&rsquo;s potential role against France with her enemies, the Emperor decided such plans must be acted upon.&#10; The seemingly never ending pursuit actions across the Iberian landscape of Spain and Portugal provided a stream of empty victories to the French, until finally, the British Expeditionary Force is expelled from the continent at La Coru&ntilde;a.&#10; To Assure My Dynasty, 1808 in Iberia presents Phase One: The Spanish Uprising in four scenarios, pitting Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperial Army against the Royal Army of Spain, and the British Expeditionary Force and its Portuguese supporters.

Each piece is also used only once, and has unique movement. Fights are therefore dynamic and exiting.&#10;&#10;Drott means king in old norse, and the game is lightly themed to fit the old kings of the north. The names of the pieces are, bowman, skjolding (pawns), berserker, spearman, wolf, elf, hunter, dwarf and king.&#10;&#10;A special feature of Drott is that pieces diagonally aligned cannot be passed through, but there are two open flanks on the side. Due to the three winning conditions, draws are extremely unlikely to happen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The First player to land on the Portal space with a full pocket wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Most people in Medieval Europe suffered in abject poverty, many driven to begging in the streets, their survival at the mercy of the passing nobility. In this game, players take on the role of lowly beggars, visiting village sites in search of sustenance and working the passing nobility for largess. Players can chose to exploit their own infirmities, or visit the cathedral in hopes of a miracle. During this struggle for survival, beggars must also avoid the stern eye of the village constable patrolling the streets. The winner is the player who can acquire the most alms to survive in the harsh world for another day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This three-handed card game would have been perfect for the Victorian courting sensibilities, played by a young couple and their chaperone. By playing your cards carefully you will gain cards that will contribute to your final score. However, you can decide to use a scoring card to win a different (and perhaps better) card. A very light, unique game for three that can be played almost anywhere by anyone, depicting the latest fashions of the 1880s.

This not only scores you points, but removes your opponent's cubes from the board.&#10;&#10;The score track is integrated into the board and other player's scoring markers, not to mention errant cubes, can allow your marker to leapfrog into the lead.

    "Description": "It wasn't long ago that the players bought an old restaurant and received their first guests. Their restaurant grew, more demanding guests came and they were able to hire more staff. Unfortunately, the success didn't last long and the restaurant became quiet. The number of guests decreased, temporary workers had to be let go and not all damage in the restaurant could be repaired. So the players decided that the restaurant needed a change. It is high time to add a pastry shop to the restaurant and serve sweet desserts: tiramisu, cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e and fancy sundaes &ndash; because it's Time for Dessert!?&#10;&#10;The expansion Time for Dessert! introduces a new type of order. By taking advantage of additional actions and using ingredients such as fruit, cream and ice cream, the players have to satisfy the demanding wishes of the guests. A specialist helps to carry out actions twice in one go, but also needs more time to do so. If the players use their earned money for investments, these bring advantages in every shift. As in the basic game, all new rules are conveyed over the course of several scenarios.&#10;&#10;While the story begins after the end of the last Kitchen Rush scenario, players only need to know the rules of the first four scenarios in order to play the expansion. Each of the seven new scenarios introduces new elements. Each group can decide for themselves whether they play the entire campaign or simply repeat the scenario that they enjoy the most.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
