    "Description": "In Beer &amp; Pretzels, players throw coasters onto a table. And then they get money. And then they throw more coasters. And then they get more money. This very complex and detailed process repeats until the end of the game at which point the player with the most money wins, just like in real life. At that point the winner will claim that Beer & Pretzels is the best game ever, and the losers will claim that the game is fundamentally flawed, and most likely broken.&#10;&#10;Just by coincidence, each coaster has an image of either pretzels or beer on it. Different pretzels have different values. Beer doubles your money. Players only score for items that are completely visible... items entirely or partially obscured by other coasters don&rsquo;t count. There tends to be name calling, bragging, self-high-fiving and the occasional brawl during the game, all of which add to the rich atmosphere and theme.&#10;&#10;&#10;WARNING: Beer &amp; Pretzels should be played with caution. Unmitigated use of this game could result in anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, lapsing into inconsistent foreign accents, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, double vision, drooling, impulsivity, restlessness, extreme hyperactivity, unusual changes in behavior, kidney problems, long term memory loss, narrow angle glaucoma, itching, right upper belly pain, insomnia, fever, an inability to line up buttons properly on dress shirts, dark urine, yellow skin/eyes, unexplained flu-like symptoms, anal leakage, dizziness, yodeling, hive clusters, nausea, fainting upon standing, stiff muscles, uncontrollable cravings for onion rings, confusion, severe liver problems, barking, high fever, increased frequency of toe stubbing, dry mouth, constipation, sudden uncontrollable left-handedness and decreased appetite. This is not a complete list of potential side effects. Ask your doctor if Beer &amp; Pretzels is right for you.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Impetus is a set of wargaming rules that allows you to play battles from the Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance periods. It is produced by the same team that publish the Italian 'Dadi &amp; Piombo' miniatures wargaming magazine.&#10;&#10;It is an extremely flexible system which allows players to recreate armies from a huge period of history - from Ancient Egypt, Romans and the Crusades right through to the Hundred Years War and Samurai.&#10;&#10;Impetus is designed to be played using miniatures in various scales: 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm, and 25/28mm are all catered for.&#10;&#10;Miniatures are based in elements - 60mm wide for 6mm &amp; 10mm, 80mm wide for 15mm, and 120mm wide for 20mm &amp; 25/28mm. The depth of the element is stipulated, but is not vital. This enables you to play the system with armies already based for other games systems.&#10;&#10;The game play is turn based, but is not traditional i-go/u-go. Players roll dice for initiative every turn, but units are able to react to enemy forces out of sequence.&#10;&#10;Units have 3 or 4 statistics, the most important of which is VBU, a combination of unit strength and morale.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast and simple. Units roll dice equivalent to their VBU in combat, with various modifiers giving bonuses to the number of dice thrown. Any score of '6' or double '5' score a hit. There is some record keeping required, as unit hits cause a reduction in VBU. When VBU is reduced to 0, the unit routs and is removed from the table.&#10;&#10;Armies are points based, with average armies ranging between 300-500 points. There are 15 army lists detailed in the original rules, usually in 'matched pairs'. These include Alexander's Macedonians &amp; Later Achaemedian Persians, 2nd Punic War Romans &amp; Carthaginians, Gauls &amp; Caesar's Romans, Crusaders &amp; Saladin's Army, and French &amp; English armies from the 100 Years War.&#10;&#10;",

Who gets rid of their cards first is usually considered unimportant. The loser must deal the next game.&#10;&#10;The game requires one regular 52-card deck (plus 2 Jokers, when six play). Aces are high, although twos and tens act as trump cards in different ways.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a set of piles of two cards, three face up and three face down. They then take turns to play cards onto a central pile, drawing from the deck to replenish their hand. If they can't make a play they have to pick up the pile and the next player begins a new one. Once a player has emptied their hand and no more cards can be drawn, they move on to play cards from their own piles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "La Grande Armee is an operational wargame for 2 players covering three distinct Napoleonic campaigns in central Europe. There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI.&#10;&#10;La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders.&#10;&#10;Note this game is totally different from the later TSR &lsquo;remake&rsquo; of the same title.&#10;&#10;",

The peaceful people of the land came to terms with Telin's rule and dared not give voice to their sinister thoughts and unabated fears.

Will Telin's rule end, or will Helloder be another name to be buried under the pen of history that is Telin's sword?&#10;&#10;In Spells of Doom, each player controls a hero with a unique deck of spells and skills cards, and he uses those to try to capture magic crystals and damage opponents. The game takes place over three rounds, with each round consisting of six turns; a turn consists of the upkeep phase, the hero phase, and the end phase. The game is played as a PvP two-player game or a 2-on-2 four-player game.&#10;&#10;",

The cards players earn from winning tricks depend on the total value of the trick.

    "Description": "From demo packet:&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: Adventures in Wyrd City. It's super fun in 3 easy steps:&#10;&#10;&#10;        1. Recruit a team of heroes. &#10;        2. Send them into battle. &#10;        3. Clobber till content.&#10;&#10;&#10;Wyrd City&mdash;where conflict lies in wait around every corner and the shadows are acrawl with mystery and adventure, where liberty wanes, government waxes, and a chosen few don capes and cowls to take their stand in a world gone Wyrd....&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game features 32 original Heroes (and/or villains, depending on your perspective) and several Crews of secondary characters, including Freedom Patrols, Liberty Bots, Diabloids, Arachnidrones, Darklings, thugs, and zombies. Each Hero is defined by personalized stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Vigor) and 3 unique Powers, while each Crew is defined by personalized stats and 1 unique Power. Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.&#10;    &#10;Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:&#10;&#10;1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.&#10;&#10;In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.&#10;&#10;Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game! Let the battle begin!&#10;&#10;",

One player assumes the role of the German high command, the other the French. The German objective is to defeat France, thereby unifying the various German states into a single nation. The French player's objective is, initially, to gain glory for the French Empire; failing that, it is to successfully defend France against a German invasion. Franco-Prussian War uses a new system to simulate the nature of 19th century warfare. The game system itself is simple, but it does have some innovative features to represent leadership, staff work, command/control, effects of different weapons, and the ever-shifting sands of morale and politics.&quot;&#10;&#10;1 turn = 1 week&#10;&#10;Other games in the series were Austro-Prussian War (S&amp;T #167); Russo-Turkish War (S&amp;T #154) and Risorgimento (S&amp;T #187).&#10;&#10;",

Getting rid of your cards might require you to take chips!&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a random hand of cards and a few chips. On a turn, you either play cards to the center of the table (with you beating the cards previously played, if any) or return two chips to the stock.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the first player to play cards lays down one or more cards of the same value. You can take chips from the stock to alter the value of the cards you play. With a red card, each chip you take adds 1 to the value of that card; with a yellow card, each chip you take adds the value of the card to itself. If you play a red 7 and a yellow 4, for example, you can take two chips from the stock to make the 7 an 8 and the 4 an 8, and now you've played a pair of 8s. (Chip It has green and purple cards instead of red and yellow ones.)&#10;&#10;To play cards on top of this, you must play a pair of 9s or some stronger pair. If you cannot play or choose not to play, you must return two chips to the stock. You are still in the round, but if all players pass in turn, then the player who last played cards clears the pile and plays whatever they wish (or returns two chips to the stock, passing the lead to the right).&#10;&#10;Whoever first has no cards in hand and no chips in front of them wins!&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to the cards, every turn offers different situations.&#10;&#10;The Criminals will have to complete two heists out of the three available to win the game and to do so they will have to move hidden in the shadows, leaving traces of their path that the Police will have to find to ruin the plans of the Criminals.&#10;&#10;The Police will have the hard job of investigating the traces of Diabolik and Eva, but they are not alone, in fact they will have the opportunity to call on up to four Police Officers to help, to keep every corner of the city under observation. To win the game, the cops will have to raise the Danger Level to the maximum on the Danger Track. Usually, solving a Clue increases the Danger Level by 1 point, but that's not the only way to do it. On the other hand, if Eva or Diabolik complete a Heist, the Danger Level is lowered.&#10;&#10;In their turn, each player can perform a maximum of 3 individual actions. The only exception is for drawing, discarding, or playing cards, which is a repeatable action.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.&#10;&#10;In this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a certain number of rounds.  The players total up their victory points (typically for occupying strategic locations with their units) and whoever has more is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 8 hours&#10;Hex: 1.67 km&#10;Unit: Company to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 21&quot; X 32&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

These frogs don't jump wild and free, however, as they must take a bridge that spans adjacent lilypads in order to move. And not only are the frogs semi-lame, but they're also extremely clumsy. After each jump &ndash; or &quot;jump&quot;, as it were &ndash; the bridge used by that frog falls into the lake.&#10;&#10;The lilypads are set up in a square or pyramid, depending on the number of players in the game, with one bridge between each pair of adjacent lilypads. On a turn, a player either moves one frog from one lilypad to an adjacent one (removing the bridge after doing so, except for the bridge to a player's home, which can never be removed) or places one bridge on the board to connect two lilypads. If a frog lands on an occupied space (other than a player's home), the frog already on that space must jump away in a direction of the active player's choosing, removing the bridge used; if that frog lands next to another, then the process repeats. If a frog cannot jump away when encroached upon due to a lack of bridges, then the initial jump is illegal and the active player must take another action.&#10;&#10;Each player has four action cards that can be used once each game to place two bridges, jump without needing a bridge, remove an additional bridge, or take an extra jump. Get all your frogs into the other players' homes, with at least one frog in each location, and you win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fancying themselves spies like those in the movies, a group of little animal rascals have decided to sneak into Farmer Papa's neighboring orchard to gather gardening intelligence (i.e., fruit) they can use on their own farm. Competing with both open and hidden information, they must identify bluffing and beware of the others' weapons. The player who can obtain the most yummiest fruit will be recognized as the best fruit spy!&#10;&#10;In Fruit Spy, six farmhouse boards are arranged in a circle in a random order, with 2-4 fruit tokens (valued 1-7) placed randomly upon them. Two stand-up figures &mdash; Farmer Papa and Daly &mdash; are placed on their respective starting farmhouses.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight spy cards in hand &mdash; trick cards valued 1-7 and one tool card &mdash; and on a player's turn, they place one card face down on a farmhouse of their choice. If another face-down card is already there, the player turns it face up; if the revealed card is a tool card, then both the new card and the tool card are discarded. When cards are played on the farmhouse where one (or both) of the figures stands, that figure is moved &mdash; clockwise for Daly, counterclockwise for Farmer Papa. The game ends when one of the figures reaches its starting farmhouse or when all players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;Fruit tokens are then awarded in order of the players' total strength on each farmhouse: the strongest player takes the fruit token with the highest Yum-yum value, the second-strongest player takes the next highest-valued token, and so on. Any remaining fruit tokens go to the strongest player. Daly is scored as a fruit token of value 10 while Farmer Papa kicks everyone out of the farmhouse where he stands at the end of the game empty-handed. The player with the highest Yum-yum value total wins!&#10;&#10;Earlier versions of Fruit Spy were titled Dead Man's Treasure, with players fighting for treasure chests in exactly the same manner as Fruit Spy.&#10;&#10;",

The stakes could not be higher as the German panzers and infantry engaged Soviet armies and mechanized corps along Russia&rsquo;s western frontier.&#10;&#10;The Arduous Beginning is the first new historical board game in some 15 years from renowned game designer Frank Chadwick.

    "Description": "Star Fleet Battle Manual (SFBM) is a Tactical level Space Combat miniatures wargame for two or more players with spaceships familiar to fans of Star Trek (the original series).&#10;&#10;SFBM is easily confused with the much better-known and much more complex &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; boardgame. Although the theme is the same, and some of the mechanics are quite similar, crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles, make SFBM unlike Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square (or more) is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.&#10;&#10;After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.&#10;&#10;Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this used the Star Trek name without having properly licensed it, and therefore was not sold for long).&#10;&#10;The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Darksiders: The Forbidden Land is a co-operative dungeon crawler board game for 1-5 players. Take on the role of your favourite Horseman and battle alongside your fellow Riders through an entirely new storyline set in the Darksiders universe!&#10;&#10;With asymmetric player abilities, you can play as War, Death, Fury or Strife and experience the game completely differently each time. Customisable decks of cards for each Rider mean that even multiple games with the same rider will be different!&#10;&#10;Manage your cards well, as you will be using them to move, attack enemies and upgrade your rider. Don't blow through them too quickly though, because once your deck runs out you've lost the battle! Fight your way through to the hordes of monsters to defeat the end boss and win the apocalypse!&#10;&#10;Cards in Darksiders can function one of a variety of different ways ways: &#10;- You may discard a card to make an attack with your melee weapon (or a ranged weapon if your Rider has one equipped) &#10;- You may discard a card to move your rider up to 3 hexes (different cards have different possible movement values listed on them) &#10;- You can spend the soul cost listed on certain cards to use their special abilities. Equipment cards might be weapons or armor that make your Rider stronger in battle. Ability cards let you use ferocious special abilities to attack your enemies, defend your rider or even summon aid in battle.&#10;- Cards can also be discarded to interact with your environment, such as opening doors, triggering switches, or trading with Vulgrim the Demon Merchant !&#10;&#10;The included Campaign Book has 20+ different levels - broken into multiple scenarios &ndash; to play through. These can be tackled in sequence for an entire campaign play-through, players may choose to focus on a single scenario for a shorter gaming session, or even just play through a single level. With a variety of enemies as well as numerous modular hex-tile game boards included in the game, we also look forward to seeing fan-created custom levels and scenarios!&#10;&#10;",

You can play an element card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker element with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star element is wild and can represent any element you need; a trash card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star or an action card.&#10;&#10;The actions let you discard cards in play, move cards, swap them, and recycle (discard a card and draw a new card). Play continues until someone collects one element of each type in his row. A scoring system is included for those who want to play multiple games.&#10;&#10;",

These wars have been among the only major conventional ground conflicts since WWII, and thus provide a developing record of the changing nature of weapons systems, tactics, and the Intensity of combat. Now all these conflicts are explored in this one game, part of the First Battle series of titles. The game is meticulously researched and provides as accurate a view of warfare in the desert as has yet appeared, yet it is also one of the most accessible tactical games ever published. The &ldquo;Jump-Start&quot; rules folder provides basics and two scenarios that can be played within a half hour of opening the box. And &quot;design-your-own&quot; scenario rules enable players to explore endless possibilities. Game components include: 16 five-color 11x17&quot; geomorphlc maps; 800 die-cut counters and markers; complete game charts.

Twelve Moai tokens are placed to the side, and the Make Make figure is placed in the center of the game board, which has a trapezoidal-shaped hex grid on it, with the intersection of any three hexes (called &quot;territories&quot;) being marked as a ceremonial ground. The six territories surrounding Make Make are &quot;sacred territories&quot;.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of a dominance phase, then a ceremonial phase. In the dominance phase, each player takes one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take control of a neutral territory by placing one or more of your dominance tokens on this hex, whether with or without your chief; a chief is worth three dominance tokens.&#10;    Take control of a territory owned by another player by placing more dominance tokens in this hex than they have; the other player returns all of their tokens to their reserve.&#10;    Withdraw from a territory by returning all but one dominance token to your reserve.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you ever control at least three sacred territories and more sacred territories than each other player, then you gain control of Make Make (possibly from another player), placing the figure in front of you. No player can place tokens in the central space, even after Make Make has been claimed.&#10;&#10;During the ceremonial phase, if you control a territory and control all of its surrounding territories and have your chief token and at least Tangata Manu on these territories, then you return tokens on this surrounded territory to your reserve and place a Moai on this territory instead. A territory with a Moai on it is considered to be controlled by all clans, and a Moai cannot be removed from the game board.&#10;&#10;Next in the ceremonial phase, if you have control of three territories surrounding a ceremonial ground, you place one of your Tangata Manu tokens on this ceremonial ground. If you lose control of one of these territories, remove the Tangata Manu from the board and return it to your reserve.&#10;&#10;If you have all five of your Tangata Manu tokens on the board and you have the Make Make token in front of you, you win instantly.&#10;&#10;",

Four of them are under the protection of the great admirals; the other sixteen ports will each be controlled by three countries at the end of the game. In order to control a port, the countries have to make a successful attack on (or defense of) the port in the port siege.&#10;&#10;During the game, there will be one siege for each single port. In each siege, three countries will attack the port while the other three countries are on the defensive. The structure of coalitions is random and different each time. Since the power of the countries are equal to each other, the allies which are supported by the corsairs will be victorious.&#10;&#10;The corsairs make their collective decision about which coalition it will support by voting. Naturally each player has to vote according to their secret mission but they cannot make it openly. Because the other players can make blackmail if the secret mission of any player is revealed. If the voting is done openly, their secret mission will be exposed and they will be open to blackmail by other players.&#10;At the end of the game, the country who controls the highest number of adjoining ports will be victorious. Automatically the players who support this country will get the most victory points. However, the successful blackmails have a big impact on the final score as well.&#10;&#10;",

When you say a syllable, you can also make a gesture of the 3 that are on the table (the next player repeats a syllable, has to say a syllable with another vowel, change the direction of the game, etc.)&#10;&#10;When a player makes a mistake in saying his syllable, the round ends and takes one of the 12 unused gesture cards. Each card has 1-3 pickles. The player with the fewest pickles at the end of the game will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

While players will not interact directly, their choices greatly influence each other. Each game is unique as optimal play requires players respond to the context of movement choices and positioning. Becoming great at Triora will require predicting your opponents' choices as each witch seeks in their own way to take the most vengeance and lead the coven into its next era.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tomb of Four Kings is a fantasy adventure card game for a single player using a standard 52 deck of playing cards and one joker. With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore a dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain skills, even use magic. But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out you will be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find the tomb hoards of four ancient kings, collect as much additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive.&#10;&#10;The spread is the standard layout for the game. At the top of the spread is an area where you play torches (A), as they appear. In the middle of the spread is the dungeon area itself. Turns descending into the dungeon are played in a row from left to right. This row is called the delve. The turns ascending from the depths of the dungeon are played underneath the delve from right to left, with one turn for each turn of the delve except the turn-around point. This is called the retreat. Below the dungeon area, from left to right are a discard area, a hit point counter, and a hand where you collect your treasure, tomb hoards, skill cards, and magic scroll.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns. Each turn, you play a series of cards in the dungeon area. The turn represents an encounter as you explore the vast and sprawling dungeon. Layer the cards in a column while the turn is active. When the turn is over, stack those cards face down before moving on to the next turn. Each turn starts by playing cards from the deck until an encounter card appears.&#10;&#10;If you make it out of the dungeon alive, add up all the treasure in your hand.  If you found all four kings and survived, you have won the game, regardless of points. Multiply total points by 100 to calculate the value of your treasure in gold pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The French and Indian War ended the French Empire in Canada; the American Revolution ended the British Empire in the 13 American colonies. An additional bonus scenario covers the War of Jenkin's Ear between Spanish Florida and British Georgia. Freely available post publication scenarios cover Lord Dunmore's War, the Chickasaw Wars, Queen Anne's War, King William's War as well as variant starts and political situations for the three wars in the published game.&#10;&#10;Each End of Empire game turn represents two months time. Each year consists of one spring turn, two summer turns, one fall turn, and two winter turns. Each hex is approximately 20 miles across. Units are mostly regiments but a few represent other sizes, each step represents approximately 250 men.&#10;&#10;End of Empire features two maps showing eastern North America. Each hex or town contains natural and/or man-made features that can effect the movement of units and the combat between units.&#10;&#10;End of Empire is an Epic game and perhaps the most detailed coverage of the critical period that saw the Empires of England, France, and Spain exit North America and the rise of the United States of America.

Six of eight village tiles are placed in a row, with three of the tiles tilted 90&ordm; to show that they're out of play; each tile has a unique scoring rule on it, and that rule will apply for all of a player's totem poles if he acquires that tile.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first draws one totem pole from the bag; the game includes 21 totem pole pieces: one eagle, two chiefs, three tomahawks, four animal skins, five teepees and six suns. The player then either places one of his totem pole pieces on an available village tile OR places one of his headdresses on an existing totem pole to claim it; in the latter case, he places this tile in front of himself and tilts the next village tile in line (if any) to make it available for play.&#10;&#10;Once all six poles have been claimed, the players tally their score based on the rules on their tiles, e.g. score 3 points per animal skin on all of your poles or score 2 points per piece for your tallest pole. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the half-century after Columbus, small bands of daring Spanish adventurers conquered Central and South America, destroying the huge armies of long-established native empires in the process. Some won great fortunes in gold, while many others only died an early death. These men were The Conquistadors. In this partly card-driven, partly procedural game &mdash;a brand-new design from Jon Southard &mdash; one to five players each control a group of conquistadors, trying to discover and loot the civilizations of the Americas and end up with the most gold and power.&#10;&#10;A game of The Conquistadors begins with the outline of Central and South America as known in 1520. Your first task will be to seek out and discover the great Indian cities and empires -- which may appear in their historical locations, or in quite different places. Once you discover where the cities and empires are, it is time to gather gold. You might battle and plunder the Indians, or your best plan may be to attempt diplomacy and enlist them as allies -- especially if you have an Indian interpreter in your expedition. Like Francisco Pizarro, you might try a Sudden Shock Attack to capture a native king and extort a fat ransom. Always you must be sure to keep the Governor happy, or he may issue a warrant for your arrest. Beware of native uprisings, painted warriors, and poisoned darts around the next corner, and watch out for defection in your own ranks. If you fall behind in the race for gold, you might try to descend the Amazon or discover the Fountain of Youth. And when you are really in a tight place, perhaps you can appeal to Mano de Dios (the Hand of God) to bail you out.&#10;&#10;The Conquistadors is playable by from 1 to 5 players, with an introductory Basic Game, a more involved Standard Game, and some optional rules. While the normal game system requires 2 or more players, solitaire play is enabled by a special solitaire module.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;     Complexity: Low to Medium  3/4/5 out of 10 (Basic/Standard/plus Optional Rules)&#10;     Solitaire Suitability: High (solitaire scenario), Low (other scenarios)&#10;     Time Scale: variable, one turn = 3 to 18 months&#10;     Map Scale: abstract, point-to-point area map covers Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru&#10;     Unit Scale: Individual leaders, 3 to 25 Spanish troops, up to several thousand Indian troops&#10;     Players: one or two&#10;     Playing Time: three hours (Basic Game), four to six hours (Standard Game)&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;Two Maps &ndash; each approximately 28 x 20&quot;&#10;Two Countersheets (5/8&rdquo; size)&#10;Deck of 130 Strategy/Conquistador Cards&#10;Deck of 26 Asset Cards&#10;Rules booklet&#10;Four Player Aid Cards&#10;One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Sweet Spot is the first title of the sports trilogy by Medieval Lords, and is a tactical card game that sees players take on the role of a tennis pro battling it out in intense singles or doubles matches.&#10;&#10;There are three types of decks in the game: Service, Return and Tactic. Players have to play the right card at the right situation as they rally it out on the court. But beware &mdash; stamina management is a critical part of the game! If you are not careful enough, you might end up breathless too quickly.&#10;&#10;Sweet Spot uses a uniquely designed 'numbers system' to simulate the tennis ball's position and allows players to feel a realistic strength control of their swings where they can literally hit the ball lightly or drive it down hard. Powerful Tactic cards can tilt the balance and are at the same time highly thematic - Bench allows one to regain more stamina in between rallies, Crowd Cheering allows one to perform better at critical moments and Egg Shot hits the ball so high in the sky that the opponent cannot take an accurate read on its position when it comes down.&#10;&#10;The game features more than eight characters with unique character abilities, and over thirty different famous moves in the tennis world. It also adds an additional layer of intensity with its hidden card mechanism that will keep players on their toes as they try to predict whether a ball was given a spin or not, and even then, whether it was a topspin or an underspin...&#10;&#10;",

Or Heidi and Ada Lovelace overcome a Kraken? Can Nzinga and Mary Seacole deal with the Martian Robots from War of the Worlds?&#10;&#10;Library Labyrinth is a co-operative board game set in a cursed library that plays in about 45-60 minutes for 2-5 players and around 30 minutes as a solo game. The play space is a grid of 25 octagonal tiles that can rotate and flip, revealing (and changing) parts of the library. Some tiles spawn literary terrors, which players need to defeat by drafting different book cards from their hands. These book cards each feature a fictional or historical woman with a combination of six different skills. Team up different cards to defeat specific terrors, then travel through the library to place the terrors back on the correct shelves. The curse is still at work in the library, however, undoing your good work, so make sure that you don't run out of time or let the library become overwhelmed...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on your turn you can pick up cards, trade cards, flip or rotate floor tiles, move down a lit path (as shown on the floor tiles), capture a terror, or put a terror back in the right shelf. You have three actions available with the option to donate one action to another player. After each player turn, a curse disturbance card is drawn, which disrupts the playing area by rotating a tile or spawning a new terror. When all six shelves have been filled with a captured terror, you win; if the deck of curse cards runs out or six terrors are left on the library floor before this happens, the game is lost.&#10;&#10;Library Labyrinth is a quick game leading to ridiculous character mash-ups. Of course Alice in Wonderland and Marie Curie can deal with the Big Bad Wolf! The game can also scale between a game suitable for ten-year-olds and a fiendish puzzle. Floor tiles can be swapped out to make a harder grid, more difficult monsters can be used, or the amount of time can be reduced. Each game also comes with a booklet about the characters and the literary terrors in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tien Zi Que (TZQ) is an entertaining pocket MahJong for two. It uses a unique selection of MahJong cards, and each card has an added color code (blue, green, red, white or black) for special scoring.  With exceptional game play, TZQ brings you more fun and strategy than the traditional MahJong. All you need is 5 cards on hand and little or no MahJong knowledge to play.&#10;&#10;Tien Zi stands for son of the god, and it is also another name for the emperor of China. &#10;Que stands for Sparrow.&#10;&#10;Goal / Winning the Game&#10;After creating a Set, the winning player chooses to keep one of the cards for end of the Round scoring.  When one player completes five Sets, he calls MahJong and wins the Round immediately.  He then uses the one card from each Set to score. Players' points are accumulated after every winning round; the game is played to 4 rounds.&#10;&#10;Components: 54 cards&#10;&#10;Combines with:&#10;Tien Zi Que: White Dragon, TZQ Red Dragon, and TZQ Green Dragon. Mix any two TZQ games for 3-4 player game, and mix any three TZQ games for 5-6 player game.&#10;&#10;",

Vast hordes of the stuff are dredged up from the depths via daemonic mining machinery that hungers for blood. In these places of infernal industry, warbands devoted to the Ruinous Powers fight to claim great hauls of varanite, using the environment itself as a weapon to annihilate their rivals and claim victory.&#10;&#10;Warcry is a game of skirmish-scale battles with larger-than-life action and strategy. Set in the brutal environment of the Eightpoints, rival warbands fight not for survival but for glory and the attention of cruel warlords.

With a strong focus on narrative gameplay, you&rsquo;ll create your own warband that vies for territory, wealth, and notoriety. Over time, your fighters will grow, earning new skills and picking up the battle scars to show they&rsquo;re willing to risk it all. Red Harvest sheds light on the grim existence of those who labour for their dark masters, putting their lives on the line for the merest chance at success and throwing their rivals into the gaping maw of defeat if it means they&rsquo;ll improve their own situation.&#10;&#10;This loaded boxed set contains:&#10;&#10;     104-page Red Harvest book &ndash; laying out the setting of the Eightpoints and varanite delves, the rules of the game, plus enough campaigns and quests to keep you playing for ages&#10;     Darkoath Savagers &ndash; 10 brutal warriors that value strength above all else and revel in bloodshed.

    "Description": "Paleontologists - A Roll-and-Write game&#10;&#10;Overview: You are a paleontologist, trying to dig up the best fossils to earn the most points! &#10;Items needed: 2 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;The game is played over 20 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points by digging up fossils. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, using the dice however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to draw a shape with a certain dig type on the dig site. You dig up a fossil when it is completely surrounded (orthogonally) by shapes you have drawn.&#10;&#10;- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference. Of the two dice rolled, one will be used to determine which shape and the other die will be used to determine the type of dig.&#10;&#10;- Use dice to choose a shape and a dig type&#10;&#10;Choosing the shape: Using one of the dice, choose one of the pentomino shapes coordinated with that number. There are twelve shapes, with a choice of two shapes with each die-face number.&#10;&#10;Choosing the dig type: Using the other die, determine the dig type. There are three dig types.&#10;&#10;Example: You roll a 2 and a 5. You can choose one shape, and can choose from four shapes; the two shapes next to the 2 and the two shapes next to the 5. You also have a choice between two dig types; the V from the 2 that was rolled or the diagonal lines from the 5 that was rolled. You decide the best play for your current dig site is to choose the L shape with the 5 die and then use the V dig type with the 2 die.&#10;&#10;- Draw shape and fill that shape in with the Dig type&#10;Shapes can be mirrored, turned, and flipped, as long as they are still the same shape.&#10;Shapes can only be placed in open, non-fossil spaces. You can place shapes over the bonus star. If you do, choose and circle one of the bonuses to gain (you can use bonuses in future rounds).&#10;&#10;- Check to see if you dig up a Fossil(s) - Once a fossil is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right. Not diagonally) then you score that fossil! Circle the number in a lower scoring area that corresponds to the fossil you dug up. If you use all of the same dig type for a fossil, you earn bonus points.&#10;&#10;Repeat these steps each round (rolling 2 dice and placing a shape with a dig type) until 20 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;- Earning Bonus points for using the same Dig Type - if you were able to use the same dig type for a fossil, you also gain the scoring bonus. Circle the extra smaller circle with the +number. If there is more than one dig type used for a fossil, you cannot gain the bonus.&#10;&#10;- Bonus Stars - when you place a shape over a bonus star, you gain a bonus! Choose one of the four bonuses at the top-left of the page. The four types of bonuses are One Square Anywhere, Switch Shape, Switch Dig Type, and +1 Point. Each bonus can be gained up to four times in one game.&#10;&#10;One Square Anywhere - At any time, place a 1x1 square on any empty square that does not contain a bonus star. Fill in the square (as the dig type). You cannot get the dig type bonus score when a filled-in square is used to dig up that fossil.&#10;&#10;Switch Shape - Choose any shape for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;Switch Dig Type - Choose any dig type for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;+ 1 Point - Worth one point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: After you have completed the 20th roll/round, total your points earned from each fossil dug up, adding in bonuses from fossils dug up with the same dig type, and finally adding points if circled from bonus stars. The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
