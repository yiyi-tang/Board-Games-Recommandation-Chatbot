    "Description": "(from Decision Games website:)&#10;&#10;Highway to the Reich is a tactical simulation of the largest airborne operation in history. Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.&#10;&#10;The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.&#10;&#10;The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.&#10;&#10;The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.&#10;&#10;Optional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  &#10;   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wolfgang Kramer's Flash 10 is a quick-playing take on the Rack-O game system, with players trying to arrange cards in numerical order &ndash; but doing so all at the same time.&#10;&#10;The card deck includes 120 cards, twenty showing a thunderstorm and the other hundred numbered 0-99, with each card ending in 0 or 5 showing a lightning bolt. Someone shuffles the deck, then each player receives ten cards face down, which they place in a row in front of them. Playing simultaneously and as quickly as possible, players reveal these cards (without rearranging them), then start taking cards one at a time from those scattered in the center of the table and placing them on one of the ten cards in front of them, thereby creating stacks of cards as the game progresses. If a player draws a thunderstorm card, she can place it on any stack.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has ten number cards in ascending order from left to right, she yells &quot;Stop!&quot; and ends the round. If she's correct, she scores 10 points, plus 2 points for ending the round. Each other player scores points for the number of cards in order starting from their left stack. In addition, each card with a lightning bolt (whether in order or not) is worth 1 point, while each thunderstorm card is worth -1 point. Players then shuffle the cards and start another round. Whoever reaches 50 or more points first wins!&#10;&#10;Flash 10 includes two variants. In one, players can end the round even if they have one or more thunderstorm cards in their row. In the second, players use nine cards instead of ten, and they must arrange their cards in ascending, then descending order with the fifth card in the row serving as the turning point.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kaiserkrieg! (&lsquo;Emperor&rsquo;s War&rsquo;) is a Strategic level Solitaire wargame of the First World War of 1914-1918. As the player, you control the Central Powers (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;; Germany, AustriaHungary, Turkey and Bulgaria). The game&rsquo;s automatic systems direct the efforts of the Entente Powers (&ldquo;EP&rdquo;; France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Serbia, the United States, and their minor allies) who are trying to defeat you. As in many of my games, you play the &ldquo;bad guys.&rdquo; For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, Imperial Germany and its main ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, are usually treated as one political entity in the game. The flags on the &ldquo;City&rdquo; Tiles are for decoration. In contrast to my other games, space precludes the addition of many historical notes in this rulebook. If you run across a name or historical reference that is new to you, Google is your friend! The heart of the game is its depiction of the ground war, which saw the battlefield deaths of some ten million soldiers. Kaiserkrieg&rsquo;s treatment can be traced back to Darin Leviloff&rsquo;s inspired Israeli Independence (2008) and the &ldquo;States of Siege&rdquo; system it started. The evolutionary leap in Kaiserkrieg! is the shift from the old &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; States of Siege model &ndash; where enemy forces converge on your central position along clearly defined lines of advance &ndash; to a new &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; model where enemy forces mass in separate regions around you, to eventually achieve an advantage in size that threatens your overall position. This adaptation allows Leviloff&rsquo;s original concept to more closely simulate the trench warfare realities of World War I on the continental level. The game also depicts the epic naval struggle of proGerman blockade runners trying to evade fleets of British cruisers. Many historians identify the failure to outwit the British naval blockade as the main reason for Germany&rsquo;s defeat in the war. The &lsquo;sideshow&rsquo; war in the Near East, where Germany&rsquo;s Ottoman Turkish ally was assailed by Russia and the British Empire &ndash; including a massive army of Indian troops &ndash; is played with a simplified version of the game system (12.0). This theater also includes East Africa, where a German-led Black African army (the Askari) held out against Indian and British Empire forces even after the Germans in Europe had surrendered! The game is an extremely strategic view of the conflict. Points are dramatically simplified to make it playable and to emphasize the &ldquo;cool stuff&rdquo; of World War I, like Zeppelins, trenches, and U-boats.&#10;&#10;Kaiserkrieg! is not a detailed historical simulation, but a fun and challenging game covering the salient themes of the actual conflict while whetting the player&rsquo;s appetite for more detailed treatments of this fascinating war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vive l'Empereur Series - Vol. VIII&#10;Quatre Batailles en Espagne (Four battles in Spain)&#10;Peninsular War, 1808-1814&#10;&#10;Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.&#10;&#10;Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.&#10;&#10;Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.&#10;&#10;Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.&#10;&#10;(source: Legion Games website)&#10;&#10;",

Moves follow that of traditional chess, with a few variations--most notably that pawns may move orthogonally (and capture diagonally) toward the center of the board.&#10;&#10;When a player's piece is on a colored square, she controls the pieces of that color. Players can control multiple colors at once, either with a number of their own pieces, or through a &quot;chain&quot; of pieces. For example, if the white player has her pawn on a red square, and then moves a red pawn to the blue square, then she controls both red and blue.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to checkmate the opposing king.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - VIP&quot; contains historical events related to very important persons, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Take real-life ranching to the tabletop as you choose from a wide variety of actual horses, hire highly skilled hands, and expand your property by laying claim to some of the most beautiful land in the west.&#10;&#10;With 3 levels of difficulty, Fantasy Ranch is a great game whether you're a greenhorn or grizzled. So saddle up your dream horse, compete in the most thrilling competitions, and use your winnings to build yourself the perfect Fantasy Ranch!&#10;&#10;Fantasy Ranch is played over 5 rounds simulating a horse show season. Each round you will go to shows and try to build your ranch into the best around. Start by drafting a stable of 4 Horse cards. Choose from one of 6 double sided Ranch tiles where your horses will live - watch your stable grow with custom horse meeples.&#10;&#10;On your turn select from 3 different actions to continue building your ranch. You can buy land,&nbsp; buy more horses or farm your ranch. Build up your property from a simple homestead to a wealthy land owner. Don't buy more than you can control or your neighbor might decide to move in and take it over.&#10;&#10;Hire employees which give you additional actions or powers to help you meet your goals. Twist of Fate cards give you rewards if you can complete the requirements but act fast since other players could beat you to them.&#10;&#10;Win shows by rolling dice based on your horses' show skills.

The game mixes area control with resource management to create a light weight fun intro game.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game!

However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;When it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are &quot;thieves&quot; with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, &quot;tax collectors&quot; who steal hand held cards and the &quot;pharaoh&quot; who can prevent these actions from taking place!&#10;&#10;",

This simple scoring system applies a certain pressure: push your luck and gamble to be the first to answer perhaps a bit quicker than you had wanted.&#10;&#10;Laugh with those at the table as you fumble and bumble when challenging your sense of touch with TOUCH IT!&#10;&#10;",

It was fought between Polish army commanded by general Jan Skrzynecki and Russian army commanded by field marshal Ivan Diebitsch. The battle was the final part of the operation of Polish army against Russian Imperial Guard. The meeting near Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka was a bit suprising for both sides, especially for Poles who didn&rsquo;t expect such quick appearance of Russian forces near their positions. Polish army was divided into two parts. The first part was situated on the eastern bank of the river Narew. The second, larger part was put on the western bank of the river. In Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka there were two bridges connecting both banks of the river (one of them was pontoon bridge).&#10;&#10;The first part of the battle was fought on the eastern bank of Narew. Polish forces tried to slow down an assault of Russians and withdraw to the western bank. Unfortunately, in consequence of earlier orders, one of Polish infantry brigades commanded by general Bogus&#197;&#130;awski was stayed to defend town Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka (situated on the eastern bank of the river), and there attacked by overwhelming Russians and partially routed, partially destroyed. Russians took control over Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka at noon. Then some Russian grenadier battalions decided to cross the river through the bridges to create a bridgehead for further operations. So started the second part of the battle. Polish main army began attacks to destroy Russian bridgehead and both brigdes to prevent main body of Russian army to cross the river. There were few attacks. At first they were not properly coordinated. Russian small forces on the bridgehead was supported by powerful artillery situated on the eastern bank of the river which was higher than western bank and allowed crossing fire (Russians formed two great batteries, one to the north and one to the south of Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka, and were shooting over own units on the western bank).&#10;&#10;In the later afternoon Polish attacks became more coordinated. Russians tried to gain more terrain, but it moved them out of the range of their supporting artillery and encouraged Polish army to make last, most powerful attack, which was stopped near to the river. The battle ended a famous charge of Polish horse artillery battery commanded by lt. col. J. Bem, which caused great chaos in the Russian forces and discouraged Russians to make general cavalry attack on Polish army in the end of the battle as they were used to do in the Napoleonic Wars. When battle ended, both sides had similar casualties (about 6 000 killed, wounded etc.). The battle is considered Polish army defeat because it left the battlefield and during the night and the next day started retreat, not chased by Russians who first weren&rsquo;t sure they had won. The main effect of the battle for Poles was the fall of morale of soldiers and the upper command, which allowed Russians to take initiative in the later part of Polish-Russian War.&#10;&#10;Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831 contains three scenarios, with one made to introduce players to the system and two historical ones, showing both parts of the battlle. The game is quite complex, tending to show full spectrum of tactic of the Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic period, but in reasonably easy way. Basic game mechanic is similar to Igo/Ugo movement, but with two phases of movement: for cavalry and infantry, and two combat phases: for cavalry and infantry. Horse artillery is generally attached to cavalry and foot artillery is attached to infantry. Additional rules offer another movement systems but rather designed for further battles based on this rules, not for that one. Rules offer many possible reaction activities for non-active player during opposite player phase. Another rules feature is an unique combat calculation system based on traditional odds ratio but originally modified. The rules focuse on simulating cooperation of three kinds of weapon (infantry, cavalry and artillery) on the battlefield and showing different formations (column, line, square, skirmish, buildings defense). The playing time varies depending on the scenario, from 2-3 hours to whole day. It also depends on the players &ndash; the longest scenario can be finished very quickly by autowin.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- One mapsheet 96 x 68 cm &#10;- Nine sheets of die-cut counters (978 counters totally, most of them are markers)&#10;- One sheet of additional counters&#10;- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)&#10;- Three dices (D6)&#10;- Six sheets with tables and player aids&#10;- One sheet with units tables (alternative way of marking units loses)&#10;&#10;",

Bid for a worthwhile stick with only a 5mm difference.&#10;&#10;Players compete for sticks that are put on the table one by one. The more sticks you collect with a 5mm difference in length, the more you score, but don't get their size to close to them during a competition because you can't measure them except by your eye. While consulting with your money, consider carefully and decide whether to participate in the competition or pass. If someone runs out of money or someone competes for 8, it adds points to the score at the end of the game, but if a player can align 4 of the same length in the middle of the game, they can win immediately.

    "Description": "In November of 1950, the United Nations counteroffensive against the North Koreans seemed to be in the final stages of a mop-up. Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.&#10;&#10;Chinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.&#10;&#10;UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.&#10;&#10;Units in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.&#10;&#10;This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977. The 2009, Second Edition of Yalu will be a fully updated version of the game with all new graphics, all known errata included and some additional rule updates.&#10;&#10;Both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; components. Second Edition Yalu has both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; map and counters to provide some replay variability. The 1977 rules and the new rules will also be featured.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea, November 1950 - May 1951&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The great powers of Europe begin to mobilize their armies, initially believing that their potential opponents will back down at the show of strength.  Yet no one shrinks from the face of an increasingly inevitable war.&#10;&#10;The Germans move towards war according to the Schlieffen plan.  As chief of the pre-war German general staff, von Schlieffen envisions a powerful group of German armies (the Right Wing) quickly moving through Belgium and northern France to attack Paris from the rear, while weaker forces protect the German border with France.&#10;&#10;France mobilizes according to their own 'Plan 17'.  This offensive-minded plan calls for the bulk of French forces to quickly re-conquer those parts of France lost to Germany in 1870.  To do this, France masses her armies along the German border between Belgium and Switzerland.&#10;&#10;As the Schlieffen plan is executed, tiny Belgium is invaded by 4 separate German armies.  The Germans believe that the Belgians will either offer no resistance, or will quickly be swept aside by their might.  But Belgium does resist, fighting on in the face of hopeless odds, even as the Germans employ secret weapons like the massive Big Bertha guns.&#10;&#10;As events quickly unfold, Great Britain lands an expeditionary force in France to help defend Belgium and assist France.  It meets the German juggernaught as it pushes through Belgium.&#10;&#10;The French, meanwhile, incur huge losses when they execute 'Plan 17'.  They now rush to stop the Germans from reaching Paris.&#10;&#10;The plans of both sides fail, due to not only to mistakes in execution, but due to causes that could have been foreseen and acted upon.  As a result, neither side is able to achieve its objectives, and the consequences is the stalemate of trench warfare.&#10;&#10;The Schlieffen Plan covers the campaign in Belgium and France from August to November 1914.  In this simulation, you assume the role of the commander of either the German or Allied armies.  The forces available to you are the same that were available to the historical participants.  Bit it is up to you to make your own strategic decisions, and to execute your your own plans as you see fit.  This is your chance to prove that you could have done better, that you could have changed the course of history.&#10;&#10;This is the first in a series of simulations designed to interlock to allow you to simulate conflicts and campaigns from 1914 to the present and beyond across all of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.  Each simulation is self contained.  Yet, tied together, they will allow you to control all aspects of land, sea, &amp; air warfare.&#10;&#10;Scale is 20km/hex&#10;4 days per turn&#10;Unit Sizes: Division/Brigade&#10;560 Backprinted Counters&#10;&#10;Medium Complexity&#10;Very High Solitaire Suitability&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The topic of the game is the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.&#10; Players control the actual units that fought in the campaign. Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.&#10;&#10;The original game was published in 2004.  The 2016, Avalanche Press released an updated &quot;Player's Edition&quot;, more pieces, a larger map and more scenarios.  There are 200 playing pieces in the Player's Edition (the first edition had 140) and a 28x22-inch map (the first edition&rsquo;s was 22x17 inches) by Guy Riessen. There&rsquo;s an introductory scenario for the 1939 German invasion of Poland, but the main event is the 1941 Axis attack on the Soviet Union. There are additional scenarios built around Operation Barbarossa plus variations like Turkish intervention.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to providing corresponding resources, city tiles give their owners action tokens that can be used at any point of the game.&#10;     Red tiles are temples and altars that give players victory points. They are of different values (from 1 to 3 points) and require different combination of resources.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of three phases. First, the player must add a new tile from the stack to the common market. Then, he has the option of playing one of his tokens; these tokens are able to buy opponents' resources, pillage enemy tiles, transfer resources between tiles, and convert resources to victory points. Finally, the player must add a tile from the market to his domain. The game ends after all red tiles are added to the players' domains. Each player calculates victory points from his temples and tokens, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Since ancient times, the world has been ravaged by war. The wise foresee an age of horror approaching, for the spirit of the earth is sick, tainted by deadly sorcery in a great conflict ages past. Not that the warlords of this bloody era care, not while there is glory to be won, territory to be wrested from the enemy, foes to be slaughtered.&#10;&#10;Kings of War 2nd Edition is a hardback rulebook that contains the complete Kings of War history and rules. It features:&#10;- Rules written by Alessio Cavatore (Warhammer 40,000, Bolt Action) and the Mantic Rules Committee. Kings of War is a game for gamers, by gamers.&#10;- Compelling new background, art and photography that invoke a powerful realm of swords and sorcery.&#10;- Elegant easy-to-learn rules, balanced and playtested by the community for casual and tournament play.&#10;- New Magic Spells and Artefacts&#10;- Eleven Force Lists upgraded with new units, including Forces of the Abyss, Forces of Nature, Undead, Dwarfs, Elves, Abyssal Dwarfs, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Basileans and the Kingdoms of Men.&#10;&#10;Kings of War is the miniatures wargame from Mantic Games. Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.&#10;&#10;Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.&#10;&#10;Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2012, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for many factions are also available for download. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdom of Men (Medieval Humans), Basileans (Clerical army with saints and angels), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes.&#10;An expansion includes the complete Ogre army list, while additional faction lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood, Salamander (humanoid lizards) Armies, The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undeads... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Club Stories is a scenario based tactical board game in which a story is told. Your story. You are an unknown football (soccer) expert like everyone else. But you got the chance to run a club. A very small club, of course. But hey, you got to start at the bottom.&#10;&#10;Club Stories is a game for 1 or 2 players. You play solo or co-op. You try to defeat the 5 different scenarios in the right order. Every next scenario has its own story. If you win it, you move on to the next scenario. You may move on to a bigger club. Of course you can also replay the scenario&lsquo;s to defeat your high score and reach higher levels of professionalism.&#10;&#10;The goal of every scenario is to reach a certain level. In the 1st scenario you have to reach the level of unexperienced professional manager. If you earn enough manager points during season (respect) you win the scenario. But every scenario has different season goals. Reaching these goals, may help you earn the manager points. For example, In the 1st scenario you try to prevend relegation, in the 2nd you try to get rid of all the corruption and in the 5th scenario you want to finish your new stadium in time.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 8-10 rounds, depending on which scenario you play. Every turn you use 6 dice to plan your actions. There is a realistic push-your-luck system in the game which fits to the theme very well. You can push your chance up to 100%.&#10;&#10;Your turn always starts with a board meeting. Your 3 board members will make a decision about a dilemma. Choose your board members well, because they have different opinions about a football club. You may want to attend the meeting and use your dice to influence decisions. After this, you plan your actions. Hire players, staff, send scouts to watch opponents or players, train tactics, hire a sponsor, etc.&#10;&#10;You try to keep the markers on the 4 tracks on the board (income, fitness, morale and popularity) as high as possible. Otherwise, bad things may happen. For example, if your morale is low, your players may get suspended more often. After planning your actions, you choose tactics, select your team and play the match. If your form is high, you may end up high in the league. But bigger clubs will be intested in your players more often. Can you convince them to stay? There is a lot going on in Club Stories.&#10;&#10;",

To attack, select one of your cards, then choose any one of your opponent&rsquo;s cards. &#10;6. Both cards are flipped over and the higher number after any modifiers wins. Special abilities or modifiers are shown on the bottom of each card. If the numbers are equal, both cards are defeated.&#10;7. After the attack is finished, the losing card is discarded and the winning card flips back over, then it is the next players turn.

    "Description": "Gnadenlos! (Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.&#10;&#10;",

This is the time that saw dinosaurs first appear, dominate the world, and go extinct (except for some groups of avian dinosaurs, i.e., birds). However, dinosaurs weren&rsquo;t the only animals of the Mesozoic; they shared their habitats with amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and others.&#10;&#10;In Lands of the Mesozoic, 1 to 4 players will create and manage their own Mesozoic ecosystems using 3 main types of cards that symbolize the different levels of the food chain.  The game comes with over 120 individual cards, all drawn by award winning Ukranian paleo-artist Sergey Krasovskiy.&#10;&#10;Players will first lay down Land cards that represent the habitats that provide shelter and  plant/insect/fish food. Land cards in play are used to pay for the cost of Herbivore cards. These are the animals using the  resources generated in those specific types of lands.&#10;&#10;In turn, Herbivore cards in play can generate the resources necessary for playing Carnivore cards. These are the animals at the top of the food chain, and they control the population size of herbivore  species in the ecosystem.&#10;&#10;All 3 types of cards need to be in balance for the ecosystem to be sustainable in the long term. However, competition between species and the shifting nature of the surface of the Earth, will trigger  extinction events of animals and habitats that will open niches for new species to appear and  spread.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players will score points for played cards, collected Victory Point Tokens, and achieved common and personal goals. The winner is the player with the most points after 3 periods of 7, 6, and 5 rounds respectively.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Complete routes with a variety of buildings to earn credit! Achieve your secret objectives to win extra credit at the end of the game. The player with the most credit wins!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Each player has their own personal color-coded deck of Rail Cards. Each Rail Card features two lines and two terminals in various combinations, thus all presenting six different outlets with varying connections or dead ends amongst them. Each card also features two different buildings, each situated on either of the two lines. (There are five different types of buildings.)&#10;&#10;Players take turns laying down one card at a time, adjacent to existing cards, to build the map of the city. Cards must be placed in a &quot;brick&quot; pattern. If placed so that the short sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be in a straight line. However, if placed so that the long sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be off-set. In this manner, a single card may have up to six adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;There is another limit to placement: Cards may not be placed outside of the city limits. This is a final shape of the city determined by the number of players. Though you know what shape the city will take at the end of the game, there is no &quot;board&quot; which predefines the &quot;center&quot; of the city. The city grows and shifts with each new card played. Controlling the growth and logic of the city is fundamental to strategic play.&#10;&#10;Scoring and Victory:&#10;Score &quot;credit&quot; by having the most segments of your color comprising a complete route. A route is complete when it is capped at both ends by a terminal or when it is made into a loop. Score 1 credit for each different type of building on a complete route. Extra credits may be scored by completing secret objectives, most of which require the city to meet certain configurations.&#10;&#10;",

The rules are deliberately simple, because of the scale and with the aim of giving the players the wherewithal for relatively short and fluid games.&#10;&#10;The campaign of 1813 is the theme chosen for the revival of the Jours de Gloire Campaign series (Vae Victis n&deg;41, n&deg;47 and n&deg;52), whose rules have been upgraded to a Version 2.0 for this. occasion.&#10;&#10;This game has 5 scenarios, focusing on the Germany campaigns of 1813 :&#10;Scenario 1: Waiting For the Emperor (March and April 1813)&#10;Scenario 2: From L&uuml;tzen to Bautzen (April and May 1813)&#10;Scenario 3: The Spring Campaign (March to May 1813)&#10;Scenario 4: The Campaign of Leipzig (September to October 1813&#10;Scenario 5: The German Campaign (February to November 1813)&#10;&#10;There are also specific and optional rules or &quot;what-if ?&quot; situations for each scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game includes one map (size A1 : 84cm * 59cm - 33in * 23.5in), 216 die-cut counters, a booklet containing rules and scenarios, player aids and 24 playing cards.&#10;&#10;Historical context: After the disaster of the Russian campaign, the debris of the Grande Arm&eacute;e had abandoned Berlin and retired behind the left bank of the Elbe. Napol&eacute;on was able to reconstitute an army of 300,000 men by summoning to the colors those young soldiers who soon came to be called by the name &laquo; Marie-Louise &raquo;. Europe formed a coalition against France: Prussia and Russia wanted to crush Napol&eacute;on permanently. Despite his victories during the spring and summer, Austria soon joined the side of the Empire&rsquo;s enemies. Gigantic maneuvers and great battles followed one after the other within the triangle formed by Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Whereas his victories were no longer decisive, Napol&eacute;on knew now that a single defeat could pull down his Empire !&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the perspective of Romans, Christians, Jews, or a Coalition of outside cultures (Germanic Tribes, Goths, &amp; Parthians) in an effort to accomplish their faction&rsquo;s unique objectives using asymmetric advantages. Mechanically, Soul of the Empire uses dice-driven action selection, deterministic combat with faction effects, culturally-based Power decks, and an objective point system to heighten tension between the factions. Thematically, Soul of the Empire explores the tensions between and motivations behind the four dominant worldviews of the period. Rome is at the height of it&rsquo;s power, but is overextended in the face of both internal divisions and external challengers. Jews zealously protect their spiritual heritage from a rapidly spreading sect, and chafe under the thumb of an increasingly oppressive Rome. The Coalition struggles to survive beset by relentless Roman expansion, harsh environments, and confusing beliefs which threaten the old ways. Meanwhile, Christians find their strength in weakness, victory in defeat, and purpose in the very people who persecute them mercilessly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Beyond the slope, they can begin to see the fire lights of the Prussians in the valley. The Saxon General Tauenzien now occupies the Dornberg after earlier relinquishing the Landgrafenberg and, more critically, the bridge over the Saale at Napoleon's back. After studying the glow of Prussian campfires Napoleon correctly surmised the entire Prussian Army was nearby. He mistakenly assumed, however, they were preparing to fight him here. This almost proved fatal for Marshal Davout, approaching from the east. For on the morrow, while Napoleon and the majority of the French fight here, Davout's III Corps alone will engage the bulk of the Prussian Army at Auerstadt.&#10;&#10;1806: Rossbach Avenged includes:&#10;   Rules: Six Days of Glory System &#10;Players: Two (or two teams) &#10;Scenarios: Nine, from meeting engagements to full campaign (the Campaign Scenario can begin on any day.) &#10;Maps: Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color maps designed by Joe Youst &#10;Counters: 280 two sided units by Rodger MacGowan &#10;Quick Set-up: one 11 x17 OB Display for each player allows you to set-up (or replay) the entire campaign day-by-day. &#10; GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System  &#10;- scale = 1,600m/hex, &#10;- time = 6 hours/GT, &#10;- strength = 800-1,000 men/SP.&#10;&#10;",

These were days of wine and roses: interpretation centers in every town, an airport in every city, 40-year mortgages, construction workers earning salaries like if they were Ministers, Olympic dreams, high-speed trains and golf resorts.&#10;&#10;You'll play as the middleman, the one that tricks politicians and building companies into winning the citizen's favor and make some good profit out of some piece of land no one cares about.&#10;&#10;Step by step, by speculating, you'll finally reach the upper echelons, will carry on monumental projects and your profit will grow more and more... Until the taxpayer's money runs out; then, the one who has been able to hide and park the bigger amount of their money in offshore tax havens, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ladrillazo includes more than 150 cards with real people and projects carefully documented which depict faithfully Spain during this time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Ladrillazo es un juego hist&oacute;rico que te traslada a la burbuja inmobiliaria de la primera d&eacute;cada del siglo XXI.

Players can maximize their points by capturing higher value Tiles, but also by collecting specific sets of Tiles worth extra bonus points. The expansion package Equilibrium adds additional opportunities to add points to one&rsquo;s score by gaining individual Equilibrium Cards.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of two stages &ndash; one where each player secretly and simultaneously selects the Tiles he wants to capture &ndash; and another where players reveal their selection and interact. Be careful &ndash; Envyra is not a game of chance. The player that best anticipates his opponents&rsquo; moves and strategically adjusts in mid-play has the best chance to be the winner. The game ends when the End Tile is captured. Each player can try to end the game when it is most advantageous to him &ndash; at that moment he has the most points &ndash; making the game more dynamic and strategic. When the game ends, the player with the most points is the winner. If multiple players end with the same point total, the player who gained the most points through collecting specific sets is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Boyd, &ldquo;Patterns of Conflict&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#10;At 0400 Zulu Time, July 24 1985, Warsaw Pact forces cross the Inner German Border and assault NATO positions in West Germany. The offensive in the North German Plain sector involves twelve divisions and has three main objectives: Deny NATO the access to the Baltic region, gain control of the West German ports on the North Sea, and support the advance of the Soviet armies in the BAOR sector.&#10;&#10;Taking its roots from SPI&rsquo;s Central Front and NATO: Division Commander, Die Festung Hamburg is the third module of the C3 series, focused on Command, Control and Communication and pioneered by Less Than 60 Miles - one of the five nominees for the 2019 Charles Roberts Awards as Best Post-WW2, Cold War, &amp; Hypothetical Era Board Wargame.&#10;&#10;Several typical wargame mechanics have been reinterpreted, and both sides must fight three equally dangerous foes: the enemy, their own plan and time. Even a simple action can quickly turn into a disaster when facing an opponent using more efficiently the real key to victory: the OODA Loop theorized by John Boyd in the early &lsquo;80s and used today as the basis for several military doctrines.&#10;&#10;Military doctrine, tactics and peculiarities for each side are represented, allowing a skilled commander to use his own strength points and exploit the enemy's weak ones.

    "Description": "The year is 2078. The worlds&rsquo; megacorporations straddle the sprawls of the Sixth World, goliaths that intimidate even nations as they suck in souls in their drive for the almighty nuyen. Between the cracks, shadowrunners carve out a living as deniable and disposable assets that megacorps fire at each other for datasteals, personnel extractions, or even wetwork. Whether casting manabolts of magic, riding the electrons of the Matrix with just the brain, or slinging good, old-fashioned flying lead while firing at speed enhanced by the latest in bio-engineering, runners live dangerously and hope their skills are good enough to let them survive another day.&#10;&#10;Encounters: Shadowrun is a 1-8 player fast-paced, pushed-your-luck dice and card game. Players take the role of Mr. Johnson, arranging the megacorps&rsquo; dirty work and adding new shadowrunners to their already-assembled teams. They send their teams into the shadows of the mean sprawl streets of the Sixth World, collecting though paydata to beat down their rivals. Grab some dice, make a team, and show &rsquo;em who&rsquo;s the boss.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first player to acquire &yen;30. &#10;Each player starts the game with (1) runner and 6 dice. At the start of your turn you flip over location card, that has effects aka breaks the rules, on every turn until a new environment card comes into play. You then flip over the top Event card form the deck and try and roll an exact match of the number on the card. If you succeed you place a die on the. You could stop then and receive &yen;1 or flip a card and continue to press your luck. If you fail the next player starts a new run with a chance to collect n the &yen; you forfeited.&#10;&#10;&yen; are used as victory points as well as currency to buy additional runners.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Landor Syndicate, a pirate alliance in an area of space controlled by the Lunar Orion Order, needs a new leader. The outgoing Supreme Admiral is looking for his replacement. Players take on the role of rival captains recruiting crews, capturing rival pirates, and collecting treasure.&#10;&#10;Pirate Tricks is a trick-taking game for 3 to 5 players with a unique scoring system. The game is played over three hands. Each hand has different scoring goals. Once the scoring cards are revealed, the players are dealt five cards.  Then players each bid on another 7 cards to complete their hands.&#10;&#10;As the players bid for cards, they will look to gain certain cards that will boost their scores. While taking tricks, the players will need to be mindful of the different factions of pirates as some will score higher than others or may be worth negative points. At the end of the hand the players will collect treasure based on how well they matched the treasure scoring card. During some hands the players will want to get as many tricks as possible, other hands they will want to have few to no tricks, or they may have to match a predicted number of tricks taken.&#10;&#10;Play continues for three hands. New scoring cards are revealed before each hand. After three hands, whichever player has gathered the most treasure will be proclaimed the next Supreme Admiral of the Landor Syndicate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a party game where players vote on 32 contenders in a NCAA tournament like bracket. A contender advances to the next round when they receive a majority of the votes of the players. The players vote based on a question asked. For example, the contenders in the first round might be &quot;Dolly Parton&quot; vs. &quot;street mime&quot;. The question might be, &quot;Who would you rather be for a day?&quot; All the players debate the match-up and then all openly vote on it. Play continues like this for each match-up.&#10;&#10;Each player makes their picks, and gets their points based on what contender they believe will win the entire tourney(4), who will make it to the championship round(2 for each pick), who will make it to the final four (1 for each pick), and a bonus pick(4). The bonus pick is where each player tries to guess what one of the other players will choose as the winner of the tournament. The points for each pick is in parentheses.&#10;&#10;The contenders are drawn randomly from 500 tiles and placed on the bracket in four categories (including an example of one contender from each.)&#10;Arenas - aka &quot;Places&quot; - Jamaica&#10;Contenders - aka &quot;People&quot; - Mark Twain&#10;Moves - aka &quot;Actions&quot; - Showering&#10;Gear - aka &quot;Things&quot;- Cocktails&#10;&#10;After all the tiles are placed, a player draws a random &quot;Knockout&quot;card. This &quot;Knockout&quot; card is the question for the final, championship round. Once every player sees that question, they make their picks and place them in an envelope until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The object is make accurate picks as well as secretly convince the other players to pick your choices.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Building off of the streamlined 3-D movement engine of Saganami Island Tactical Simulator, 2nd Edition, Squadron Strike lets you build any ship, from any setting, in full 3-D glory&mdash;and then pit them against each other, in titanic battles for the fate of galaxies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Squadron Strike takes between 5 and 10 minutes per turn with 6 ships per side, and combines fast play with more tactical depth and scalable detail than any other 'construction ready' space combat game. It&rsquo;s suitable for Ages 12 and up.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In Squadron Strike, ships move in one of three movement modes, named for the number of Newton&rsquo;s Laws being obeyed; with these options you&rsquo;re not stuck with whatever movement mode the game designer liked - you can pick the one that works best for the setting you&rsquo;re trying to run in. You even have optional fuel rules (for both interstellar and tactical movement) to simulate the setting or TV series to whatever degree you like. You decide what reality level is appropriate for your level of fun.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You can design nearly everything in the game, from missiles, to beams, to fighters, to torpedoes. An original setting includes pre-built ships and weapons for people who don&rsquo;t want to get deeply into the customization process, but if you want it, you have complete control.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Automated tools do complete SSD generation for you, in Excel format, or with higher end features via web applications.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Squadron Strike comes with a complete, integrated campaign system, including web apps that automatically generate campaign maps, victory decks, and system maps. Just enter the campaign turn in the web app and the positions of the planets on the system map update automatically!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The boxed game will have two map sheets, a bag of tilt blocks, two bags of stacking tiles, box miniature sheets, a rulebook, an SSD book and a setting book. The ship design tools are available as a free download in Excel; the web applications (including a nicer ship design tool set, and campaign support) are behind a subscriber login.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brewin' USA is a thematic Eurogame in which players control a start-up brewery at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players will need to collect key ingredients, launch a product line of &quot;liquid gold&quot; craft beer, and strategically compete for regional control across the nation.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of three phases: Ingredient Auction, Launching Beers, and Resolving any Brewfests. During the Auction Phase, players compete for the ingredient cards needed to launch their beer via a turn-based bidding system. Any bids entered are then turned into craft beer &quot;market demand&quot; that is dispersed at the discretion of the players making each play through unique and delivering many interesting decisions. Each beer card has an ingredient recipe that must be satisfied before the beer can be brewed and one of six different beer styles that tailor better to certain cities which will be key when competing for regional control. When a player brews a beer, they must choose to control an open city location or challenge an controlled city to a brewfest where the winner of the brewfest will control the city. If any player controls the most cities in a region at the end of the game, then they control the region. The game ends when the first player brews three beers, and points are then totaled counting beer quality and reputation on cities and any regions you control.&#10;&#10;Brewin' USA aims to deliver a quick strategic euro experience paired with a very approachable theme and thrives on its player interaction. The game play revolves around Beer Coaster tiles delivering new twists on fun mechanisms and components including 105 Bottle caps to be used for both money and victory points. The player interaction comes from the Brewfest event in the game, which ramps us as more players grow their craft beer product lines and are chomping to establish their control in the regions.&#10;&#10;",

Mighty is played mostly by current or former students in Korea, as well as by some groups in North America.&#10;&#10;Mighty is a point-trick game with bidding. In each hand, the high bidder chooses a partner by calling a card, and these two players try to take enough of the scoring cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) to fulfill the bid. Importantly, the bidder's partner is not revealed until that called-for card is played.&#10;&#10;The standard Mighty is played for five players, but variant rules allow for player counts from three to eight.&#10;&#10;",
