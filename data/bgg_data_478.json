    "Description": "Final Argument of Kings is a product of the same circle of players and designers who produced the Squad Leader board game and the Johnny Reb Civil War miniature rules.  Final Argument bears a strong resemblance to the latter but was designed to tune to the warfare of the middle part of the 18th century.  These rules are appropriate for games set from the time of the War of the Polish Succession (1734) to the beginning of the Wars of the French Revolution (1789.)  It is scaled to be appropriate for battle on the European continent.  For 15mm figures, one inch on the table represents 45-50 yards.&#10;&#10;Horse and foot units are each four stands and represent infantry battalions and cavalry regiments.  Artillery batteries are single stands as are army, wing, and brigade commanders.  The number of figures per unit is variable with each figure representing 40 soldiers or one section of artillery.  Stand size is variable with the number of figures so that units with more men cover a wider frontage.  (The game would be playable with other basing systems, but the game's basing has a number of subtleties that transmit the tactical feel of the time.  For example, units are longer in march column than they are wide in line as, indeed, they should be.)&#10;&#10;Turns follow a set sequence with simultaneous movement and fire of various types.  Each turn represents 20 minutes of time.  Players mark orders for units that are hidden from the opposing player.  Command is an important element but does not dominate the game or become obtrusive.  There is also provision for grand tactical movement so that maneuver and closing to battle may happen quickly without taking too much time nor sacrificing tactical detail.  Combat tends to be bloody with stands taking figure losses as a result.  Morale of units is a key game concept.  Units have a basic morale point that is altered by loss of strength and the local situation faced by the units.  Battlefield events trigger morale checks.  There are no saving roles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On October 14, 1920, the last major White offensive took place. It would become Wrangel's Kursk, a precursor to that more famous WW2 battle at Kursk but this happened at Kakhovka, a small town astride the Dnepr River.&#10;&#10;Unique for it was only the second time in the RCW that a mass tank attack would occur (the first was in the Summer of 1919), fully supported by DH9A bombers and infantry against a very well prepared Red defense consisting of three consecutive trench lines, mines and barb wire. WW1 was in effect &quot;revisited&quot;. General Wrangel placed his blind faith in the tanks he had procured from the British, His tankers were well trained. He had even developed a combined arms approach. His forces, though outnumbered by 2 to 1 or more, continued to fight the &quot;good fight&quot; and had busted out of the Crimea in June, sent the Reds fleeing backwards for hundreds of miles with mass tank attacks and the ideal flat land. However, Wrangel was unable to secure the town of Kakhovka. The town had little real tactical value except for the fact the Reds held it. In September, several battles had been fought for it, each time the Whites were repulsed. Oct. 14th would be the last one.&#10;&#10;The Reds had created antitank formation consisting of MkV and FT-17 tanks and a unique American weapon, the Maklen 37mm AA gun. True, they only had a few of them , but the weapons ability to penetrate armor at very long distances was a stopper. Artillery units in AT mode also had been created. In manpower, the Reds had overwhelming strength if they did not flee from the tanks as they approached.&#10;&#10;The stage was set for the massive tank assault (in RCW terms) and for the final show-down between White and Red.&#10;&#10;Game scale is 1 hr turns, 800 yd a hex, company level, individual MkV, Whippet, Ft-17 tanks, Austin Armor Cars, DH9A Aircraft. The system never plays the same as once never knows how many units they can activate.&#10;&#10;",

The basic game provides a good blend of strategy and luck, while advanced rules allow for either pure skill games, or ones where luck is more of a factor. Suitable for solitaire, one to five individual players, and several combinations of teams.&#10;&#10;The game of Tesserae pits players against one another, meshing colored tiles into the ever-evolving play field, each trying to exhaust their supply of tiles while preventing their opponents from doing the same. Skillful strategy can pay off, but be careful -- things can change on the luck of a draw! This is a game that will stretch your brain.&#10;&#10;",

These are then used to execute movement and other tactical operations.&#10;&#10;The rules provide diagrams of historical formations, army lists, and scenarios for the battles of Lutzen (1632), Jankow (1645 -- erroneously listed as 1635 in the contents page) and Anfangsthal (1644).

    "Description": "Do-To-Ho Table Hockey is completely different from other table hockey games. The play figures are not fastened to rods, but are mobile on the whole playing field. In their bases just like in the puck there is a ball bearing, so they slide like ice skate runners all over the board. Moving a play figure is done via a short, unique knock against the figure with a small stick as in the case for billiard. The play courses take place alternating, there are 'attack courses', with which the puck may be played by a play figure, and 'position courses' (defense courses as well as offside release courses), with which a play figure only may change position without touching the puck. Puck possession changes, if the aggressor misses the puck or hits an opposing play figure. Do-To-Ho was developed in Germany and published in 1994. Until now (2007) there are about 200 exemplars, all handmade. The antecessor of Do-To-Ho was Stahlkugelhockey (=Iron Ball Hockey), developed by the same author in 1980.

    "Description": "From the author: Groups is related to Lines of Action, with the differences being that pieces in Groups move only one space, only orthogonal connections count, there are no captures, and the game begins with a drop phase. The game also bears a resemblance to Teeko, with the movement of pieces to attain a configuration, although in Groups a winning configuration can take any form provided all pieces are orthogonally connected. I had been playing it [the game with no jump rule] and found that it eventually bogged down with defensive play. I wanted to speed it up some, so I added a rule that a piece was allowed to jump over another piece to an empty space. I thought this would open the game up more. What I had found is that the game grew immensely more dynamic, and much more offensive, and finished a lot faster. What would go on from 30 turns for a game usually now finished up in under 10. The play balance seems the same now, but the game is a lot faster.&#10;&#10;Designer's Note: For individuals who would prefer a more strategic, and less tactical, game eliminate the jump move in the game (see the entry in the variants section).&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The father reads a question aloud to one of the children and both write down their response. If the answers match, the father scores a card worth 25 points and he advances his pawn the number of spaces indicated on the card. If the answers do not match, the child&rsquo;s pawn advances one space. The game continues with all players changing roles as questioner and responders. The winner is the player who scores 250 points.&#10;&#10;Three of the spaces of the gameboard are marked &quot;toy store&quot;. A player gets a chance card whenever landing here. Should a player land on the space indicated by the card held, that player is declared the winner immediately.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by one family with the participants playing as individuals, or as a contest between families.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a religious-themed trivia game for members of the Latter Day Saints (Mormon) church.  The trivia questions are religious in nature and are asked and answered in a mechanism simulating a simple baseball game. The key to the game is the question and answer booklet, which includes two pages of rules and 53 pages of questions. Each page has six numbered questions and answers. There is a cardboard field inset in the box and plastic pegs to use as runners.&#10;&#10;For each &quot;at bat&quot;, the batting player rolls a D6. For the first batter, the &quot;pitcher&quot; on the opposing team reads that numbered question from page 1. If the player answers correctly, he receives the result designated for that question. If he answers incorrectly, he is out. Pegs are placed on the field and advanced accordingly. One roll on each page provides a result without a question.&#10;&#10;With each succeeding batter, the question moves to the next page of the booklet, allowing a long game before any possibility of a repeated question arises. As per normal baseball rules, three outs ends an inning and the team with most runs scored after nine innings wins. The game seems to expect high scores: there are holes in the scoreboxes for 24 runs by each team.&#10;&#10;Many of the questions are very basic: &quot;Who was the real father of Jesus?&quot; (God). Others require more detailed knowledge of the Mormon church: &quot;Name the brother of Joseph Smith whose name begins with the letter H who was one of the Eight Witnesses&quot; (Hyrum), or &quot;Which of the following is not an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood: Elder, Seventy, Teacher, or High Priest?&quot; (Teacher).&#10;&#10;",

Shots from sand traps, putts and chip shots are done with special dice that have non-standard number distributions: &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Brown &#10;&#10;         Sand Trap Shot &#10;&#10;          1:2:3:3:3:4 &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Red &#10;&#10;         Chip Shot&#10;&#10;          1:2:2:3:3:4 &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Green &#10;&#10;         Putt&#10;&#10;          1:2:2:2:3:4 &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Alternately, these shots can be done by taking the appropriate card and following the instructions.  As the player's marker (ball) gets closer to the green, they will wish to roll fewer white dice to ensure they do not overshoot the hole.  Markers landing in hazards suffer penalties.  The course includes 9 holes with water hazards, sand traps, out of bounds areas, and trees.&#10;&#10;",

As in that game, players take turns setting up a pattern which the other player must deduce, with the player making the deduction in the fewest moves winning the game.&#10;&#10;In this game, a pattern is a 3x3 grid with each square being one of 6 colors, looking much like the side of a scrambled Rubik's Cube (the pattern is formed with 9 small cubes). On each turn, the guesser can either ask the setter if a given set of three colors are in a given row or column, or can ask if a given space is a specific color. In the former case the colors present and the colors not present are placed in different sections of the board for tracking purposes.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, players pick up a card and do what it says - anything from a simple move to a full-blown charade, with drawings and lip reading possibilities.&#10;&#10;By doing the action correctly, the player then gets to move further around the M25.  The aim of the game is to be the first to reach central London and find a parking space, which is done by rolling a 6 on a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;",
