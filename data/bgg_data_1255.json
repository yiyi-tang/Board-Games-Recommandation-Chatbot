    "Description": "You&rsquo;re in the enemy&rsquo;s hide-out, they vastly outnumber you and your cover has been blown! There&rsquo;s no other option, but to fight your way out using your Kung-Fu skills.&#10;&#10;In Hand2Hand you play as one of two Kung-Fu crime fighters, using your martial art skills to neutralise the enemy threat.&#10;&#10;The game is played until either one player is hit by an enemy (they lose), or the players knock out 18 enemies (the player&rsquo;s win).&#10;&#10;The game is played over several rounds. In each round a D6 is rolled to determine where the new enemies spawn. The players then select, in private, which new action card to play.&#10;&#10;Once the round has been setup, the players can discuss the sequence of actions to play. The main restriction is that the actions must be taken alternatively (left player, right player, left player, etc.). There are other restrictions, such as:&#10;&bull; a player can only perform up to 2 actions per round,&#10;&bull; an action may only be used once,&#10;&bull; the targeted enemy must be adjacent to the action card,&#10;&bull; actions cost cubes, meaning some actions prevent a player from taking a second action.&#10;&#10;The key point is that few of the actions let you directly knock-out an enemy, you must use the enemies&rsquo; attacks against each other. There are three types of enemy:&#10;&#10;&bull; Unarmed enemies cannot knock-out (discard) another enemy, they can only knock-down (flip over),&#10;&bull; Knife Wielding enemies can knock-out any enemy,&#10;&bull; Gun Wielding enemies can knock-out any enemy, but they cannot be blocked (placing a cube on the enemy card), and some player actions cannot be used on them.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to be the aristocrat who invests the most in the HMRS Endeavour.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most money invested in HMRS Endeavour. The game is played in turns. Each turn the player draws two, double sided location cards and then places them in sequence from the current location card. The player choose the order and the side of the placement in order to optimise the actions they want to activate. Then as the ship travels from the current location to the next location the matched actions are executed.&#10;&#10;Actions include:&#10;&bull; Gathering Intelligence. This is used to active black market actions.&#10;&bull; Training. This is used to improve actions you execute.&#10;&bull; Strike a Deal. This is used to increase your money.&#10;&bull; Invest in the Rocket. This is how you win the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of executing the matched actions, you can spend the intelligence you have gathered to execute a black market action. These allow you to spoil another player&rsquo;s deal, improve your own deal, or to cash out of a deal early. The cost of executing a black market action is that the location banishes the Endeavour from its orbit.&#10;&#10;The game ends when 1 player has an undefeatable investment in HMRS Endeavour.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Crusader, The Winter Battles for Tobruk, 1941 is played on a map of Libya and Egypt immediately south and east of Tobruk, where the battle was fought. It uses playing pieces that represent the actual military units that participated in this campaign. Each player represents the commander of the Axis or Allied forces. The individual ground units represent battalions of approximately 700 soldiers (50-60 tanks in an armored battalion, 12-24 guns in an artillery battalion), or companies of about 200 soldiers (15-20 tanks or armored cars in an armored company, 4-12 guns in an artillery battery). Each hex represents 2 kilometers or 1.25 miles. Each turn is a third of a day.&#10;&#10;Operation Crusader is a two-player game, with team play possible for the full campaign game. &#10;One player assumes the role of the Axis and the other player assumes the role of the Allies. &#10;Each player moves his units and executes attacks on enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the game&rsquo;s Victory Conditions. &#10;To move from one space to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. &#10;Combat is resolved through Battles by &quot;firing&quot; at opposing units and then determining the outcome of any hits scored. A die is used to resolve combat.&#10;&#10;The classic monster game returns with a newly-streamlined game system throughout (no more pre-plotting movement!). This new edition emphasizes playability while capturing the flavor of the original game. The game adds smaller scenarios (6 total), each covering a shorter and smaller part of the historic battle, and a full campaign game which allows players to experience the full sweep of Operation Crusader. Two shorter versions of the entire campaign (the most exciting parts) are also included for those wanting less game play time.&#10;&#10;Featured scenarios include:&#10;    &bull; Scenario 1: Gabr Saleh (5 turns, 1 map), AM 19 Nov - PM 20 Nov&#10;    &bull; Scenario 2: Bir El-Gobi (5 turns, 1 map), AM 19 Nov - PM 20 Nov&#10;    &bull; Scenario 3: Sidi Rezegh (8 turns, 1 map), AM 21 Nov - PM 23 Nov&#10;    &bull; Scenario 4: Storming the Frontier (8 turns, 1 map), AM 21 Nov - PM 23 Nov&#10;    &bull; Scenario 5: Rommel's Dash (11 turns, 1 map), AM 24 Nov - PM 27 Nov&#10;    &bull; Scenario 6: The Cauldron (8 turns, 2 maps), AM 24 Nov - PM 26 Nov&#10;    &bull; &quot;Short&quot; Campaign Game (14 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 23 Nov&#10;    &bull; &quot;Long&quot; Campaign Game (31 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 28 Nov&#10;    &bull; &quot;Extended&quot; Campaign Game (50 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 5 Dec&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Players take their corresponding discs (blue or red). Determine the starting player by any peaceful means.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;The second player decides which sub-board the first player must place the first disc on. The first player places a disc of her colour on any empty space of that sub-board.&#10;&#10;From now on, starting with the second player, players alternate turns placing a disc of their colour on an empty space of the board in a sub-board that corresponds with the position of the disc just placed by their opponent within the sub-board it&rsquo;s been placed.&#10;&#10;If this is not possible, then the player can place the disc on any sub-board (this happens once per game at most).&#10;&#10;Note: One of the cells of each sub-board maps to the sub-board it&rsquo;s in. These are called &lsquo;autocells&rsquo; and are marked with a dot for clarity.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;&#10;If, at the end of your turn, both sides of your colour are connected by a continuous chain of discs of your colour you immediately win the game (just like in HEX).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Can you mix and match the elixirs to create the most magical brew?&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Group all of your Blinks together to create your bubbling cauldron. The game begins the moment you do!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Each turn, rearrange your Blinks in an attempt to create matches. A &ldquo;match&rdquo; is 3 or more Blinks of the same color in a cluster. Matched Blinks get replaced by new colors. Sometimes, new colors will immediately create a match, and these matches will cascade one after the other if you position your Blinks correctly.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll notice as you make matches that your Blinks will begin bubbling - this shows how alchemically activated each Blink is. Each time a Blink is matched, it increases in alchemical power, which causes it to bubble more and more intensely. Eventually, after 10 matches, a Blink can become a Bomb.&#10;&#10;Bombs appear as spinning points of color. To activate a Bomb, click the Blink. This will cause an alchemical explosion, turning all adjacent Blinks to the color of the bomb, and automatically creating a huge matching cluster.&#10;&#10;But be careful - Bombs only last a few seconds before they revert back to their basic form. If you miss it, you&rsquo;ll have to power up that Blink again.&#10;&#10;If you are playing with 12 or fewer Blinks, it is possible to end up in a situation where no matches are possible. If this happens, simply triple-click a single Blink to change its color, potentially creating a match.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;Alchematch has no explicit goal, and can be played endlessly!&#10;&#10;VARIANT RULES&#10;Alchematch can be played by a stricter set of rules for greater challenge. First, place 12 Blinks in a 3 x 4 rhombus formation, with distinct rows and columns.&#10;&#10;During gameplay, instead of moving Blinks freely, you must instead break off rows or columns of the rhombus and re-attach them to the opposite end. You may rotate the rows or columns, but must always maintain the overall shape. This requires you to think spatially to make matches each turn.&#10;&#10;",

This was to be a pincers type attack, enveloping Kharkov. The Germans coincidentally were planning an assault in May against the salient which formed the southern base of the Soviet May offensive. The Red Army struck first, and five days later the German attack commenced. These double offensives are what are covered in &ldquo;Pincers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operation Fredericus&rdquo;. As the German Zitadelle offensive of 1943 was winding down, the Soviets launched a major attack of their own on the northern part of the Kursk area. Then on August 3 the Soviets attacked the southern part of the Kursk area. &ldquo;Orel Salient&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operation Rumiantsev&rdquo; cover these actions.&#10;&#10;Eastern Front Operational Battles use the same basic rule set in all four games as one would expect in a quad game. The rules are accessible and straight forward for playability, and at the same time, all aspects, such as movement rates, combat outcomes, and so on, are based on historical analysis.

Steal your neighbor's gnomes if you must because the cops are gnomewhere to be found.&#10;Set traps to protect your precious gnomes, and hoard away because the HOA isn't writing fines for cluttered lawns. Or at least try... let's face it, thieves will be thieves.&#10;Let the War for Lawn Supremacy begin!&#10;&#10;In Oh Gnome!, players will be playing three different card types: Gnomes, Traps, Abilities. Gnome and Trap cards each with their own values helping the player to achieve enough points to be crowned the victor. Each Gnome has a unique power that activates when they enter a lawn. These powers can be used strategically to create chain combos to devastate your opponents' lawns. Be careful though because if you don't protect your Gnomes, they can be stolen right back without regard. Players can arm traps which generally do something bad when they are tripped but some are simply caches to boost your lawn value and achieve a sly victory. To cap off the card types, there are ability cards which are one time use cards that have great effects. The deck runs out fast and there's no reshuffling so paying attention to how many are left can be used to achieve a spectacular game ending combo.&#10;&#10;This is a quick play game where games generally last around 10 to 20 minutes and occasionally get up to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The official solo mode of Catalyst - originally released as a promotional set of rules in IoGioco game magazine.&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;Confront your skills against a fearsome Artificial Intelligence (AI).&#10;&#10;PREPARATION&#10;&#10;     Choose the difficulty level: easy (+10 PV), standard (+20 PV), advanced (+30 PV).&#10;     Follow the instructions for preparing a 2-player game. You are the first player.&#10;     Return all building cards to the box with the exception of a building costing 1, one that costs 2, one that costs 3 and one that costs 4. They must all be of a different color and randomly selected (e.g.: play with the blue &ldquo;1&rdquo; building, the &ldquo;2&rdquo; red building, the &ldquo;3&rdquo; yellow building and the &ldquo;4&rdquo; green building).&#10;&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;Play multiple turns in a row until the game ends.&#10;During each of your turns you must perform one of the three actions of the game, with the following additions to the normal rules:&#10;&#10;      Collect Contributions: you get coins as usual, and the AI gets a military power token.&#10;      Recruit a Catalyst: You recruit a Catalyst as usual, then take the first card to the left of the one you recruited and place it, without looking at it, in the deck of AI's scoring pile. If you recruit the first Catalyst to the right of the deck (the one on the space marked with &ldquo;+1&rdquo;), then place the top card of the draw pile, without looking at it, in the scoring pile of the AI. &#10;      Activate a Catalyst: activate a Catalyst as usual, then place the card on top of the drawing deck, without looking at it, in the AI&rsquo;s scoring pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: When you get coins or actions to recruit a Catalyst through a Catalyst or a building&rsquo;s effects, and when you spend Chain activation tokens to activate Catalysts, the additions to the normal rules (see above) do not apply: This means that while you perform the effect of an activated Catalyst or building, the AI does not get any military power tokens nor you must put cards in its scoring pile.&#10;&#10;THE END OF YOUR TURN&#10;As in the standard rules, after you have chosen and performed one action (and possibly the AI has gained a card in its scoring pile or a military power token), your turn is over. If one or more spaces of the board are empty, slide the other cards to the right until there are no gaps, then draw new cards from the deck to fill the board back up to 5 cards.&#10;&#10;THE END OF THE GAME&#10;When the last card of the reserve deck is discarded or put on the board, the game ends immediately.&#10;Count your VPs as usual, including the goal card&rsquo;s points. The AI instead obtains the VPs written on the cards in its scoring pile, the VPs provided by each pair of its military power tokens (and for the majority), and additional VPs depending on the difficulty level chosen (see Preparation). If you scored at least 1 VP more than the AI, you won &ndash; otherwise, try harder!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Armoured Corps wargame rules allow players to command a combined-arms battlegroup fighting battles during the third world war.&#10;&#10;Scope&#10;These rules are designed to be quick to play with large forces from a single company to multiple battalions while still giving realistic results.&#10;&#10;The rules are also designed to simulate the role of a formation commander so much of the minutiae of modern armoured combat is incorporated into generalised statistics or dice roles. For example, the formation commander will not be deciding on which type of ammunition (HEAT, APDS etc) each tank will be firing when engaging an enemy unit, this would be left up to the tank&rsquo;s own crew. So many parts of the rules that may seem simple or &ldquo;glossed-over&rdquo; are simply below the player&rsquo;s (acting as overall commander) level of command.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;Various sequences and methods of unit activation were considered however it was decided to go back to the classic &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; sequence (albeit with interruptions form an opponent&rsquo;s units on overwatch).&#10;&#10;Morale&#10;Morale has been heavily simplified to a single dice roll at the end of each turn for any units that have come under fire and been suppressed. This determines if they fall back, continue fighting or give up, surrendering or leaving the battle area.&#10;&#10;Ground Scale&#10;The approximate ground scale of 1&rdquo; =100 metres was chosen as it would allow for realistic weapon ranges to be depicted on a reasonable sized table without being able to fire across the whole area, allowing more emphasis on manoeuvre and positioning of units.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you loose, you get more cards to get rid off. The winner is the first to exhaust his/her stock.&#10;With GeoXpert, learn all countries' flag, name, capital, and other facts and quiz your family and friends.&#10;GeoXpert may be played with 2, 3, 4 or more players. It may be played alone too.&#10;There is a card of each country.

Your excavations have unearthed ancient mechanisms that redirect treasure falling from great heights, how much can you now collect in your treasure buckets?&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Take your sushi roll case and lay it out on a flat surface. This will be the floor of your treasure chamber. Long press 2 Blinks until they flash white, then set them standing up on the sushi roll case. These are your treasure buckets. Take another Blink and set it between the two buckets. This trio of Blinks is the foundation of your treasure chamber.&#10;&#10;Finally, take at least 1 Blink and triple click it. It should now be green with a swirling face. This Blink is your treasure spawner. It will drop one treasure piece whenever it is placed on top of the treasure chamber tower.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;The goal of this game is to collect as much treasure in your bucket as possible by using the mechanisms built into the treasure chamber walls.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two stages. First, both players work together to assemble the treasure chamber. Take turns adding one Blink at a time to the tower and watching the mechanisms self-assign.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;When the bucket is full it will turn purple - the first player to fill their bucket with treasure is the winner!&#10;&#10;However, if one of the players causes the tower to collapse, they must empty all the treasure from their bucket. Double-click a bucket to empty it. Then the first stage of the game is repeated and the tower is reassembled before treasure is allowed to tumble again.&#10;&#10;",

But cards only score when played atop other cards, and every time a turn is taken, the villain (the game itself) has a chance to remove players' cards from the Octagon before points can be scored against him. Not only that, but interspersed throughout the villain's deck are cards that render categories unusable for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For instance, I could use red and yellow to create orange.&#10;&#10;To match colors players may pick up a color if they already have that exact color in their hand.&#10;&#10;To meet company goals, players declare that they are seeking to meet a goal and if they have the required colors in their play area, they may collect the goal card.&#10;&#10;Any cards used for an action are then placed in the player discard and can cycle through their deck back into their hand on a later turn.&#10;&#10;Players start with an even mix of red, yellow, blue and white and can collect a variety of other colors. In this way every card can help to build your deck. Excluding the starter cards, every card is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the center pile runs out.

It uses unique positioning mechanics in three rows and four columns for each player. The position of each warrior card is crucial in determining who he can attack. The base game comes with 3 decks of 30 cards each and all cards are unique. In the match setup, you choose 20 of the 30 cards for that match. Each warrior is unique and has Strength and Dodge values that allow these characters to attack, counterattack or dodge in combat, creating an immersive and intense game. Strength or Dodge points earn a bonus from a D4 to increase the variability of combats and make them more real. No warrior is able to return once they have been defeated and the objective of the game is to leave the opponent's field without any card on it, which means instant victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
