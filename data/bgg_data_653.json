    "Description": "Explore the hidden dungeons of the land of Antaire.  Fight your way through the dungeon, avoiding its traps, fighting monsters and most importantly collecting your gold.&#10;&#10;Antaire: Dungeons is a competitive dungeon exploration game.  Players compete against the dungeon and each other, trying to leave with the most gold.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to allow infinite replay.  All players start with one of eight characters (Knight, Barbarian, Archer, Thief, Mage, Healer, Druid, Necromancer) on a beginning tile.  As the game progresses the dungeon is extended by adding tiles consisting of corridors, rooms, and importantly shops and most importantly the exit tile.  Shops allow the player to buy new equipment for their character, increasing his or her abilities, or heal damage from the dangers of the dungeon. Players themselves add monsters, traps and treasure within the dungeon to either their advantage or opponents disadvantage, leaving everybody to play.  Death in the game is only final if the exit appears, extending the overall player interaction to the last possible moment.  And don't worry, if a character exits the dungeon, the player may still play, using the dungeon and its inhabitants to stop other players exiting and defeating them.&#10;&#10;",

With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While Memory &rsquo;39 continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty.&#10;Designed by the Institute of National Remembrance, this game not only improves the players&rsquo; power of concentration but also helps them to memorize the events of 1939 that are so important for Polish national identity. Memory &rsquo;39 makes use of archival photographs illustrating Poland&rsquo;s 1939 war of defense. A historical commentary on each photograph is provided in the enclosed brochure. Together with the commentary, the photographs tell a short history of the September campaign. To make the distant events more vivid, the black-and-white photographs have been tinted with great attention to historical detail.&#10;&#10;The box contains:&#10;&ndash; 48 game cards with archival photographs&#10;&ndash; a brochure with historical commentaries on the photographs&#10;&#10;(From back cover)&#10;&#10;",

Opponent teams take alternate turns, going through a sequence involving, in that order, artillery fire requests, previously requested artillery fire resolution, direct fire, movement. Combat is resolved by dice rolls on probability tables. The game uses two six-sided dice of different colors, to generate numbers from 11 to 66.&#10;&#10;",

It is an expanded version of sishi fen ('40 points') using two or more decks, and is related to zhao pengyou ('looking for friends'). All these games are collectively known as Sheng1 Ji2 (&#229;&#141;&#135;&#231;&#186;&#167;), which means &quot;raise level&quot; or &quot;promote&quot;. Tractor is widely popular in China, especially in Shanghai and south of the Yellow River where it has practically displaced the older single deck game.&#10;&#10;The scores of the teams are expressed as card ranks. At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.&#10;&#10;In each hand, one team forms the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (&#229;&#189;&#147;&#229;&#186;&#132;), and the other team forms the opponents. In the first hand, either team can be the declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand is the declarers, and the other team is the opponents.&#10;&#10;One member of the declarers' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.&#10;&#10;Source: edited from Pagat, http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives 16 chips of the same color. Choose a playingcard together to play with. There are 2 copies of each card, one for each player.

You can see all the words from the playingcard in the holes now.&#10;If you choose a blue playingcard for example, you both choose a blue wordcard. You recognize your own wordcards by the white or black triangle in the corner of the card. Player 1 chooses a card from the stack with white triangles, and player 2 from the stack with the black triangles. This is your secret word your opponent has to search for. Put the wordcard against the sloping side of the playingfield, so your opponent can't see it.&#10;&#10;The first player to guess the word from the other player wins. On your turn, you ask your opponent a question which he can answer with yes or no. For example: Does your word start with a &quot;B&quot;? If your opponent answers no, you can put a chip on every word on your playing card that does not start with a &quot;B&quot;. This goes on until only one word remains. He calls the word and wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 2 player abstract game, played with white and black stones on a Hexhex board. The goal is to have the largest group on the board when the game ends and the board is full.  There is a trick, though: You can place as many stones per turn as you have groups on the board (up to a limit).  There's a tricky balance: you need to connect your groups together to advance toward the goal, but you can't connect them too much or else you won't be able to place as many stones as your opponent.&#10;&#10;The current rules:&#10;&#10;1. The board begins empty.&#10;&#10;2. To begin, White puts a single stone on any vacant space, and then Black does the same.&#10;&#10;3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you may place as many stones as you have groups on the board, and you may place them onto any vacant spaces.  Except:&#10;&#10;*You must place at least one stone.&#10;    *The stones you place may not be adjacent to one another. &#10;    *If you have more than 3 groups on the board, the maximum number of stones you may place is 3.&#10;    *You may not grow any group by more than one stone.&#10;    *A stone connecting two or three different groups together is considered to have grown them all (at the end of your turn, no group may have more than one new stone in it).&#10;&#10;4. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the largest group wins.   If the players&rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger group wins.&#10;&#10;",

There is also a Shootout and Adventure booklet containing scenarios.&#10;&#10;In Episode One there are 10 maps - each will print on a single US Letter or A4 page and will tile with each other to create a large range of environments in which scenarios are set.

The war has also spread to initially neutral Poland, which became a battleground for involved powers.&#10;&#10;In history, the Coalition has lost three major battles in the first year of the war. But the war continued, even despite early Danish withdrawal and Saxon surrender, which followed six years later. Carolus, who was also able to put his own king on Polish throne in the meantime, faced his last active enemy - Russia. His failed attempt at taking Moscow became the pivotal event and a milestone in Northern European history.&#10;&#10;Players will be able to recreate those events or find their own alternative strategies to win the Great Northern War themselves.&#10;&#10;The game is currently in development, first bits will be hopefully shown at Essen Spiel 2010.&#10;&#10;",

The board is pushed down into a spring-loaded box with a timer. When you fit all your shapes into the right holes, you turn off the timer. If you don't turn it off in time, it pops and sends all your pieces flying.&#10;&#10;Poppin' Puzzlers is exactly like that except each player has his own set of pieces, orange or yellow, and you play on opposite sides of the game unit. There are 20 pieces for each player. The pieces get stored in a compartment on the top of the game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Roll 'n Divide, players work together to form division equations and then build individual triangles with double-sided chips (one color on each side for each team) to win the game.  You roll a 10-sided die to determine the quotient (answer) you need to make.  The you pick a chip for the dividend number and divisor number.  You can place them anywhere on the board, either to be part of a triangle you are making or to block your opponent from making a triangle.  If you roll 7 for example, you can take the 56 chip and the 8 chip to place on the board.  You could also take the 77 chip and 11 chip to put on the board. You are able to turn over an opponent's if you are able to use the previously used number in your new equation.  The game board doubles as a storage tray for the pieces.&#10;&#10;",

(With two players, each player sets up two card holders.) Ideally these cards have been mixed and shuffled so that they face in different directions. Once all the holders are set, each player passes a holder left, then a 30-second sand timer is started, during which time each player writes down on their score sheet what images they think they see in the line-art jumble. Players go through this process for each holder, then they reveal the images one by one. A player scores one point for each image correctly identified.&#10;&#10;After two complete rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

An 18-inch octagonal plastic tray cradles eight sets of numbered Bingo cards, while small wells beside each hold plastic chips for covering the numbers on the cards. In the center of the tray, a spinning roulette-style wheel catches a steel ball in a lettered, numbered space when it stops--telling players what numbers to cover in their race to get five in a row. For younger players who are just learning to read double-digit numbers, it's good reinforcement; but, it's also fun for adults who usually can't sit through a &quot;kid's&quot; game.&#10;&#10;",

They are contraindicated for psychotic children and/or those significantly involved in fantasy.  Such children's problems might be entrenched because the games encourage further fantasizing.  Such children should play reality-oriented games e.g. The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Pick-and-Tell Games were designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children.

    "Description": "Oak Island, Nova Scotia, 1900&#10;&#10;In 1795, Daniel McGinnis found a 10-foot circular indentation in the ground, in the centre of a man-made clearing. A large branch (and some say the remains of a pulley) hung directly above the pit. He recruited friends and, armed with shovels, they began to dig. They found a solid floor of oak-logs every 10 feet for a considerable depth. Sea-water floodied the pit and prevented them from digging further. What still lies buried over 100 feet below the surface depends on who you ask: Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, Incan gold, Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost manuscripts, the Holy Grail, or perhaps nothing at all.&#10;&#10;Over the years more men brought their ingenuity to bear on the problem, but failed. The failures were due to lack of modern machinery and ignorance; each excavation being stopped by water and lack of funds. A new century brings new technology and every hope that the mystery of Oak Island will soon finally be put to rest.&#10;&#10;Oak Island is a board game for 3-5 players attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious treasure pit on Oak Island. The amateur treasure hunters bring their resources to bear on the problem of excavating the pit, and compete with each other to publish their findings and theories using an innovative scoring system.&#10;&#10;Players take turns picking up a row or column of resource cards from the card display. Action cards set in the display are triggered when a player picks it up. Machinery cards in the display do not refresh until the next round. A round ends when a player picks up the Treasure Trove License card, triggering an excavation.&#10;&#10;The Money Pit consists of consecutive tiles that are revealed as they are excavated jointly by the players. In order to excavate a tile, the symbols shown on it must be matched on resource cards invested secretly and simultaneously by the players. Each resource card has an abstract monetary value ($, $$, or $$$); the players are ranked in order of investment, with the one who invested least playing first in the next round. The player who invested most gets first pick of the assets (clues, machinery, and victory points) collected by the venture.&#10;&#10;Another source of VPs are the theories a player can publish. A theory consists of two or more clues joined together. A complete theory is any size rectangle (2xY) while a partial theory is any other assembly of clue pieces. Publishing a theory during the game consists of a player revealing one or more new clue pieces to form a new theory, or revealing one ore more new clue pieces and reinterpreting the clues of the same colour in an existing public theory (theirs or another players) in order to form a new theory. Clues that don&rsquo;t make it into the new theory cost the player points. The first clue played of any given colour are worth bonus points. Adjacent clues of the same colour within a theory are worth additional points. Complete theories earn a player 2 points per clue, excluding blank ones - incomplete ones earn a player 1 point per clue, including blank ones.&#10;&#10;",

However, games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a 1 metre by 2 metre tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual or group of miniatures in the game is called a &quot;Playing Piece&quot;, whether represented by a single model, or group of similar troops.&#10;&#10;Three Plains is largely set on the Middle Plain, on the World of 'Many' Names, so called because no race will acknowledge any of the other races titles. Although all have a word for &lsquo;Many&rsquo; and over the years Many has become the bilingual name for their World. The World of Many much resembles an ancient earth long past, with warlords running amuck and empires throwing their weight around and there are some great individuals, who are commonly known as Hero&rsquo;s, Lords and Wizards who face each other on the field of battle usually fighting to the death. This world also has its share of Beasts too, Dragons, Ogres, Wyverns and hundreds more roam and terrorise the lands of Many plaguing the younger races.&#10;&#10;",

Trials entail a battle of wits that will require bluffing, deduction, and careful timing to win.  Players earn trial tokens by having animal &quot;morph&quot; cards in play with attributes that best match the requirements of the current trial.  Players will also cast a variety of spell and obstacle cards to hinder their competitors or propel themselves to victory.  But be careful! Cards are selected in a hidden fashion with all players revealing their moves simultaneously.  When shape-shifting is involved, you will need to be cunning to stay ahead.  When all the trials are completed, the player with the most trial tokens wins!&#10;&#10;............&#10;Playtesting Request&#10;&#10;Shifter's is currently in the second prototype phase, and needs playtesting!

Spanish troops and leaders, as many Napoleonic historians point out, performed badly on a large number of occasions. Yet there are a number of battles, Bailen, Tamames, Alcaniz and San Marcial where the Spaniards fought valiantly and gained victory. Ironically, the point most historians overlook is the fact that the Spanish armies constituted a threat that the French simply could not ignore. As good as Wellington&rsquo;s Anglo-Portuguese field army was, that army faced multiple French armies. They could only defeat one French army at a time. The Spanish Armies and the accompanying guerrilla warfare against French troops tied down the remainder, allowing the Anglo-Portuguese army to ultimately emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on Peninsular battles fought by the Spanish army from 1808 to 1813, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.=&#10;&#10;",
