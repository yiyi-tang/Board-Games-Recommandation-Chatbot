Each player will be drafting tiles, in order to score the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Will you build the legendary temple Tiwanacu and be rewarded by the gods?&#10;&#10;The game is played in 9 rounds. Every round, each player will receive  tiles that he must place in his temple, to try to score the most points. At the end of the 9th round, players will add up all their points and the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each game two random God cards will be picked that will change some of the basic rules or add ways to score points at the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Round structure&#10;1.    Place tiles in each turn order position as indicated in the current round marker. The tiles that are where the row selector is, will be the active tiles and are available to purchase this round. The other tiles will be available next round. &#10;2.    Starting with the player in first place and following player order, each player takes his turn.&#10;3.    All the tiles available in the active row that were not picked, are returned to the box. &#10;4.    Move the row selector to the next group of tiles (if it was on top, move it to the bottom. And vice versa) &#10;5.    Move the round marker to the next space.&#10;After 9 rounds, the game ends.Player turns&#10;On their turn, each player in player order will the following: &#10;1.    The player moves his piece from their current order position to an empty position in the player order track. &#10;2.    He pays (or receives) the amount indicated on the position. If he doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to pay, the player will get a loan token and 10 coins. &#10;3.    Takes the 3 tiles from that position and place them next to their temple board.&#10;4.    The player must put the 3 tiles he has next to his player board. The rules for placement are as follows:&#10;a.    He can place in any position in his grid. &#10;b.    He can choose the order of placing the tiles, but the 3 tiles must be placed this turn.&#10;c.    If he wishes, he can pay 1 coin to place it on top of a previously placed tile. &#10;d.    The grid can have empty spaces.&#10;e.    After placing a tile, it cannot be moved for the rest of game.&#10;Note that some God cards and rounds may change the number of tiles you need to place and change some of the tile placement rules. God cards rules always take precedence over the rules above. &#10;5.    After he has placed all his tiles, the next player in player order does the same.&#10;End of game&#10;After the last player has finished his turn in the 9th round, the game will end. The players will add up their scores and the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;At the end of the game, players will score points depending on the layout of their board and the god objectives. Each type of tile score in the following way.&#10;Color Tiles (Red, Blue. Yellow and Green)&#10;Red tiles scoring in two ways:&#10;&#10;     1 point per color tile, regardless of figure. If a player has more than one colored area, they only score for their biggest one.&#10;     Points according to the number of figures and multipliers. If there are Multiplier tiles next to a colored tile (that have the 2x in the same coloredbackground) they will multiply the number of figures on the tile by 2 for each multiplier tile surrounding it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Monolith Tiles&#10;&#10;     Monolith tiles score depending on how many different ones you have in a set. There are  6 different monoliths designs, an a set of 1/2/3/4/5/6 will score 1/3/7/12/18/25 respectively. &#10;     If a player has more than 1 set of monoliths, each one of them will be scored separately. For example, if a player has 2 sets of different monoliths, one with 3 tiles and the other with 2, he will get 10 points (7 for the first one and 3 for the second one). &#10;&#10;&#10;Extra scoring&#10;After all types of tiles have been scored, each player will receive additional points for the following criteria:&#10;&#10;     1 point per Gold coin still in their possession. &#10;     1 point per tile in their biggest zone (can coloured tile or a monolith tile).&#10;     10 points if they have at least one tile of each of the five colours (red, yellow, green, blue) and a Monolith. If a player is missing of the types, he doesn&rsquo;t receive any points. &#10;     Points awarded by completing God cards, if applicable)&#10;&#10;&#10;Penalties&#10;Each player will receive negative points for the following criteria&#10;&#10;     -15 points per Loan token.&#10;&#10;&#10;Final score&#10;Each player will add up their points and the one with most points at the end of the game, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each stick's length represents a relationship between the grid squares on the back of a piecepack tile- from &quot;null&quot; cubes that represent a single point in space to &quot;5&quot; sticks that represent the full diagonal length of a tile.&#10;&#10;The matchsticks can be used for many different mechanics including: &#10;-Connections and pathways&#10;-Walls and barriers for area enclosure and maze building&#10;-Spatial mechanics that go &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; of the square grids that define many piecepack games&#10;-Resource tokens that match up with piecepack suits and values&#10;-Additional movement tokens for games that require more pieces of one type than a single piecepack can provide&#10;-And as many other uses as a designer can imagine.&#10;&#10;Like the piecepack, the piecepack matchsticks are a public domain game system, which means that anyone is free to make and even sell a set without paying royalties.&#10;&#10;",

The game features multi-use cards, which you may trade for items and gold or imbue into weapons to fend off dangerous creatures. With the coins you earn, you can upgrade your abilities making your survival more likely. An AI system will be moving around and spawning new creatures, so choose your fights wisely.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The book contains an introduction into 18th Century Warfare including both land campaigns and naval campaigns. The land campaigns include information on troop types, weapons, formations and battlefield tactics. The Naval includes information on the ships armament, naval strategies and fighting tactics.&#10;&#10;The unique system of Decision Games is explained, which with the use of Programmed Events and Chance Events form the basis of the campaign rules which are included.&#10;&#10;In the campaign modules the commanders are given historical objectives and the forces that were available to them. This book provides the rules to re-fight the campaign modules with the methods for troop manoeuvres being dependent upon their commander&rsquo;s ability, weather and plain luck. Forces march along defined routes, must maintain a line of supply and set down depots. They suffer from sickness and desertions but occasionally receive reinforcements. The rules also include a system of bidding which accurately portrays the skirmishing and manoeuvring prior to a battle or withdrawal.&#10;&#10;Troop strengths are always recorded in terms of Army Points (APs) or Naval Points (NPs). This book gives an in depth justification of the balance between APs NPs and VPs (Victory points) based on extensive research.

    "Description": "The siege rules make use of the authors Decision Games system which enables a siege to be conducted in terms of Stages as outlined by the great French military engineer Sebastion de Vauban. The system uniquely and realistically enables the timing of the advancing stages of a siege to run sequentially with the land campaign and along the timetables set by Vauban and so make sense in the context of a campaign.&#10;&#10;Within the campaign system, each fortress is classified as being either weak, medium, strong etc. and a Victory Points value (VPs) incorporated into the initial balance. Dependent upon the strength of the fortress it is allocated a garrison strength (APs) and a garrison morale value (GM) plus a proportionate amount of provisions (GPRs).&#10;&#10;Similarly the besieger whose strength (APs) is dependent upon the situation in the campaign, monitors his own force&rsquo;s morale (BM) which will vary as the siege progresses and with comparison with Vauban&rsquo;s timetable. The presence and size of any siege train or the approach of a relieving force are also critical to success.&#10;&#10;This siege system enables the besieger to choose from a variety of tactics which may vary at each stage. These include sapping, bombardment and stratagems.&#10;The defender similarly has a number of tactics to hand including stratagems and even the occasional sortie which can lead to a table top encounter.&#10;The progress of the siege is dependent upon a cross reference of each side&rsquo;s tactical choices some of which result in either a Reaction Test by the Garrison or the Besieger. These can result in surrender, a lifting of the siege or a continuation.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Siege Decision Game Mechanics.&#10;     Garrison&rsquo;s Morale (GM) and Besieger&rsquo;s Morale (GM).&#10;     Garrison&rsquo;s Provisions (GPs).&#10;     Log&rsquo;s for Sieges of Fortresses including Reaction Tests.&#10;     Truth Tables.&#10;     Diagram of a typical Vauban fortress and the siege stages.&#10;     Honours of War (HOW).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Dependent upon the circumstances encountered during a game these force players and units to act historically. The casualty system uses HIT dice which translate immediately into battlefield and campaign casualties. After battle pursuits and rear guard actions necessary for a campaign are also included.&#10;&#10;Units are organised as battlefield brigades rather than battalions or regiments to reflect the actual practice of the period and to fit in with the campaign system. This avoids the predicament which arises when army numbers are reduced by casualties and desertions and yet the number of battalions and regiments remains constant.&#10;&#10;Commanders have an ability rating to reflect their own personality and that of the ability of their staff.

Speed and manoeuvrability being dependent upon size of the ship, wind direction and the number of sails in use.&#10;&#10;Damage is inflicted with the use of HIT dice. The HIT dice and associated Tactical Factors reflect range, size of gun and the size and protection of the enemy target ship. These are recorded by crossing out boxes on the ships log.&#10;&#10;The ships are divided into Ships Of the Line (SOL) and Repeater ships consisting of Frigates, Sloops and Brigs. The Ships of the Line are further categorized by the number of guns that they contained. 90 gun, 80 gun, 74 gun and 64 gun. The simple game mechanism includes alternative moves in which orders are secretly chosen in advance and apply to the whole fleet and reflect the difficulty of handling multiple ships simultaneously as was the responsibility of 18th Century Admirals.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules enables fleet actions of ten or more ships per side to be completed in a single two to three hour wargaming evening with the pre action manoeuvring being a vital and enjoyable feature.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Order Cards &ndash; Ships of the Line.&#10;     Order Cards &ndash; Repeater Ships.&#10;     Order Cards &ndash; Ships of the Convoy.&#10;     Table Top Battle Logs for Fleet Actions.&#10;     Table Top Battle Logs for Small Actions.&#10;     Rules Synopsis.&#10;     Players Reference Sheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This campaign is set in Silesia part of modern day Poland in the winter of 1741 and at the beginning of the second year of the conflict popularly known as the First Silesian War which later expanded into the wider conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession. It attempts to re-enact the attempt by the Austrian army commanded by Marshal Niepperg to march to the relief of the blockaded fortresses of Neisse and Brieg and to simultaneously cut the Prussian occupying army&rsquo;s lines of supply. Had the Austrians succeeded, King Frederick II (The Great) of Prussia would in all probability have been forced to surrender because his position in Silesia would have been untenable.&#10;&#10;Frederick was taken by surprise and with many of his troops being dispersed into winter cantonments, it was a race against time to concentrate his forces before being attacked by the Austrians. Early on at the battle of Mollwitz it went badly for Frederick who fled the field only to discover that his army had gained a victory during his absence.&#10;&#10;The campaign module does not aim to slavishly recreate the attempted relief of Silesia to the last historical detail. Nor does it attempt to fight the whole war or even every engagement across central Europe during 1741. Finally of course, it does not aim to re-fight the battle of Mollwitz on replicated terrain and with the historically accredited troops there. Instead it provides players with the information and mechanics to re-fight the Mollwitz campaign closely based on historically accurate forces, commanders and strategic considerations.&#10;&#10;Its aim is to provide an interesting (and challenging) backdrop or context for table top battles.&#10;&#10;This was a very short campaign being all over in less than 2 weeks. There are no sieges, naval actions or reinforcements involved. Consequently, it serves as an excellent introduction to the campaign system.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;&#10;     Historical Background.&#10;     Campaign Map.&#10;     Commanders.&#10;     Initial Army Strengths and Fortresses.&#10;     Progremmed Events.&#10;     Chance Events.&#10;     Army Lists.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Book contains 3 standalone land campaign modules.&#10;&#10;The Nish Campaign, 1737. Austrians v Ottoman Turks.&#10;This campaign is set in Serbia in the late summer of 1737 during the Austro-Russian-Turkish War of 1736-39. It attempts to re-create the invasion of Ottoman Serbia by a Habsburg Imperial army led by Marshal Count Friedrich von Seckendorf and its opposition by the Ottoman Grand Vizier Al Haji Mohammed who commanded the Ottoman Army on behalf of his master the Sultan.&#10;&#10;The campaign ended in a disastrous failure for the Austrians following their defeats at the battle of Valjevo and the recapture of Nish by the Ottomans.&#10;&#10;The campaign includes at least one siege against a medium fortress (Nish), the probability of two other sieges and unusually the probability of some fortresses being besieged, captured and then re-besieged and recaptured by the relieving forces.&#10;&#10;Special features of this campaign include the fact that the invading army decimated by sickness and in particular malaria, eventually becomes the prey. They are pursued and virtually destroyed by an aggressive relief force led by the Grand Vizier and defeated at the battle of Valjevo.&#10;&#10;It also pits a poorly trained and equipped European army against a basically irregular Asian army with a high proportion of cavalry.&#10;&#10;The Cuneo Campaign, 1744. French and Spanish v Austrians and Sardinians.&#10;This campaign is set in north-western Italy in the summer of 1744 and is part of the wider conflict popularly known as the War of the Austrian Succession 1741-45. It attempts to re-create the Franco-Spanish (sometimes referred to as &lsquo;Gallispan&rsquo;) invasion of Piedmont, led by Prince Louis de&rsquo;Conti which was opposed by Charles Emmanuel the King of Sardinia (Piedmont) with an Austro-Sardinian army who fought to protect his kingdom. Although victorious at the battle of Madonna dell&rsquo;Olmo, the campaign ended with the Gallispans being forced to withdraw from Piedmont after torrential rain destroyed their siege works at Cuneo.&#10;&#10;The campaign includes a potential siege or storming of a Weak Fortress, and a number of potential sieges against Weak and Medium Fortresses including the historical objectives of Demonte and Cuneo.&#10;&#10;The Gallispan lines of supply across the Alps is an important and special feature of this campaign. The French objective was to capture an important fortress to be used as a base for the campaign planned for the following year. Another feature is the fortifications known as the Barricades built by Charles Emanuel to prevent the passage of enemy troops through the Stura Valley. The maneuvering and audacity of the Gallispan attack which resulted in the capturing of the fortifications was hailed as the feat of arms in Europe at the time.&#10;&#10;The Zorndorf Campaign, 1758. Russians v Prussians.&#10;This campaign is set on Prussia&rsquo;s eastern borders with Poland in the summer of 1758 and is part of the wider conflict popularly known as the Seven Years War 1756-63.&#10;It attempts to re-create the invasion into Prussia by a Russian army led by General Villim Fermor which was opposed by King Frederick II who personally commanded his own Prussian Army. The campaign ended after the bloody draw at Zorndorf with the Russians withdrawing from Prussia and Pomerania.&#10;&#10;The campaign includes a potential siege or storming of a Basic Fortress, and a number of potential sieges against Weak Fortresses including the historical objective at Custrin/Kustrin (modern-day Kostrzyn).&#10;&#10;Special features of this campaign include the fact that it has one army the Prussians, actively rushing to force a battle and destroy the enemy. A definite Napoleonic strategy and a far cry from the usual 18th C. maneuvers to capture fortresses or other possessions.&#10;&#10;Each module contains its own:-&#10;&bull; Historical Background.&#10;&bull; An account of the historical campaign.&#10;&bull; Campaign Map.&#10;&bull; Programmed Events Table.&#10;&bull; Chance Events Tables.&#10;&bull; Army Lists.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The naval campaign The Caribbean uses the unique Decision Games system and is based on the campaigns of 1781 and 1782 between the French Admiral Comte Francois de Grasse and the British Admirals Sir George Rodney, Sir Samuel Hood, Sir Francis S. Drake and Thomas Graves during the American War of Independence.&#10;&#10;It includes three naval Decision Games.&#10;&#10;Martinique re-enacts the arrival in the Caribbean of de&rsquo;Grasse with the French fleet and the attempted interception of them by Sir Samuel Hood and his British fleet.&#10;&#10;The Windward Islands re-enacts the attempts by de&rsquo;Grasse to capture either Tobago or St Lucia whilst again Sir Samuel Hood attempts to prevent this.&#10;&#10;The Big Prize is based on a conglomeration of the 1781 and 1782 campaigns where in 1781 de&rsquo;Grasse had the option to either assist the Americans or to attempt to gain further possessions from the British in the Caribbean whilst 1782 saw the engagement between Sir George Rodney and de&rsquo;Grasse at The Saints off Dominica.&#10;&#10;Each of these Decision Games will produce a naval action which may be a major fleet action or a minor skirmish scenario such as Small Convoy, Pirates or Trapped. Table Top scenario maps are supplied for all possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;A concise but well researched history of the occupation of the Caribbean Islands is included to give a thorough strategic and diplomatic back ground and to put the American War Of Independence into perspective from the British and French point of view.&#10;&#10;&#10;     History Naval Campaigning in the Caribbean Islands&#10;     Table Top Battle Logs for Fleet Actions.&#10;     Table Top Battle Logs for Small Actions.&#10;     Campaign Log British.&#10;     Campaign Log French.&#10;     Programmed Events.&#10;     Chance Events.&#10;     Campaign Map &ndash; The Caribbean.&#10;     Three Naval Decision Games.&#10;     Table Top Scenario Maps.&#10;     Reference Sheets for Scenario Small Actions&#10;     History of Naval Battles of the 18th Century.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Villains threaten the city. Led by the notorious Green Goblin, they will surely crush all that is good and right. Spider-man has his work cut out for him-and it will take all his Spidey-speed to grab the Green Goblin(and all the cards) first!&#10;&#10;Based on the popular game Slap Jack, this fast-paced card game will keep the Spidey-action flowing battle after battle.&#10;&#10;52 card deck includes an instruction card and 3 BONUS VILLAIN CARDS!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;The goal is to win the Green Goblin and all the cards, by being first to slap each villain card as it is played to the center.&#10;&#10;Deal cards one at a time face down, to each player until all the cards have been dealt. The hands do not have to come out even. Without looking at any of the cards, each player squares up their hand into a neat pile in front of them.&#10;&#10;Beginning on the dealer&rsquo;s left, each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.&#10;When the card played to the center is a villain card, the first player to slap their hand down on the villain takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile.&#10;&#10;When more than one player slaps at a villain, the one whose hand is directly on top of the jack wins the pile. If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a villain, they must give one card, face down, to the player of that card. When a player has no more cards left, they remain in the game until the next villain is turned. The player may slap at the villain in an effort to get a new pile. If the player fails to win that next pile, they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

He sought out the object of his lust and seduced her while she worshipped at the temple of Athena, and then he retreated into the sea. The goddess Athena discovered the blasphemous act which had occurred within her temple, and she punished Medusa with a terrible curse. Medusa&rsquo;s mind was shattered, her hair turned to snakes, and all those who gazed upon her would be turned to stone.&#10;&#10;The wrathful gods have now come to punish the Atlanteans, sinking their island forever. Knowing that the Atlanteans are clever, Athena unleashed the gorgon, Medusa, to turn the entire populace to stone and thwart any efforts to save Atlantis. As the waters rise, you and your fellow Atlanteans must work quickly to defeat the gorgon and save your people!&#10;&#10;Medusa Unleashed is a new module for Atlantis Rising and can be used with any player count. The new expansion introduces Monsters, persistent misfortunes that continue to hinder your progress once activated. Each round, Medusa is drawn to a random tile on the island.

If there are no workers present, she instead targets the populace.Petrified volunteers fill the island tile and limit the number of available action spaces.&#10;&#10;The Artisan comes to your aid as a new playable councilor. The Artisan can create mystical items to equip your workers, granting them exciting new powers. In a twist on the ancient myth, you can even construct and use a fabled mirror shield to break Medusa&rsquo;s curse! With her curse broken, Medusa turns her rage towards the gods and joins your cause, unlocked as a councilor for future games!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Given the upheavals in Britain outlined in the background above, technologically, socially and musically it is about the Mid 1970&rsquo;s. So too are the clothing fashions!&#10;&#10;Cities and towns have been ransacked and then abandoned to the Undead. Survival lies in small villages in the British countryside. &#10;Remember that this isn&rsquo;t a gun-happy US TV show.&#10;&#10;This is a Campaign driven system, players start with a bunch of unarmed starving survivors that work their way up to hardened professional survivors&hellip; but don&rsquo;t get too attached to anyone!. Of course one-off games are a must too.&#10;&#10;Games should be scenario driven (find food, grab guns from a police station, empty fuel from cars on a road&hellip;. and then get the Hell out of Dunnie on the Wold) or a straight points based Shoot&lsquo;em Up (well, Bash&lsquo;em Up).&#10;&#10;The possibilities are endless and you&rsquo;ve seen enough films, etc. to sort it out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Dice Phase consists of rolling two types of dice to determine the wind direction and exploration events. In the Action Phase each player can choose to Sail, Explore, or Visit a Port. As you Sail and Explore you&rsquo;ll add to your Story. When you Visit a Port you&rsquo;ll get to tell your Story to gain Reputation.

    "Description": "CoronaLine is a 2-player paper-and-pencil game, which was made for everybody stranded at home during the corona virus crisis. All you need is a piece of paper, a pencil and two different markers.&#10;&#10;CoronaLine is played on a grid of 31 dots. Every turn a player must draw a straight line from a dot they already occupy to an unoccupied dot. They can't cross multiple dots at once or their own lines. A player can cross 1 opponent's line to score a point, but then they must rest for at least 1 turn. The player who scores 3 points or is the last one to be able to make a legal move, wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is also great for playing over the internet since most chat rooms allow simple drawings over pictures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seeing Red is a solitaire game on the British Royal Navy&rsquo;s raid on the Kronstadt naval base during the Russian Revolution. Even before the armistice with Germany ended the fighting along the Western Front in WWI, British, French and US forces were deployed to attack Soviet controlled Russia to undermine and perhaps overthrow the Communists from power in Russia. One of the more daring Allied attacks occurred when a British flotilla of Coastal Motor Boats (CMB) was dispatched to raid the Soviet occupied naval base of Kronstadt. The raiders were supported by aircraft launched by the world&rsquo;s first aircraft carrier, HMS Vindictive, making this one of the first combined air/sea attacks in military history.&#10;&#10;Soviet warships based at Kronstadt safeguarded St. Petersburg (soon to be renamed Leningrad), and were severely contesting Allied warships in the Baltic. The harbor was considered one of the most heavily fortified ports in Europe, and many in the British Admiralty considered the raid a suicidal gamble. The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the British ships and aircraft. You must endeavor to overcome the Soviet defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or fleeing, and then escaping with those vessels and aircraft that survive. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
