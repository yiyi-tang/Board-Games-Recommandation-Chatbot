    "Description": "Logical Curling is an abstract game that simulates the game of Curling. Players roll and reroll dice, to try and obtain specific patterns, similar to poker hands, which determine the movement of stones. The higher scoring patterns give players access to more powerful and flexible trajectories - but there are rules that prevent the game from becoming a luck fest.&#10;&#10;The stones have to enter the board and slide according to specific, somewhat limited curved trajectories, and they can bump and dislodge other stones already on the board. So, when deciding which dice to reroll, players have to take into consideration not only the numbers they already have, but also the current board state, and what trajectories might become available with those numbers.&#10;&#10;The player or team that manages to get their stones closest to the target, and bump the opponent's stones away, scores for the round. The player or team with the highest score after 6, 8 or 10 rounds is the winner!&#10;&#10;The game can also be played with a standard deck of cards instead of dice. According to the designer, this variant is more difficult, but also more subtle and interesting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you did what you were told, it was also easy. But the easiest way was to simply not stand out, become invisible, merge with the haze of the city and stay out of everything. What do I care? That&rsquo;s the way it is. Many of the young people didn't mind, they were just interested in having fun, being cool and being able to do what they wanted to do. Why should one then interfere with the stress that the old people made for themselves. Until, yes, until you faced reality, staring at you brutally and cruelly, punching you in the face, breaking your bones or snuffing out your lights. &#10;That reality was a man whom everybody only referred to as &rdquo;The Baron&rdquo;, the crime lord who controlled everything in Mega City. His army of henchmen was everywhere and enforced his will with unlimited brutality and cruelty. &#10;In Secret Hunters, each player leads a group of young people who have formed a gang with the goal of overthrowing The Baron. They all share the fate of having been brutally abused by The Baron and his henchmen. To achieve their goal are not choosy with their methods. They hack terminals, crack safes, bribe the followers of the mystery man, but they would never use weapons. Each gang consists of 4 specialists. A hacker, a safecracker, a spy and a biker. Using the action board and 4 action tokens, the characters are guided through Mega City, but, The Baron does not just watch as his weaknesses uncovered, his henchmen strike mercilessly. Four pieces of evidence need to be found and presented to the court in order to take out The Baron, but to find out which four pieces of evidence they are, the players need to collect clues they get from informants, as to where relevant safes and terminals are located which may contain possible evidence. The gang which has collected all four pieces of evidence and manages to take them to court wins the game and is referred to by the others as the real Secret Hunters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Devil's Chess brings modern board game mechanics to an old classic.  With Devil's Chess you get a bit of randomness, new mechanics and card combos, and a whole lot of new tricks to surprise your opponent. Devil's Chess brings Chess out of the 6th century and into the 21st!&#10;&#10;Setting up the game is easy.  Shuffle both decks, and set them to the left and right of the chessboard.  Each player is dealt a hand of three Playable Cards. To begin the game flip over one Rule Card.  Players then take turns playing cards and moving pieces.  When a player draws a &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Chess&rdquo; card, another new Rule Card is flipped over.&#10;&#10;&#10;     At the beginning of your turn, draw a Playable card if you do not have three&#10;     You may use or discard one Playable Card&#10;     Your turn ends after you move a chess piece&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is over when a King is put into checkmate or when a &ldquo;More Ways to Win!&rdquo; condition is met by a player.&#10;&#10;With 30 unique Rule Cards and 90 Playable Cards, Devil&rsquo;s Chess is unbelievably re-playable.  We know you&rsquo;ll make it a mainstay in your game library.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player has one hand to themselves that they hold, but 2 additional hands, one on each side, that is held in a card rack and shared with their neighbor.&#10;&#10;Players may only follow suit, and if they cannot follow suit from any of their hands, they do not play a card at all. A round ends when one player has no cards left in any of their hands.  Any person who has played all of the cards from each of their hands earns 1 point per trick won.  All players lose 1 point per card left in each of their hands as well as losing a variable number of points based upon aces collected in tricks.&#10;&#10;After several rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. In some scenarios, a unit may represent an entire division, while in others, a unit may represent a single regiment or battalion. During play, the Command cards drive movement, while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo;, and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The stylized battlefield maps emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Finally, the Napoleonic tactics you will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Napoleonic national armies of the day and the actual battlefield terrain features on which they fought.&#10;&#10;The Grand Battles is the seventh expansion for GMT&rsquo;s Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics game system. The expansion features as many as 10 Grand Battle scenarios, 10 EPIC engagements, and a number of standard-sized battles. The Grand Battles battlefield is a whopping 11 hexes deep by 26 hexes wide, and there are two Grand Battles mounted map boards (left and right) included in the expansion. The EPIC battlefield is 11 hexes deep by 20 hexes wide, which is almost double the size of the standard scenario battlefield of 9 hexes deep by 13 hexes wide. Two EPIC battlefield map sheets (left and right) are also included.&#10;&#10;Special Bonus: There are two Grand Battles extended size scenarios on a double-sided preprinted paper map, Waterloo 18 June 1815 and Borodino 7 September 1812. These two battles are 11 hexes deep by 29 hexes wide and because the battlefield is already printed with all the terrain and unit deployments, the time it takes to set up these battles is minimal.&#10; Players will find a number of new units, including Polish French allies, British highlanders, KGL infantry and cavalry, plus all the unit blocks and rules needed when fielding these units in a battle.&#10;&#10;The expansion also includes a number of Leader of Honor blocks. Leader of Honor blocks have a portrait of the Napoleonic leader and were first mentioned in the Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians expansion #5. A Leader of Honor orders more units when a &ldquo;Take Command&rdquo; Command card is played. Please note, the number of Leader of Honor blocks for the various Napoleonic nations will vary and are determined in scale with each Napoleonic Army&rsquo;s field commander status history.&#10; This expansion also presents new rules for Iconic Commanders that are recommended for all EPIC and Grand Battle scenarios. For example: When Napoleon is in command, because of his excellent grasp and flow of a battle, after the play of a Scout Command card, the French player, when drawing two new Command cards, can keep both cards and discard one Command card from his hand. When Wellington is in command, because of his keen eye for terrain, the British player prior to the battle may redeploy up to 4 hexes of units. For example: One unit could redeploy up to 4 hexes or two units 2 hexes each or four units 1 hex each, etc. Other Napoleonic nations also have their own unique Iconic Commander rules.&#10;&#10;Knowing that it is not always easy to muster eight players, you will find that a scenario of EPIC Napoleonics will play out very well with just two players. It is highly recommended players give the EPIC scenarios a try, playing one on one. While a Grand Battle game is best played with eight players (four players taking command on each side). The Grand Battles rules found in this expansion, however, have be slightly modified from the Grand Battles rules originally presented in EPIC Napoleonics expansion #6. Basically, we found after playing through these larger battle scenarios a number of times, that the updated rules will allow each player to be more involved and have greater control during the entire battle.&#10; To experience the maximum enjoyment with these two Napoleonic game formats, both EPIC and Grand Battle scenarios are best played using the Command card and Tactician card decks that were part of the Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians expansion.&#10; It is important to also note in order to play most EPIC Napoleonics scenarios, players will need a copy of the Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonic core game and many of its expansions (Spanish Army, Russian Army, Austrian Army, Prussian Army, Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians, EPIC Napoleonics and The Grand Battles).&#10;&#10;Again as I stated previously in the EPIC Napoleonics expansion, it is not the intention of GMT or myself, to require a player to buy multiple copies of the Napoleonic game to play a Grand Battle scenario. I would truly hope, that two friends, both who own copies of the Napoleonic game and expansions could come together with their games, set up a Grand Battles scenario and share in the fun with six more of their friends.&#10; Although the scope and scale of our Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonic game has increased two fold again, the basic rules of play for the most part, have remained the same.

    "Description": "Carrot Bunny Den is a competitive little card game to share among friends (ages 18+). It is played by 3 to 10 players and games last about 15 minutes. It is very quick to learn and triggers good bursts of laughter. The graphical direction may surprise you but it's just like the gameplay, it looks cute but it's hard!&#10;&#10;In Carrot Bunny Den, nature goes crazy and it's up to us to fix it. Each player starts with 3 cards representing combinations of the words &quot;carrot&quot;, &quot;rabbit&quot; and &quot; den&quot; and a decadent vision of our poor nature. During the game, the players exchange words by pointing at each other and saying one of these three words. But beware, each word has an associated rule! One must not make mistakes when speaking and remain attentive to the words spoken. Indeed, when a spoken combination corresponds to one of your cards, you can put it down!&#10;&#10;It's a game of memory and quick decision making. Players must choose the words they say skillfully and quickly, according to their hand. They choose who they give the floor to based on what they understand of other people's play. They have to adapt constantly to hope to put down every card. The first player to put down all his hand wins the round and the game is played in three winning rounds. Nature needs you! Ready for the challenge?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Liphook Historical Wargames Group was formed in 2000 to refight Napoleon&rsquo;s major battles during their 200th anniversary year. During the last 16 years the group has successfully fought over 38 battles, which have included Wagram, Salamanca, Borodino, Leipzig and Waterloo, using its own, home-grown set of specially designed rules.&#10;&#10;Art of Command evolved from the group&rsquo;s desire to refight big, multiplayer battles. The set aim was to simulate the confusion and impact the chain of command has on such major engagements through the interaction of players representing the various commanders from brigade through divisions and corps to army level. The objective is to replicate the historical ebb and flow of battle at battalion, squadron and battery level, refight them over an accurately contoured, scaled model and complete them in a day.&#10;&#10;The group initially tested existing, commercial rule sets but felt that these were designed for small table engagements lasting a couple of hours or larger games with brigades being the smallest units represented. It was concluded that we needed rules that would encompass command, communications and control functions.  Rules that would enable us to coordinate and accommodate a large group of commanders refighting battles the size of Waterloo, but still represent battalions and squadrons on the wargame table.  We believe Art of Command fulfills this need and the fact that the group successfully completed almost all the battles in a day is a testament to the robust nature of the rules and the thorough testing which has taken place.&#10;&#10;We recommend Art of Command to those wargamers who wish to simulate a major Napoleonic, multiplayer battle in a day.   We hope that you find their simplicity and resultant speed of play beneficial in recreating your own big battles and, above all, recreate the fun and excitement of a hobby that we all enjoy.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;1 fig (inf.-cav.) = 50/60 men&#10;1 gun = 1 gun&#10;Ground Scale: 1/1000 for 25/28 mm  (half for 15mm)&#10;each Game Period: 10-15 min real time&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once you have become familiar with the core elements then your games will flow more quickly and a larger battle such as Wittstock should last for 3-4 hours depending on the arrival of the reinforcements!&#10;&#10;Nothing is certain; but generals that hone their skills are more likely to be victorious.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You have been given three Ether flyers and the best soldiers the British Empire could muster and you are headed to Mars to do the Queen&rsquo;s bidding.&#10;&#10;Q&amp;P is designed to balance the mass and ferocity of the local races of Mars against the technology and training of the Colonial powers and to provide a fair and reasonable struggle for both imperial General and Martian Odwar.&#10;&#10;This rule set does include the following:&#10;&#10;     All rules necessary to play a VSF version of the game.&#10;     An alternative timeline for VSF genre play.&#10;     Unit lists detailing British, Imperial Red Martian, Black Martian, Green Martian and Cephalopod forces.&#10;     A eight-scenario campaign that will allow you to play your way through the British Punitive Expedition to Mars in 1901 from the initial encounters with Red Martian Miltia forces all the way through to the final destruction of the British forces on Mars.&#10;     A blank unit command sheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;CAMPAIGN SCENARIOS:&#10;Each of the scenarios in this rulebook is written to be fought as a pure VSF battle.

Elemental abilities deal double damage to opposing elements&mdash;however, this means that each element&rsquo;s weakest target is also its biggest threat. Characters placed in the back row cannot be attacked until the character in front of them is defeated, meaning that weaker characters are often placed in the back.

All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.&#10;&#10;Each player has a flight of four bombers, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed&#10;&#10;Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.&#10;&#10;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&#10;&#10;Each aircraft is sold separately.  Only pay for the ones you want, and print out as many copies as you need to create your own epic WWII air battle.&#10;&#10;The B-29 Superfortress performed strategic bombing of Japan's factories and infrastructure.  A pressurized cockpit reduced crew fatigue, allowing long flights over the ocean.  The Superfortress featured heavy defensive armament and a massive bomb load.&#10;&#10;This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the B-29 Superfortress and four scenarios that reference other aircraft:&#10;&#10;     Target 357: At high altitudes, Ki-84 Franks  intercept B-29s inbound to the Nakajima engine plant in Tokyo.&#10;     Thumper:  A lone B-29 tries to escape a lone Ki-61&#10;     Firestorm: B-29s drop incendiary bombs on Tokyo at night. Defending Ki-84 depend on spotlights to illuminate the bombers.&#10;     Target 357 Again: The capture of Iwo Jima allows P-51D Mustangs to escort B-29s, while Ki-61s protect the factory complex.&#10;&#10;&#10;This set contains miniatures for the B-29, along a city target,  flak templates, spotlight templates, illumination markers, and and hit markers.

Building upon the superb third rate plastic sprues, the box contains additional metal components to make the following famous vessels, all of which were present at the Battle of Trafalgar!&#10;&#10;HMS Bellerophon - This 74 gun third rate has a long and storied history, serving during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Whilst most of this time was spent on blockades or convoy escort duties, she distinguished herself in three fleet actions: The Glorious First of June, the Battle of the Nile, and the Battle of Trafalgar. At Trafalgar, she fought an embittered battle against both Spanish and French ships and suffered heavy losses including the death of her Captain, John Cooke.&#10;&#10;After Trafalgar, she resumed blockade duties around France, as well as performing more escort duties in North America between 1813 and 1814. Assigned to blockade Rochefort in 1815, HMS Bellepheron was the vessel on which Napoleon came aboard to officially surrender to the British following his defeat at Waterloo (finding his escape to America blocked).&#10;&#10;HMS Revenge - Launched on 13 April 1805, HMS Revenge was a 74-gun third rate. She was one of a larger class of 74s with 24-pounder guns on the upper deck rather than the more common 18-pounders.&#10;&#10;Newly commissioned, and under the command of Captain Robert Moorsom, she served at the Battle of Trafalgar in Admiral Collingwood's column. She would continue to serve until 1842.&#10;&#10;HMS Tonnant - An 80-gun third-rate of the Royal Navy, she was originally the lead ship of the French Tonnant class captured by the British at the Siege of Toulon (August 1793), recaptured by the French at the break of the Siege (December 1793) and subsequently recaptured by Horatio Nelson's fleet at Aboukir Bay during the Battle of the Nile (1 August 1798). She would go on to fight at the Battle of Trafalgar against the French.&#10;&#10;Tonnant was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane over the majority of the Chesapeake Bay campaigns as part of the War of 1812. Of particular note, Francis Scott Key dined aboard the Tonnant as part of a prisoner release negotiation. As a result of their inferred knowledge of the forthcoming attack on Baltimore at Fort McHenry. As a result, he and his fellows were not allowed to return until after the attack. It was in witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry that Key wrote the poem 'Defence of Fort M'Henry' later to become &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
