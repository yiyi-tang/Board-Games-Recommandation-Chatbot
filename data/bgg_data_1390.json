A round begins by each player dealing out five card onto the play surface from left to right. The cards have a silhouette of an Axe or a Shield along the long edge of the card. When the edges of the cards line up they will either match axes, shields, or have no match. The number of Axes is your attack strength, the number of shields your defense. If you have more Axes than you opponent has Shields, you have wounded their tribe. See what their highest numbered card is. If it is a Warrior, remove the card from play. If it is the King, give them one of your matching wound cards. If it is their Witch, remove their Witch from play, but also remove your lowest Warrior card.&#10;&#10;If the initial draw of cards results in a tie, each player plays another card to the right of the last card played.

All this in a limited time where you will have to think fast and cooperate with your companions!&#10;But that's not all, because many special levels await you with which to test yourselves as a team. You may have to serve the chacorritos in a buffet, or play with one less table, or you may not be able to speak to communicate during the game or even face your friends in the competitive levels.

Your mine will strike the earth at the Barrier Mountains, and uncover the secrets of an ancient artifact buried deep below. Will you discover its secrets? Or will your mine fall to the odd creatures that inhabit these mountains? Play to find out, as your mine tells its story!&#10;&#10;Barrier Mountains is an expansion to Dwarf Mine (the Dwarf Mine base game is required to play).&#10;&#10;Like Dwarf Mine, Barrier Mountains is a game played by drawing a mine on graph paper. On your turn, you will first draw (dig) rooms, hallways, and ladders for your mine! Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.&#10;&#10;After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!&#10;&#10;Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end. Your game ends when your population reaches 0. By the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll have created rich and unique history for your mine &ndash; no two games are the same!&#10;&#10;Players are getting VP during the game and trying to see how many VP they can get each time they play. Kind of like a high score.&#10;&#10;Barrier Mountains expands on this experience, by offering a sci-fi style of gameplay, which includes:&#10;    A brand new Dwarf Mine map&#10;    4 new rooms for your Dwarf Mine&#10;    4 new final bosses to fight&#10;    4 new Treasure Tables (one for each mine level)&#10;    4 new Combat Tables (one for each mine level)&#10;    New mechanics unique to this map&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek their luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;In Village, each player takes the reins of a family and attempts to help them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone, and given enough time people will vanish. Those who find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each turn you take a cube from an area on the game board, then take the action of that area. The board has zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house, and each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors as well as black cubes that serve as curses. Many of these areas offer multiple actions, so if for example you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, or a scroll, or you can convert wheat to gold. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only endgame scoring. The round ends when no cubes remain at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;Village: Big Box contains the Village base game, the Inn and Port expansions, every promo previously released, and a new &quot;Marriage&quot; expansion, with all of the materials being integrable with one another and with the game now containing a solo mode as well as revised gameplay, dual-layered player boards, and a larger, double-sided main board that eliminates the need for the overlays used in the original expansions.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the weary eight-year-long full-scale anti-fascist war, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), temporarily united to resist invasion by militaristic Japan, were once again faced with the crisis of breaking up. An outright war that would soon engulf the whole country was about to come.&#10;&#10;This strategic-level wargame applies our innovative game system specially designed for the Chinese Civil War. You will play as the Chinese Nationalist Party or the Chinese Communist Party through the civil war between 1945 and 1949. With a unique attack-and-reaction system and area control system, you can experience different tactics such as mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare in the Chinese Civil War, deploying resources across the whole country. With a political simulation and event system, you can also experience the political gambles of both sides in the civil war.&#10;&#10;This is a war that will determine the fate of China's future. Should you concentrate your superior forces to destroy the enemy in one move, or reserve your strength by mobile operations? Should you strive to lead your side to a total victory in the war or conduct negotiations to gain an advantage in the coalition government? The choice is up to you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But be careful. Fellow associates are attempting to do the same thing, and once you play a dirty trick on them, they now have access to this new trick. Anyone who has worked in an office environment knows there is no more brutal kill-or-be-killed workplace than the modern office setting.&#10;&#10;Thrown Under the Bus (TUtB) is designed so that non-gamers could easily learn and enjoy but still has the complexities and advanced tactics that will keep seasoned gamers engaged. TUtB hits that delicate balance while creating a fun thematic experience. An average game takes between 30 and 60 minutes depending on group size of 2-6 players and their experience level. The Ages 16+ is more of a theme suggestion, the mechanics and rules can easily be understood by younger players but we felt why get them jaded about work before they enter the workforce. Let them discover that joy the same way we did&hellip;&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t let the cut throat theme fool you, Thrown Under the Bus is fun and cathartic release at the end of a long week of dealing with your coworkers quirks and protecting your station at work.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay revolves around strategic pathfinding and turn optimisation. On your turn, your opponent will first populate the forest with berries and trinkets using the seed deck. You may then alter the paths through the forest by rotating the 7 central tiles, before moving your Bowerbird along its current path, collecting the trinkets you pass over. If you can return your bowerbird to the nest, you score points depending on the number of trinkets it returned with. You also earn a powerful crest to enhance your future turns. The player with the most points from their bower and personal goal cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: Great Bowerbirds (endemic to Australia) have a fascination with anything green or white. The Males will collect as many discarded toys, plastic scraps, stones, bones and shells as they can find to decorate their nest (Bower), in the hopes of scoring a partner during the November-January mating season. Young males will even work together on a &ldquo;practice&rdquo; nest, to ensure their skills are properly honed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Chris Dias (Naramata, Ultramodern5) designed this cooperative tabletop game which allows two to four players to assume the roles of the characters from Brothers Bond and journey across a mystical land, partaking in numerous adventures in hopes of saving the world. Each game resides within a larger connected campaign where heroes travel across the land, engage in high-pitched action, and progress a story towards an epic climax. Along the way, characters develop and improve between sessions, carrying over skills and choices to later games.&#10;&#10;The story of Brothers Bond centers on Yoshi, the young, arrogant crown prince set to inherit an empire.&#10;&#10;After falling into trouble with his father, the one man he fears, Yoshi runs from home.  Picked up by two blind wandering samurai, Yoshi grows up to learn honor and strength.  He then decides to return to his homeland to claim his birthright and save his people from a demon invasion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, it&rsquo;s the turn of the queen bee situated on your left.&#10;&#10;The game can end because of two different situations:&#10;&#10;- When there are no bees left to play.

Each round of the game, players are presented with the current market conditions and must make strategic decisions on what to buy, sell, or hold in order to increase the value of their client's portfolio.  Players must push their luck to squeeze out as much money as possible before the inevitable market crash as only cash on hand is important once the market tanks.  Do you have what it takes to beat out the other interns and impress the boss? Try it out in Brokers: The Stock Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly selecting 3 event cards including the Market Crash event and mixing them. Then 5 or 6 cards (depending on the number of players is add on top of these 3 cards.  This is the event deck.  The Stock Summary Sheets are placed in the play area and the price deck for each is shuffled and the top card of each is played face up on top of the corresponding Stock Summary Sheet. A marker token is placed on each Stock Summary Sheet for on the price listed on its current price card. The Energy stock does not have a price deck and instead has its marking token placed on 155. Each player is given a set of action cards which includes 3 buys, 3 sells, 2 praises and 2 critiques.  Each player is given a starting portfolio of $150, and share of 2 Retail, 2 Venture Capital, 2 Energy, and 2 Manufacturing stock certificates.  Players receive additional $150 on turns 2 and 3. One player is selected as the Lead Intern.&#10;&#10;The game is played in up to 8 or 9 rounds depending on the number of players and each round an event is played which alters the rules of play for that round. Each round players secretly plan which 3 action cards they will play and players reveal their actions together. The player with the Lead Intern card starts playing 1 or 2 action cards for a single stock type and each player does the same taking turns going clockwise until all actions are played.  The action cards players choose influence the order of decisions that the other players make.  As players buy shares the price increases for the next player. As players sell share the price of decreases for the next player.  If a player plays a praise card, the price increases by two values. If a player plays a critique card, the price decreases by two values.&#10;&#10;Once all actions are played, players collect exclusive roles for fulfilling specific portfolio requirements. The Major Retail shareholder role gives the player double dividends for retail shares. The Major Manufacturing shareholder gives the player an extra sell action each round. The Major Venture Capital shareholder role gives the player a free share of Venture Capital each round. The Most Diversified Portfolio role give the player an extra $25 dividend for having at least one of each stock and the greatest number of stocks among all the players.&#10;&#10;After roles are collected or redistributed, players collect dividends for owning the stocks in their portfolios, and then the Lead Intern card is passed to the next player clockwise.  The game ends at the end of the round when the Market Crash event occurs. At that point, the player with the highest cash score (not share value) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
