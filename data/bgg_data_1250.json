    "Description": "By 1942 the British Admiralty was increasingly fearful of losing control in the skies over the English Channel. Earlier in February the German&rsquo;s Operation Cerberus saw the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gniesenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sail up the channel to ports in Germany, beneath the very noses of the RAF and Royal Navy. New German radar and anti-aircraft and shore batteries installed along the north coast of France were making life more dangerous for Allied shipping as well as increasingly dangerous for their bombers crossing the channel to conduct bombing raids in occupied France, Belgium as well as Nazi Germany.&#10;&#10;In May it was decided to conduct a raid on the channel port of Dieppe. Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbattan, commander of the British Combined Operations Center, was charged with planning the raid. It was hoped the raid could cause serious damage to the German&rsquo;s defenses, demonstrate to the Soviets that the Allies were earnest in their desire to quickly take the war to the Germans on the European continent, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of large scale amphibious operations. The RAF was counting on the Luftwaffe also rising up to aggressively defend the skies above Dieppe in a battle the RAF leadership was confident they could win. It was also hoped that intelligence agents, that would land with the 5,000 Canadian and 1,000 British  assault troops (along with 50 US Rangers), could perform &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; operations to capture German code books, samples of their new radar technology, and perhaps an Enigma code machine (this aspect of the raid was overseen by Ian Fleming, the future author of the James Bond novels). An earlier raid to be launched in July, dubbed Operation Rutter, was cancelled but the raid was resurrected in the first week of August and called Operation Jubilee.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your opponents?

The Order dice test system, at the mechanical core of Mythic Americas, and an extremely balanced rules set offers Warband leaders great tactical freedom, but the game still offers lots of opportunity for fate and chance to have a say in the outcome of your battles.

Their aim is to get rid of all cards as soon as possible. To do so, each player takes 5 cards in her/his hand, then the three dice are thrown. The pips and colour shown by the dice now offer possibilities for the players to discard some of their cards (&bdquo;abspecken&ldquo;), or they imply restrictions, depending on the combination of the 5 cards a player holds in her/his hand. So the players need to do some deduction to keep their chances for winning the game.&#10;As soon as one player got rid of all of his 24 cards the game round is over. The players who still have cards collect minus points. The game ends as soon as one of the players has collected 33 minus points in total.&#10;ABspecken is an easy-to-start family game which implies some challenges in combination and a certain proportion of good or bad luck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Note by the publisher: Interested in licencing ABspecken?

These are placed behind a phylactery and will be used for the duration of the game to fuel both your attacks and defense by producing blood, bones, and souls equal to their cost. These resources will be used to play other minions.&#10;     Ensure that your phylacteries are safe by guarding them with your minions. Using resources from your collector minions, you can place down a defender to protect one of your phylacteries. Build a strong defense by placing high health minions as defenders, and having spells ready to counter attacks.&#10;     There are countless ways to overcome your opponents' defenses and seal your victory! Once you have enough resources from your collector minions, launch your attack by spending symbols equal to your attacker's cost. Buff your minion with spells to create an unstoppable assault!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Solitaire Print and Play Fishing Dice Game!&#10;&#10;In this solitaire fishing dice game You roll 3 six-sided dice. You catch a fish when you roll doubles and one different number, that different number is the kind of fish you catch.&#10;&#10;You must always catch the small fish of a kind first, then you may catch the big one. You can never catch the big one first if the small one is still available! once you catch both of a kind those are no longer available.&#10;&#10;Small fish are worth 1 point, big fish are worth 2 points!&#10;&#10;If you roll trips of any kind you can catch any fish you want respecting the small to big fish catching rule. In other words, when choosing which fish to catch after rolling trips, if a small one of that kind is available you must catch the small one, but if the small one has already been caught, you can go ahead and take the big one!&#10;&#10;You can always use a &quot;Lucky Nudges&quot; box to change the number of one die, but only by one unit, either up or down. As an example you can change a number 2 roll to a 1 or a 3 by marking one of the &quot;Lucky Nudges&quot; boxes. Use the lucky nudges carefully, you don't get more than the available four per game! Once they're gone, they're gone!&#10;&#10;If you roll 1 2 3 the game ends immediately! The game also ends with a 4 5 6 roll or by rolling three &quot;Awful Casts!&quot; An Awful Cast roll is a &quot;nothing&quot; roll! Like a 1 4 6 or 3 4 5 for example (if you happen to &quot;catch&quot; a fish that's already been caught, nothing happens, roll again, this is not considered a &quot;nothing&quot; roll). So When you roll an &quot;Awful Cast&quot; mark one of the appropriate boxes. If all three get marked the game ends. BUT! with the 4 5 6 roll and the Awful Casts you may use one of your Lucky Nudges to keep going AND maybe even catch a fish in the process! As long as lucky Nudges are still available of course.&#10;&#10;Keep rolling until you either catch all the fish or run out of luck!

Separate the white and black cards into two piles and shuffle. The first player draws a white card, reads it aloud, does what it says, then the next player does the same until someone picks up a white &quot;DRAW&quot; card. Once this happens then that player must draw a black from the other pile, read it aloud, and do what it says or drink. If the challenge on the card is completed successfully, the card can be kept by the player and counted as points. Some cards are far more challenging than others and therefore are worth more but also have greater consequences for failing to successfully perform the challenge.

Warring human faction must choose to keep fighting one another or join forces to defeat the Alien invaders... or both... or side with the aliens to get help in defeating their human foes... or not.&#10;&#10;Day of Independence is a grand strategy game for 2 - 5 players set in an alternative steam-punky future. Each player plays a human power trying to take over the world. At some random point in the game Aliens may show up. The Aliens' true intentions are slowly revealed over time, and players must decide whether to fight the Aliens or not. Players choose actions that will make them either Collaborators with the Aliens or Resistance Fighters. The benefits and penalties of each decision depends upon the Aliens' true intentions. Lots of strategy, forced cooperation, and the ever present possibility of a knife in the back makes this game fun and different each time it is played.&#10;&#10;You live on an Earth that is a fractured world of rival human powers, struggling against each other for dominance&hellip; you know, the usual &mdash; like it&rsquo;s always been. Each unwilling to let other nations just chill.&#10;Culture, art, religion, language, population, and even military might have been reduced to a single quantified unit of influential power, called Influence.&#10;Advances in technology have allowed all economies and industries to rely on just three resources: Ever-Stones, a chewy red resource crystal especially good in stews and as a sealant for nuclear waste sites; Green Avoidium, an aromatic mineral green resource used to put off chores and unpleasant tasks until tomorrow, and; Un-salt, a yellow resource ore best described by what it isn&rsquo;t &mdash; it&rsquo;s not salt.&#10;Scientist the world over have postulated the possibility of extra-terrestrial life for centuries, but there has never been any proof that Aliens exist and no proof that they are heading to earth on a mothership filled with super-powerful weapons and a willingness to use them.&#10;So don&rsquo;t worry. There probably aren&rsquo;t any super advanced Aliens out there with incredible technology that could pose a threat to humankind. Just keep fighting amongst yourselves. If only you could capture enough territory to declare yourself Ruler of Earth, everything would be great. All problems would be solved and you could go to bed at night and sleep the sleep of the just, knowing that you are the winner, &lsquo;cause winning is all that matters.&#10;But, if Aliens came&hellip; they might Exterminate the human race, or maybe they would come to Enslave you all. If they knew the Earth contained the Resource of Interest that they have been scouring the Universe for, they might come to Mine the Earth dry. Or maybe they might just come to say &lsquo;hi&rsquo;, as part of their mission to Explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations. Or maybe capitalism would be their bag, and they would come to Trade, with a special offer, just for you.&#10;But they probably don&rsquo;t exist, so just keep fighting amongst yourselves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An ancient Chinese folk tale recounts that the Jade Emperor once held a feast to which he invited all the animals of the forest. Only twelve showed up. To reward his guests, the Jade Emperor announced that he would name a year of the Zodiac after each. The animals were all duly honored. But then the question of order arose. The Ox, the brawniest of all the animals but also the most dull-witted, insisted he should be first due to his tremendous strength. The Rat, puniest of all the animals but also the most cunning, argued he should be first due to his keen intelligence. The other animals, who possessed both strength and intelligence in varying degrees, soon joined the quarrel. Some sided with the Ox, saying that strength was more important than intelligence. Others sided with the Rat, saying intelligence was more important than strength. While still others wavered back and forth. So to settle the matter, the Rat proposed a contest.&#10;&#10;This game uses the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Each animal possesses its own unique combination of strength and intelligence. During the first phase, strength is crucial; in the second phase, intelligence is valued.&#10;&#10;The board starts off empty. The players alternately place their pieces on their sides of the board. Each piece must be placed on the unoccupied yellow spaces within their first three rows. The direction a piece is facing indicates which player it belongs to. After each player has placed all their twelve pieces, the game can begin. North, for having gone second during the set-up stage, gets to move first.&#10;&#10;An animal can not capture an animal stronger than itself. The animals are ranked in strength, from strongest to weakest: 12. Ox, 11. Tiger, 10. Dragon, 9. Horse, 8. Dog, 7. Goat, 6. Pig, 5. Snake, 4. Rooster, 3. Monkey, 2. Hare, 1. Rat.&#10;&#10;When an animal reaches the far rank, it is removed to the side and scored according to its intelligence. The animals are ranked in intelligence, from smartest to dumbest: 12. Rat, 11. Hare, 10 Monkey, 9. Rooster, 8. Snake, 7. Pig, 6. Goat, 5. Dog, 4. Horse, 3. Dragon, 2. Tiger, 1. Ox. As can be seen, an animal's intelligence is in inverse proportion to its strength. In other words, the weaker the animal the more valuable it is and vice-versa.&#10;&#10;Other than this, normal Checkers rules apply. Pieces can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.&#10;&#10;When one player is unable to make a move, by either having no more pieces left on the Checkerboard, or by having all his pieces blocked from movement, the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;Incidentally, through prudent and skillful play the Rat was able to easily defeat the brute efforts of the Ox. On the Chinese Calendar, the Year of the Rat is first, and Year of the Ox second to this very day.&#10;&#10;",

Perform ridiculous rituals, collect disciples and forget your morals in this fun global strategy tabletop game.&#10;&#10;Disciples is an easy-to-learn tabletop game, where you are a cult leader who collects disciples and sets up tents and temples around the world. The first player to build three temples wins.&#10;&#10;You start by using your intuition to pick the 2 cards that decide your cult's name and rules. For example &quot;Angels of the Gold Hive&quot; or &quot; Infinite Crown of Serpents&quot;. There are 144 possible combinations of cults. On each turn you roll, move across the map, perform your peculiar ritual, collect new disciples, tempt fate with the Cards of Consequence and built your tents and temples in various cities around the world.&#10;&#10;There will be lots of laughs, surprises and turns of fortune. Luck meets strategy. You may get arrested or sued for your shady behavior. If you think you're winning, you probably won't. The game takes about 30 - 60 min.&#10;&#10;This game is rated for ages 17+. Cult leaders are typically inappropriate. Fun for gamers and civilians alike.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "District Commander: Kandahar simulates the problems facing insurgent and counterinsurgent commanders in southern Afghanistan circa 2009-2010. This is not Brian Train's first or even second game about this conflict, and you might be wondering, what does this one have to offer? We think that the District Commander system - with its emphasis on bluff and deception, scarce resources and shifting operational goals - is an especially good fit for capturing the pace and nature of operations in Afghanistan.&#10;&#10;Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players build sequences of attacks and responses that resolve in reverse order, representing the ebb and flow of a theoretical fantasy fight scene two psychics are projecting into each other's minds. Planning your own moves isn't the only key to victory; you'll also use your psychic and magical abilities to manipulate when - or IF - actions resolve!&#10;&#10;Players select one of the four characters in a diverse cast of psychic combatants, using their unique skillsets to emerge victorious. Every character deck has its own strengths and weaknesses, with a depth of tactical play that ensures no two fights are the same.&#10;&#10;In Fight Sequence, players take turns playing Actions or passing, building a series of Actions until both players pass consecutively [with passes being forced once the maximum sequence size of 9 Actions is met]. Once that happens, the entire sequence then resolves in reverse order, starting with the last Action played. Timing your Actions for maximum effect is crucial, but every character has some ability to manipulate that timing to work more in their favor. Even the best-laid plans aren't foolproof!&#10;&#10;Actions are either attacks or responses - use your attacks to damage your opponent, and your responses to defend yourself from opposing attacks or support your strategy. Every card in the game can be played as either an attack or a response, so you're never out of options. Damage is represented by discarding cards from your deck; no paper, pen, dice, or tracker apps required. Just choose your characters, shuffle your decks, and begin!&#10;&#10;In addition to four varied characters with different styles and movesets, The First Chapter also includes the Academy decks, which use a more streamlined subset of cards to help ease players into the reverse-action-programming nature of the game.&#10;&#10;-- description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

However, there is a price for this; a white dragon replaces 2 normal dragons and takes twice as much magic to summon. So in a 36-health game, you could either bring 2 normal dragons or 1 white dragon. Any color dragon summoning spell can summon a white dragon, however, it takes 14 points of magic instead of 7.
