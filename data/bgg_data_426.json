    "Description": "Daruma Otoshi is a Japanese cultural toy. The first part of the name &quot;Daruma&quot; is the name of the doll (usually the face of a angry-looking Japanese samurai-like guy, but also can be friendly looking, depends on the artist who draws the face),&quot;Otoshi&quot; means &quot;to drop&quot;.&#10;&#10;This traditional Japanese game requires a good eye and fast reflexes. The purpose of the game is to knock the center pieces out with the hammer without causing the doll on top to fall over. The doll on top is called daruma; he represents the Buddhist priest Bodhidharma who is said to have lost the use of his arms and legs after meditating for nine years. Today daruma are used as a charm for the fulfillment of a special wish, for example, passing the entrance exam to high school or winning an election. The character written on this daruma&#194;&#129;s belly reads &#194;&#129;gfuku,&#194;&#129;h or good fortune. Japanese children can play with daruma otoshi when they are alone by seeing how many blocks they can knock out before daruma topples over. They may also play it with friends and take turns until someone causes daruma to fall over.&#10;&#10;Usually made of solid wood.&#10;&#10;",

Enhances creativity and lateral thinking and ideal for anyone wishing to improve their public speaking skills. 3 to 8 players. Ages 8 to adult.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the game are the 500 &lsquo;Opinion&rsquo; cards. When a player lands on an Opinion Square he or she becomes &lsquo;the Candidate&rsquo;, draws an Opinion Card and reads it to the other players. The Candidate then selects an opponent from amongst the other players who is now called &lsquo;the Opposition&rsquo;. The Candidate argues in favor of the Opinion for up to a minute. Players cannot choose sides - they must argue the Opinion as it stands - whether they agree with the statement or not.&#10;&#10;The opposing player then argues against the opinion. The remaining players vote for the best argument - not for the argument they agree with - but for the best defended position.&#10;&#10;Because the voters are not casting a secret ballot, but have to justify why they think an argument was good or bad, this part of the game can get pretty raucous as players try to convince each other that someone&rsquo;s argument was absolute balderdash.&#10;&#10;Opinions, however, is not just about arguing an opinion. There is a whole story to the game which unfolds as players race for the Presidency. Good and bad press, in the form of the 500 Press Cards, alternatively encourages or plagues players as they seek support for their campaigns. Get arrested in a riot, take a vacation in the Caribbean, rescue a kitten and meet the Queen as your career unfolds (or unwinds!). get caught in compromising situations or rewarded for your service to the community as you work your way to the top.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The game of Chandal Mandal&quot;&#10;&#10;A variation of Chaupar, the national game of India. Chaupar later became Parcheesi - aka Ludo - in the west. Invented by Akbar the Great, ruler of India, who lived from 1542 to 1605.&#10;&#10;Think of it as 16 player Chaupar, with 16 arms instead of 4, and you are a long way there. The board is made out of 16 parallelograms arranged in a circle around a centre. Each parallelogram is divided in 24 fields, in 3 rows of 8. Each of the 16 players get 4 pawns each. Four (traditional) dice are used, with the longer sides marked 1,2,10 and 12. As in Chaupar, the pieces are moved anti-clockwise, and go around the whole circle. The first player out wins the agreed amount from all other 15, and each subsequent finisher also gets that same amount from whoever is still left to finish. So the last player loses the most.&#10;&#10;His Majesty seemed to play 12 broad variations:&#10;&#10;1. No pawn can remove another pawn, but it moves on by itself instead.&#10;2. Single pawns may be captured, and are sent back to start.&#10;3. With each throw two pawns are moved at a time (with or without the option to capture).&#10;4. Three or four pawns are moved like this.&#10;5. The dice are thrown four times, and four pawns are moved at each throw.&#10;   &#10;Usually players would all move in the same direction, but sometimes some players would move anti-clockwise, whilst other would play clockwise.&#10;&#10;6. A player is out when he reaches the starting point of the player directly opposite, moving from the middle row of his opposite number into the empty centre space. Longer games would require players to reach the starting point of the player sitting on the left.&#10;7. Each player has three throws. On the first throw two own pawns are moved, on the second throw, the player moves one own pawn, and one pawn belonging to the player on the right. On the third throw, again, one own pawn gets moved, plus the player on the left may also move one pawn belonging to that player. Pawns belonging to neighbours cannot be removed, and when they land in the same row as a player's own pieces, they are moved as if they belonged to the throwing player.&#10;8. Two pawns together may hit two other pawns, but single pawns cannot hit each other.&#10;9. Four pawns combined can remove 3 pawns, 3 pawns can hit groups of 2, 2 can hit single pawns, but single pieces cannot remove any.&#10;10. A player whose turn it is moves according to the dice rolled, the player opposite him moves at the same time, but uses the eyes of the bottom side of the dice, whilst the players on the left and right also move, but according to the eyes on the left and right face of the rolled die.&#10;11. Five dice are rolled. The active player moves the sum of the two highest rolls. The next highest roll is used by the person on the opposite side of the board. The lowest two rolls are used by the players sitting on the left and right.&#10;12. Five dice and five pawns. At every throw, the result of one of the rolled dice is given to the player on the right. In a variation to this, the thrower would name four players before rolling, and would give one result to each of these players, keeping only the fifth die. And when only a few points are left to get pukhtah, the remaining points go to those near to where the dice come to rest.&#10;&#10;If the game was played by less people the board and the number of dice thrown would be amended accordingly. It is highly likely the boards were frequently life-sized and groups of slave girls were sent around the track, dressed in appropriate colours.&#10;&#10;Brief history: ask anyone to name great rulers of history and you are unlikely to hear the name Akbar, ruler of the Mughal Empire (1556-1605). Leaving remarkable military and administrative successes, and a fondness for alcohol and women to one side, the illiterate and, at times, brutal man, also had a passion for religious tolerance and class harmony. He surrounded himself with scholars, thinkers and poets, and was persuaded by the Plato school that argued that a great ruler should be like a philosopher-king. Whilst trying to unify the different religions, he became a great patron of the arts and literature, for which he is best remembered. Thanks to the recordings in the &quot;Ain I Akabari&quot;, third volume of the &quot;Akbarn&#196;&#129;ma&quot;, a detailed biography and history record kept by his close advisor and court scribe, Abu'l Fazl, we know that the good bloke also had a weak spot for games, and had even invented a game of his own. It is because of Abu'l Fazl passion for detail and accuracy that the rules of this elaborate Chaupar descendant have been preserved to this day, as part of a seperate chapter on Amusements.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players are shepherds in medieval Spain seeking to expand and make wise investments in their flocks.  Throughout the game they choose from among the roles of Lambing, Market Day, Place Investments, Cry Wolf, Bear, Barter and Stray Sheep.&#10;&#10;In lambing, the players can choose to cooperate and help the other shepherds or go it alone, in hopes of receiving a larger return.  As the players all cooperate, the predator threat from the wolves and bear is minimized.  If any player chooses not to cooperate, then the predator threat grows, usually threatening the non-cooperative players the most.&#10;&#10;If the Cry Wolf role is chosen, then the players must (in an order determined by earlier play) roll a twelve-sided die to determine whether their flock has been attacked. Once a flock is attacked, the remaining players&rsquo; flocks are safe for the rest of the round.  There are many different ways a player can minimize the predator threat to herself.&#10;&#10;In order to make investments, a player must sell his sheep (which are also points at the end of the game) and then place the gold received as investments in a Ram, Best Pasture, Market Stand, Guard Dog, Gaita, or Divine Intervention.  The largest investment in each of these areas provides advantages throughout the game as well as additional points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Cry Wolf! uniquely employs a modified &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo; in lambing which is integrated with a typically increasing and dynamic predator threat.  The majority area control of investments combined with the timing of placement being determined through variable phase order also provides challenging strategic choices.&#10;&#10;",

At many points in the story the player will be required to use a weapon, a vehicle, or an ability, to check against a skill level, and in some cases to choose one of several possible courses of action.&#10;&#10;The object is to complete all the missions without running out of mission points.  While the player in general cannot lose a confrontation, if he or she does badly mission points will be lost.  When playing on the advanced level every weapon, vehicle, and ability costs missions points for every use.&#10;&#10;The basic set includes 1 mission book, 1 mission blueprint (a diagram of locations), and 12 cards in addition to the rulebook, score pad, log book, rules summary sheet, and dice.

Make sure the cutout figures are secure on the holder&mdash; Mary on one side, Bert on the other.  Place selector on space provided on playing board.&#10;&#10;To operate the selector, pick up the figure holder and let the pole slide all the way through.  Place the base back on the circle and release the figure holder.  It will spin to the bottom of the pole and spin to a stop.  One pointer will point to one of the instructions surrounding the merry-go-round, the other will indicate a different instruction.&#10;&#10;To determine order of play, each player picks a playing piece and puts it on one of the instructions around the merry-go-round.  The figure holder is lifted and released and the player which Mary points to (or is nearest) goes first.  Order of play is then clockwise from the playing piece of the first player.&#10;&#10;All players now place their playing pieces on Cherry Tree Lane ready to start.&#10;&#10;PLAY: Each player &quot;asks Mary&quot; for his instructions by using the merry-go-round selector as described earlier.  The instructions Mary points to are then followed.&#10;&#10;In moving around the board players follow any instructions given on the square where their playing piece lands.&#10;&#10;If a player's piece lands on a sidewalk picture the selector is operated again by that player and he now &quot;asks Bert.&quot;&#10;&#10;If a playing piece lands on a carpet bag the player may, at his next turn, decide whether to advance directly to the next carpet bag or whether to &quot;ask Mary.&quot;  This choice exists for any player at any time his piece is on a carpet bag.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on an umbrella he immediately &quot;asks Mary&quot; again.&#10;&#10;The countryside counts as three squares if a player is passing through it.  However, if a player chooses to be sent there by Mary or Bert he must miss his next two turns.  (If a player waiting in the countryside trades places with a player in front or in back of him, he is free and the traded player must wait whatever turns remain.)&#10;&#10;Winner is the first player to reach the park.&#10;&#10;",

The design is typical of this type of game, with plenty of opportunities for discussion, speculation and dramatic accusations.&#10;&#10;The second case (Death of a Train Spotter) has no speaking parts, and is therefore playable by any number of guests.

Periodically the outcome will be &quot;xx tape xx&quot; which means to activate the audio cassette tape included and listen to the &quot;play by play action&quot;. The announcer will then tell you the outcome of the play.&#10;&#10;The rules suggest not rewinding the cassette tape until reaching the end of the tape, thus keeping some level of randomness.

The advantages and disadvantages of different formations and aircraft types become apparent very quickly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This set of rules operates in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft. Weapon effectiveness is taken into account, and the skill of your aircrew is paramount. This is varied by nation and period to get the right feel for the game. The system also caters for game balance to ensure that no game is a walkover. There are simple rules for ammunition expenditure, Flak, Bombing, Night Actions, etc. Players can handle about 4 planes each.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules are quite short, but are supplemented by introductory data with over 200 selected aircraft from the main theaters of World War Two. The theaters concerned are those NOT marked with an asterisk in the list below. These illustrate the differences caused by new designs and trying to stuff more into an old design. The Second Edition incorporates a number of rules revisions and some new rules to make life even more exciting for the unwary.

    "Description": "Division Commander is a set of miniatures rules designed for very high-level World War II operations.  Each stand is a battalion, the ground scale is 3&quot; = 1 mile, and turns are 90-180 minutes.  The rules are designed from the ground up to play multi-day campaigns with multiple divisions per side.&#10;&#10;Like Bruce's &quot;Great Battles of World War II&quot; rules, one of the primary concepts is that of troops &quot;going to ground&quot;.  Troops start the day fresh and can make dramatic breakthroughs.  But, as damage occurs, troops are less willing to push forward, they will seek out defensive positions and wait for a new day.  Green troops, in particular, will tend to go to ground very quickly, while more elite troops can continue moving forward.  At this level, combat is abstracted, but operational aspects such as air support and corps and army artillery support are key parts of the system.&#10;&#10;A number of scenario books are available for the system, including France 1940, Eastern Front, Normandy, North Africa, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;",

The charcoal from the burnt bread helped to reduce the wine's acidity.

Each question has a category and if your piece is on that category when you get the answer right, you double your move - 4 or 2 spaces. Twenty-six spaces means twenty-six correct answers - or possibly as few as 8 - will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each comes with a deck of 24 card printed with some astronomy trivia. The mechanics are similar to Trivial Pursuit. One player draws a card and asks the opponent a trivia question from it. A correct answer allows the player to put a mark in a tic-tac-toe box on the game board.  For each completed row or column on the game board the player scores its point value. As each of the 9 squares on the tic-tac-toe board has a different value, there is some strategy here. Correct answers to 6 of the 24 cards enable a choice to mark a tic-tac-toe square or to erase an opponents mark. A simple plastic cover allows write-on/wipe off. &#10;The gameboard and card can also be used for a much simpler form of tic-tac-toe for the younger players.&#10;&#10;",

Finally each player draws new tokens from the pile to have 3 again.&#10;&#10;The critical point is that the shelf can only be filled following a certain pattern: each token must be of the same color or the same category as the previous one, and to completely fill in the &quot;shelf&quot; the player must have, at least, one token of each color and one token of each category.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete his collection of 9 pieces is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
