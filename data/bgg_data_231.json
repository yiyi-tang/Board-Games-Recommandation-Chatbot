Over the course of the season, the standings of each club in the league is tracked to see who wins the championship.  Provisions are included in the game for injuries and star performances to occur, and mechanics are included for rookie players to be created.  The game is designed for solitaire play as well as multiple players, and can be used to simulate the background games of a league in tandem with whatever detailed baseball simulation the user prefers.&#10;&#10;",

However, judge not! In this game you have to take the right tricks at strategic times to get yourself into the best position each round. With a double-edged-sword resource collection element, Gone Viking elevates itself as a uniquely competitive game, and one that reminds players of what it was like to be a viking raider.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each round players receive a hand of cards, with the leader then swapping up to four cards for free. After trump is declared, all players can pay to swap cards. As players win tricks, they can plunder resource tokens that are used to win the game. During the trick-taking phase, players can add multiple cards together to increase their total and play viking god cards to use those special powers. The last standing viking god in a round provides an additional benefit to its owner, and the richest player in a round will find half his wealth taken by Jarl &mdash; so aim for second place in order to keep your goods.&#10;&#10;",

For example, in one round you want to create &quot;T&quot; shapes of a single color, while avoiding &quot;I&quot; shapes. After three rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include a solo variant in which you're challenged to score as many points as possible.&#10;&#10;BITS Mitbringspiel differs from BITS as it includes fewer tiles, lasts only three rounds instead of four, and the tiles are cardboard instead of plastic.&#10;&#10;",

When a player acquires new ingredients, whether it is on his turn or not, he immediately has the opportunity to&#10;prepare one of the dishes depicted on the face-up recipe cards. If he can supply all of the necessary ingredients, he takes the corresponding recipe card and acquires money (beans ... actual beans!) to increase his coffers. Players may also cook recipes which were previously cooked by other players, but they only receive a portion of the monetary amount the original cook received.&#10;&#10;",

When only two sheep remain on the dyke, the race ends and an award ceremony takes place; according to East Frisian tradition, the most fearless sheep that has not aimlessly rushed forward wins the race - thus, the runner-up is really the winner!&#10;&#10;Ostfriesisches Schafe-Schubsen, which will appear in an edition of 500 copies, is being sold on a non-profit basis, with neither the game designers nor the graphic designers earning money from the game.&#10;&#10;",

As you arrive, you discover you are not alone. Some people are family you recognize, others you don't. The door opens and you all enter. The door locks behind you. A spectral form of Alphie greets you and informs you he is stuck in an interplanar portal. He needs your help to be saved. All you have to do is make your way through his mansion to his laboratory and pull him out. He promises to share his wealth and knowledge with whomever among you can reach him first.&#10;&#10;The Mansion of Mana is a sequential set collection, unique power, engine building light-strategic game with a modular game board. In the Mansion of Mana, each player represents a distant relative of Uncle Alphie who are attempting to earn their fortune and knowledge by helping to save him. Players navigate the mansion- collecting runic elements, playing them sequentially to acquire keys, to enter new rooms in the mansion. With each room entered, a new ability is gained allowing each player to become quicker at acquiring the runes to enter more rooms or to slow others down who would beat you to the objective of saving Uncle Alphie.&#10;&#10;The Mansion of Mana gives players a medium to light weight strategic game in a small box. Player's seek to get through the mansion as quickly as possible while engine-building their special abilities to gain more cards, hold more cards, add more options, steal from other players, or allow them to bend the rules in their favor. The Mansion of Mana is strongly strategic with the only elements of luck in the cards available to draw from (similar to Ticket to Ride). However, every player has a hand limit, so you cannot save up your cards, but you can play them on the table, partially completed, and add to them. However, watch out! Someone could steal from your partially completed set.&#10;&#10;Will you efficiently navigate the Mansion? or will you prey off of those who would be so careless to leave their runes in the open? Or perhaps you will Unlock the secrets of the mansion to find your way to Uncle Alphie and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of five tribe cards (from a set of eight), and going clockwise from the chief, each player lays down a tribe card in front of one of the solo challenges. If two players play on the same solo challenge, their tribe cards are moved to the duel challenge, then all other tribe cards are placed on solo challenges.&#10;&#10;Starting with the chief, each player attempts to perform the trick shown on the challenge, with the value of the tribe card played showing how many jacks on the table must be used in the challenge. A challenge might have you setting jacks on edge, throwing a jack over a wall formed by your other hand, move jacks from the table into your other hand, and so on. If at any time, you fail to catch your jack, your turn ends &mdash; although you can twice discard a tribe card from your hand to replay the challenge. If you succeed, you keep the tribe card you played.&#10;&#10;In a duel, the first player to complete the duel keeps one of the two tribe cards played.&#10;&#10;After all solo and duel challenges are complete, everyone participates in a final challenge to determine who will be chief for the next round. After four rounds, players tally the points on the challenge and tribe cards they collected, and the player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;Reimplements: Knucklebones&#10;Reimplements: Jacks&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is sort of an updated version of the 1904 Parker Brothers classic, Pit.  The object of the game is to trade groups of cards to your fellow players in an effort to collect an entire set of cards.  However, Remmi Demmi changes the game slightly by adding another characteristic to the cards, so each card can either categorized by color or the position of the figure on the card.  The object of the game is still basically the same (collect a full set), but you can either collect figures or colors.  In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.  Either way, the first set (Remmi) gets the most points, with those that follow getting less or none.&#10;&#10;",

Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Atop his noble steed, this handsome prince is every girl's dream...or is he your worst nightmare? It should be easy for Prince Charming to defeat a young boy, except that Hansel has an equally sinister sister, Gretel, and together they form an eerily unstoppable duo. It will take all of their tricks to win control of the Kingdom, but who will be victorious?&quot;&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

The poker-chip sized pieces, embossed with scorpions, also stack neatly onto the impressively designed and attractive playing surface.&#10;&#10;The race starts with players entering their pieces onto the yellow track. After 18 spaces, when the end of the initial S has been reached, players double-back on themselves, taking the black track to return home. The twist lies in &#10;that a scorpion may &quot;sting&quot; another, not just by landing on the same space, but also by landing on an adjacent space on the other coloured track. This enables a player to hinder opponents or to boost his own position by switching scorpions onto the other track.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the rather minimalist rules supplied do not cover every gameplay eventuality. In particular, the knock-on effect that occurs frequently on a congested board, where a &quot;stung&quot; scorpion may inadvertently sting another is not explained in a satisfactory manner.&#10;&#10;",

A few modifications were made to adjust to the lack of a computer.&#10;&#10;Players play on a 4x4 grid (play mat provided), with some spaces randomly blocked out during set-up by special extra cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has a set of arrows, and a set of attributes.  The arrows point at one of the adjacent cards in the grid (four sides and four diagonals)  An arrow may be present or not, each card has a unique combination of arrows.  The attributes are: an attack value, whether the attack is physical or magical, and two defense values: one physical, and one magical.  There are a few other special cards.&#10;&#10;Cards are played from a hand onto the game grid, and marked with a chip indicating the player.  If the new card has an arrow pointing at an existing card, and that card has no arrow pointing back, the other card changes owners.  If opposing arrows occur, then the cards 'battle' using their attributes.  Combat is resolved by comparing the attributes, looking up the value in a table, and then rolling the indicated percentile.  Winning a combat can create a chain reaction of ownership changes, based on the card arrows.&#10;&#10;To my knowledge, the game was only published in Germany.&#10;&#10;",

Will Bigfoot's hideaways be discovered, leaving him with nowhere to go, or will the Cryptozoologist be left frustrated?&#10;&#10;This new game from up and coming designer Scott Almes is the ultimate battle of wits! Depending on what side you're on, you'll be playing a very different game - The Cryptozoologist is laying traps and attempting to trick the Bigfoot who must deduce and work out what's the best option...&#10;&#10;One player plays the Cryptozoologist who is hunting for Bigfoot, played by the other player. Each round, the Cryptozoologist will lay out a series of cards in two &lsquo;paths&rsquo;, which will contain sensing equipment and special actions. Then, Bigfoot must choose which path to go on, triggering any sensing equipment and giving the Cryptozoologist a few more clues about his Lair. The Cryptozoologist wins by pinning Bigfoot in one of his Lairs, while Bigfoot wins by eluding the Cryptozoologist for six rounds. Capturing this beast won't be easy...!&#10;&#10;By slowly eliminating the various potential lairs, the Cryptozoologist will slowly whittle down the places where Bigfoot could actually be hiding. However, if this isn't done by the end of the sixth round the beast will escape the clutches of 'science'!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Psycho Chickens is a card game like no other. In fact, it's so good that you can't even look at it. No, really, you play the game without looking at your cards! Now, there's room for strategy (and a bit of luck) but be careful... play the Psycho Chicken card and you're dead, poof, out.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 3 facedown cards. On their turn, they flip over 1 card and play it, then draw a card (facedown) to replace it. The card they play may instruct them to look at or manipulate some of their cards and/or an opponent's.&#10;&#10;When a player plays the Psycho Chicken, they lose.&#10;&#10;",

It can be played by two or more and includes a total of 164 different cards in three different rarities. Tank Commander is very simple to learn yet not simplistic to play. The Eastern Front Edition includes over 80 different tank models!&#10;&#10;The game is sold in Playing decks of 60 cards each. One Display Box contains 12 Tank Commander Playing Decks.&#10;&#10;The game is a simple tactical level card game of warfare with each card representing an individual tank, squad, gun and gun team, etc.  There are terrain cards representing all forms of terrain that can be used to build custom scenarios.  Also in the mix are special cards like minefields, Panzerfausts, Flank Shots, Snipers, Mine Dogs, Artillery barrages and counter barrages, air strikes, etc.  Even though this is a CCG, it plays well with a few starter decks.  Deck building is point based with a value assigned to each card so it's not necessarily to one's advantage to have a bunch of high value cards.  Also, the rarity mix in the set was supposedly based on the availability of the actual equipment in WWII on the East Front.  There are plenty of good common and uncommon cards that are best used to build a deck.&#10;&#10;A player's guide is also available with comprehensive rules, errata, advanced rules, optional rules, card lists and more scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seega is a very old game of indeterminate age, which may have been a descendent of the Roman Latrunculi and, ultimately, related to the Hnefatafl family, as the &quot;sandwiching&quot; method of capture is identical.  Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a &quot;Knights&quot; solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players get a card with a list of &quot;answers&quot;. A theme is picked randomly. One player chooses an answer and rings the bell that comes with the game.&#10;He asks a question &quot;in the theme&quot; to the other players, who must answer the correct word. The asking and the answering players earns points. More points are given if some players give the wrong answer before the right one is picked, so the question should not be too easy !&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Snack Time is a Roll and Write game for an unlimited number of players. Each round a player will roll 5 dice which will include appendages to add to your creatures as well as sewer pipes to guide them to the surface.&#10;&#10;Players are scored based on their ability to take a small bite out of people passing by and the quality of the people you snack on. If you aren't careful then the pedestrians will fight back and your creatures will be injured in their quest for food.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round the pedestrians will move down the street visiting different locations. Someone will roll the dice and all players will add traits to their creatures and add pipes to their sewer. Then everyone will check to see if one of their creatures can take a bite out of a pedestrian! This depends on being in the right location and having the right traits to overwhelm your prey!&#10;&#10;The Game ends when one player has completely fed all of their monsters or when a player gets caught by the authorities! Scores are based on the quality of food... I mean, people you ate, as well as how much damage your creatures sustained.&#10;&#10;Keep your monsters healthy and happy and don't alert the authorities or you will incur heavy penalties because snitches get stitches.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the year 2047, and the world's atmosphere is filled with all manner of junk; those in charge have decided to do something about it. Their solution is to begin production of &quot;Space Junk&quot;, a brand new reality TV show that follows a group of carefully chosen random contestants as they cobble together spaceships out of whatever junk they can find, cleaning up space in the process.&#10;&#10;Altruism is all well and good, but in order to make a good TV program, one needs more than that &mdash; which is why the producers, in all their wisdom, encourage the contestants to engage in space races with each other. Additionally, the contestants are allowed to use anything as weapons against one another, with a fat cash prize encouraging such motivation for the contestants.&#10;&#10;In Space Junk, you've landed a spot on this reality television show, and now it's time to clean up outer space while entertaining the masses! Orbit the earth seeking out and picking up space junk, both to build a ship with and to recycle! The game is simple, easy to learn and will reduce you to tears (of laughter) as you build the most ridiculous ship imaginable.&#10;&#10;You will use your ship to speed around the earth, crash into and attack other players, and collect valuable junk to become the most famous contestant! Space Junk plays 2-6 players and plays different every time with the huge variety of cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pamplona attracts over 1 million visitors each year in July for its nine-day San Ferm&iacute;n festival, originated in the 14th century. The daily Running of the Bulls, so dear to Hemingway, is its highest profile event. With is simple yet refined mechanics, Pamplona - Viva San Ferm&iacute;n! Faithfully reproduces the run in all its aspects: bravery, euphoria, adrenaline, but also tactics and management. Players must run all of the 4 sectors of the race, escaping from the opponents&rsquo; bulls and steers, while trying to gore or trample the opponents using their own. Pamplona - Viva San Ferm&iacute;n! is not a common race. The winner is not necessarily the first runner to cross the finishing line, but the one show shows the most courage.&#10;&#10;",
