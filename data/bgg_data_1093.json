    "Description": "Poka Yoke is a combinatorial game for two players. It's the follow-up to Tixel and Regatta.&#10;&#10;The rules of Poka Yoke are exactly like the Tixel rules (see below) with the addition of the following 'piece promotion' rule:&#10;&#10;If in a single turn a player picks up 1 of her own pieces (during a bonus move) to end the turn, then the picked up piece is promoted to a Regatta piece. In any single game at most 2 pieces per player can be promoted in this fashion.&#10;&#10;Brief description of the Tixel rules:&#10;On a turn, a player can either place a new Tixel piece or move one of her own Tixel pieces already on the board. A Tixel piece can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active pieces, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making pieces inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active piece.&#10;Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a piece that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it's sacrificed &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a piece, she can now remove a piece from the board, activate an inactive piece, or pivot an active piece to reorient its hollow side.&#10;&#10;",

It lasts the four seasons to let you taste the best ingredients of each of them, represented by the tree in the middle of the board that you can dress and cover with its colorful flowers, leaves and snowflakes.&#10;&#10;A game lasts 4 rounds: one for each season.&#10;&#10;In each season only those who complete a cup with at least three flavors of gelato earn points. To make a flavor you need the three basic ingredients and the ingredient of the flavor itself (eg. hazelnut or strawberry). The ingredients are won in the respective areas of the board and in the seasons in which they are available (e.g. fish at Mura Mura, but only in summer). The winner of the game is the one who, at the end of the fourth season, has scored the most points.&#10;&#10;",

Players are Strategoi (generals) leading phalanxes of bronze-clad warriors in pursuit of fame, glory, and the honor of their city-states. To win such prizes, however, you must prove your mettle, display your valor, and bring the other Strategoi to their knees!&#10;&#10;Designed to recreate small battles or larger skirmishes with 50-80 figures per side, each army will have its own unique mix of rules, advantages, backgrounds, and abilities. Strategoi must understand and appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their forces in order to win glory on the battlefield. Of course, there's no telling what tricks a rival Strategos might have up their tunic sleeves.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each counter represents a single combatant.  Each combatant has unique skills derived from an available pool of combat &quot;styles&quot; that are reminiscent of pop-culture martial arts.  Combatants are further specialized by buying abilities using a points pool.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns.  Within a turn, movement and combat are rather free-form; attacks are resolved using two ten-sided dice, with modifiers, and results are applied immediately.  Players may set their own victory conditions, but the default condition is complete destruction of the opposing force.  The game is unusual in allowing much variety in the individual units, with significant player decisions made during unit construction (this also is a somewhat time-consuming pre-play process).&#10;&#10;The game is published as a print-and-play instruction manual.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hello, American citizen! Do you have what it takes to achieve the American Dream during America's Golden Age?&#10;&#10;A newfound national identity of consumerism during the 1950s and '60s may have made it look easy, but this was a time of war, nuclear weapons, discrimination and violence, and even illegal CIA mind control experiments.&#10;&#10;Never fear! Americana: The Card Game makes it easy to try your hand at the American Dream with a historical take on issues such as race, gender, socioeconomics, and more. But of course, even in the land of the free, some of us have advantages over others...&#10;&#10;Americana: The Card Game tackles complicated issues such as intersectionality, discrimination, and more with gameplay that is straightforward and easy to pick up. Like our gender, race, social status, and so on, much of Americana: The Card Game comes down to chance, and player skill is not a necessity. Games can include 2-6 players and typically take around 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Each of the 108 cards centers on a historical event, popular culture, or some other aspect of mid-20th century life. In addition to a brief description for each card, most cards also include a hand-drawn illustration and a metaphorical in-game action, representing its real-world historical impact.&#10;&#10;Almost every card in Americana: The Card Game has a positive or negative effect toward your American Dream, due to the card's numeric value, the action outlined on the card, or both.&#10;&#10;Different card categories include various positive- and negative-value cards with different sets of card actions. These categories include: Race, Gender, Socioeconomics, Environment, Government, Queerness, and Consumer. By presenting American history through a variety of lenses, players are encouraged to reflect upon what is and is not fair within a society.&#10;&#10;The Race, Gender, Socioeconomics, and Queerness categories offer an additional sub-category of cards known as Demographic cards. These cards are played immediately and provide an advantage over other players for the duration of the game by granting you bonus cards. For example, after drawing the &quot;You Are White&quot; card, you then get to draw bonus cards when you draw Race cards. By giving players who are lucky enough to draw Demographic cards an unfair advantage over the other players, this mechanic illustrates how some members of American society during the 1950s and '60s (and today) benefited from social privilege.&#10;&#10;Players start Americana: The Card Game with empty hands. On your turn, draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand, then play a card face-up toward your American Dream. Oftentimes, players are forced to play negative-value cards due to a sparse hand. Once the card has been played, commit any action indicated on the card. These actions typically involve drawing a card, discarding a card, forcing another player to discard a card, and so on.&#10;&#10;There is only one deck in Americana: The Card Game. Discarded cards are placed on the bottom of the deck and players with poor hands may have to draw from the bottom of a (literally) stacked deck. Additionally, players lucky enough to draw positive-value or even Demographic cards will find themselves adding more and more cards to their hands, while players drawing mostly negative-value cards will struggle to maintain a hand. Of course, luck can change.&#10;&#10;Once the net value of the cards played toward a player's American Dream reaches 10+, that player has won the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It's rare to see someone who quits Reveal.&#10;&#10;The Game has 8 set of cards:&#10;&#10;     4 Set of questions with hidden point, strip and Joker cards&#10;     4 Set of Dares&#10;&#10;&#10;The 4 set of questions are Experience, Opinion, Intimacy and Fantasy.&#10;The 4 Set of Dares are in fact 4 level.&#10;&#10;You spin a wheel at the center of the board when it is your turn, to determinate which category you will  have to pick a question from.&#10;Whatever category you end up during your turn, you can get a question, a joker (counter card), a Strip card (optional) or a Point cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Question are cards you need to answer. You will be judge by the other participants on your answer. If half of them judge that your answer is not satisfactory, then you have to put back one of your point card or Joker card in the pile of card.&#10;     Point card are collected to buy a dare to impose on anyone - when you have enough of them.&#10;     Strip card if used, request you to remove a piece of cloth.&#10;     Joker card enable you to counter a question, a dare or a strip card&#10;&#10;&#10;Choose Your Level Before Playing&#10;&#10;There is 4 ways to play Reveal: from casual to progressively sexual charged.&#10;&#10;If you play level 1 of the game (to play with any type of friends OK to talk about kinks and sex). You will only be able to access the Dares from level 1 that you can purchase with the points you collect randomly as you pick up a card during your turn.&#10;&#10;If you play level 2, only dare level 1 and 2 will be accessible, making the dare a little bit more provocative but still playable with friends.&#10;&#10;At level 3, level 1,2 and 3 of the Dares are accessible. Now we are talking about Dares including 2 participants. So everyone need to be comfortable with that.&#10;&#10;At least, level 4 includes all the dares. this last Level will make the game sexual and is designed for people in the Lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Depending of the Level you choose to play, it will be more or less easy to counter dares and Strip cards. As you can imagine, at level 1, it takes some points to buy a Dare but it's easy to counter it.&#10;At level 4, it is the opposite: Dares are easily purchase with points but hard to counter with Joker.&#10;&#10;Strip cards can be completely removed from the game before starting. It doesn't change the fun of the playing Reveal. It just a choice you make to have people losing their Joker faster or not countering Strip cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stay Calm, Act Fast!&#10;&#10;Everyone hides one or more white cubes and shows them all at once.&#10;You must add up the number of cubes and immediately take one of the three figurines!&#10;&#10;In Polarich, you add up the number of cubes revealed from the cup and race to take the corresponding Polar figurine. Not only competing by speed, you can also have a bit of strategy by changing the number of cubes you hide.&#10;&#10;Everyone receives a cup and some cubes. 3 figurines (Penguin, Inuit, Polar Bear) are placed at the center of the table. Each player hides one or more cubes in the cup and turns the cup down on a table. All cups are lifted at once.&#10;&#10;As soon as hidden cubes are revealed, players add up the number of the cubes on the table, and get one of the three figurines corresponding to the sum of the cubes by putting their cups over that figurine.&#10;&#10;The player who got the correct figurine first receives gems. When you&rsquo;ve collected 5 gems, you win and the game ends.&#10;&#10;The game varies by the number of players; how many cubes players get, the sum for the figurines, the gems received. There are also penalties if you claim the wrong figurine.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#176;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#150;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#231;&#174;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#13

For example, you can start off playing as a mage, but spec it into a tank, or vice versa.&#10;&#10;By defeating enemies, you receive experience and loot that allows you to level up and create your unique hero. You can also increase your stats by equipping armor, accessories, and weapons. In order for the hero to be able to use an item, their stats need to pass the use requirement threshold. New items are available for purchase in town or can be looted from monsters.&#10;&#10;The main goal of the story mode is to reach to final level of the dungeon. Each level hold a quest mission, new items, and tougher enemies. All enemies in the game are automated, with their behavior, tactics, and stats described on monster cards.

All the characters are from Japanese video games named &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; and &quot;The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player has six idol (pop singer) cards at the beginning of the game. Players take turns playing an idol card and rolling a number of dice printed on the card, determining her power. Then she activates her ability written on the card. Dice results are changed frequently by their abilities.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have played five cards. They total the power of all their idols, and the player with the greatest power wins the game.&#10;&#10;Depending on game mode, initial cards are determined by simple deal or rochester draft. Additionally, a three-game match can be played if each player has a copy of this game. Players make three groups of six idols and play three games. The player with highest total score of three games wins the match.&#10;&#10;The game has been published since 2012, and new stand-alone expansions have been added, from Track 2 through to Track 5. You can mix these sets as you like, or play them separately. The rules remain the same, the card sets vary. The decks are for two players, but more can play when combining decks.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#137;&#181;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#229;&#165;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#162;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;5&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

At the end of a turn, the Troll tosses out some remnants, most of the time on the clients, making them leave the inn. Once only 3 clients or less remain in the tavern, doors close and it's time to count your pay. The richest server wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wit Clash is a tile based strategy game. The goal is deceptively simple: to be the first in completing a 3 x 3 grid of black Asset tiles, arranged in 3 columns (hollow, striped or solid) and rows (triangle, circle or square).&#10;&#10;These 9 standard Asset tiles must match the icon on the gaming tray. The black Wildcard (star), a mobile tile, completes the set of 10 Assets. It can be placed/moved anywhere within the 3 x 3 grid, but is not a precondition for victory.&#10;&#10;The game set contains 3 sets of Assets for a total of 30 black Asset tiles.&#10;&#10;However, such a goal is enabled (or hindered) by Action Tiles, which have an offensive or defensive capacity. Action tiles are therefore the leading characters in this game. The diversity of Action tiles (red or green) provide tremendous flexibility for strategy planning. The action arsenal consists of 12 different actions, for a total of 45 units. Namely:&#10;&#10;DEFENSIVE (Green):&#10;&#10;     Dump&#10;     Key&#10;     Revert&#10;&#10;&#10;OFFENSIVE (Red):&#10;&#10;     Loot (Triangle, Circle or Square)&#10;     Swap (Tile,Column or Tray)&#10;     Pause&#10;     Disarm&#10;     Lock&#10;&#10;&#10;Despite the variety of actions available, not all actions are required simultaneously. The game can be executed in incremental dexterity levels:&#10;&#10;- BASIC: Dump VS Loot&#10;- PLUS: (Dump + Key) VS (Loot + Lock + Pause + Swap Tray only)&#10;- ULTRA: (Dump + Key + Revert) VS (Loot + Lock + Pause + Swap + Disarm)&#10;&#10;Asset and Action tiles are shuffled together in a central tile pool. Tiles are randomly drawn but, from there on, only strategy will prevail.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns raising the number by playing a prime number with cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;This game uses 54 standard playing cards with two jokers included. Suit doesn't matter in this game. Shuffle the deck and deal 11 cards to each player.&#10;&#10;The leader plays any prime number (see below). Then in clockwise order, players may play greater prime numbers with the same number of cards as the leader. The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round.&#10;&#10;To play a prime number, take a certain number (or any number if you are the leader) of cards from your hand and arrange their order to indicate a number. If the number is prime, your play is valid. Consider Ace as 1, and 10, J, Q, and K as two-digit numbers (10, 11, 12, and 13 respectively). For example, you may play 3 and J in two ways, 311 and 113 (both are prime numbers), but you may play 3 and 5 as 53 only, because 35 is not a prime number. There's a penalty when you play an invalid (non-prime) number.&#10;&#10;You win the game when you get rid of all cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#153;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#166;&#130;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;11&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#164;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129

After the initial terraforming phase, relations broke down irreparably and several sects formed, each laying claim to a region of the planet. Each player in Catastrophic represents one of the rival groups. To win, you must support the development of the most robust community of plants and animals, weaken those of your opponents, and adapt to survive the catastrophes the planet and your opponents continually throw at you.&#10;&#10;Catastrophic is designed to help players make connections across large spatial and temporal scales in biology. Plant and Animal Trait cards (e.g. thick waxy cuticles and evaporative heat loss) help Species to withstand environmental Conditions that they must face in an onslaught of Events such as global warming, drought and habitat fragmentation. Interaction cards help players to support their community of Species through reproduction (by using the pollination card, or perhaps cross-breeding), protection (e.g. with the Doomsday Vault), collaboration (e.g. reciprocal altruism and obligate mutualism) or stab other players in the back with cheating, brood parasitism, predator ecesis and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

With very few resources at their disposal, international outlaws must rely on one of the biggest technological breakthroughs of the twenty-first century: the Blockchain.&#10;&#10;Crypto Cartel is a Card Game where players must establish resources in order to exchange them for Cryptocurrency -- or Crypto. During exchanges, players may also earn Silk Road Cards, which can give you the opportunity to descend upon your opponents and their resources or to defend yourself from any attacks. Trading is also one of the main centerpieces of the game: while trading might give your opponents the ability to move ahead quicker in the game, trading can also help you maintain your production lines much longer. While earning high amounts of Crypto might be beneficial at first, it won&rsquo;t guarantee that you&rsquo;ll come out on top. Crypto Cartel encourages an aggressive playing style, but play too hard too fast and your opponents will quickly descend upon you.&#10;&#10;Crypto Cartel has two different versions to play: a quick 30 minute game, or an epic one to two-hour game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
