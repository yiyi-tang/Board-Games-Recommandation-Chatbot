    "Description": "Nemesis: Aftermath &amp; Void Seeders is an expansion for Nemesis. It contains all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign except for Medic: the Aftermath expansion and the Void Seeders expansion.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.&#10;&#10;Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.&#10;&#10;Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Overlook:&#10;&#10;Voidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.&#10;&#10;This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.&#10;&#10;Nests:&#10;&#10;On the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).&#10;&#10;Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.&#10;&#10;Voidlurkers&#10;&#10;They will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.&#10;&#10;Whispersers&#10;&#10;They will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.&#10;&#10;Stalker&#10;&#10;He is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.&#10;&#10;Despoiler&#10;&#10;Equivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.&#10;&#10;Contamination card&#10;&#10;Here it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.&#10;&#10;Whispers mechanic&#10;&#10;This mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;In combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.&#10;&#10;Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.&#10;&#10;Event phase&#10;&#10;In the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.&#10;&#10;But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)&#10;&#10;Overall feel&#10;&#10;Overall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends  - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There should be a total of 6 stacks of game cards on the playing board.&#10;&#10;THE PLAY... Play begins with each player rolling die. Highest roll starts from Florida coast first. Second highest goes next and so forth. Speedboats progress across the board according to the roll of the die. When a player lands on a space marked X he/she must pick a game card form the corresponding zone and comply with the requirements before returning card to bottom of respective stack. Players are to draw NO MORE than one card per turn.&#10;&#10;MOTHER SHIP &amp; YOU'RE BUSTED... &quot;Mother Ship&quot; counts as one space to board and load. After reaching the &quot;Mother Ship&quot; each player must decide upon the quantity ( 1 or 2 bales) he wishes to load. The quantity of the load decides the degree of risk. If a player carrying 1 bale back to Florida draws a &quot;You're Busted&quot; card he/she must replace the bale back on the &quot;Mother Ship&quot;, return his/her speedboat to start in Florida and try again. Two busts and player is out of the game. A player who risks to smuggle 2 bales on one trip back to Florida is automatically out of the game upon drawing a &quot;You're Busted&quot; card. (Exception see Pay Off Cards). The first player who successfully smuggles 2 bales back to Florida either on one trip or several is the winner.&#10;&#10;PAY OFF CARDS...

During the game, units on the table will gain ground and move to new positions, get sick and be moved to the out of combat section of the battle board, or even die from the plague. New units may join the besiegers, or sneak through the lines to reinforce the defence. New siege equipment can be built, and can start to batter down the walls. All this quickly replicates the effects of weeks of preparations. After these preparations, you play out the Final Assault.&#10;&#10;The Final Assault is played as a normal game of Time of Legends: Joan of Arc.

    "Description": "With games like Objective Shreveport! and Hood's Last Gamble, designer John Theissen has found a unique, accessible, streamlined approach to games of operational maneuver. With Campaign of Nations, he turns his attention to the Napoleonic era, and specifically to the dramatic and turbulent 1813 Leipzig campaign. Waterloo might get the attention and the catchy pop song, but it was Leipzig that saw the emperor encircled, defeated, and forced to abdicate.&#10;&#10;These are far larger, grander armies than those that marched across your plexi in Mr. Theissen's ACW games. New Zone of Control rules appropriate for this scale make it more difficult to slip by the enemy. Just before being attacked, defenders in multiple hexes may attempt to concentrate forces, leading to dramatic swings in fortune. These and other rules support a tense board situation in which the French player, occupying a central position, must contend with enemy armies marching in from all directions. Will Napoleon defeat each one in detail, or will they be able to tighten the noose?&#10;&#10;",

The more products of a kind a player has on his player table, the higher is the reward from the 'harvest'. Unfortunately, however, a player is often forced to sell his product at dump prices too early. And sometimes a harvest yields nothing at all. The aim of the game is to earn the most coins from the trade in farm products.&#10;&#10;During the game, you grow vegetables and farm animals on your fields to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random produce cards. Each card has a picture of the product, cow, sheep, cabbage, sunflower etc, and numbers showing how many cards of that type you need to harvest at a time to get that amount of coins. You are not allowed to change the order of the cards in your hand. You play them in that order &ndash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is an essential part of the game.&#10;During your turn you place one or two cards on your two fields in front of you, indicated on your personal play board. During the game you can buy a third field for your use. Each field can produce only one product &ndash; sheep, pumpkins etc. If you do not have space to do the required action of placing a product on your fields, you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. More cards on the field, more coins while harvesting.&#10;Next, you take two cards from the deck and place them open on the table. You can take these cards for your own fields, or you can trade them or give them away &ndash; if anyone takes them. You can also trade cards from your hand, but all trading has to be done with the player in turn. No traded cards go back to hand. They all must be played to the fields after trading phase.&#10;Finally, you take three and place them in the back of your hand. In the order you draw them.&#10;The game ends when the draw pile has been used up for the third time. Who ever has the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

But remember, anyone landing on the same space as you may take one of your lids you are carrying.&#10;&#10;After landing directly on the scoring place, the price of your lids is determined by retooling the dice and paying the number rolled for each lid.

    "Description": "The Noisavni Invasion is a light, science fiction skirmish game for two players. It consists of eight scenarios that can be played individually or linked together in a campaign telling the story of a conflict between identical mecha forces across mirrored dimensions. With only two pages of rules, it&rsquo;s ideal for both inexperienced wargamers and seasoned veterans who want to have a series of quick, fun battles.&#10;&#10;Players drive the action through a strategic hand-management system that gives them partial control over the order in which units activate - both their own and the enemy&rsquo;s &ndash; adding a layer of command confusion. The scenarios specify changes or exceptions to the standard rules and explain the game end and victory conditions. Some scenarios even let you &quot;shift&quot; your units between the parallel dimensions, adding a simulated 3D experience!&#10;&#10;The game adds fresh ideas while incorporating familiar wargame concepts such as zone of control, supporting fire, attacker losses, and advances after combat, tucking them into the mechanisms in subtle ways that make it easy for novice players to understand.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need to print and cut 2 map sections, 10 unit standees, and (optionally) 10 Turn Tokens. The components come in two sizes, and you&rsquo;ll only need to print one or two pages depending on the size you prefer. You&rsquo;ll also need a regular deck of playing cards or a handful of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Drinkill is a drinking board game that will make each game become a night you&rsquo;ll surely remember, and a day you&rsquo;d rather forget.&#10;How do you win? The only objective is to make it to the end. The first player that arrives to the &ldquo;Vomit Here&rdquo; space at the end of the board is the winner.&#10;How do you lose? If you&rsquo;re not the first player that arrives in the last space. You can also lose if you refuse to do a challenge but also refuse to take a shot. You can always surrender and admit defeat. &#10;The Drinkill game consists of 10 different characters. Each character has a special ability that can be used only once in every game. Before the game starts, each player chooses a character and draws 3 item cards from the deck. All players roll a pair of dice &ndash; the player with the higher number goes first and the other turns go clockwise.&#10;On each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice and advances the number of spaces the dice say &ndash; when landing on a space &ndash; the player must do what the space indicates.&#10;If it&rsquo;s your turn, you can activate any card in your hand. If it&rsquo;s not your turn, you can activate any card that is marked with a star.&#10;&#10;&#10;What type of cards can you draw in this game?&#10;Item cards: Items can be used to give the user an advantage in the game. Attack your opponents or delay them, defend yourself from other opponents and many other functions to make you win the race.&#10;&#10;Challenge cards: Challenges are the core of the Drinkill game. When a player lands on challenge space he has to draw a card from the deck and decide whether to complete the challenge or to take a shot.&#10;&#10;STD cards: STD cards are challenge cards that the player can hold in his hand like item cards and use them against other opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player can hold up to 5 item cards at any given time and any amount of STD cards. Challenge cards are immediately discarded. Item and STD cards are discarded after use.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Drinkill board spaces and what you have to do when you land on each of them:&#10;1.    Burning shot &ndash; Take a shot.&#10;2.    Totem &ndash; Draw an item card from the deck.&#10;3.    Challenge &ndash; Draw a challenge card from the deck. You can decide to do the challenge or take a shot instead.&#10;4.    STD &ndash; Draw an STD card from the deck.&#10;5.    Pub &ndash; Choose another player to take a shot with, take a picture and upload it.&#10;6.    Hospital &ndash; You&rsquo;re stuck there and lose your next turn.&#10;7.    Arrow space &ndash; Go forward/backward depending on the number on the arrow space.&#10;8.    Golden coin &ndash; If you have the &ldquo;Capitalist Pig&rdquo; item card and you land on this space you can choose as many opponents as you want and discard all of their item cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Invite your friends, race them to the end and do a lot of stupid challenges while you&rsquo;re getting drunk. Use cards combos and collaborate with other players to delay the leading opponent.&#10;&#10;Do you think you&rsquo;re hardcore? Do you want to make your friends wash the dishes? Do you want to make someone drink all the leftovers of the party? Do you want to kiss a beautiful girl but you&rsquo;re the ugliest dude around? Now you can.&#10;&#10;",

People live in fear of tomorrow&hellip; and I am the one who wants to bring about what they fear. Welcome to Y&#197;&#141;kai. The ever-shifting sprawl of vice and corruption. Your goal is to become the most powerful villain in the City of Crime.&#10;&#10;Y&#197;&#141;kai: City of Crime is a simple, dynamic game (it takes only 30-45 minutes to play, even with five players) with a large dose of negative interaction. The simplicity of the rules combined with a multitude of choices, not to mention the beautiful artwork, make this a game that will be returning to your table often.&#10;&#10;In the game Y&#197;&#141;kai: City of Crime, players take on the roles of powerful gangsters. Every round each player secretly chooses 2 actions which are executed in order of players&rsquo; reputation, so that those in the lead have the disadvantage of having to act before they know the full extent of their enemies&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;During their turns, players can move through the different city districts, making use of location-specific abilities or simply causing mayhem; tipping off the police about their opponents&rsquo; activities or playing intrigue cards which leverage their underworld connections to thwart their rivals&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;Each round, after the players have completed their actions, the police will raid the district with the most crime and tip-offs in an attempt to round up those responsible. Going to prison will slow down your ascent to the top, but it can help you make some useful connections. At the end of each round, the players who managed to evade the long arm of the law score reputation points based on the level of crime in their districts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each episode occurs in a different time and place, from Elizabethan England to earth&rsquo;s Lunar Colony, so you never know exactly where you&rsquo;ll end up next.&#10;&#10;TimeStamp is the 2018 Board Game of the Month postcard from Button Shy, with each month bringing a new episode, which can be played independently.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Episodes:&#10;&#10;     01 &ndash; 2020: Santa Colina (Prologue)&#10;     02 &ndash; 1955: Santa Colina&#10;     03 &ndash; 2020: Undisclosed location, UT&#10;     04 &ndash; 1912: Southampton&#10;     05 &ndash; 2076: Moon Base Adam&#10;     06 &ndash; 2009: Cambridge&#10;     07 &ndash; 1888: Range Creek, UT&#10;     08 &ndash; ????: Middle of Nowhen&#10;     09 &ndash; 1593: Cambridge&#10;     10 &ndash; 1947: Roswell, NM&#10;     11 &ndash; 2045: Geneva&#10;     12 &ndash; 2020: Santa Colina (End)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!&#10;&#10;In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon.

If the dice show snakes they gain coins in their silo. After each roll players can decide if they want to keep playing or stop. If players lose all their coins they are out of play.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players may make side bets on the active roller.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on the value rolled, players will either be paid back 2-4 times the amount of their bet, or will owe their money to the bank. The role of the banker switches when one player rolls a 7. At some point, one player will have won the majority of the money in the game and can be considered the winner at that point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Talos Collapse is a strategy role playing board game that takes place in the fantasy world of Talos. The world is on the verge of collapse and the only safe place is its capital &ndash; Talos City. You are the leader bearing the noble mission of saving your people from perishing. You levy an army and advance towards Talos. Travelling through different realms you will meet hordes of hostile creatures and slay each and every enemy standing in the way of your cherished goal. In Talos, you will find an immense stronghold and will have to face an army of guards that surely won&rsquo;t  let you in. What should you do to them? You will have to defeat them, of course. Finally, drained by the numerous bloody battles, having most of your loyal troops you take over Talos City to only find another three conquerors and understand that only one will survive&hellip;&#10;&#10;At the start, each player creates a hero by selecting one of 7 available classes and a set of basic skills. As the game progresses, you will learn new advanced skills. To do that, your hero will need to develop a certain type of a character and gain a required number of character points by choosing corresponding options when playing an Event Cards. At the same time, limited by a selected type of character, the player might have to face some very tough choices. For instance, choosing the &ldquo;Evil&rdquo; option in an Event Card obliges you to make an assault upon a fortress (which is a very uneasy task). This is where players might start asking themselves if they really are that evil? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be in their benefit to choose the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; option to avoid danger?  The choice is up to the player&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s signature feature is the combat system. In the beginning of the battle, the player arranges his troops in his part of the battlefield. After that, the same arrangement is implemented by the creatures of the realm in which the combat is taking place. The player to the left plays for the creatures&rsquo; army. Striving towards their own victory, the players&rsquo; key task in such action will be to play for time and inflict maximal losses to the opponent. The battle process is a turn-by-turn attacks of the opponents&rsquo; units until a complete defeat or retreat of one of the armies. Smart tactics, clever manoeuvring and right order of actions is the key to winning the battle. After the battle is over, the player will have to restore and heal the troops injured in combat. Smart battle timing is also very important: if the fight takes too much time, it delays the players reaching Talos City, entering which sooner than other players is one of the games&rsquo; priorities.&#10;&#10;The player needs to be well prepared to fight the Guards of Talos. The long way you have to make through the realms of the game is designed to prepare for victory by collecting and improving your skills, army, spells and artefacts. If you fail to develop your assets to a sufficient level there is a major risk that taking over Talos City will become an overwhelming task. Having a strong army but lacking resources to cast spells, the player will suffer too many casualties which will further lead to losing to other, better prepared, players. This diversity makes the game both complex and very interesting to play again and again.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

TRIAL &#10;The game master picks up and examines the current challenge card, then throws the throwing stone. This decides the category for this round (see later: Throwing stone). The game master has half a minute to come up with a Trial for the other players, one which is connected to the challenge card AND is of the current category.&#10;2. BATTLE&#10;The players battle each other. They carry out the trial set by the game master in the last phase.&#10;3. ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESULTS &#10;The game master ends the trial and announces the winner of the round, or a tie. The winner places one of his/her obstacle markers in a freely chosen hole on the throwing board that is of the corresponding category colour for this round&rsquo;s trial.&#10;In case of a tie, if several players completed the trial equally well, or if all failed the trial, the person that yells out &ldquo;Wombat&rdquo; the quickest is considered the winner.&#10;4. PLAYERS VOTE&#10;At the end of a round, if a player found a fellow player&rsquo;s solution the wittiest, he may give that player 1 voting token from the common supply. Each person may only vote once in each round. Then game master does not vote, but can receive votes. If at least one player voted in the current round, then the game master receives a voting token for overseeing a pleasing round.&#10;&#10;",
