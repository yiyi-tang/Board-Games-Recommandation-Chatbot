They expand the trading routes of these families and establish trade relationships with other families. The player who gains the most victory points with relationships and goods will be the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players either marry into a merchant family or expand the trading route of a family they are already married into.&#10;&#10;To marry into a family, the player pays the cost of the family. Only two players may marry into each family. To expand the trading route of a family, the player must be married into the family and may pay for the route with the money of the family. The goal is to meet other families not met before (gaining trade relationship markers) and to reach goods spaces first (gaining goods tokens).&#10;&#10;When all families have established at least one trade relationship or one family has established five trade relationships, the game ends. Each player scores their goods cards with the corresponding goods markers they have acquired, the trade relationship markers they have collected, and their money.&#10;&#10;This entry has been split from the Winsome Games publication Age of Scheme: Routes to Riches. As the rules have been altered, number of players differs, and updates to the artwork have been made, the two games are regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, they must first gain the help of the servants and petty officials at the court, who can then help them gain access to the nobility, who, in turn, can help to reach the king.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On their turn, a player will gather their dice, roll them, set aside at least one, and roll the remaining dice again, until all dice have been set aside. After that, they select a character who will help. Each character requires a certain combination of dice (such as two pairs or dice that show at least 30 points). The character will give the player some benefits on later rolls, such as an additional die or the ability to modify the results of a roll.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player gains the support of the Queen (and temporary favor of the King, winning ties in the final roll-off). Now, all players try to gain a dice result of as many equal dice as possible (7x 2s, 8x 6s, etc). The player who gets the longest, highest result gains the favor of the King and wins.&#10;&#10;Contents: 12 Dice, 60 character cards, 5 player aids, 1 marker, rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Together, the players use cards to try to build the eight wonders of the ancient world. The number they build varies, but can't be more than seven. (Hence the subtitle of the game, &quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built.&quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it's someone else's turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk).  So a feature of &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another's turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points. The game ends when a player takes the last disk of any one of the four suits, so players have some influence on the game's end moment.  And, the victory points determine the winner at game end. Typical game length is less than an hour.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia Variant--some recommend against using the action cards because the publisher rather than Reiner Knizia added them and because they damage the game balance. To play with this variant, simply leave the action cards in the box. There is no bonus to the person who completes the final stage of a wonder.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of GMT's Lunchtime Series, Twilight Struggle: Red Sea &ndash; Conflict in the Horn of Africa is a two-player card driven game that builds on the award winning Twilight Struggle.&#10;&#10;The year is 1974, and the Soviet Union and the United States have been locked in a life-or-death struggle across the globe. As so often happened during the Cold War, a relatively obscure region of the globe suddenly took center stage. Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, a bedrock U.S. ally in Africa, had grown old and increasingly dictatorial. When he was overthrown in 1974, a Marxist coalition took the reins of power. This new revolutionary leadership initiated a chain of events that upset the regional balance of power and unleashed all the familiar elements of Cold War competition in the Horn of Africa.&#10;&#10;With a more limited scope and much shorter playtime, Twilight Struggle: Red Sea is the perfect way to introduce new players to the Twilight Struggle system, while maintaining all the tension, decision making, and theme of the original classic. The cards from Twilight Struggle can be used in TS: Red Sea and vice versa.&#10;&#10;",

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;    Menara&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One player is playing the girl Ren who has lost her memory; the other is her psychic friend Feth who is trying to repair it. The game is about trying to communicate as well as possible by simply the choice of cards. (Note: &quot;Thri Sahashri&quot; is the buddhist term for a trillion worlds combined, which in this case means &quot;the other plane&quot;.)&#10;&#10;Of a deck consisting of cards of five colors and numbered 1&ndash;5, the Ren player draws four cards and keeps them face down. The goal for both players is to ensure that when the hand ends, the playing field has cards of these colors and these colors only.&#10;&#10;Each round, the Feth player draws as many cards as he wishes from the shuffled deck, putting them on the playing field according to the marks on the cards. The deck also contains ravens, which when drawn will &quot;eat&quot; any discarded cards of that color and threaten to take them out of the game.&#10;&#10;When the Feth player is done, the Ren player picks one of the cards in the playing field and puts on the leftmost still &quot;incomplete&quot; hidden card. A hidden card is complete when that card plus the cards placed on it total 7. (The fourth pile, however, should total only 5, according to the Japanese poem metric &quot;dodoitsu&quot; that goes 7-7-7-5.)&#10;&#10;Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed. The game is played for three hands, but in the final hand, one hidden card must be completed per round, lest the players fail. Players also fail if the deck runs out or if all five Ravens are drawn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Give as good as you get in Bohnanza: The Duel!&#10;&#10;What was that thing about the gift horse? In this two-player variant of Bohnanza, both bean farmers give each other gifts of beans they can't use themselves &mdash; to make life harder for their opponent, if possible. Trying to fulfill their secret &quot;bo(h)nus&quot; requirements, they both need to keep a vigilant eye on the other player's bean fields.&#10;&#10;In more detail, both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves on which to plant their beans. Between them is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three &quot;bo(h)nus cards&quot; with secret objectives. In this game, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you've planted previously, this new bean type must be the next highest number. When harvesting your beans, the beanometer of the card you've most recently planted is what counts.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand, then reveals bean cards from the deck as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type's gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don't take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards. &quot;Bo(h)nus&quot; cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents. When the draw pile is used up, the player with the most bean dollars wins.&#10;&#10;In 2020, AMIGO released Bohnanza: The Duel &ndash; Deluxe, which replaces the gift cards with a game board and gift tokens. This edition also contains newly designed bean fields and bonus cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In March of 1917, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate the throne of Russia. In his place, a conservative Provisional Government formed, representing the official authority of the state. Opposed to the newly formed government stood the Petrograd Soviet, an elected council of workers organized by socialist activists.&#10;&#10;Over the following months, an internal struggle for power and influence would dominate the country and spark a social revolution. In this state of dual power, or dvoevlastie, charismatic and powerful leaders would rise with the tide of public dissatisfaction and change the course of Russian politics forever.&#10;&#10;In Dual Powers, 1-2 players direct the forces on one side of this struggle through political action, social maneuvering, and military conflict. The player with greater support at the end of the game will shape Russia&rsquo;s future and either launch or suppress the impending Civil War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side, each player takes control of one of five Star Wars characters: Darth Vader, Asajj Ventress, Kylo Ren, Moff Gideon, or General Grievous. Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and other things. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's storyline, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;Depending on their villain's unique power, players can also use their villain's &quot;ambition&quot; to perform actions that power effects based on the villain's use of the Force, strategic leadership, or sheer luck. The game also incorporates villain-specific missions and rules for iconic ships and transports from all corners of the Star Wars galaxy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The sun has retreated from the earth. It has been a little over a week since the last hint of light shone over the horizon, and the chaos has begun. People fear for their existence, while scientists struggle to explain the phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Until they came.&#10;&#10;The creatures of nightmare &mdash; vampires, werewolves, and ghouls &mdash; have begun to appear throughout the world, and they show no sign of hesitation in claiming the dark world as their own!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb&#10;&#10;Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&#10;&#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&#10;&#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&#10;&#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Nightfall: Martial Law&#10;    Nightfall: Blood Country&#10;    Nightfall: The Coldest War&#10;    Nightfall: Dark Rages&#10;    Nightfall: Eastern Skies&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One player is the &quot;Dark Consul&quot; who controls the monsters of the dungeon. Every hero/monster has a character card that details the stats for movement, attack, armor, willpower, dexterity, action points and hearts (= life points). Additional information may include special abilities / actions / attacks and potions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on modular dungeon boards. During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to &quot;level up&quot; apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon. The heroes must spawn the dungeon boss by killing monsters or destroying all spawning points (= entry points for new monsters). The heroes must then kill the dungeon boss to be victorious.&#10;&#10;UPC 817009010004&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a world unified by the Empire, it is forbidden to raise armies and make war. All major conflicts get solved in the ARENA, where the best fighters represent entire Nations. Such fighters, with good reason, are called HEROES.&#10;&#10;In this turn-based tactical combat boardgame, players recruit teams of three or four from a wide pool of Heroes, all of them experts in a Combat Role, like Tactician, Healer and Bruiser. There are countless combos, counterpicks and strategies to explore in the attempt to build a powerful and synergistic team.&#10;&#10;Each Hero is granted a Move and an Attack action per turn. Its governing rules are intuitive, meaning even beginners will find ARENA easy to learn; however, the game will forever remain challenging, as it is impossible to reproduce two equal matches, all attacks are unique, and there are optional 'advanced' features to implement in order to refresh and deepen the experience, such as Artifacts and Scrolls.&#10;&#10;In Competitive mode (PvP), both teams fight each other until one eliminates all opposition and wins the battle. Matches begin by strategically positioning highly-detailed miniatures in an infinitely customizable battlefield featuring optional elements that change the dynamics of combat, such as walls, debris, altars and lava. You're required to plan ahead, consider your enemies' moves and work in harmony with your team in order to find the best possible action when your turn comes.&#10;&#10;In Cooperative mode (PvE), the Player(s) build a team of 4 Heroes to travel the fantastic world of Tanares in order to solve an ancient mystery, facing Missions with different problems, hazards, and goals. Campaign Cards present players with challenging events, requiring tough decisions that shape the course - and outcome - of an adventure that find its climaxes in the difficult Dragon Boss Fights.&#10;&#10;The Campaign is meant to be conducted through the course of several sessions, in which Heroes gain experience according to the number - and quality - of accomplished Mission objectives. Experience Points can be spent to Level UP and acquire minor permanent boosts, or to purchase Items that grant major - but provisory - boosts to any Hero.&#10;&#10;Players are free to tweak and adjust their experience according to their personal preferences, making Arena a highly diverse and replayable game. Players can make tournament tables and play simultaneous Matches on different boards; add or subtract different advanced rules and strategical features at will; try the game on custom boards or design their own missions. Players that enjoy immersion and storytelling can maximize adventure in PvE-Campaign Mode, while players adverse to that can even play the Quests individually, in any sequence, with minimum reading required.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Amalfi: Renaissance, players take on the role of merchants in the Italian port town of Amalfi during the Renaissance period. The town was a dominant maritime power during the previous century, but its importance has diminished. The merchants of Amalfi are eager to recapture their previous success and revive the abandoned port town, but they have only four ships.&#10;&#10;In this game, players' ships are used to navigate, but also to store their resources. With their resources, they will be able to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discover charts and thus get better destinations for their actions.&#10;     Acquire paints, books, and historical monuments to earn honor and bonuses.&#10;     Invite renowned historical figures to support their strategy.&#10;     Construct new ships to have more workers and take more actions.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after four rounds, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Amalfi includes new mechanisms (you can now build lighthouses on the map); new characters including new illustrations with si new asymmetrical decks; and rebalanced artworks, charts, decrees, and titles to offer more choices and more replayability, all in a new box with a double-layered main board and individual player boards.&#10;&#10;",

Other players can copy your engineer's action by playing an engineer of the same suit but a higher grade.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Turning your corrosion wheel puts your machines to work and returns engineers to your hand, but also causes old gears and machines to rust.&#10;&#10;&#10;To be successful, you must cleverly co-ordinate your engineers and corrosion wheel and smoothly shift from one efficient engine to the next.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered once the special point supply or the award supply run out.

Its rules are based on Ted Raicer&rsquo;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player takes command of one of the sides (Nationalist or Republican), and looks after all the aspects that involve a war: mobilization, recruitment, movement of troops, offensives, construction of defences&hellip; There are also historical events that must be taken into consideration, as the foreign military aid, international policy, change of Republican Government, etc.&#10;&#10;[en Espa&ntilde;ol:]&#10;&quot;CRUZADA Y REVOLUCI&Oacute;N.

Sus reglas se basan en &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; de Ted Raicer.&#10;&#10;Cada jugador se pone al frente de uno de los dos bandos (Nacional o Republicano), y atiende todos los aspectos que implican una guerra: movilizaci&oacute;n, reclutamiento, movimiento de tropas, ofensivas, construcci&oacute;n de defensas&hellip; Tambi&eacute;n hay eventos hist&oacute;ricos que se deben tener en cuenta, como la ayuda militar extranjera, pol&iacute;tica internacional, cambio del gobierno republicano, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website:)&#10;&#10;Crusade and Revolution (C&amp;R) pulls together enjoyment, playability and historical simulation. It uses the traditional card-driven system, adapting it to the specific circumstances of the Spanish Civil War.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own deck of strategic cards, which are the heart of the game, and must make difficult choices on their use through-out the game. Each card has four possible uses, but only one of them can be chosen each time the card is played! The possibilities are:&#10;&#10;Recreate a Historical Event: Each card shows a historical event that affected the course of the war. They include political, military, economic and even social events, as well as the reinforcements that flowed to both sides through-out the war both from within Spain, and from foreign powers Germany, Italy and Russia.&#10;Conduct Operations: Each card has an operations value that is used for activating units on the game map for movement, preparing fortifications, or attacking.&#10;Strategic Redeployment (SR) of Troops: Each card has a Strategic Redeployment value that is used to move units great distances on the game map, or to bring units out of Reserve to shore up a threatened flank.&#10;Replacement Points for Reforming Your Army: Each card has a Replacement Point value which is recorded and used for repairing damaged or rebuilding destroyed units at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;The greater impact the historical event of a card has on the game, the greater its Operations, SR and Replacements value. As such, a player is often faced with a dilemma while playing each card: use an important event, launch an offensive in a vulnerable zone, move units from one front to other, or accumulate replacements to recover from losses? Combine this with &quot;Combat cards&quot; that bring tactical benefits, and a player faces has a myriad of choices with each and every card.&#10;&#10;A complete C&amp;R game is divided into three phases, which illustrate the evolution of the Spanish Civil War and introduce new strategic cards:&#10;&#10;The War of the Columns phase begins with the outbreak of war and finishes in February 1937. During this phase only &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are used, because both sides had limited combatants, almost all grouped in irregular units - called &ldquo;columns&rdquo;- that operated across large, poorly garrisoned fronts. The best of these &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are the Nationalist African Army regular army units &ndash; brought to the Spanish mainland from Morocco by Franco at the outbreak of the war. These units are strong, but brittle, as they cannot be replaced or replenished with Replacement Points.&#10;&#10;The Mobilization phase lasts from March 1937 to February 1938. During this period the two sides realized that the war would not be over quickly, and began to mobilize their human and material resources to form regular armies. The players deploy their first &ldquo;large units&rdquo; (army corps) and large battles erupt across Spain.&#10;&#10;The War of the Armies phase begins in March 1938 and lasts until the end of the war, in April 1939. During this time, the Nationalists tried to force the enemy&rsquo;s unconditional surrender, while the Republic fought desperately to resist and prolong the Spanish Civil War so that it might merge with the threatening Second World War, which could be seen looming in the horizon.&#10;&#10;Take command of your forces! Marshall international aid and intervention to your side! But take care...for your opponent is doing the same, and while you may be planning on achieving a quick victory, you never know what a game of Crusade and Revolution may bring!&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = Two months (1 month during the first 4 turns of the game)&#10;Map Scale: 1 space = approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles)&#10;Unit Scale: (Small Units) from Irregular columns to divisions.

Also included in the box set is a BattleTech universe book providing an overview of the game world, its history, and its factions. A set of 24 unpainted plastic 'Mechs, ready for play and suitable for painting, are accompanied by prefilled record sheets listing each 'Mech's capabilities. The set also includes maps, a painting and tactics guide, cardstock reference sheets, a universe poster map of the BattleTech universe, and two six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;The 2011 &quot;Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition&quot; of this set replaced the 2007 edition's thin paper maps with board game-style mounted maps, added two additional &quot;high-quality&quot; plastic minis (a Thor and a Loki, with accompanying record sheets), and included a brief guide detailing the BattleTech gaming system intended to introduce new players to the various products for the game. The 2013 reprint is identical to this version, albeit with different box art and the &quot;high-quality&quot; minis were changed to a Timber Wolf and a Battlemaster.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;Other introductory-level products:&#10;&#10;     Classic BattleTech: Starterbook &#226;&#128;&#147; Sword and Dragon (Scenario book and sourcebook designed as a bridge between the box set and Total Warfare)&#10;     Classic BattleTech: Technical Readout &#226;&#128;&#147; 3039 (Companion &quot;technical readout,&quot; with game &quot;fluff&quot; and unit statistics)&#10;     Classic BattleTech: Record Sheets &#226;&#128;&#147; 3039 (Print version of selected prefilled record sheets for TRO: 3039; also includes two scenarios and additional rules)&#10;     BattleTech: Hexpack &#226;&#128;&#147; Lakes and Rivers (Additional maps and terrain overlays to add more variety to gameplay)&#10;&#10;&#10;Intermediate-/standard-level products:&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: Total Warfare (Full standard/tournament rules for BattleTech)&#10;     BattleTech: TechManual (Full construction rules for BattleTech units)&#10;     Classic BattleTech: Technical Readout &#226;&#128;&#147; 3050 Upgrade (Technical readout for the early Clan invasion period)&#10;     Record Sheets: 3050 Upgrade (Print version of selected prefilled record sheets for TRO: 3050U; also includes two scenarios and additional rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;ISBN 9781934857595&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, &quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?&quot; which should help the others determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess &mdash; but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles ...&#10;&#10;Code 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration.&#10;&#10;In 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly. In 2015, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, which is the final edition from Stronghold Games.&#10;&#10;In 2015 DiceTree Games released a multi-lingual edition of the game.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    What's That on My Head?&#10;    Egghead&#10;    Figure It&#10;    Amnesia&#10;    Guess What I Am!&#10;    Coyote&#10;    Pow Wow&#10;    Am I a Banana?&#10;    What's That on My Head?&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the year 3030, and technology offers humankind unimaginable entertainment. What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. They compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. These actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill.&#10;&#10;Your programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own.&#10;&#10;",

It is even said that from its wood, the Gods crafted the first humans and animals.&#10;&#10;Druidic orders from far and wide flock together around its roots to bathe in its glory. Arch-druids sanctify sacred places and erect rune-etched monoliths, while bards tell the tallest tales to recruit a greater following. Ovates read the omens to gain a glimpse of the things to come, while sacrificers use force to defend their Order's beliefs.&#10;&#10;Oak puts you in the role of the leader of one of four different druid orders, with you attempting to establish that your order deserves to be chosen by the Arch-Oak's spirit to stay and learn its secrets. Your order starts out small and insignificant, but if you choose your actions wisely and use your druids efficiently, you will see it grow in power and stature. You will gain the friendship and help of otherworldly creatures like the mischievous brownie, the terrible merrow, and the magical pixies. You will learn powerful spells of the wild and uncover mighty artifacts. You might even risk upsetting the natural balance by creating new sacred places in the forest to house your growing flock of druids.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to prove to the Arch-Oak that your order is worthy? Will you be able to unlock the secrets of the ancients?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there&rsquo;s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.&#10;&#10;If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won.&#10;&#10;",

(Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards.

If you have less than 200 in a currency, subtract 100 from that amount but don't go below 0.

You can 'customize' your deck by adding or removing cards between games to 'tweak' it.&#10;&#10;Each player selects their deck of 60 cards in secret.  Cards are arrayed on a flat surface between the two players.  Location cards are laid out first and then characters or ships are laid out at the locations.  Additional types of cards can be placed on ships and characters, for example weapons and devices. The object of the game is to drain your opponent's life force.  Each card represents a unit of life force.  Playing location cards allows you to draw additional life force into your hand.  If a ship or character is destroyed in battle, the card goes to a lost pile; when all cards are in your lost pile you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;This is a strategy based card game set in the Star Wars universe that can become very addictive.  It is a complex game that offers rewarding, strategic play for those who take the time to learn it.  Visit SWCCGPC.com for the latest news and to learn how to play.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Under his leadership, those who will train the mighty Inca people came out of their caves to discover new horizons in order to subsist and grow in harmony with nature. They venerated Pachamama, Mother Earth, the basis of all living things, plants and minerals, on earth and under the earth.&#10;&#10;In Tiwanaku, first announced as Pachamama, you lead your tribe into unknown territory in search of new lands to cultivate. Your goal: To explore regions and draw outlines to develop cultures according to the customs and legacies of Pachamama. If you honor Her by respecting the great principles of diversity and complementarity, Nature will reward you; otherwise, you will suffer his wrath. In this race, risk-taking, deduction, intuition, and a good sense of timing should allow you to get through.&#10;&#10;Each scenario disc indicates a unique arrangement of terrain tiles and crop tiles. Terrain tiles are in regions of 1-5 spaces, and a region of one color does not touch a region of the same color, even diagonally. Crop tokens have a value of 1-5, and each value has a different size/color (level 1 is brown, level 2 is green, etc.). A size 1 region will contain a value 1 crop token, a size 2 region will contain crop tokens of value 1 and 2, and only a size 5 region will contain crop tokens of each value. Two identical crop values can never be adjacent, even diagonally.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take either an explore action or a divine action: At the end of an explore or divine action, you can hand in 1-5 offering cubes for 0-10 points. You can hold at most one offering of each color.&#10;&#10;When the final terrain tile is placed on the game board, the end of the game is triggered. Starting with this player, each player in turn can take a single divine action or pass. If you pass, you take no further actions. If you divine, you gain points and an offering cube like normal, or you lose points and must pass. Keep taking turns around the table until everyone has passed, then make a final offering, then see who has the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.&#10;&#10;Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.&#10;&#10;Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.&#10;&#10;All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;",

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How to PlayYou acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish.  The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Design NotesLords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence.  The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion.  During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last.  Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage.  Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.&#10;&#10;",

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&#10;&#10;Complicating matters (optionally) is that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&#10;&#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.  The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;.  There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched.  These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations.  So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&#10;&#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn they draw an event card.  These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city.  Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!  These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur.  Some of them have &ldquo;unknown circumstance&rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.&#10;&#10;If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed.  Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.&#10;&#10;So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.&#10;&#10;Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token.  These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.  However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances.  The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for.  If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&#10;&#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.  If time runs out, once again the murderer shall escape justice!&#10;&#10;The pressure is great and the stakes are high!&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn selects a tile, with the lead player being forced to take the final tile.&#10;&#10;When you take a tile, place it adjacent to at least one other tile in your display, then see whether you complete any tasks on your tiles; each time you do, cover that task with a token. Tiles contain 0-3 frames and 0-3 tasks, with each of these coming in four colors. A task might be, for example, a green 3, and to complete the task, the tile bearing this task must be part of a set of three tiles that have green frames, whether directly or via an orthogonal chain of connection with tiles that have green frames.&#10; Tasks might be two colors, e.g., red and brown, which means that both frame colors can be used to satisfy the task. Alternatively, a task might be 4 yellow or 4 brown. Also, conditional tasks exist in which you must first complete one task before you can complete the second one.&#10;&#10;Whoever first places all of their tokens wins. Framework also includes a solo game in which you attempt to place all of your tokens in an area of tiles that is as close to a 5x5 grid as possible.&#10;&#10;",

As Saladin, who was the epitome of a chivalrous warrior, can you repeat history and retain the Holy Land for the Saracens?&#10;&#10;Crusader Rex plays a bit like other Columbia block war games but has many variants that give it its own historical flavor, such as siege warfare, knight charges, harrying, muster moves, freedom in set up, and more!&#10;&#10;",

The better they do during training, the easier they catch cattle in the field. Be smart and get in your opponents&rsquo; way with mean tricks by snatching the most valuable cattle from under their noses, or swing your lasso to abduct one of their animals. At home, sort your cattle by race and assemble them in herds only to sell them later for as many Pesos as possible.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect sets of cattle tiles and sell them. Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.&#10;&#10;Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).&#10;&#10;Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold. The game ends when the cattle tiles draw pile runs out. When this happens, one more round is played, and then all cattle tiles are sold. The player who made the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;This is the English release of the 16 cards The Starship set in Lost Legacy.

The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.&#10;&#10;There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.&#10;&#10;Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)&#10;&#10;The action cards work as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.&#10;    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.&#10;    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.&#10;    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.&#10;&#10;&#10;When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Freshwater Fly is the second standalone game in a series from designer Brian Suhre that integrates modern game mechanics with the surprisingly rich and uniquely refreshing world of angling. In Freshwater Fly you will encounter a rushing mountain stream teaming with fish, armed solely with a rod, reel and selection of flies. To catch fish and earn valuable achievement points you will need to carefully perform a series of tactical maneuvers while executing a deliberate and evolving strategy.&#10;&#10;Begin by examining the ever-changing hatch in the current, and tie a fly to match your target fish at just the right time and turn of the river. Then choose to cast upstream to drift your fly with the current and gain extra bites on your line, or push your luck with a pinpointed cast for the perfect catch. In either case, it is wise to cast near rocks to boost your skill and uncover new fishing techniques, while keeping your supply of finesse charged for the next challenge. Your rondel reel, which physically spins, provides you different bonuses as you draw in your line, depending on how aggressively you choose to fight the fish you've hooked. Applying drag, for instance, will negate the fish's strength, but leveraging your momentum could provide you a unique action to set you up perfectly for your next cast.&#10;&#10;At its core, Freshwater Fly is a dice drafting and set collecting game, with elements of creative puzzle solving and pushing your luck. Each turn you select one die from the dice pool and assign it an action that relates to the particular fishing maneuver you want to take. Higher valued dice typically earn you more powerful actions, but accumulating lower dice totals can earn you free turns. The dice you select will also unlock or multiply various bonus actions you can use to solve the most stringent fishing puzzles in unique and rewarding ways.&#10;&#10;The sets of fish and flies you collect will help you achieve personal and common goals, but to obtain victory you must focus on those goals which overlap in the most valuable ways, while not falling behind in your total fish count. The game ends when a single player catches a seventh fish, achievement points are awarded, and the winner is declared.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gandhi: The Decolonization of British India, 1917&ndash;1947 is Volume IX in GMT&rsquo;s acclaimed COIN Series. Exploring one of the world&rsquo;s most prominent experiments with nonviolent resistance, Gandhi takes us to the subcontinent of India, the jewel in the crown of the British Empire, for a detailed look at the final decades of the British Raj. 1 to 4 players compete to determine the future of India; will the transition to home rule be a peaceful one, will India be split apart by partition or civil war, or will it remain firmly in the grip of empire?&#10;&#10;Gandhi offers a fresh perspective on the history of insurgency with the addition of a new type of faction to the COIN Series, the Nonviolent (NV) faction, while retaining the multi-faction, asymmetrical, card-assisted system of earlier titles in the COIN Series. COIN veterans will be able to jump right in.&#10;&#10;Other features include:&#10;&#10;     Gandhi as the game&rsquo;s sole leader piece.&#10;     Nonviolent operations and special activities.&#10;     Nonviolent activists that are always active, but generally immune from Raj actions until engaged in protests (or caught up in post-terror reprisals).&#10;     Protests that erode support but leave activists vulnerable to arrest by Raj forces.&#10;     A Hindu-Muslim Unity track that measures tensions between these two communities, affecting resources, operations, and victory.&#10;     A British Rule track that reflects shifts in colonial policy in response to events on the map, from resolve to restraint, affecting the cost of several actions.&#10;     British Viceroys who come and go with each passing campaign and have their own unique effects on each faction.&#10;     An out-of-play jail space that holds nonviolent forces arrested during martial law. Pieces can be kept in jail over several campaigns, but at a cost to the Raj.&#10;     Independent Princely States that are never controlled by any faction, yet offer a haven for violent and nonviolent insurgents alike.&#10;     Short and medium-length scenarios that allow for the study of different periods of the struggle against British rule in India.&#10;     Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, and 4-player games.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Gandhi, players will face a range of difficult and interesting strategic choices. Following in the innovative footsteps of previous COIN titles, Gandhi weaves together historical, political, and cultural threads and offers an opportunity to study nonviolent and violent resistance in one of the most significant colonial possessions from the age of European imperialism. Civil disobedience and non-cooperation, protests and terror, imperialism and constructive programme, growing unrest, negotiation, agitation, assassination, persuasion, boycotts, martial law, and many other options await.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Gandhi made it impossible for us to go on ruling India, but at the same time he made it possible for us to abdicate without rancor and without dishonour.&rdquo;&#10;&mdash; British Historian Arnold Toynbee&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall is a co-operative campaign game for 1-4 players that blends thrilling fantasy adventure with tactical, edge-of-your-seat combat. Play as one of six unique Seekers, sworn to protect the city of Din&rsquo;Lux and help rebuild the world beyond. Armed with kinfire lanterns, you&rsquo;ll brave the Starless Nights, battle the creatures that emerge, and guard each others&rsquo; backs against the malevolent forces trying to stop you.&#10;&#10;Each quest has three phases: adventuring, battle, and exploration. In the adventuring phase, players make choices based on options presented on the quest cards and need to accomplish something (such as crossing a river or chasing down a suspect) by flipping the correct number and color of cards from their decks. In the battle phase, players work together to defeat enemies on a physical battle map. Turns are determined by drawing chits out of the destiny bag, with each enemy having numbered tokens that correspond with different attacks and actions. Players may play action cards on their own turns to do damage and can play boost cards on other players' turns to do things like reduce damage, move players, or even return a drawn chit to the destiny bag for redraw. The game doesn't end if an objective isn't achieved or an enemy defeats the heroes, but it will affect later gameplay and choice options. Lastly, on certain quests players can return to the city in the exploration phase to speak to NPCs, purchase items, and level up their decks.&#10;&#10;Woven throughout each of these phases are cards that require you to make a choice, such as resting before moving on or charging into battle, or whether or not to spare someone's life. The characters in the game have their own set of morals and standards, and playing according to your character can earn you Kinfire tokens that help you level up. Ultimately though, the decisions you make are yours alone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orbis is a tactical game of world development and strategic resource management, in which players take on the roles of gods creating their best universes. Utilizing lands lost in the aether, players accumulate worshippers to spend on even more fruitful lands &mdash; some of which grant game-changing bonuses. The key to victory lies in having the most creation points (CPs) at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must take a tile from either the nine region tiles in the center of the table or the available God tiles. (A player may take only one God tile throughout the game.) Every time you take a region tile, worshippers of the same color as the tile taken are placed on adjacent tiles, making the tiles left behind more enticing for the next player. Restrictions apply to region tile placement, making each decision tougher than the last!&#10;&#10;After fifteen rounds, the game ends when all players have created their universe, at which point CPs are calculated, bonus tiles awarded, and a winner is crowned. Beautifully simple yet rich in strategy, Orbis is a different game each and every time you play it.&#10;&#10;Become the best god and craft your most prosperous universe!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oddly enough, several of you have been hired to build the city of OddVille, home to four powerful worker guilds.&#10;&#10;Cleverly place your buildings in order to obtain greater power and fame, while thwarting your opponents' plans. Manage your workers to obtain the resources, coins, and building projects you need in order to make your mark on the city.

The guild comes first, though: At a moment's notice, every guild member will return to the guild hall, regardless of how much that inconveniences you. Of course, the person who &quot;inspired&quot; the guild meeting may be chuckling gleefully at the &quot;unfortunate&quot; timing of your guest's departure.&#10;&#10;OddVille is a card-based city-building game in which all actions are carried out by playing one of your four Worker cards. Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus.&#10;&#10;The city grows with each player's contribution, ever changing the values of players' buildings. As soon as a player builds his sixth building, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lots of people grew up playing roll-and-move games, and That's Life!, a.k.a., Verflixxt!, is a modern roll-and-move design that puts you (a bit) more in control of your fate than those games of old.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the tiles in a continuous path, with the tiles either bearing a clover or being numbered -10 to +8. Place wooden guards on the clover tiles and two of the positive tiles as indicated in the rules. Each player has three tokens (two in a five- or six-player game) that start at the beginning of the path.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the die, then move one of your tokens that many spaces down the path. If your token is the only one on a tile when you leave it, you collect that tile, which shrinks the path on which everyone is moving. If a guard is still on a tile when you leave it, you do not collect the tile. If any player's token is on the same space as a guard, you can move that guard instead of moving one of your own tokens, possibly setting someone else up for misfortune on a future turn and possibly setting yourself up for goods things &mdash; as long as no one else lands on your tile!&#10;&#10;Once your token reaches the final space on the path, that token is retired from play. Once all tokens are retired, players tally their points, with each clover you possess turning a negative tile into a positive one. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Verflixxt! includes a number of variants, including one in which you construct the path by laying out the tiles at random instead of in a particular order. The 2020 version of Verflixxt! uses this variant for its basic set-up, with the addition of a double-sided &quot;give/steal&quot; tile placed after every eighth tile on the path. When you collect tiles in this version of play, you place them in a tower, with your most recently collected tile on top. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;give&quot; tile, you must give your topmost tile to another player, giving a negative token to whoever has the most positive token on top and vice versa; you then flip the &quot;give&quot; tile to its &quot;steal&quot; side. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;steal&quot; tile, you take the topmost tile from whichever player you choose, then place it on top of your stack.&#10;&#10;For an even trickier variant, you can play that the clover tile affects only the tile directly beneath it in your stack, turning a positive negative and a negative positive. Now the clover isn't always so attractive!&#10;&#10;",

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.&#10;&#10;Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.&#10;&#10;Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.&#10;&#10;As a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.&#10;&#10;",

A dread terror that is not of this world or any other &mdash; but rather from the spaces between the stars &mdash; demands your submission. Meanwhile, unwary investigators vainly attempt to halt this appalling chapter in the dark history of Arkham.&#10;&#10;As the high priest of one of these shadowy cults, you must dominate the city. You will invoke cosmic creatures and unholy gods to receive their &quot;gifts&quot;, but you must take care to preserve your sanity and thwart the investigators who seek to stop you. This time, you are the bad guys. Why settle for the lesser evil?&#10;&#10;Kingsport Festival, a game of bizarre cults set in the terrifying world of Howard Philips Lovecraft, lasts 12 rounds, each divided into six phases. All Cultists roll their dice and the one that rolled the lowest sum will play first and so on, then (in turn order) each one may invoke an Elder God by using one or more of his dice, where the sum of their values is exactly equal to the number of the Elder God, or pass. Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards. After Cultists have taken their dice back, in turn order each one may place his disk on one Building that is connected to another one he has already marked (starting from the House). To do so, he must pay the Domain resources required.&#10;&#10;In turns marked with a blue marker on the Calendar, a Raid takes place: first the Event card and then the Investigator card is revealed. Each Cultist calculates his Strength by adding up any modifiers he has due to Spells, Buildings, and other game effects (such as Events, Scenarios, etc.). If his strength is greater, the Cultist receives rewards; if is less, he suffers the penalty.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the twelfth round is played. If the Scenario has a Festival card, it is revealed and its effects resolved at this time.&#10;The Cultist who has the most Cult points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is clearly written that anyone to whom the King awards the title of Royal Steward will manage the Wieliczka Salt Mine, called Magnum Sal. His Majesty the King will give this royal stewardship to the foreman who by his work shows that he is the best in the craft of salt mining, and he will lead the operations of the Cracow Salt Mine for the glory of the Polish Kingdom.&#10;&#10;Magnum Sal is a eurogame about exploration of a salt mine (second oldest still operating salt mine in the world). Each player takes the role of a foreman - the manager of a mining team. During the game, players will try to extract salt most efficiently from the mine, sell their &quot;white gold&quot; at the market, and above all complete the king's salt orders. The player who earns the most money from extracting salt receives the title of Royal Steward and wins the game.&#10;&#10;(From the rulebook)&#10;&#10;Magnum Sal is latin name that Wieliczka was noted in some documents for the first time - it means Great Salt. From this latin name, Wieliczka was formed - Magnum (Latin) -&gt; Great (EN) -&gt; Wielki (PL)&#10;&#10;Quote from wikipedia (there is no source for this but it's probably the way that the name Wieliczka was formed): &#10;Magnum Sal (latin) -&gt; Wielka S&oacute;l -&gt; Wielika S&oacute;l -&gt; Wielicka -&gt; Wieliczka&#10;&#10;",

Players send out a trading ship on a voyage in which it must survive a round of attacks from other player's pirate ships. You defend your traders with your own pirates and collect the spoils of your attacks elsewhere. The game ends once the draw deck is depleted and one player is out of cards. The player with the most gold coins wins.&#10;&#10;Description for the Heidelberger release:&#10;&#10;Essen release, 2002. In the nice small black box, with embossed lettering. This game has 25 Trade ships worth different amounts of gold (from 2 to 8), 48 Pirate ships, 12 each in 4 colors. The Pirate ships are worth 1-4 skulls (the player with the most skulls played on a trade ship captures it if the lead is kept for one full pass around the table). There are 4 Pirate Captains (1 of each color) to help win the battles and 1 Admiral to help defend the trade ships. The game is playable with 2-5 players individually. With partners it can be played with up to 6 or 8.&#10;&#10;",

These three different modes enable each kind of player to have a good time. The Board Game will enable expert players to discover a game based on an endless number of strategies; the Family Game will enable little players and families to get to know the basic game dynamics while playing a simpler but yet just as fun game; the Party Game will transform Horse Fever into a platform for a potentially endless number of players and turn any boring party into the most entertaining event of the century.&#10;&#10;",

Each hand of cards represents a convoy of experts and equipment travelling between the players' outposts, giving the player the choice of one new construction each turn. In a new twist on the genre, each hand always contains one of a number of &quot;Expedition&quot; cards that grant a special free action every turn before passing on to the next player.&#10;&#10;Wooden lunar rover tokens are a neutral resource that add a worker placement element to the game. They are also used to break ties and so must be used with care.&#10;&#10;Over the three distinct eras of the game, players compete for majority in 5 aspects of their bases: housing, transportation, science, industry, and food production. At the end of each era, the leader in each of these areas as determined by flag icons on their constructed buildings, collects bonus victory points.&#10;&#10;Each game also features a number of randomly selected &quot;Reputation&quot; cards which provide one-time or ongoing bonuses for the player who meets the requirement and claims the card.&#10;&#10;Moon is the third game of a loose trilogy, preceeded by Villagers and Streets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As winter blows in and ghosts start to appear, play &quot;tricks&quot; to the past, present, and future.&#10;&#10;As turns progress, your foes will play - out of order - to any of these time periods, and you will start to figure out who might &quot;lead&quot; each trick. Even though you can play to the tricks in any order, the tricks will resolve based on who was leading. Can you figure out who will be leading or manipulate the leader to set yourself up to win tricks?&#10;&#10;Points are awarded to whomever has correctly bid on the number of tricks they thought they'd win. If you&rsquo;ve played as many hands as there are players, the game is now over, otherwise keep playing! Whoever has the highest score and collected the most wreaths wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Time Palatrix is a trick-taking game played in four rounds of three tricks each. First the cards are dealt out, and players bid on how many tricks they think they will win. Each player has a mat with three numbered spaces for cards, and on their turn plays a card in one of those spaces. If that card is the first to be played in that number space, it sets the suit for that space. Other players must follow suit on that space, or play on a different space. Once all three tricks are complete, the winners are determined, the cards are cleared, and the next round begins. Points are awarded if you correctly bid on the number of tricks you won.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The generations before you have relied on harvesting the oceans. But as the 19th century ends, change and opportunity reach your fishing village in northern Norway.&#10;In Saltfjord, you must decide if you will expand your settlement with new buildings, send your boat to collect fish, engage in trade, or pioneer new technologies to make everyday life easier. How will you shape the destiny of your village?&#10;&#10;Saltfjord is set in a Norwegian fishing village, and is loosely based on the dice drafting mechanisms from &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, but the game has otherwise been completely redesigned and expanded with new elements.&#10;&#10;To add to the replayability, the game has lots of variable elements in the set-up, such as what special abilities and end scoring tiles are available.&#10;&#10;Over three rounds, players draft dice to activate buildings in their settlement. This provides resources as well as activating actions such as sending out your fishing boat, advancing along the various technology tracks, completing trade orders, or erecting new buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player's player board shows a grid. When you draft a die, you activate all buildings in the row or column corresponding to that die. By erecting buildings in your settlement, each die can activate more buildings.&#10;&#10;The technology tracks unlock special abilities, such as upgrading your fishing boat. And fishing is an important part of daily life in Saltfjord.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Age of Conan is a board game which puts players in control of one of the major kingdoms of the Hyborian age, in the period of history well known through the tales of the adventures of Conan the Cimmerian, the barbarian hero created by Robert E. Howard.&#10;&#10;You will fight with armies, sorcery and intrigue to make your kingdom the most powerful of its age, and to secure on your side the mightiest hero of all &ndash; Conan the Cimmerian!&#10;&#10;In Age of Conan, you control one of the major kingdoms of the Hyborian Age &ndash; Aquilonia, Turan, Hyperborea and Stygia.&#10;&#10;You will build up and use your armies and emissaries, you will enhance your actions with your kingdom cards, and you will try to take advantage of the adventures of Conan to increase the power and wealth of your kingdom.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of three ages. At the beginning of each age, four Conan adventure cards are drawn and used to create the adventure deck. At the beginning of each adventure, players will bid to decide who will be the Conan player for that adventure; when an adventure ends, a new one is drawn and a new bid determines who will be the new Conan player.&#10;&#10;The roll of the fate dice is used to determine the actions available to the players. The dice are rolled to form a common pool from which all players will pick their dice. Each player, in turn, will choose and use one fate die and will be able to do one of the actions allowed by that die result.&#10;&#10;When the fate dice are all used, they are rolled again and the game continues in this way until all four adventures in the adventure deck are complete. At that point, the game will temporarily stop so that players may earn gold and take several kingdom&ndash;building actions in preparation for the next age.&#10;&#10;",
