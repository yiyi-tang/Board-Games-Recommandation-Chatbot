Create a common supply with as many markers &quot;+30 / +60 Seals&quot; as players participate.&#10;&#10;The wooden markers on the board are not advanced according to the values on the board. Instead, move all 3 wooden markers on theboard as indicated on the open Silver Train paying attention to the number of players. When you have advanced the wooden markers on the board, you draw the top tile from the face down pile and place it face up on the current tile. The game ends when the stack of Silver Train tiles is empty. When the last open tile has been used, you continue to play the current round and the complete the final scoring as usual.&#10;&#10;",

How does one add a monorail? First you need to place tiles in your park that each contain space for a pillar, and you need to place them at the proper distance. Once you have two pillars in place, you take the topmost monorail tile, then balance it on the pillars. Now everyone can scoot around your park looking down at the bears!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reckless rabbit rascals penetrate the Carrot Yard (&quot;R&eacute;p&aacute;skert&quot;). The rabbits are trying to loot as many carrots as they can, competing with each other. But their hardest challenge is to avoid the two hostile mastiffs chasing them among the bushes.&#10;&#10;Players control their own rabbit, and they also move the dogs. Their objective is to collect as many carrots as possible and to increase their scores by making the dogs bite the opponents&rsquo; rabbits. Everyone has a set of movement cards to direct the steps of the animals.  One half of each card instructs the rabbit, the other half instructs the dog; players have to choose carefully which part to use and when.&#10;&#10;Rabbits also leave droppings on the board, which obstruct movement: if a rabbit crosses or lands on a space where there is a dropping, it loses a carrot. Dogs don&rsquo;t care about the droppings.&#10;&#10;R&eacute;p&aacute;skert (Carrot Yard) is an easy-to-learn, fast-paced family game.  A party lasts 2-5 rounds, depending on the number of players. However, the game may end sooner if the upper limit of bites is reached or no more carrots are left on the board.

First, you choose whom to meet with and whom not to.  If a player has lost the trust of the other players she will have a hard time getting them to meet with him and cannot score.  Second, you can &quot;double-cross&quot; a player: if you think he is trying to eat you, play the animal that eats his animal!&#10;&#10;When one player has used her last card the game is over.

If they are spice supplied to start with, the strength of the units increases by one half per unit (four tokens would have the strength of six, five of seven and one half, and so on).&#10;&#10;2. When played against the Ixian player, it destroys all spice he owns.&#10;&#10;STRATEGY:&#10;The Ixian player must contend with two weaknesses &ndash; always having to move first and poor leadership. Always moving first means almost no surprise attacks; enemy players will be able to retreat almost at will, fighting only when they want or have to. Low leadership values will force the Ixian player to assign large numbers of tokens to battles, as well as expend several spice points to support them. While their non-stop spice helps, the Ixians should not  engage in non-stop fighting &ndash; instead, they are advised to build their strength, prepare themselves for the jihad, then strike!&#10;&#10;",

In &lsquo;The Cave,&rdquo; you will play cards from your hand into the dungeon, trying to defeat the monsters and bring home their treasure.&#10;&#10;Equipment: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;To Begin: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards in the starting hand varies with the number of players, as follows:&#10;&#10;Players:    2 3 4 5 6&#10;Cards:      7 6 5 5 4&#10;&#10;Next, deal the &ldquo;Cave,&rdquo; a collection of five cards face up in the center of the table. Play will start on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceed clockwise.&#10;&#10;On Your Turn: You will play one card from your hand into the Cave. This card will capture one or more cards from the Cave, as follows:&#10;&#10;If there are lower cards in the cave, your card captures the card(s) of the value that is closest beneath it. For example, if the&#10;board is 4-7-7-8-9, and you play an 8, you will capture both 7s.&#10;&#10;If no cards in the Cave are lower than your card, you capture all cards of the highest rank (even if that rank matches your card).&#10;For example, if the Cave is 4-5-7-9-10, and you play a&#10;4 (or lower), you will capture the 10.&#10;&#10;The card you played goes into the Cave. Set aside your captured cards, to be scored at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Refilling the Cave: If the Cave has fewer than five cards, refill it from the deck. If the deck is ever empty, the Cave does not refill, but play continues.&#10;&#10;Scoring the Round: Play until everyone has emptied their hand. Then score the game as follows:&#10;&#10;For each rank, the player who captured the most cards of that rank scores one point for each. Players with fewer cards in that rank do not score.&#10;&#10;For example, if someone captured three 10s, and no one else had more 10s, then that player would get 3 points. If two or more players are tied for the most cards, they each score full points.&#10;&#10;Record your score after each round, and play one round for each player, passing the deal to the left. Then the player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Play your cards right, build a rocket, and head to the Moon!&#10;&#10;To the Moon is played over several rounds. Each round is made of several countdowns, or tricks. The goal of each trick is to be the last player still &ldquo;in,&rdquo; and this earns you one point for every card in the trick.&#10;&#10;To start the round, shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards you deal out varies with the number of players, as follows:&#10;&#10;Players: 2 3 4 5 6&#10;Cards: 8 7 6 5 4&#10;&#10;The dealer plays the top card of the deck to start the first trick. Each trick represents a countdown, and may therefore contain no more than one card of each rank. Play proceeds clockwise, skipping players who are out. On each turn, you may do one of three things: build, test, or withdraw&#10;&#10;Build: Play a card from your hand into the countdown. This card can&rsquo;t match any of the cards that are already there. If you complete a perfect countdown (all ten cards), then you win this trick immediately. Otherwise, play continues, and you are still in.&#10;&#10;Test: Play the top card of the deck. If it is a legal play, then your test is a success, and you are still in the trick. If it matches another card, then you are knocked out of the trick, and take that card into your hand.&#10;&#10;Withdraw: Play no cards, and take yourself out of the trick. You also take one card from the table into your hand, unless this would leave no cards on the table.&#10;&#10;Note: When out of the trick, lay your hand face down on the table, with the card that you just took face up on top. This makes it easier for everyone to see who is in and out.&#10;&#10;Taking the Trick: When only one player remains in the trick, that player wins the trick and scores those cards. All players come back in, and the winner leads the next trick by playing the top card of the deck. If the deck is empty at this step, the round is over.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Each card captured in a trick is worth one point. Play six rounds, and then the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each hand a is series of rounds in which some merchants will prosper, and some will struggle.&#10;&#10;Equipment: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Setup: To start the hand, shuffle the deck and deal six cards to each player. Note the alternate rules for 2-3 players, below.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play: On each round, every player will play one card face up, going in turn to the left. On the first round, play begins on the dealer&rsquo;s left. On later rounds, play begins with the player who took the most points on the previous round. If this is tied, which is rare, then the same person leads the next round.&#10;&#10;Generally, each card played in the round is worth its face value in points. However, if more than one card of the same rank are played, then the earlier ones are &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; and only the last one scores. For example, if three 8&rsquo;s are played, only the last 8 can score.&#10;&#10;There are also five special cards, described below, which do not behave by these basic rules.&#10;&#10;Rules for 2-3 Players:&#10;Players start with ten cards. Each player will play two cards on each round, so play proceeds twice around the table. Be sure to remember which cards were played in what order.&#10;&#10;Special Cards:&#10;&#10;Each of the following cards breaks the basic rules in its own way.&#10;&#10;1: Tinker. At the end of the round, this card may trade places with any other card.&#10;&#10;2: Knight. Before scoring, this card kills (discards) the highest scoring card. Knights cannot kill cards of rank 3 and lower. Playing a second Knight does not spoil the first, and they can each kill a card.&#10;&#10;3: Royal. This card cannot be traded, killed, or spoiled. When you play a 3, you will always score it.&#10;&#10;7: Rain. If only one Rain card is played, it spoils everything except Royals, including 1&rsquo;s and 2&rsquo;s. (The player who played the Rain does score the Rain card.) However, if more than one Rain card are played, treat them as ordinary 7&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;9: Bandit. The first bandit, not the last, is the card that scores. Bandits played after the first one are spoiled.&#10;&#10;The round ends after all players have played one card.&#10;Before scoring, first remove any cards that are spoiled, and then check the other cards in the following order:&#10;Royals, then Rain, Knights, and Tinker.&#10;&#10;The hand is over when all cards have been played. A full game is six hands, or one hand for each player, whichever is greater.&#10;&#10;",

They throw all the ingredients into a bowl, and when a sandwich forms, they grab it.&#10;&#10;You Need: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Note: This game can be played cutthroat (with everyone playing alone), but with more than three players we prefer playing in teams. See Team Play with Odd Numbers below to learn how to do this with five or seven players.&#10;&#10;Structure: Lunch Rush is played in several rounds. In each round, players take turns playing cards into the center and trying to complete &ldquo;sandwiches.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A sandwich is a sequence of cards in which one or more smaller cards lie between two matching larger cards. For example, 9-8-3-9 is a &ldquo;nine sandwich,&rdquo; made from two 9&rsquo;s surrounding an 8 and 3. However, 9-8-10-9 is not a nine sandwich, because the 10 is larger than the 9&rsquo;s. Playing a 10 into the second sequence would create a ten sandwich: 9-8-10-9-10.&#10;&#10;Note: Two matching cards in a row does not make a sandwich, because there must be at least one smaller card between them.&#10;&#10;To Begin the Round: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards in hand, and the total number of rounds to play, is as follows:&#10;&#10;Players:   2 3 4 5 6 7&#10;Cards: 10 9 8 7 7 7&#10;Rounds: 6 6 4 5 6 7&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play: Starting on the dealer&rsquo;s left, each player in turn plays one card from their hand into the sequence in the middle of the table. If you complete a sandwich, you pick up those cards and score them.&#10;&#10;Scoring: For the &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; the large cards that bracket the sandwich, you score one point per card. For the &ldquo;meat,&rdquo; the smaller cards inside the bread, you score face value. For example, a sandwich of 7-4-7 would be&#10;worth a total of 6 points: 4 for the meat, and 1+1 for the bread. Keep these cards aside, with the bread face down and the meat face up.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players&rsquo; hands are empty. Record your scores for the round and pass the deal to the left.&#10;The total number of rounds in the game is given above.&#10;&#10;Team Play with Odd Numbers?&#10;&#10;With five or seven players, you can use a format of rotating teams. The dealer plays alone, and the other players divide into two teams. With five players, the teams are A-B-A-B-D, where D is the dealer. With seven, they are A-B-A-B-A-B-D. In a full game, each player deals once.&#10;&#10;Because these teams are temporary, each player keeps a separate score. Both of the players on a team score all of that team&rsquo;s points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Free game published in the August 2018 (GTM #222) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Pirate Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&#10;&#10;Story: You are mutinous pirates trying to gather a crew and overthrow the Captain. But the Captain and his allies hide among you, and they aim to foil your plans!&#10;&#10;Captain&rsquo;s Orders is a game of bluffing and deduction.&#10;&#10;You Need: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Definitions: The Captain is a secret player, the person holding the lowest ranked card. The identity of Captain can change whenever cards are played and passed. Sometimes there will be a tie for lowest card, so there may be more than one Captain.&#10;&#10;All non-Captain players are Mutineers. Mutineers can win the round either by discovering the Captain, or by accumulating the most points in their hands. (Cards are worth their face value in points.) The Captain can win only by running out of cards.&#10;&#10;Each Round: To begin the round, shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Play begins on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceeds clockwise. Pass the deal to the left after each round.&#10;&#10;On Your Turn: Your options are different depending on whether there is an Order on the table.&#10;&#10;NO ORDER: If there is no Order on the table, you must do one of the following: play an Order, pass a card, ask for a card, or discover the Captain.&#10;&#10;Play an Order: Play a card face up in the middle of the table. This card becomes an Order and you are its owner.&#10;&#10;Pass a Card: Pass a card from your hand to another player, face down. That player must then discard one card face down.&#10;&#10;Ask for a Card: Ask another player to pass you a card from their hand, face down. Then you must discard one card face down.&#10;&#10;Discover the Captain: If you think you know who the Captain is, you can accuse that player. This ends the round, and all players must immediately reveal their hands to find the true identity of the Captain(s).&#10;&#10;If you are a Mutineer, and you correctly identify the Captain, you win the round. Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t win, and the other Mutineer with the most points wins the round.&#10;&#10;STANDING ORDER: When an Order is on the table, your options are different. You must either follow or belay the Order, or discover the Captain as described above.&#10;&#10;Exception: You do not respond to your own Order. If an Order has traveled all the way around the table, its owner simply discards it, and the turn passes to the left.&#10;&#10;Follow the Order: Pass a card face down to the owner of the Order. The rank of the card you pass must be equal to or higher than the rank of the Order. (Note: there is no discard after this type of card pass.)&#10;&#10;Belay the Order: Play a new Order of a lower rank than the current Order. The old Order is discarded, and the new one belongs to you.&#10;&#10;Ending the Round: The round ends when any player runs out of cards, or tries to discover the Captain.&#10;&#10;Running out of Cards: Whenever you empty your hand, either by passing a card or by playing an Order, you may reveal that card and declare that you are the Captain. This ends the round, and if you&rsquo;re right, you win. If you were passing that card away, and you are not the Captain, then the card passes into that player&rsquo;s hand for scoring.&#10;&#10;Ties for Captain: If more than one player holds the lowest card, then either of them can win by running out of cards, and Mutineers can win by accusing either of them. However, one Captain can&rsquo;t win by identifying another one.&#10;&#10;Ties for Points: If two or more Mutineers win with the same score, they each score a win for the round .&#10;&#10;Winning: The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is their holy quest to save earth from the Oni. They are mystic warriors, arising from the Jade Kingdom, a realm in which all surviving otherworldly creatures found shelter, after humans began killing and hunting them. The Sentinels still protect the earth whenever Oni walk it. So they return through their jade portals. Possessed with the magic of ancient times, like the Kami had, they can hide in plain sight. Their jade armor hides them, when a mortal is looking at them.&#10;&#10;As Oni appeared in several times during earth's history, the Sentinels adapted to these times. Although they are ancient warriors, some use modern technology while others stay traditional. But in the end, they are here to save the earth - but not the humans anymore. They walk between both worlds, the protectors of two realms.&#10;&#10;Playstyle:&#10;&#10;The Sentinels are the first game changer faction for Tsukuyumi. They modify the game dramatically, as they have a special winning condition: If there are no more Oni on the board, they immediately win - both, if they killed the last Oni or any other player did. In this case, no score points are counted. If they are not able to kill all Oni before the end of the game, they are awarded score points for killing Oni units.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a homezone, they place six portal markers next to which they are allowed to place new units. Sentinel units are even allowed to move from one area with a portal to another of its kind for only one movement point.&#10;&#10;Any unit has at least one exact copy in play, representing its camouflage. Both standees can be moved separately and are treated as real. Only in battle, the player has to decide which of both standees is the real unit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Forty Nine Football (49F) is a strategy simulation football game that is designed to play out like a real game. Skill players and teams will perform according to their statistical abilities. Each team has its own Team Chart which includes individual ratings for all skill players. Defense and the Offensive Line are based on team effort, but are affected by injuries.&#10;&#10;A big factor in the game is Influence. Teams are rated for run and pass Influence, which is affected throughout the game. A team gaining Influence (and both teams can on a play), increases their chance of affecting the play. There is a quick bout of suspense / anticipation as every play quickly develops to the final result.&#10; The game plays using a combination of Dice, Game Action Cards, and Results Cards (random numbers are on the Results Cards for those who don&rsquo;t want to use dice). There are no separate charts for looking up results, it's all right there on either the Team Charts or the Cards.&#10;&#10;You choose if you want to coach either or both Offenses and or Defenses or let the Solitaire Charts call all the Plays, or you can use the Quick Play Rules where you only have to worry about the Offenses, or you can also let the Solitaire Charts make the decisions. A standard game takes approximately two hours to play, while the quick play option reduces time by forty minutes. The quick play rules use the same charts as the standard game making it easy to move between the two in case of a blowout.&#10;&#10;A spreadsheet (Excel or Numbers) is included so you can create and print your own Team Chart. This allows you to recreate past season, or play along with any current season.&#10;&#10;As in any real football game, weather plays a role. Quick reference cards are used for wind, rain, snow, or combinations of each.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game can start!&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player chooses a player to fight, then flips a card from their pile onto the visible discard pile owned by that player. At this moment, each player concerned has to do very quickly the action of their card:&#10;&#10;&bull; If the card shows Banana, grab the banana and hit the opponent's head.&#10;&bull; If the card shows Coconuts, grab the coconuts and defend against the opponent's banana attack!&#10;&bull; If both cards show the same picture, every player should shout &quot;Ukiki&quot;. The fastest player takes &quot;starting player&quot;.&#10;&#10;When one of the players plays their last card and wins the fight, they win the game! If they don't win this fight, all the other players give them one card each face down and they have to continue to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player then flips the top card of the deck to the table and captures with that if possible. Cards which don't capture stay on the table.&#10;&#10;The game continues until all cards have been captured - with some unlikely exceptions, the last card flipped will always capture the one remaining card.&#10;&#10;Players score their captured cards: red 2-8 are face value, red 9-K are 10 points each, red aces are 20. Black cards are worthless, except: with 3 or 4 players, the ace of spades is worth 30; with 4 players the ace of clubs is worth 40. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It is possible to play in competitive or cooperative mode.&#10;&#10;In the competitive version each player takes turns in the role of host and secretly assigns the identities to 5 unknown people, choosing among the 8 available. The other players bet on the identity of the current unknown, also using the available clues.&#10;Who guesses gains the value of the unknown, but if everyone has made a mistake, the host loses the value of the unknown. The host, therefore, must be careful to choose an identity that is neither too easy, otherwise all others earn money, not too difficult, not to lose them himself.&#10;After having unveiled the identities of the 5 unknowns, the proof of the mysterious relative takes place: the host draws another unknown and chooses which of the 5 initial unknowns is his relative, also assigning clues to the degree of kinship and the 2 unknowns to be excluded. Who misses the mysterious relative loses 50.000 &euro;: also in this case the host must be careful because if nobody guesses, he will lose 50.000 &euro;. After everyone has played the role of the host, whoever has the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;In the cooperative version all the players collaborate to earn as much as possible. Contrary to the previous mode, the host must try to help the players as much as possible.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based in the popular TV program, Pechino Express is a game in which the players have to travel all over the world to reach their destinations as quickly as possible: to do it they need to use the means of transport, collect food on the map, use bonuses at your disposal and answer to some questions about the visited places.&#10;&#10;During his turn, the player can take 2 means of transport (choosing between the face up cards or drawing them from the deck) or traveling to a nearby destination. To travel, you must play a number of cards equal to the number of small circles present along the link. Based on the played cards, the player will advance his disk on the timeline path. It takes less time to play cards with the same number or the same color. On each destination there is a food that is taken by the first player to reach it, so the players must also be quick in anticipating the opponents' moves. When a player reaches a goal destination, he has the right to take one extra food and, if he correctly answers a question, he earns a bonus card that he can play in subsequent rounds.&#10;&#10;When a player has visited all his destinations, the game ends: the players receive bonuses and malus in terms of time based on the reached destinations and the taken foods. Foods have different values depending on the type: rice will give a fixed time saving, the sandwich in a growing way, the fruit based on who has more, while the fish will give a penalty to those who have less.&#10;The player who has spent less time wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Such knowledge is difficult to come by, even in a place like Arkham, but you do know of one witch whose story has been passed down for nearly two hundred years: Keziah, who escaped from the Salem Gaol back in the late 1600s and whose ghost still supposedly haunts the condemned Witch House in French Hill. With many questions and few leads, you have no choice but to chase the ghosts of Arkham&rsquo;s past.&#10;&#10;As a new cycle begins, you will need new tools to help you battle these unholy forces. To help you with this task, some of the new player cards in The Secret Name belong to more than one class. These cards, which can be identified by their golden hue and dual class icons in the upper right corner of the card, can be added to your investigator&rsquo;s deck if you have access to either of the classes detailed on the card. If, however, an investigator has limited access to one of the classes on a multiclass card, that card will occupy one of the investigator&rsquo;s limited slots, even if they have unlimited access to the other class detailed on the card. But with diverse uses and powerful effects, they make a worthy addition to any investigator&rsquo;s arsenal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The cards of the game has two faces, a map face and a clue face. The game is played in 2 phases.&#10;&#10;In the map phase, you play cards either as map cards to an island or as clue cards to your hand. The map cards tell you the terrain of island and the clue cards tell you where the treasures are in relation to the terrain. You may only play two of your cards as clue cards so choose them wisely!&#10;&#10;You also play 1 pirate flag to serve as a starting point. The later you play it, the sooner you get to start the next phase!&#10;&#10;In the treasure phase, you take turns to move from any pirate flag. If you find a map card that matches any of your clue cards, you exchange the clue card with the map card and take 1 treasure. But hurry, other pirates may beat you to the treasure!&#10;&#10;The game ends when a round is completed without any found treasures. The winner is the pirate who finds the most treasures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Over the time of history, tribes of different peoples move across the Earth. They found settlements, establish foreign relations and develop civilizations. Each people shapes its unique civilization and develops its unique abilities. Eventually they will all meet and their meetings will tell which civilization that is destined to stand the test of time.&#10;&#10;There are six victory conditions linked to the six civilization traits. Culture victory is won by placing all your culture tokens, Economic victory by collecting one of each resource, Military victory by placing all your tribes etc.&#10;&#10;The game is played on modular map where new areas are added and merged as your civilization grows and expands.&#10;&#10;Each turn you engage one tribe only. A tribe may either produce resources in its area or spend civilization points to take one of six civilization actions. Certain development cards improve certain actions.&#10;&#10;1. Civics lets you build settlements or activate all tribes in a settlement in a turn.&#10;2. Culture lets you place culture tokens, which give discounts on civilization points.&#10;3. Economy lets you exchange resources with adjacent peoples to collect more valuable sets.&#10;4. Military lets you attack adjacent peoples to plunder their resources.&#10;5. Religion lets you place religion tokens, which give discounts on development cards.&#10;6. Science lets your tribes take actions in areas further away from their own areas.&#10;&#10;When all tribes are engaged (but not before!), you must disengage them with a Revolution action. This is also the action where you grow your population and acquire civilization points and development cards. This also serves as a catch-up mechanic, since larger civilizations gets more productive actions but have to wait longer for the next Revolution action.&#10;&#10;In Peoples, you are faced with tough tactical and strategic questions. Which civilization traits do you prioritize to achieve your goals? Which development cards do you acquire to adapt to the changing conditions? Which civilizations do you cooperate with and which do you compete with? The history will judge whether you answered the questions right or wrong.&#10;&#10;",
