    "Description": "The expansion adds an extra step to the game: in order to exhibit precious artefacts in their Museums, our Curators will now need to send their agents out into the world to bring them back first!&#10;&#10;Players will have to choose which Continents to send their archaeologists to carefully, as funding expeditions doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. However, if you don&rsquo;t have any agents present, you can&rsquo;t bring objects back from that Continent ! Unless of course, you can convince one of your competitor&rsquo;s staff to lend a hand&hellip;&#10;&#10;So how does it work ? The expansion&rsquo;s board has spaces for each Continent, on which you can place your agent meeples to symbolize expeditions that you are sending out. Each player starts with one agent that they can place on any Continent they wish for free. Once you have an agent on site, you can bring objects back from that Continent as normal during the Exploration phase. If you have no agent on a particular Continent, but another player does, you can pay them 1 Prestige point to use their staff to do the work for you. If there are no agents present on that Continent, then you can&rsquo;t bring anything back at all !&#10;&#10;You can also pay extra to send additional archaeologists to a given Continent. If you do so, you gain additional bonuses, such as extra Prestige points when you draw a card. Each additional agent you send out to the same Continent costs more than the last. However, if you are the first to develop a full network of 3 agents, you gain a considerable bonus ! The second player to do so also gets a (smaller) bonus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Packaged inside are several expansions that are not contained in the retail release:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Crystal Skulls expansion, which adds 12 Crystal Skull cards which can be shuffled into the artifacts and when collected can either be played as a regular artifact or can be sold to a special 'Crystal Skull Collector' for many points.&#10;     The Assistants, each giving a different set-up and a unique ability.&#10;     The League of Extraordinary Explorers, double sized cards that can be purchased for 8 prestige points and exposed in the Main Gallery, these cards also have a unique ability.&#10;     The Solo mode.&#10;     Discard Tiles, for placing cards in a player's storage.&#10;     Extra Cards: 5 Expert cards, 3 Favour cards, 4 Headline cards, 12 Patron cards &#10;&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;It&rsquo;s the turn of the 20th century, the golden age of museums. As interest in and accessibility of museums grew exponentially, many institutions underwent an intense period of expansion on both an intellectual and physical level, searching to grow their collections for profit and science.&#10;&#10;You play as a curator of one such museum and it&rsquo;s your job to build the biggest, most coherent collection that you can in this game of collection and bartering featuring over 300 individual illustrations by Vincent Dutrait and authentic architectural facts. But it&rsquo;s no simple task!&#10;&#10;Each player in Museum has a small collection of relics to get them started, after which, they will have to send explorers around the world to uncover others. These relics each have a value which is either the cost to add them to your museum, or how much they contribute towards adding other relics to your museum. &ldquo;Spent&rdquo; Relics are added to your reserve. You can withdraw them from it by exchanging them for an equal amount of items however your opponents also has access to your reserve!&#10;&#10;During the game you will be required to assemble different collections. These can be from different categories (war, agriculture, architecture, etc) or periods (Ancient Egypt, Rome, Aztec, etc). Patron cards will give you bonus cards for amassing certain collections. Explorer cards will allow you to hire famous archeologists to confer bonuses to your museum and event cards will provide you with some game changing circumstances that you&rsquo;ll have to work around, based on historical events!&#10;&#10;All these different elements make compiling your collection an interesting and sometimes tricky experience! At the end of the game points are scored based on collections and their value and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Our intrepid archaeologists have stumbled upon lost relics infused with the power of 6 Old Ones (one for each Domain in the game). These artefacts will now be corrupting your continent decks and have a chance to appear as cards are drawn. On top of their standard value and a domain, each object has a power that varies depending on which god it&rsquo;s dedicated to. You can use these powers to bolster your museum's Domain Collections or hamper your rivals.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s not all however. Possessing these relics will cause you to earn &ldquo;Occult&rdquo; points. The player with the most Occult points at the end of game will score bonus victory points. On top of that, as soon as you gain 6 Occult points, you get to draw a &ldquo;Disciple of the Occult&rdquo; secret objective card (much like your Patron card) which will give you a chance to score even more points at the end of the game! Sounds good right? But beware, the Old One&rsquo;s power comes at a price&hellip;&#10;&#10;Playing the most powerful relics of a value of 5 will attract the eye of the terrifying beings that linger behind the veil of reality, with calamitous effects for your museum. These cards act as a sort of double-edged sword. Using Dagon's most powerful relic for example will flood your opponents' galleries, rending parts of them unusable. However, the Old One will return to take his due, and some of your gallery space will also disappear into the depths...&#10;&#10;The expansion contains over 40 new components, including object, character, Notoriety and Event cards as well as some different effects tokens, all contained within its own expansion box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player commands a band of three characters that fight each other in a vicious battle to the last drop of blood. Players control their characters on the board by playing cards from their unique decks of cards. Each faction has its own deck, character abilities, playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses that must be used strategically in order to defeat its opponents.  Fighting in the game is performed by using custom fencing stance dice secretly chosen by each of the opponents, aiming to outsmart each other by choosing the more advantageous fencing style. Play the right cards, move your characters to the best positions on the board, use your opponent's weakness to your advantage, chose the advantageous fencing style, and claim your victory with SABER AND BLOOD.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is distributed for free, and anyone who is interested in playing it is allowed to make a copy for themselves and their friends.&#10;&#10;In Cults of Dagon players control groups groups of 5 cultists traveling around the world to seek the knowledge and tools to summon the sea god Dagon. The tricky part is that too much knowledge may lead them to insanity, reducing their effectiveness for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn 6 cards are drawn from a deck of artifact cards. Each card represents a type of artifact (book, map, dagger, etc) and has a numerical value between 1 and 6. Players alternate placing their cultists on the cards. They cannot place cultists where they already have a presence, and must outbid by at least one the player with majority on an occupied card.&#10;&#10;Once all cultists have been assigned, each card goes to the player with majority. The cards are arranged in sets (books with books, etc), and if the numerical value of a set reaches or exceeds the Insanity Value for that game, a cultist of that player goes insane and is removed from the game. The set that went bust is turned face down.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the deck runs out of cards or a player loses 3 cultists. Players score the value of their face up cards. Each face down set is worth the Insanity Value of the game, regardless of card values.&#10;Highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game contains two mini expansions: Dark Visions, and Devious Plots.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You conquer a constellation when you get your colored discs on more than have the number of stars in the constellation.&#10;&#10;Play takes place on a 34&quot; x 22&quot; mat with images of the constellations.  Players roll dice to move their pieces around the track on the outside.  You either stop on spaces with color\\star combinations that allow you to put a marker on a star or stars in a constellation or you land on spaces that allow you to take a card and follow the instructions on the card.&#10;&#10;Two other variations of game play include The Game of Polaris (The North Star) in which players start in a different constellation and move towards Polaris.  Final variations include a Fast Game Variation which allows you to just conquer stars based on dice throw instead of moving around the track on the game mat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

On one side, an army of the undead: former friends and family members who have succumbed to the zombie virus &mdash; decaying flesh and an insatiable appetite for destruction are all that remain. On the other side, a magic squad of unicorns: pixie dust and rainbow farts, their mythical horns as deadly as their enchanting glare. Which side will you fight for? Which will fight against you?&#10;&#10;Unicorns &amp; Zombies is a turn-based card game for 2-4 players which pits &mdash; you guessed it &mdash;unicorns against zombies. Players draw a trio of cards &mdash; weapons, gear, or action &mdash; and equip their fighter in the hopes of taking out the opposing teammate(s). Some cards can make your fighter nearly invincible. Others can make you want to flip the table over and rage-quit. You won&rsquo;t though, because winning is more important than keeping friends. In groups of 3 or more, the fighter you pull is completely random, so your love of unicorns could be totally useless when you&rsquo;re forced to fight as a zombie. And sometimes, you&rsquo;re the only fighter of your kind on the table, so you&rsquo;ll need to be strategic AF to win the round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Colorless-type Pok&eacute;mon and Trainer cards could be found in all half decks.&#10;&#10;The 30 cards in each booster pack consisted of: 11 energy cards, 11 character cards, 6 trainer cards (2 of which were TMs), 1 holo character card, and 1 holo special energy card.&#10;&#10;Wizards of the Coast officially stated that they had no plans to release the VS set, primarily because they had competitive play in mind. Some cards from this expansion were still released in English in the Tyranitar Half Deck; however, these cards were produced by MEDIAFACTORY and received a limited release to competitors of the 2001 Tropical Mega Battle. Despite this statement, Pok&eacute;mon USA localized the Generation IV equivalent, Pok&eacute;mon SP when they debuted in the Platinum expansion.&#10;&#10;-- summary obtained from:  https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_VS_(TCG)&#10;&#10;",

If that wasn't enough, the ceiling is collapsing and giant blocks of stone are coming down to crush you.&#10;&#10;Players will have to be quick and smart about making strategic decisions all while trying to survive!

    "Description": "This special Artifact card was designed to work in original Chrononauts, but you can use it in EAC by house rule agreement before the games starts.&#10;&#10;When used with EAC, since the TimeLine is totally different, it is freely playable, and also counts as a dessert food item for 4 Missions.&#10;&#10;Text says:&#10;&quot;Cannot be played or stolen if [Hitler is alive]. Once in play, it can be discarded at any time and used as a Memo. Cannot be used to stop theft of cake with Get There First.&quot; (I.e. it can't be used up to prevent itself from being stolen)&#10;&#10;This card debuted as a promo card at Dragon*Con 2002, but was added to the original game during the 3rd printing.&#10;It was also available for purchase by itself from the Looney Labs webstore&#10;&#10;",

No Cards. No luck. Just pure strategy and choosing different team combinations.&#10;&#10;Every turn, the player progresses each of their unit's turn meter (by moving the respective cube along the ready track) until they have a unit ready to attack. Each Hero has special abilities and attacks, creating an interesting strategy to every team. Each ability has a value (either damage, heal or alter turn meter) that the player activates and chooses to target.&#10;&#10;Players win by defeating all of their opponents units.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, more than 2 players can fight in a free for all, where each player is out for themselves.&#10;&#10;Print and Play is available ahead of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign&#10;&#10;",
