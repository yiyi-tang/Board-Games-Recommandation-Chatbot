    "Description": "Basari: Das Kartenspiel keeps the fundamentals of Basari and its sister game Edel, Stein &amp; Reich.&#10;&#10;Every round in Basari: Das Kartenspiel, each player is dealt a bazaar card that shows a number of gemstones, victory points, and workers. Players simultaneously choose their action for that turn, which is one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw an additional bazaar card to get more workers&#10;     Score VPs shown on the bazaar card they received this turn&#10;     Take the gems shown on the bazaar card they received this turn&#10;&#10;&#10;If only one player chooses a specific action, she takes that action. If exactly two players choose the same action, those players will barter for that action: offering increasingly valuable gems to one another for that action. One of the players will take the gems offered, the other player will take the action. If three or more players choose the same action, the action is forfeited.&#10;&#10;Players keep all the cards they are dealt, and the round ends if one or more players have 15 workers on their cards after all negotiations and actions have been completed. Each player with 15 or more workers scores 12 VPs. The player(s) with the most gems of each color score additional VPs, but then must return some of their gems back to the bank.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps their leftover gems, the cards are shuffled together, and a new round starts.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The rules include detailed treatment of movement, terrain, search and destroy operations, special operations, firepower, airmobility, riverines, brigade-level formations, limited intelligence, and auxiliary units in each scenario.&quot;&#10;That's the blurb from the back of the original Victory Games edition of the game.&#10;&#10;There are several small scenarios and a couple of campaign games. Each year is divided into four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter), and each season has two turns (so, roughly 6 weeks per turn). The map scale is roughly 6 miles per hex and units are, generally, battalions or regiments. During the operational phase, players take turns (who gets to operate is determined by the NLF player) conducting operations with their units to destroy the enemy, clear the roads, take towns and cities, or just reposition units. In the Campaign Game, during Seasonal Interphases, each player decides whether and how many additional units and/or resources to bring in to the fight. The game features hidden VC units, airmobility, riverines, national morale, pacification, ARVN effectiveness, and many other nuances that allow the player to grasp the some of the experience of what it might have been like to conduct the war in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;An updated reimplementation of the Victory Games' classic.&#10;This edition changes some of the rules as well as clarifications.

If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",

The vehicles and infantry have dials similar to Mage Knight figures, with some new symbols to indicate new game mechanics.  Vehicles have long bases, like the mounted units.   Battlemechs use larger dials and include a heat dial which modifies three of the stats as the mech performs more actions.  The final result, while similar to Mage Knight is much more, using the simple action based system and dials, and bringing a new form of wargaming to the table.&#10;&#10;",

By August 3rd, Germany had declared war on both Russia and France and was preparing to invade France through neutral Belgium.&#10;&#10;In Brave Little Belgium, you assume the role of either the Germans or the Allies (Belgians, French, and British) at the start of World War I.  As the Germans, can you quickly smash through Belgium without committing too many atrocities? As the Allies, can you slow down the German advance and halt their plans to capture France?&#10;&#10;This quick-playing wargame uses a point to point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the beginning of World War I on the western front.  The game takes place over the period of time between August 4 and August 27, 1914.  Each turn represents three days. In each turn, you pull chits representing the different generals and armies in the battle.  A pulled chit allows you to move that army and battle opposing armies.  Random event chits are also included and when you pull and activate them, you can use them to help you or hurt the other player.&#10;&#10;If you are the German player, you must try to get through Belgium as quickly as possible while also destroying the two major forts at Liege and Namur.  If you can do so quicker than it historically occurred, you win the game.  Anything less than this is a draw or a win for the Allies.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland May 10 to 14, 1940, simulates the German May, 1940 capture of Rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag).&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1940, the German military machine turned west to convert the Phoney War into a real one. Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.&#10;&#10;In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.&#10;&#10;The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers. Following last year's smash hit of Drive on Paris, Al Wambold returns to show this under-represented battle in great detail, much of which, from original Dutch records...and, yes, Dutch researchers were used to confirm the accuracy of the map!&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 8 hours&#10;Hex: 0.6 miles / 1 Km&#10;Units: Platoon &amp; Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook&#10;One 16-page Fallschirmjaeger specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-12 hours&#10;&#10;",

It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.&#10;&#10;",

You will have to open and close different parts of the map in search of the Impossible Triangle that will allow you to escape the maze. You can go under bridges, climb up ladders and run around in circles in the maze and in your own head until the exit finally leads you to&hellip; the next map!&#10;&#10;Mazescape Ariadne places you in the ancient Crete of legend, where you must enter the famous labyrinth of Daedalus. You can rely solely on your wits to overcome the ordeals this box of maps provides, to reach the final challenge against the minotaur and help Ariadne escape. And when you have gotten out the first time, then you can dare to go back in and find all the hidden treasures that exist in the accursed maze.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs.&#10;&#10;At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry.&#10;&#10;The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Aliens: This Time it's War is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive melees. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco, but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. No icons are used.&#10;&#10;Aliens: This Time it's War can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Colonial Marine player wins if she manages to &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit&quot;.&#10;     The Colonial Marine player wins if she reaches and survives the Sulaco Loading Bay battle.&#10;     The Alien player wins if Ripley and all the Colonial Marines are either killed or cocooned.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.&#10;&#10;No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.&#10;&#10;Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!&#10;&#10;With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Eastern Front&quot; is a reprint of the original &quot;Panzer Grenadier&quot; game by Avalanche Press.  However, it's much more than just a reprint, with the game expanded noticeably and a new revision of the rules, taking lessons learned throughout the series.  Art has also seen a major update, along with a number of other improvements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The new maps will use the style Terry Moore Strickland showed so well with Beyond Normandy. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     There&rsquo;s twice as much playing area from which to choose, as there has been a move from four to eight maps&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;      In addition to infantry, the Germans also now have two full squadrons of cavalry. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A new concept is added for the first time to the series, the vehicles known as prime movers. These are tracked or semi-tracked vehicles like the Soviet Komsomolets or the German SdKfz-7. They have better performance off the road than the game&rsquo;s standard trucks, but cannot carry infantry. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Soviets received a much greater overhaul than the Germans. New artillery pieces include the 107 mm cannon and 76.2 mm mountain gun. A new &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; type of infantry is available, anti-tank rifle platoons. There are two new flavors of armored car: the FAI and Ba6 in addition to the Ba10m found in the first edition. The stable of tanks is vast.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Romanian army is now represented&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     All 50 scenarios from the original Panzer Grenadier have been included, as well as 62 new scenarios, for a total of 112.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Grenadier&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Arctic Front: Finland's War, 1939-1944 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book: Deluxe Edition&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Blue Division&#10;    Campaigns & Commanders: War in the East, 1939-1945 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Campaign Book&#10;    Edelweiss: A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book&#10;    First Axis: Slovakia at War 1939-1945 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book&#10;    Fronte Russo: A Panzer Grenadier Expansion Book&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves &#226;&#128;&#147; Lithuania's Army&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: North Wind&#10;    Red Warriors&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: War on the Equator&#10;    White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, they won't always listen. Before collecting resources, you have to drop all the workers in that resource's space through &quot;The Passage&quot;, a three-dimensional, mountain shaped tower where they will tumble and get stuck, leaving only a few to get out and actually collect that resource. The rest will have to wait to be knocked loose on a future turn.&#10;&#10;So if you send a worker to the forest to collect wood and berries, they might end up in the mountains collecting herbs, on the plains hunting for fur, or in the &quot;Love Tent&quot; making...your population larger. They might also bring some predators out of The Passage with them &mdash; or not come back at all.&#10;&#10;Players use the resources their workers end up with to arm their workers with spears and drums, to build a larger cave, or to create an invention, which earns victory points for their tribe. The first player to have 10 victory points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The board is 33 percent larger than 1822, has 30 private companies, and 30 minor companies. The game has 10 public companies including the Canadian Pacific Railway that starts on both the east and west sides of the board.&#10;&#10;The game consists of an alternating series of stock rounds and operating rounds. Initially, there is one operating round between each stock round, and then once the first 2-train is bought, two operating rounds between each stock round.  The final set of operating rounds has three rounds.&#10;&#10;In stock rounds, players act as investors, buying and selling shares in the various companies. The player with the most shares in each company is the company&rsquo;s director and decides all actions that the company takes in the operating round.&#10;&#10;In operating rounds, players, as company directors, run the various companies that they control. They choose whether to build track, place station tokens, which trains to run on which routes, whether to pay or withhold dividends and whether to invest in more trains, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:&#10;Immediately, if the first stock round ends with nothing sold.&#10;&#10;At the end of the operating round in which a company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which a major company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which the bank runs out of money.  The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&#10;&#10;When the bank runs out of money in an OR, complete the pair of ORs and then run one additional OR (for a total of 3 ORs in the final set). The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s total wealth is the value of their stock, at current prices, plus cash on hand.

    "Description": "Established in 1810, Circleville, Ohio derives its name from the circular portion of a large Hopewell earthwork upon which it was built. The Circleville earthworks, as described in 1772, comprised an 1,100-foot diameter circle connected to a 900-foot square. Town director Daniel Dreisbach plotted the town directly atop the earthworks, integrating the town plan into the landscape. An octagonal courthouse stood directly in the center of the circular road system in the center of town.&#10;&#10;To the dismay of Dreisbach, however, the people of Circleville hated the circular roads. People complained that the round roads forced everyone to build on oddly-shaped lots and caused confusion. By the mid-1830s, enough dissatisfaction arose with Circleville's unique radial concentric road layout that the townsfolk petitioned the State Assembly to change it.&#10;&#10;The Circleville Squaring Company, authorized in 1837, undertook a project to convert the &quot;peculiar&quot; town plan into a more conventional grid. Circleville occupies a unique place in the history of American town planning as one of the earliest examples of urban redevelopment in the United States.&#10;&#10;In Squaring Circleville, you work for the Circleville Squaring Company to manage the process of deconstructing and reconstructing the town of Circleville. You will move around the courthouse rondel getting permits to perform work, such as deconstructing and constructing roads and demolishing and building structures.&#10;&#10;As the game proceeds, you become more experienced and are able to do an amazing amount of work in the same amount of time. In the end, only one player will be recognized as the best at &quot;squaring the circle&quot; and wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel captures the spirit of Qwixx &mdash; with players still trying to cross off numbers in four colored rows as best they can &mdash; but this game uses cards instead of dice, allowing for more tactics and planning as you draft and play a hand of cards.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, in Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.&#10;&#10;If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.&#10;&#10;When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck. A player determines the color of this card only when playing it on her turn.&#10;&#10;",

The players collectively have control in this. Will you sell your goods, or will your fresh products end up in your storage to be used in future rounds? Smart merchants profit from opportunities in the market &mdash; but this also creates new opportunities for the farmers who receive income when other players buy their goods.&#10;&#10;Interaction in markets, production, and player sequence providing interesting dilemmas for the players. Some farmers expand their lands with the earnings. Others develop smart skills to bypass the markets or to get victory points in different ways. It is also possible to create a monopoly or at least a scarcity of goods. Indeed this game has some very interesting market elements, but players who follow a one-sided strategy have little chance of being victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In New Haven, set in colonial New England, players must develop the riches of the land and build a thriving settlement. Players place tiles strategically to a shared game board to cut timber, quarry stone, plant fields of wheat, and fill pastures with fat sheep. Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!&#10;&#10;New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.&#10;&#10;This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.&#10;&#10;Once a player is done building, any value he hasn't used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you'll be rewarded with additional tokens.&#10;&#10;The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.&#10;&#10;New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.&#10;&#10;",

However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&#10;&#10;",

A player is Garibaldi in hiding, the others are the Austrian patrols hunting him. Garibaldi wins if he succeeds in reaching the safe point and can run away, otherwise the Austrian patrols win if they catch Garibaldi.&#10;&#10;In turns, using the cards, it's possible to move on the gameboard, a big-sized board that reproduces accurately a map of the territory at that time. The player who controls Garibaldi, with the help of a special screen, makes his moves secretly, while the other players have to work together to stop the moves of the escaper, trying to find him.&#10;&#10;Garibaldi: La Trafila is a game of deduction and bluff, recommended for all families: the rules are simple, but the gameplay stimulates reasoning and cooperation, offering the possibility for expert players to adopt more refined strategies.&#10;&#10;",

If the card played is equal to or lower than the value of the top landscape card of the same type, then the player adds the values of all landscape cards of this type, then moves her lemming up to this many spaces, crossing grassland and the depicted landscape type freely. If the card is higher than the top card of the depicted landscape type, then discard all cards of this type and start a new pile.

They can be bought and sold at the gem exchange, shady traders are always willing to engage in a little wheeling and dealing, and then you can use the gems to claim valuable mining rights, artifacts and jewellery. Who will become the most successful gem trading mogul?&#10;&#10;Zavandor is a fantasy setting which revolves around a capitalist economy based on trading in gems - sapphires, rubies, mystical gems etc. Other games in the family include Mines of Zavandor, and The Scepter of Zavandor.&#10;&#10;Gnomes of Zavandor features two central boards. The first is a grid with markers indicating the current price of each of the gem types, and also indicating whether the price is going to go up or down next turn. Gems can be bought (or sold) for cash in the first phase of each turn. Buying gems makes them more valuable in subsequent turns; selling them reduces their value, and this is reflected on the grid. These gems can be used to buy tiles from the second board, a star-shaped arena featuring &quot;mining rights&quot; tiles positioned randomly around it. The position on the board indicates the cost to purchase these mining rights; the cost will be a mixed selection of coloured gems. At the end of each turn, players gain new gems according to the mining rights they have acquired and this affects the central economy, generally reducing the value of the relevant gems when they are purchased for hard cash, in future rounds.&#10;&#10;The initial phase of the turn involves buying gems, selling gems, taking gold, trading with the central supply, and purchasing cards and tokens (with gems rather than cash). The items available for purchase include equipment improving your efficiency, jewels providing victory points, and mining rights. The second phase of the turn involves mining for new gems. Each player takes the gems they are allowed according to their mining rights. At the end of each turn, the market values are adjusted according to the actions which have occurred; the price of the available equipment is discounted (this rule is optional); and another area of the star-shaped board becomes accessible with more mining-rights available to purchase in the next round.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has reached a victory-point target, dependent on the number of players in the game. Victory points are achieved by purchasing mining-rights, equipment, and most significantly (but also most expensively) jewellery.&#10;&#10;",

Stalin's War will test both player's operational skills to the limit.&#10;&#10;But there is more to Stalin's War than directing your forces on the map. Both sides have their own deck of 55 cards, needed to launch offensive operations, mobilize their forces, replace losses, introduce new weapons, and deal with the larger strategic context of a World at War. Card Events include combat leaders, weapons (from German Tiger Tanks to patriotic Soviet mice nibbling the electrical wiring of the panzers), the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Manstein's Backhand Blow, Stalin's and Hitler's meddling, the Battle of the Bulge, and much more. Stalin's War allows players to combine the best of WWII operational play with the strategic depth and tactical chrome of a card driven design. A genuine new look the the most important theater of WWII, this is a game you want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;(Taken from rear of the game box)&#10;&#10;Scenarios &#10;In addition to the full campaign game, a shorter tournament scenario is included that comprises 8 game turns and covers the time period of June 1941 through to Winter 1943.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Outburst of laughter guaranteed with Chicken Chicken, a fast, original and clever card game first released as Poule Poule that will make you love &mdash; or hate &mdash; omelets!&#10;&#10;The principle of Chicken Chicken is very simple: egg cards, hen cards, fox cards are stacked randomly, the last card hiding the others. As soon as you count five eggs in the pile, be the first to hit the pile to win one point! You must win three points to win the game. But, be careful not forget that when a hen passes by and there is an egg in the pile, the hen cannot help sitting on an egg, which means that egg disappears! And if a fox passes by and a hen is sitting, the fox hunts the hen and the egg comes back! Otherwise it would be too simple! Not to mention the intervention of the other characters in the story...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Originating in Luebeck, the Hanseatic Trade League is formed, long-distance traders join forces and thereby create unprecedented wealth in northern Europe. There are many opportunities for young merchants to gain power and influence. Nevertheless, only few have the chance to be elected to the most influential position and thus lead the Hanseatic Trade League as Aelderman.&#10;&#10;Aelderman is a competitive Euro-Game for 2-4 players. You embody an ambitious merchant in the medieval Hanseatic League and fight for your place at the top of the trade alliance! Through lucrative trading with other Hanseatic cities, you increase your wealth and gain more and more influence in the entire region of the North and Baltic Sea. Meanwhile, you contribute to the development of the flourishing city of Luebeck by commissioning useful buildings. Try to secure important privileges during the Hanseatic Convention in the Council Hall before your opponents take them away from you.&#10;&#10;Use your limited action points wisely to trade goods and gain wealth. But money alone will not be enough to win this strategic Euro-Game. Rather you must secure as many victory points in the form of council votes as possible through influence majorities on the sea map, your reputation in the city of Luebeck and through various privileges and luxury goods to become Aelderman and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Oblivious of the climatic, technological and political changes inflicted by more than 20 years of nuclear winter, they are about to face the mysterious Black Hand - elusive, abhorrent masters of the wastes, and the combined might of the modern, highly mechanized and versatile NATO alliance.&#10;&#10;Units represent platoons of vehicles like T64 or King Tiger tanks, infantry, or helicopters. The platoons are grouped into formations and lead by a commander. The formations are activated by chit draw, and better-trained, better-led units can activate more than once in a turn, moving, shooting, and fighting in each activation. On the flip side of a coin, there is no guarantee that a formation will activate even once.&#10;&#10;This game was originally released as the DTP game Nuklear Winter '78.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Normandy: The Beginning of the End is a standalone game in the War Storms series. Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the D-Day on the American beaches at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.&#10;&#10;Normandy: The Beginning of the End, while utilizing &quot;Paths to Hell&quot; standard rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Landings&#10;     Battalion officers&#10;     Paratroopers rules&#10;     Recon rules&#10;     Amphibious Tanks&#10;     Waffen SS&#10;     Fallschirmj&auml;ger&#10;     Free French troops&#10;&#10;&#10;One A4 chart with many overlays including a whole beach making a large map. Normandy: The Beginning of the End has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.&#10;&#10;Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit officers to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units.&#10;&#10;Representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.&#10;&#10;Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase&#10;&#10;The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other mopboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios. Each map hex represents a distance of approximately 150 to 200 metres.&#10;&#10;The following components are included in this game:&#10;&bull; 2 3/4&rdquo; countersheets with German/American and Free French vehicles (AFV and transports) and weapon units (Mortars, MG, AT, AA guns, infantry guns, artillery,&hellip;).&#10;&bull; 2 5/8&rdquo; countersheets with German/American and Free French troops and officers.&#10;&bull; 1 5/8&rdquo; countersheet with common markers.&#10;&bull; 4 Isomorphic mapboards.&#10;&bull; 8 Overlays.&#10;&bull; 3 Charts &amp; Tables cards.&#10;&bull; 2 Battalion Battle Stress Charts&#10;&bull; 17 scenarios.&#10;&bull; 1 Standard rulebook.&#10;&bull; 1 Exclusive rules booklet.&#10;&bull; 2 Six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the USMC player will activate one of his battalions (there are 8 in the game).  During it's activation it can move, attack, and attempt to regroup.  The USMC player further has a 3 card hand (out of a deck of 30 cards) that gives additional resources to the player (naval support, air support, engineers, tanks, etc).  The USMC player can play 1 card during their turn and 1 card during the Japanese turn.&#10;&#10;As a battalion is activated it reduces its cohesion (reflecting wear and tear, exhaustion).  Battalions are further reduced in cohesion due to Japanese attacks and the marines &quot;pushing their attacks&quot;.&#10;&#10;After the USMC player finishes their activation, the Japanese turn begins with the flip of a card.  From this the USMC player will face fire attacks, banzai attacks, bunkers, cross fires, infiltration, and more.  The card engine will ensure an ever changing game and no two will play the same.&#10;&#10;The game will give the historical starting invasion site, however, we have included the alternate &quot;south beach&quot; landing possibility, that the Japanese had expected and prepared.  &#10;Victory is achieved by taking the island as quickly as possible while minimizing casualties.  This was the first invasion of the US island hopping strategy and high losses or a prolonged fight could have led to a cancellation of the island hopping campaign.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunder in the Ozarks is a two-player wargame about The Battle of Pea Ridge, which was a critical engagement in the American Civil War fought on March 8th and 9th, 1862 between the Confederate Army of the West under Major General Earl Van Dorn and the Federal Army of the Southwest under Brigadier General Samuel Curtis.&#10;&#10;In the winter of 1861, the Confederate army in Missouri, then commanded by Major General Sterling Price, had been chased back into the Boston Mountains of Arkansas. The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. &#10; Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.&#10;&#10;This is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games. The first game, Stonewall&rsquo;s Sword simulates the Battle of Cedar Mountain in 1862.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;RAN is the 12th volume in the &quot;Great Battles of History&quot; Series, and the second game on the battles of the Samurai (following GMTs Samurai: Warfare in the 16th Century Japan (Vol. V). RAN covers several of the less famous of the Sengoku Jidai, the Age of Warring States (more or less), in which powerful Daimyo - Japanese feudal lords - strove to both maintain and extend their power bases while seeking to attain the office of Shogun, the power behind the throne of the Emperor.&#10;&#10;RAN simulates the highly personal form of warfare developed by the Japanese samurai, wherein formal battles played out almost as backdrops to individual feats of courage, bravery and devotion much of it outstanding, some of it rather foolhardy, all of it very Homeric. Although political and tactical victory was the bottom line, collecting the severed heads of enemy samurai reigned a very close second in importance. In terms of tactics, this was, as in Europe, the Dawn of Modern Warfare, with the introduction of guns - arquebuses - by the Portuguese. Even with the revelatory effect of musketry, Japanese battles were still pretty much a swirling, non-linear affair.&#10;&#10;RAN, the name the famous Japanese film director, Kurosawa, chose for his samurai version of King Lear, roughly means &ldquo;Chaos.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Battles of RAN (all battles are one-half map, except for Tennoji):&#10;&#10;&#10;    MIMASETOGE (6 October 1569): The Takeda are trying to return to their castle base, and the Hojo are trying to intercept and ambush them with twice their number. A startling Takeda victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    MIMIGAWA (11 November 1578) Interrupted while besieging Takajpo Castle, the Otomi retreat into the woods, then burst out to attack the Shimazu relief force, only to be outwitted by clever Shimazu tactics.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    NAGAKUTE (17 May 1582): Tokugawa vs Ikeda, in a nice, small battle (less than 10,000 men each). Set piece affair fought over very difficult terrain &hellip; mountains, rice paddies, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    NUNOBEYAMA (14 February 1570): The Amako vs The Mori&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    OKITANAWATE (24 March 1584): The Ryuzoji vs The Shimazu&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    SURIAGEHARA (5 June 1589): Date Masamune (and his 23,000 men) hold off an initially effective attack by Asahina Yosohiro's 16,000 man army on relatively flat terrain. Key use of reserves.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    TENNOJI (7 May 1615): One of the biggest battles of the era (and the only full map battle in the box). After Sekigahara, Hideyori, son of Hideysohi, challenges Tokugawa... the result is a battle with over 250,000 men and a swirling affair with lots of arriving reinforcements. &#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;    5 Countersheets&#10;    2 22 x 33 battle maps, backprinted&#10;    1 Battle Rules Book&#10;    1 Battle Scenario Book&#10;    5 Charts &amp; Tables Cards&#10;    2 Record sheets&#10;    1 ten-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

After three rounds, the person who has made the most money displaying animals wins.&#10;&#10;To play, roll the special animal dice to get a selection of animals to add to your zoo. Each animal has a unique way to earn you money: Kangaroos score by the square of their number, so if you want to score them, you should try to get a large group; lions are worth big bucks, but if you score lions, then only the lions score; camels are a decent $5 each, but they score zero if any lions are present; squirrels steal money from the other players; and moose score the most, but each moose must be paired with a squirrel in order to score.&#10;&#10;Penguins don't earn you money, but they get you penguin tokens. A penguin token can be used to add another die to your group, or to reroll as many of your dice as you wish. This makes it very valuable to start your turn with a fistful of penguins...&#10;&#10;The basic version is intended for casual family play and to teach gamers the faces of the dice.  If you are rating the game for a BGG audience, please play the advanced version before rating the game.&#10;&#10;",

As a viking chieftan you roll dice to harvest rare resources for your tribe. Then you scavenge and explore the worlds by drafting and playing cards and actions. Building temples in the different God-domains is an important goal to gain divine abilities and get access to more powerful spells. But beware, enemies can attack you with the weapons of the Gods. Defend yourself and use your resources and shields wisely. Fight and build with honor to receive the grace of the Gods. Which God? That depends on your playing style.

    "Description": "From the publisher: &quot;Since time immemorial, the Kindred - vampires - have stalked unseen by the mortal masses upon whom they prey. Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city - one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.&#10;&#10;Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie&rsquo;s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie&rsquo;s patronage. Who will be top ghost?&#10;&#10;The game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day Phase and a Night Phase.&#10;&#10;During the day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the night and survived will calm down from their twilight visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next night by buying more Terror Dice, Scare Tactics to improve their scaring and Spookie favours to give those extra little bonuses.&#10;&#10;During the night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their creepy tactics to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each turn in the children's game Maskenball der K&auml;fer, each player spins the spinner on the board. If the spinner points to one of the eight ladybugs, the player may move that ladybug to visit the others. Each ladybug piece has a magnet in its nose, and if the visiting ladybug &quot;likes&quot; the ladybug (i.e., is attracted to it), they may swap spots (each ladybug has five spots of one color), and she continues on to visit other ladybugs; if the ladybugs do not like each other, the turn is over. Once a ladybug has five spots of different colors, she is ready for the ball and taken out of play. The players win if all of the ladybugs are ready.&#10;&#10;If the spinner points to one of the smaller leaves, then the player doesn't get to move any ladybugs, but instead must advance the ants along the side of the board. If all seven of the ants are on board (and each takes two moves to get on-board), the players lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dark Venture is a retro, story-based, adventure card game where players construct a twisting narrative to explore a dystopian future with their heroes, completing quests to win the game.&#10;&#10;Pursue your destiny through the ravaged wilds of Darkgrange where magically-mutated creatures prowl the grounds of every seemingly abandoned building and stretch of dilapidated roadway.&#10;&#10;From writings found on the deceased body of the hero, Torgon the Hunter: &quot;We are the new rulers of the Earth and this is our struggle against one another. We venture into the darkness, the uncertainty, ambling through the ruins of progress every day. We live the repercussions of the events that spun civilization backwards while propelling the remaining inhabitants forwards along various inconceivable and diverse refractions. The world has unquestionably become a new, peculiar and merciless place.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players maintain a hand of LOCATION, ITEM and CHARACTER cards, playing them on their turn by spending ACTION POINTS. LOCATIONS are played and attached to the map, then descriptive story entries are read that set up actions to be triggered and decisions to be made. ITEMS, including weapons, magical artifacts, armor and potions, can be placed from a player's hand into their heroes inventory for them to use. Players may want to play other CHARACTERS from their hand to complete a quest or thwart an enemy.&#10;&#10;Competitive: A player's goal in the main COMPETITIVE game mode is to gain the MOST QUEST POINTS over the course of a day, 6 game rounds in a short game or 12 game rounds in a long game, tracked on a QUEST TRACK, which can take about 20-30 or 60-90 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Cooperative: In the COOPERATIVE mode, players work, fight, move and complete their quests together to each get a set number of quest points before the end of the day, in 6 or 12 game rounds.&#10;&#10;Solo: In the SOLO mode, players can choose to play a short game of 6 game rounds, attempting to get a set number of quest points before lunch, or a full game of 12 game rounds, attempting to get even more quest points before the end of the day.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Stifling Dark is a one-vs-many hidden-movement horror board game with an innovative line-of-sight mechanic for 2-5 players. One player takes the role of the adversary, whose goal is to prevent the other players (the investigators) from escaping through a variety of unique actions. As an investigator, your only goals are to survive and escape.&#10;&#10;Investigators move around the board in a point-to-point fashion using their base movement speed. They may sprint to move more quickly, but they need to keep an eye on their stamina so they don't become exhausted. Additionally, investigators can pick up and use items, lock and unlock doors, or use their flashlights to try and find the adversary. Meanwhile, the adversary is secretly moving around the board, trying to stop the investigators from escaping. There are a variety of investigators to choose from, each with their own special abilities. The adversary also has multiple attacks and abilities that change how you play the game.&#10;&#10;Will you fix the car and drive out, or will you override the gate and try to sneak out? The investigators will need to decide if they want to stick together to watch each other's backs, or split up to race towards the exit. Either way, they must move quickly - the longer the game takes, the more chances the adversary has to stop them!&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all of the investigators escape (meaning the investigators won) or the adversary achieves their win condition (which is different for each adversary).&#10;&#10;",
