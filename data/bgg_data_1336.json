The Empire faced long odds in 1453, but it had miraculously survived even worse odds before.

    "Description": "La Grande Guerre is a miniatures wargame designed for entire large battles of the age of Continental linear warfare during the 18th Century.&#10;&#10;The rules abstract details the brigade level into combat factors and modifiers. When brigade bases contact one another, the infantry/cavalry combat system combines all actions troops took within musket range of one another, including skirmishing, musketry, and charges, while artillery can also fight at a distance  Simple but accurate mechanics allow players to concentrate on command decisions and the direction of troops, including grand tactical movement of reserves, rather than wade through the minutia of battle or numerous or complicated rules.&#10;&#10;Players usually take the role of wing commanders, directing a few divisions, each of several brigades.  &#10;Many battles, such as Rossbach, can be played with one player per side. &#10;The game rewards historical formations and tactics, while allowing more gifted commanders to innovate within the capabilities of forces during the wars of Spanish and Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years War (in Europe). &#10;This game inflicts battlefield friction on the execution of command decisions. Each nation&rsquo;s troop types have historical characteristics that place them in the proper balance with the other forces of their era.&#10;&#10;These thoroughly playtested rules are written primarily for the Seven Years War, but have an intrinsic module for the War of Spanish Succession, with just enough adjustments to cover the differences in tactics and operation while keeping most of the same basic rules.  Further expansions may cover the Great Northern War.&#10;&#10;If players want to fight all of an 18th Century battle, rather than with some battalions or want to worry more about deployment, concentration of force, combined arms, and the commitment of reserves rather than where might skirmishers be, or when to change from column to line, La Grande Guerre is the game to play.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;1. Determine initiative.&#10;2. The army with initiative moves each brigade or battery until all selected units have moved.&#10;3. Resolve all active player combats. Conduct general risk tests.&#10;4. The reacting side moves.&#10;5. Resolve all combat for the reactive side. Conduct general risk tests.&#10;6. Check for victory conditions. Proceed to next cycle.&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s only one way to find out&hellip;&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered whether or not you can weather a huge, destructive storm or total infrastructure collapse using nothing more than your wits, an axe, a paracord bracelet, a bottle of vodka and a dog, then this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;The first main goal in Prepper is to build up a cupboard filled with everything you need to get through a crisis. While you&rsquo;re doing so, you advance around the board and pick up extra items and skills by testing your own prepping, survival and general knowledge and abilities, during a fun and challenging trivia round in which you&rsquo;ll answer questions and also interact with your surroundings and each other. By the end of the first round, you&rsquo;ll have a great prepper cupboard &ndash; packed with items that could range from a packet of painkillers to a domestic electricity generator. So far, so good. Right?&#10;&#10;Wrong. Prepper is a game of two halves. And in the second half, things really go south. You see, once you&rsquo;ve tested your knowledge and built up your prep store as best you can, disaster strikes. What this disaster is, you don&rsquo;t know for sure. It could be anything from getting lost in the forest to a total infrastructure collapse. And it&rsquo;s happening to you, right now, and you need to do something about it.&#10;&#10;A lot of people think they have the gumption needed to make it through a crisis. In Prepper, you get the chance to find out. And it&rsquo;s not just about having the right stuff in your cupboard. Far from it, in fact. It&rsquo;s also about having the skill to come up with creative solutions using only what you have at hand. It tests your ability to barter with your friends for the things you know you need right now &ndash; and which you&rsquo;re also going to have to convince them that they won&rsquo;t need any time soon. And, it measures your willingness to help others in their times of need &ndash; after all, one day you might need their help, too.&#10;&#10;But more than anything else, it&rsquo;s about using your wits and your kit to get through tough situations &ndash; which might range from a cut thumb or a power cut to the roof literally being torn off your house &ndash; while still, somehow, keeping it all about the LOLs.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ve got what it takes to play Prepper. In fact, you were born ready. Now all you have to do is prove it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Following rumors of the haunting, they come to the house and begin to explore. As the daylight fades they make for the exit, but they are locked in! What&rsquo;s more, an evil spirit has possessed one of them, but no one knows who. Desperately, they scramble to uncover the secret of the house before time runs out, wary all the while that they can trust no one. Welcome to Possessed, a fast-paced game of exploration, supernatural forces, and treachery. Can you survive the night?&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards from the house deck, representing the rooms they are searching. Clue cards will be claimed as points at the end of the game, and you may trade these with other players to make sets worth additional points. However, should you draw too many Ghosts or Despair in one round, you risk losing those points. You must decide whether to hide from the Ghosts and drop out of the round, or push your luck and risk losing it all.&#10;&#10;At some point in the game, the Possessed will reveal who they are. From now on they will attempt to thwart the investigators using the cards they have accumulated throughout the game. Can the investigators collect enough clues before three rounds are up? Or will they be overwhelmed by the Possessed and the terrors of the haunted mansion?&#10;&#10;",

It is a semi-cooperative game that you can play solo, with your partner, with (a) friend(s), with your family, with co-workers. The explorers (players) have total control on how to engage in the gameworld ('agency'). Under the supervision of a 'narrator', players explore a diversity of domains of meaning in close cooperation with each other. There are several domains of meaning in the game that can be chosen and are puzzled in a game board: neighbourhood, relationship, freetime, family, household, work, friends and school. In each domain you will face questions, exercises and challenges depending on the chosen mission. You gain 'join' points by doing missions and by engaging in the missions of other explorers.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a fixed amount of gathered missions (depending on how long you want to play: between 1 hour and 3 hours) and the explorer with the most 'join' points (victory points), wins.&#10;&#10;In a search for new ways to 'do psychotherapy', we offer in this board game an unseen constellation of play and therapy, where we let go of the necessary presence of a therapist in the therapeutic process. Narrato is a board game that has it's inspiration from concepts within the narrative psychotherapy and systemic psychotherapy. In an atmosphere of fun and connection, players remember not only rich stories but they also write new ones with the playing of Narrato. Players can get connected in surprising ways and through the specific design of the game. We expect new kinds of experiences for themselves, their partner, their family, friends and other meaningful persons in life.  Increasing each other's sense of influence is rewarded ('relational agency&rsquo;) through 'join' points.&#10;&#10;",

Using home made blocks, and simple terrain (or no terrain at all!) as well as the included unit counters allows players to quickly construct an attractive looking game which can be taken almost anywhere.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players roll a die to determine initiative for the round. Play then proceeds into the command phase where players spend action points on moving their blocks around on the board. The game ends when one player defeats the other by destroying 4 of their opponent's blocks.&#10;&#10;Players can use 3D terrain, hand drawn maps, or just a kitchen table to play on. The goal of the design is so make wargaming as easy and simple as possible to get into. The use of coloured blocks and action dice also means the transition to wargaming is made easier for those who currently only play traditional board and counter games.&#10;&#10;Movement is regulated in inches using tape measures or home made measuring sticks and the rules of the game fit onto a single side of A4.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Splintered Lands is a post-apocalypse-themed expandable deck-building game from Civil Dawn Games. Players take on the role of an enclave governor who must lead their people in a fight for survival using a brand new base-defense tactical deck-building game mechanic.&#10;&#10;Somehow, you have cobbled together a band of basic fighting men and women to help you survive in the inhospitable wasteland you call home. However, you&rsquo;ve noticed another group of survivors competing for resources in your area. If you are going to survive for long, you are going to need to spend your ever-dwindling resources to convince new and capable people to join you in the constant struggle...but finding them can be just as difficult as convincing them to come back with you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns attacking their opponent, fortifying their enclave, and searching the Dunes to acquire new and powerful characters to join their fight. Defeat your opponent by crippling their authority, and do it quickly -- your opponent will only grow stronger the longer you let them live. Unfortunately, they know it, too.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with an 11 card deck. Then players choose which factions they want to be represented. Combine your favorite three factions to create the six card Dunes deck. This is where you will find powerful allies to join your enclave. On their turn, players play cards, pick cards, and arrange/navigate cards on their side. The game ends when one player has had their Authority (life) reduced to 0 due to actions happening in the game. A player wins by reducing their opponents Authority (life) to 0 or below.&#10;&#10;Along with the four starting factions, Splintered Lands has five expansions already planned out. Each expansion contains two new factions, plus exclusive bonus content. These unique boosters create new ways to engage with the world of Splintered Lands, giving players optional new ways to defeat their opponents, new and interesting mechanics to discover, and unusual aberrant creatures to defend with or against.&#10;&#10;",

A player&rsquo;s word is scored by the numeric value of each letter plus the total number of cards used.  Each word played after the first must contain at least one card from the previous word and at least one card from their hand. A fast, portable word making game that's also fun as a solitaire game.&#10;&#10;Literatio comes in a cloth draw-string bag containing 100 small laminated letter cards, instructions, pencil, and score sheets.&#10;&#10;Player One builds as high a scoring word as he can. For example, 8 points for the total of the numerical values of the letters &#10;plus 6 points for the number of cards used.&#10;&#10;Player Two discards one card from Player One's word into a used letter pool and rearranges the remaining letters while adding at least one of his own to make a new word.  Play continues until all cards have been drawn and one of the players has used all of his cards or until all possible words are played. The value of the &#10;unused cards that players are unable to play are subtracted from their scores.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins! Players may use a timer if desired.&#10;&#10;",

All players start with the same size of crew, ship and resources, but they are free to pursue whatever strategy they think best. Each player builds a unique tableau consisting of different crew members and ship modifications.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking their respective turn. A player can usually take 3 actions per turn.&#10;&#10;The game starts in a pirate phase, where pirate ships occupy a number of locations on the map.  If most of the pirates are destroyed, then the game shifts to a normal phase. Finally, the game enters an end phase after a pre-determined number of rounds have been played and a boss appears.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to defeat the boss, but if it is not dealt with quickly then all of the players will lose. If the players are successful in stopping the boss, whoever has the most Victory Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

While in the caverns, an earthquake hits the area and catastrophic geologic nightmare ensues. Rock slides block pathways and the water begins to rise from the lowest point of the caverns. To make matters worse, in all the confusion, your friend gets injured and separated from you in the caverns. Your goal is to find your injured friend and escape out of the caverns before the water overtakes you. If you run out of Life points, unable to escape the caverns, or you are overtaken by the rising waters, you lose!&#10;&#10;Each turn you will roll for two rock slides. Next, you will raise the water level in the caverns. You will then take two actions to either move, climb, dig. After completing your actions, you will roll for an event. Two of these can be beneficial ... but don't get your hopes up! The event die can really thwart your effort to get out of the caverns.&#10;&#10;Once you get to close enough, you will call out to your friend and the location of your friend will be revealed. You will then trudge your way through the caverns to reconnect and escape out of the caverns.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with 10 cards, and during their turn may either: discard a card to draw the top card of the draw or discard pile; lay a word down on the table form their hand; exchange a letter from the hand for one on the table (as long as it makes a valid word; or add one or more cards from the hand to an existing word to make a new word.&#10;&#10;When one player empties their hand, each other player adds the points of the cards in their hand to their score. Face cards are 10 points, number cards have points equal to the number of spots, and the Joker (wild card) is 15 points. When someone reaches 100+ points the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Kittylex: The same as Lexical, except it scores by each player placing a chip in the kitty at the start of the round, and the winner claiming the kitty.&#10;&#10;Combolex: The same as Lexical, except you may also lay down a flush or run of 5+ cards. You may not lay off cards on opponents' flushes or runs.&#10;&#10;",
