    "Description": "In 1994, the first national robot competition took place in San Francisco. Competitors from across the country brought their radio-controlled creations made out of spare parts. Several years later, the first televised robot combat competition was aired, which introduced the general public to the budding sport of robotic combat.&#10;&#10;Decades have passed since those early competitions. The robots have become more technologically advanced. The base of spectators and fans grew at an unprecedented rate.  Large technology firms took notice and injected significant sponsorship capital into the sport. Prize pools for robot battles grew to dwarf those of other televised competitions. Professional robot operators gained celebrity status as their matches became the most watched sporting events in the world.&#10;&#10;The stakes are higher than ever. Do you have what it takes to step into the robot battle arena?&#10;&#10;VOLT: Robot Battle Arena is a tactical game of robotic combat. Be the first player to score five victory points. Players earn victory points by having their robot on the active control point at the end of the round or by destroying opposing robots. You must use your wits to out-think and out-maneuver your opponents to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from box cover and rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is the latest in Ted S. Raicer's WWII operational series that began with The Dark Valley: The East Front Campaign 1941-45. The game uses a chit-pull activation system that determines both the order and type of each sides' actions during the game's ten action-packed turns, covering June 6 to August 21, 1944. The availability of Action Round chits (for the Germans, and separately for the British and US forces) is itself determined by the draw of Weather chits, one per turn, which reflect the importance of weather on the effectiveness of Allied air superiority and Allied shipping across the Channel. Weather also determines the number of German Reaction markers, which allow limited response to Allied actions. The &quot;Dark&quot; chit pull system makes The Dark Summer an excellent game for solo play, while keeping both players involved in face-to-face play.&#10;&#10;The single map extends from just south of Cherbourg (itself covered by a Cherbourg Box) southwest to Avranches and southeast to Alencon, allowing players to recreate the entire campaign from D-Day to the closing of the Falaise gap in late August. Units are mostly regiment/brigades, with a few battalions, but German mechanized forces are presented as operational kampfgruppen.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by the Allies capturing Cherbourg, exiting units to Brittany and Paris, and preventing the exiting of German units, but the Allies win a sudden death victory if they capture all the cities on the map before Turn 10 and the Germans win a sudden death victory by closing down any three Allied Beaches, two of which must be contiguous. The unknown activation sequence means the Allies cannot take the safety of his landing beaches for granted in June!&#10;&#10;The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is a game of moderate complexity, but nevertheless covers all the most important elements of the campaign. There are rules for the D-Day Landings, untried German strong-points and Ost battalions, Allied tac-air and carpet bombing, Allied artillery superiority, German nebelwerfer and flak guns, Allied naval support, the conquest of Cherbourg, exiting and re-entering the map, and variable entry and possible delay of both side's reinforcements. A game on an epic campaign that is playable in a single day's gaming and with a small footprint that will allow it to be left set-up for solo study, The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is a must-have for fans of WWII operational games, the &quot;Dark&quot; system, or students of the campaign for northwest Europe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.&#10;&#10;Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&#10;&#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?&#10;&#10;Space Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.&#10;&#10;Space Race: The Board Game is a game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.&#10;&#10;The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.&#10;&#10;Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Points are earned by seeing different parts of the city, but the various ways to earn these points are only unlocked by crossing the city&rsquo;s seven bridges.&#10;&#10;Six dice are rolled at the beginning of each turn, and each player drafts the roads from one of these onto their map. Should they select the one that lets them travel furthest, or the one that points them in the right direction? After five rounds, the player who tallies the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Seven Bridges stands out from most other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer! The elements of the game itself have been cleverly &lsquo;superimposed&rsquo; onto the map as an overprint, a technique once used to update or repurpose outdated maps.&#10;&#10;",

Specialist actions include gathering information, switching roles, and helping players in their attempt to identify the Informant(s) before the day is over. If a majority of players identify an Informant, the Rebels wins &mdash; but if the Informant(s) remain hidden, they win!&#10;&#10;",

Players start with 4 cards in hand. Each turn, players pick a card from one of the available piles (targets, hunters, contracts, and Jawa market). Then, they can choose to either play or sell a card. Finally, they pass their remaining hand to their left-hand neighbor.&#10;&#10;Target cards have defense values, while hunter and droid cards have attack values. To capture a target, players must equal or exceed the target&rsquo;s defense values by placing hunter and droid cards in front of their targets. Once a target is defeated, it is placed horizontally.&#10;&#10;Players may also fill contracts by choosing contract cards. These grant bonus points for capturing specific targets and purchasing crates.&#10;&#10;The first player to capture 4 targets earns bonuses, and this triggers the final 2 turns. Using the scorepad, players count the points they earned from capturing targets, filling contracts, and purchasing crates, and they deduce points they spent to hire hunters. The player with the most points is declared the best bounty hunter in the galaxy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For months you've been planning and gathering forces for the largest invasion of the war. Your opponent knows that you are preparing a major strike, but do they know where? Suddenly you receive reports that a spy has gained information about your operation, and the enemy shifts their defensive forces. But do they know the full extent of your plans? Should you call off the invasion and plan for a new attack? Or risk disaster against a prepared enemy? This is the fog of war...&#10;&#10;The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies.&#10;&#10;The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling.&#10;&#10;You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply.&#10;&#10;In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to investigate your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses.&#10;&#10;",

Players will need to command armies of giants as they wage war throughout northwest Faer&ucirc;n. Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.&#10;&#10;Each player issues commands to their giants in the form of command cards (recruit, move, attack, pillage, and so on). This allows players to recruit new giants, send them out to attack settlements and other giants, and also to pursue special agendas based upon their race. Each player represents a different giant race (hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, or storm giants), each with a different agenda.  For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh.&#10;&#10;Contents include 12 Giants miniatures, injection molded in color, measuring from approximately 60mm to over 90mm in height, and three Giantslayers.&#10;&#10;Preliminary FAQ: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-preliminary-faq&#10;&#10;Official Variants: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496&#10;&#10;",

The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.  Scoring occurs whenever a player draws a profit card from the deck.

Both first and second editions were sold as box sets which contained rules, scenery and enough miniatures for two armies.&#10;  &#10;First edition subtitled Epic Battles in the Age of Heresy was set in a much earlier time period than Warhammer 40,000. It featured Space Marines versus Space Marines in a civil war. The game could be combined with the previous published Adeptus Titanicus which featured Titans, giant robots, in the same 6 mm scale. Ork and Eldar models were also released, with rules for them in the Codex Titanicus expansion.&#10;&#10;Second edition was subtitled Epic Conflict in the War Torn Universe of the 41st Millenium and brought the setting into the standard era of Warhammer 40,000. It was radically revised but still fundamentally the same system, unlike the latter version of the Epic range. The new edition included Orks, Eldar and Titans in the base rules. These and other new races were greatly expanded in latter supplements.&#10;&#10;First Edition expansions and compatible games:&#10;&#10;    Adeptus Titanicus (1988) - also a stand alone game.&#10;    Codex Titanicus&#10;&#10;&#10;Second Edition expansions and compatible games:&#10;&#10;    Armies of the Imperium: Space Marines and Imperial Guard (1991)&#10;    Renegades: Eldar and Chaos Armies for Space Marine (1992)&#10;    Ork and Squat Warlords (1992)&#10;    Space Marine Battles (1993)&#10;    Titan Legions (1994) - also a stand alone game.&#10;    Hive War:Tyranids (1995)&#10;&#10;&#10;Later Editions of the Epic system:&#10;&#10;    Warhammer Epic 40,000 - 3rd Edition  (1998)&#10;    Epic Armageddon - 4th Edition (2004)&#10;    NetEpic - unofficial continuation of 2nd Edition (1997)&#10;    Heresy - unofficial rules in same scale and setting, designed to be a grittier wargame.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the great success of Dorfromantik: The Board Game, the next part of the Dorfromantik world is no longer about working together, but about friendly competition. The basic principle of the Spiel des Jahres 2023 is retained, but now both sides continue to expand their own landscape with the tile they have just revealed. Two new types of assignments also come into play with double and all-around assignments, which can also be combined with Dorfromantik: The Board Game. Two independently playable modules also provide more challenge, more variety, more interaction. Four of the new special tiles can also be integrated into Dorfromantik: The Board Game and played cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Dorfromantik: The Duel allows two players or two teams to compete. And with two copies even up to four people can play. Who will create the most beautiful world of hexagonal landscapes? Who will be better at fulfilling the villager's orders while also mastering the challenge of new assignments?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The hotel owners&rsquo; only care is to give these tourists the stay of their life - and of course to rid them of as much money as possible.&#10;&#10;Each round, new tourists of various nationalities will arrive at the island, and new upgrades in the form of build tiles will be available to buy for your hotel. Players will simultaneously choose one of their price cards to play, which indicates both your bid for building a hotel upgrade, and the price you set on your hotel rooms. The tourists will of course seek out the cheapest hotels first, so you must carefully plan when to demand sky high prices, and when to drop prices low in order to attract the tourists right under your opponents' noses. All the tourists have different personalities and abilities - so be sure to get the ones that benefit you the most. And of course you can enhance your hotel by building extra rooms, a swimming pool, or perhaps a luxury suite? &#10;In the end, it's the cash that counts.&#10;&#10;This is a fast and varied game of medium-light complexity, and as most decicions are made simultaneously by the players, the game has very little down time.&#10;&#10;",

Despite an upbringing of real hardship she rose to the highest rank in the royal court and did what she could to make sure the poorest in Brighthelm were not&nbsp;forgotten. She died too young, her work half done. A tournament has been announced to find her successor. Brave knights have travelled down royal highways. Bold paladins have knocked on royal doors. So too have bards, lords and heroes. All looking to take over Scraggart&rsquo;s reign and rule the realm to their desires. And every one of them has been sent back to whence they came. Because Garolium herself had devised the tournament. It was the last thing she did, and she decreed it would only be open to those of the most limited means. Those whose potential had been locked by the chains of ill-fortune and poverty. Brighthelm's paupers. She had spent her whole life building their ladder and nobody was going to kick it away.&#10;&#10;In Paupers' Ladder, players are a pauper in Garolium's tournament. Along with your bird companion, explore the wild and treacherous land of Brighthelm as you strive to learn three of the five virtues: generosity, fellowship, bravery, knowledge, and magnificence. Battle a bestiary of creatures, undertake quests, find ingredients to craft powerful recipes, and discover the sights and wonders of an exciting new world along the way. But beware! You're not the only pauper in town. the land of Brighthelm is illustrated with a playing board and over 400 cards depicting equipment, quests, recipes, monsters, ingredients, encounters, cities, villages and more besides.&#10;&#10;On your turn you use both your Pauper and your Bird, in either order. Each character may move from the Region they occupy into any adjoining Region, or stay where they are. Paupers&rsquo; can pay to travel extra Regions. Your character now explores the Region they occupy.&#10;&#10;The aim of Paupers&rsquo; Ladder is to learn any 3 of the 5 Virtues. Virtues are learned in different ways. For instance, you learn the Virtue of generosity by discarding a certain amount of gems from your purse. When a player has learned 3 Virtues, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the beginning of the 16th century, the city of Rouen is the main French port. The city's wealth depends on fishing and the trading of salted fish. Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?&#10;&#10;In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.&#10;&#10;The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building&#10;    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen&#10;    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods&#10;    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market&#10;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.&#10;&#10;In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There's still much left to do in order to become the world's largest and most diverse amusement park! Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!&#10;&#10;The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!&#10;&#10;To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.&#10;&#10;A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)&#10;    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.&#10;    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.&#10;&#10;&#10;By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).&#10;&#10;Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.&#10;&#10;After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens &ndash; and you wouldn't say &quot;no&quot; to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.&#10;&#10;Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Ming Voyages&quot; are the seven journeys made by the Chinese treasure fleet of oceanic junks between 1405 and 1433. The Yongle Emperor constructed the fleet during a period of outward-looking expansion of Chinese influence overseas, and its commander was Admiral Zheng He. The maritime power of the Ming Empire was used for political purposes, not just for trade. The immense fleet was technologically far in advance of European counterparts until at least the 18th century. While it is purported by some that the fleet circumnavigated the world and discovered all its continents save Europe, the voyages certainly reached Calicut in India and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, while making landfalls in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa &mdash; but on the landward side of the Empire, border troubles were always brewing.&#10;&#10;In The Ming Voyages, one player will be the Ming Emperor who is trying to complete all seven treasure voyages, in addition to protecting the Chinese borderlands from invading barbarians. The other player controls the three disparate barbarian factions who are trying to settle on the borderlands with China. Battles can occur in these borderlands, with players use their three dice to roll for triples, doubles, and singles that are better than their opponent's rolls. Reserved cards can be used for re-rolls.&#10;&#10;The game uses multi-function cards (as in The Cousins' War) to provide actions for players to reinforce their armies and attack the enemy and for the Emperor to complete voyages. Play of a card may provide an out-of-turn action for the opponent, so players must be careful of timing. Only the Emperor draws new cards. Players swap hands at the end of each turn, so the Emperor always knows what the Barbarian Overlord holds, and each player tries to exploit the out-of-turn actions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

As in the show, pro-bending matches are a game of push and pull, with an objective toward being the team that has either advanced the farthest forward, or completely knocked their competitors out of the ring.&#10;&#10;The game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that they returned to the matching Dog Bowls.&#10;&#10;There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House.&#10;&#10;Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging.&#10;&#10;One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique &quot;Leap Frog&quot; Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they may perform three of the following actions in any combination:&#10;&#10;MOVE: A player may move their Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone they hold prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, they may move their Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move their Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference.&#10;&#10;DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in their hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time.&#10;&#10;DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of yourself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color.&#10;&#10;Game End and Scoring:&#10;   When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring.&#10;&#10;Number 12 in the Pack O Game series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of Ben Hull's award-winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles series.&#10;&#10;The fourth installment in this series is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the career of one of the Great Captains of History, King Gustav II Adolf the Great of Sweden. In his brief career, he catapulted Sweden to the forefront of European power politics. This volume sets it focus on the rise and climax of Gustav Adolf's military system.&#10;&#10;The series began with the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War, then covered the Swedish army after Gustav Adolf in Sweden Fights On, then looked at the rise of the French in the Thirty Years War in Under the Lily Banners. In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.&#10;&#10;In each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:&#10;&#10;Dirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars. Again the King faced the Polish General Koniecpolski and sought to the same again.&#10;&#10;Breitenfeld 1631 - The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War&#10;&#10;Alte Veste 1632 - The late summer saw the Swedish besieged by Wallenstein at N&uuml;rnberg.&#10;&#10;L&uuml;tzen 1632 - Southeast of Leipzig the Swedes caught up to the Imperial main body. Wallenstein's army had detached two corps and was serious danger. He fortified a position at L&uuml;tzen. King Gustav Adolf's final battle.&#10;&#10;Honigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back. The Imperial commander, von Arnim, would take the field with Gustav Adolf at Breitenfeld two years later.&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;3 Full-color countersheets&#10;Two 22&quot;x34&quot; back-printed maps &#10;Rulebook &#10;Scenario/Playbook&#10;2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;",

Competing at the same time, players need to find the lab, then move in the right direction to spot the amoeba (which may, of course, be striped and not spotted).&#10;&#10;But wait! If you encounter a vent after leaving the lab, you need to skip to the next vent in the circle before continuing your search. (Amoebas prefer to travel in the dark when possible.) Plus, if an amoeba passes through one of three mutation devices in the circle, you need to alter the criteria for your search, looking for a tentacled amoeba instead of one with a tail, for example, or an orange/red amoeba instead of a blue/purple one.

ASLSK#4 is a self-contained ASL module that gives players the opportunity to start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately.&#10;&#10;ASLSK#4 expands on the themes of previous Starter Kits by providing new counters and updated rules featuring a new concept to Starter Kit &ndash; PTO. At the heart of this module are the rules for using the Japanese Imperial forces who fought amongst the jungle and island atolls of the Pacific in terrain completely different from the European Theater of Operations and with tactics different than their European counterparts. In addition to the step-reducing Japanese infantry and new rules for familiar looking terrain, simplified rules for Banzai, concealment, and hand-to-hand close combat are introduced. Neither components nor experience with earlier Starter Kits is necessary to play.&#10;&#10;The eight scenarios and three mapboards cover actions between the U.S. forces (Marines and Army) that opposed the Imperial Japanese Army on the islands of the Pacific and in the exotic China-Burma-India theater. From Guadalcanal to Myitkiyina to the big island of Luzon in the Philippines, these forces fought to the death from 1942 to 1945.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pharaoh is dead and his funerary barge sails slowly down the Nile toward his tomb where his spirit will stand before the judgement of Osiris.&#10;&#10;Pharaoh had no offspring so tradition holds that the governors of the land be tasked with building monuments to Pharaoh&rsquo;s glory so that Osiris will favor his spirit in the afterlife. Accordingly, Pharaoh&rsquo;s successor will be the governor who builds the greatest tribute to the late king.&#10;&#10;Resources and laborers are limited, the gods are capricious, and time is short; the memorials must be finished before the barge reaches the temple of Osiris at Men-nefer.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sailing Toward Osiris is a euro-style game with worker placement, resources management, project completion, and no direct conflict. Down-time is kept to a minimum via a single action, round-and-round turn structure that emphasizes timing decisions and subtle strategies.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over four &quot;seasons&quot; with the movement of Pharaoh's barge tracking the game's progress. Each season, after players draw workers from a communal bag, play begins with each player taking a series of one-action turns from a list of 10 possible actions:&#10;&#10;1. Play a worker to harvest resources&#10;2. Play a worker to a city for cards&#10;3. Play a worker to a caravan as leader or follower&#10;4. Hire an extra worker&#10;5. Trade at the market&#10;6. Plan a monument&#10;7. Build a monument&#10;8. Play a city card&#10;9. Play a boon card&#10;10. Withdraw from further actions.&#10;&#10;Players are working to build sphinxes, obelisks, and pylons to the glory of the late Pharaoh and to earn extra glory by building the monuments on certain river segments and in certain configurations. However, as more monuments are built, resource harvesting becomes less productive and viable locations for future monuments become scarce. By the last season, players will have to be creative to find enough resources or available land on which to build.&#10;&#10;The player who has amassed the most glory points by the end of the game will be crowned the new Pharaoh.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sailing Toward Osiris was inspired by the real events surrounding the death of Rameses XI at the end of Egypt's 20th Dynasty and the ascension of Smendes, a powerful governor in Lower Egypt.&#10;&#10;",

They must do this without verbal communication, empathizing and always considering each other's situation when making a move.&#10;&#10;A player can use their own cards or their partner's, but if their move causes their partner to be unable to move, the players lose and the game ends.

    "Description": "In 1894, farmers from the small village of Malpaso face the prospect of again losing their livelihood to a band of roving thieves, led by the self-styled &quot;General&quot; Mapache &ndash; himself wanted by the Mexican National Defense Army.&#10;&#10;Their solution is to go to the much admired but fallen from grace &quot;Padre&quot; Esteban, and see whether he can hire gunfighters to protect them. After trying to raise funds by any means at the &quot;All Rivers&quot; Poker tournament, the Padre recruits a band of gunslingers for the task and, once complete, travels back to the village over the precipitous Los Quantos bridge &ndash; all the while harassed by a detachment of the General's men. There they fortify Malpaso itself, and usher the frightened villagers into the abandoned silver mine for protection.&#10;&#10;When the bandits finally attack, both sides are prepared. Mapache's men unleashing their Gatling gun to devastating effect, while the villagers have a few tricks of their own. Both sides will suffer many casualties in the calamitous battle, but will the Mexican Army arrive in time to put an end to the bloodshed?&#10;&#10;Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso is a two-player card game set in the Old West, in which one player takes the role of General Mapache and his band of thieving outlaws, and the other player controls the villagers and guardians hired to protect the town of Malpaso, led by the infamous Padre Esteban. Each player has a unique deck of cards with unique possibilities as well as different winning conditions, which requires different tactics and different methods of play.&#10;&#10;More than just new locations, Revolver 2 features brand new gameplay elements in players can use a mine cart-mounted Gatling gun, blow up a bridge, assemble their own team of gunfighters, and dynamite mine tunnels. The game also includes a terrific Stud Poker mini-game which determines in which town the initial firefights occur.&#10;&#10;Like the original Revolver, the game remains elegantly simple and can be learned in five minutes. That said, Revolver 2 is a standalone game and the cards from Revolver and its expansions (red packaging) are not interchangable with Revolver 2 and its expansions (green packaging).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the late 19th century, the Russian government commissioned a project to build a railroad that would connect Moscow in the west with Vladivostok in the east. You and your fellow players are buying shares of the railroads that will expand across Russia, attempting to enrich yourself along the way and not lose control of railroads to the Tsar!&#10;&#10;Trans-Siberian Railroad &mdash; originally one of three titles in Winsome Games' 2015 Essen Set &mdash; shares some similarities with older Winsome titles in which the rail network is already printed on the board and individual railroad companies purchase the links that are printed. Four companies (Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow) are active at the start of the game, with one share of each company auctioned to the players in that order to provide starting capital for those companies. The winner of each auction chooses an unoccupied link from Moscow to another city; each link has a value listed in it, and the railroad's initial income is set to this value.&#10;&#10;Once the game begins, on a turn you can:&#10;&#10;&bull; Buy stock, specifically one share in one company or one share each in two different companies; the money paid is placed in the railroad's treasury, and when you buy two shares, you must pay an additional $4 to one of the two companies.&#10;&#10;&bull; Build links, specifically one link, two links, or one external link (i.e. to a location on Russia's border) &mdash; but only if the railroad is public (i.e., at least two shares have been purchased) and you hold at least as many shares in that railroad as each other player. (If a railroad has had only one share of stock purchased, it is private.) You can build direct links that extend that railroad's existing network or you can jump another railroad's links to extend the network in a more convoluted way. When you build two links, the second link must start from where the first link built that turn ended. The cost to build an internal link is $4, and if you jump another railroad's links, you must pay $2 to that railroad's treasury; the cost to build an external link is $8, plus $4 to each railroad per link you jumped.&#10;&#10;When you build a link, the value of that link &mdash; 2-6 &mdash; is added to that railroad's income. Each time a railroad's income marker lands on or passes over a black mark on the income track, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level. Additionally, when you build two links or an external link, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level.&#10;&#10;&bull; Pass.&#10;&#10;When you buy two shares, build two links, build one external link, or pass, you move the timing token one space on the timing track. When this token reaches the end of the track, each railroad pays dividends to those who hold stock in it, with the railroad's income being divided by the number of shares owned, then rounded up. If Red has $11 income and you own two shares and another player owns one, then you receive $8 and the other player $4.&#10;&#10;After paying out dividends (and re-setting the timing token to 0), if any railroad has a stock value of at least $48, then the game enters phase 2, which starts with an auction for a share of the black and white railroads, with the winner of each auction claiming any one non-external link for that railroad that connects to another railroad's network.&#10;&#10;In phase 2, once you pay out dividends, you check to see whether any railroad's stock value is equal to or less than the nationalization value, which starts at $24 and which increases after each dividend payout in phase 1, each failure to auction a railroad's share at the start of either phase, and each dividend payout in phase 2 during which no railroads were nationalized. If a railroad's stock value is less than the nationalization value, that railroad is nationalized, with each owner of its stock getting one final dividend payment, after which all shares of that railroad are removed from the game. Once all nationalizations are complete, the nationalization value is increased three levels for each nationalization that took place.&#10;&#10;If at this point any railroad has a stock value of $75 or the dividend marker has reached the end of the track, the game ends; otherwise players continue playing. When the game ends, players sum the value of the stocks they hold in public railroads with any money they have on hand. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

The pizza delivery professionals have to find a pizza and deliver it to the right house in town, all while avoiding ghosts, barriers, and mystic teleportation runes. The first player to find and successfully deliver a pizza wins. Luckily for them, the pizza delivery professionals all possess mild psychic powers. They must use their abilities to sense and divine what's around them if they hope to deliver their pizzas.&#10;&#10;The main role of mayor is to moderate play and make the town. The mayor wins if no one is able to deliver their pizza. The game begins with the mayor building a unique town map that includes the starting location for each player, pizza, and house. On a player's turn, they may choose to move one space in any of the four cardinal directions, attack in any of the four cardinal directions in hope of banishing a ghost, or use a psychic power. The mayor then resolves the action, tells the player the location of any barriers adjacent to the player, and whether or not the player senses any ghosts/pizzas/houses in any of the eight spaces surrounding the player.&#10;&#10;Attacking removes ghosts from the board and lets players draw one psychic card. Psychic cards allow players to make special movements on the board such as diagonal, hop step, or warp back to start.&#10;&#10;The players have only twenty turns to locate a pizza and deliver it to the matching house. The players have a gridded sheet of paper and a pencil to draw and record information about the town. The mayor has a special log sheet to track all the players moves and results.&#10;&#10;The game also includes several variant tiles that can be added to the town to vary gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Each family fights dirty, doing all they can to seize ownership of alcohol crates, even if that means sending rivals to sleep with the fishes. You are the &quot;Capodecina&quot; for one of these families. Command your henchmen to gain the upper hand in New York City by collecting crates, eliminating rivals, exposing moles, and tipping off the DA on your opponent. Do you have what it takes for your family to become Capo dei Capi?&#10;&#10;Each round in MOB: Big Apple, players take turns rolling two dice, then decide how to execute the results. Each roll allows players to allocate henchmen to the two game boards and perform various dastardly tasks, such as loading cars with henchmen to drive to locations, loading crates of contraband, revealing their rival's moles, and eluding the District Attorney.&#10;&#10;In more detail, six key locations of New York City are contested each round, with half being represented by a black die and half by a white die. You roll one of each die on a turn, and the die values denote which locations may be interacted with, and how many henchmen may travel to that specific location, with the white die serving as the location and the black die the number of henchmen or vice versa. During every turn, a player must send at least one henchmen to perform a specific task on the action board, which can help command cars, expose moles, move crates, and influence the District Attorney to move in on their rival&rsquo;s family.&#10;&#10;Once both players have allocated all of their henchmen, the round ends, then a battle takes place at each location, with the survivors remaining to guard the contraband.

Melodies whisper in slow rhythms as children wake from their slumber. Leaping from their beds, they rush to their parents and startle them awake. The mix of fear and excitement fills the room. The lure of exotic sweets wafts in on the warm summer wind. The lives of this dull, small town are revitalized with the anticipation of this dreadful circus.&#10;&#10;Dreadful Circus is a set-collection card game in which players try to create the most successful circus! The game comes with an unique twist: Over the course of the game, players buy cards that have special final scoring rules. As the game progresses and more cards are gained, each player develops their very own final scoring rules. No game is the same, and no player at the table scores the same way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have you felt the thrill of the struggle between life and death, sitting at the same table with your worst enemy and an unreasonable amount of poison? Don&rsquo;t forget to bring some antidote when playing Raise Your Goblets!&#10;&#10;In Raise Your Goblets, players take the roles of nobles at a banquet, each one with their own agenda of personal vendetta. Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else's, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has &quot;served&quot; all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.&#10;&#10;What's your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you're alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total). Also, whoever has the most wine in their cup scores 1 point. If someone has died, they receive a new noble card, and at the end of three rounds, whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Bohemian Revolt of 1618 triggered the Thirty Years War and in the early period of the war the Catholic/Imperial cause enjoyed an almost unbroken string of victories. This game, part of the Musket and Pike Battle Series, simulates six battles of the early Thirty Years War. In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.&#10;&#10;The battles covered in this game are:&#10;&#10;White Mountain&#10;November, 1620&#10;The combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.&#10;&#10;This is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.&#10;&#10;Wimpfen&#10;May, 1622&#10;Tilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.&#10;&#10;A balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.&#10;&#10;H&ouml;chst&#10;June, 1622&#10;The Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.&#10;&#10;A rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.&#10;&#10;Fleurus&#10;August, 1622&#10;Defeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;This is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.&#10;&#10;Stadtlohn&#10;August, 1623&#10;Following the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.&#10;&#10;A race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.&#10;&#10;Lutter am Barenberge&#10;August, 1626&#10;The Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.&#10;&#10;This is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.&#10;&#10;In addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.&#10;&#10;Even though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.&#10;&#10;",

You need to discover that identity in echoes: The Cocktail.&#10;&#10;echoes is a co-operative audio mystery game. Using the free app, players listen to mysterious noises and voices that are connected to the playing material. Together they look for hints in the sound bites to bring the story parts in order and solve the case.&#10;&#10;In more detail, your task is to assemble the 24 parts of the story in the right order; each part is represented by an object &mdash; either a game board or a card &mdash; and its associated echo. The entire story is divided into six chapters, with each chapter being represented by a game board. By scanning the objects with the app, you'll hear the echo connected with each object, and by using conversations and noises in the echo, you try to figure out which three object cards are associated with a chapter and in which order they should be placed. If you're not correct, the app will inform you which cards are incorrect or in the wrong place; if you are correct, you can listen to the entire chapter all at once &mdash; and you should since new, additional hints can then be heard.&#10;&#10;The objects themselves also provide you with clues from time to time, so neglect no details.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Summer nights, the woods, and the campfires where it is good to roast marshmallows &mdash; it doesn't get better than this!&#10;&#10;Well - that is about to change! Suddenly, out of the bushes, hordes of zombie animals are rushing towards you. Do they want to steal your marshmallows? Not at all! It's your brains they want to cube and roast over the campfire. Your goal in Oh My Brain is to rid yourself of these assailants &mdash; that is, the cards in your hand &mdash; as quickly as possible to avoid gradually losing your mind because losing your brain entirely means being transformed into a zombie...and losing the game!&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of cards numbered 0-19, and to start a round of play each player takes three cards from the deck and places one in their &quot;cemetery&quot; (a card holder) and the other two in their hand. They then do this twice more to have a hand of six cards and a cemetery of three cards. Each player starts with a number of brain tokens.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must play to the central pile (campfire), playing a number higher than the current highest number. You can play multiple copies of the same number, and if you do, you place all copies of that number after the first one into the cemetery of one or more opponents. You can always play a 0, which restarts the pile. If you play an 8, the next player must play lower than an 8, then the pile ascends again. If you play an 11, you take another turn. If you play certain high or low cards, you must roll the special die, which may have you play again, steal a brain from another player, swap campfires with an opponent, or take some other action.&#10;&#10;If you cannot play, you lose a brain token, clear the pile, draw two cards, place one of those cards in your cemetery, then start the pile again by playing from your hand. If you have fewer than three cards in hand at the end of a turn, refill your hand to three from the cards in your campfire. If you have played all of your cards, success! You have fended off the zombie animals, and all opponents lose a brain token for each card in their hand and cemetery. If any player has no brains remaining, the player with the most brain tokens wins; otherwise, shuffle the cards and play another round, starting with the player who has the fewest brains.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "INCURSION is set in the world of Secrets of the Third Reich and is the ultimate combination of board game and miniatures game. Armored troopers of the US &ldquo;Lucky Seventh&rdquo; and stalwart commandos of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s MI-13 hurtle through underground bunkers and combat the monstrous forces of the German SWD in a furious race against time. The Doomsday Device is ticking and neither the Allies nor the Axis can fail. This two player game features a tight storyline campaign that culminates in an epic and desperate climax. The game mechanics are simple to grasp allowing players to instantly focus on their tactical options. Game play is incredibly fast-paced and tense and players choose their forces through a card-based Requisition Point system. The game is played on a board with a special card deck and highly detailed 30mm metal miniatures. You can also use the miniatures in games of Secrets of the Third Reich. Rules can be found for them here.&#10;&#10;In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;Rigid two piece box covered in art&#10;Glossy 28 page rulebook&#10;Card rules summary/playsheet&#10;4 sheets of two-sided heavy-duty die cut pieces (132 total) including counters, doors and stand-ups for all models&#10;Super Heavy duty two-sided six-fold game board&#10;86 cards (66 card Battle Deck and 10 Model Cards for each side)&#10;3 black dice&#10;36 black plastic stand-up holders for doors and &quot;models&quot;&#10;Vac-formed plastic holding tray&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FROM THE GAMESITE:&#10;&#10;HISTORY MAKER BASEBALL Big League Baseball board game incorporates the intangibles of baseball--team chemistry, hot and cold streaks, player experience and so on. if a player is on a hot streak, or there's tension in the clubhouse, it's a palpable feeling with noticeable--though not precisely quantifiable--results. HMB reproduces that phenomena using a simple set of easy-to-implement qualities. The result is story-line drama that we think you'll find to be quite entertaining and captivating--but which doesn't bog down play, or require copious book-keeping!&#10;&#10;HISTORY MAKER BASEBALL expands the scope of the game to include events &quot;outside the innings&quot; which rightly affect what happens during the game. The pitching coach wants to talk &quot;privately&quot; to you about yesterday's starter. Here's the trainer with an injury report. Comments this morning from an outraged local sports talk host will have to be dealt with. The front office can be fickle--maybe they'll give you a &quot;vote of confidence,&quot; or perhaps bungle a player negotiation, and you'll have to clean up the mess. All these are real factors in real baseball, and it's built-in to be a real part of HMB as well.&#10;&#10;This baseball board game offers a universe of managerial choices that includes classic baseball strategy and at the same time supersedes it, expanding into the realm of baseball psychology. Dugout chatter, coaching tips, walking to the mound to chat with the pitcher, arguing with the umpire--all have a place in real baseball, all have a place in HISTORY MAKER BASEBALL Big League Baseball simulation board game.&#10;&#10;Results are found by rolling 3D6 and checking the results in the included game action booklet.  Each player is rated on a set of qualities for batting, running and fielding, while pitchers are also rated on their pitching ability.  Qualities include being a &quot;patient&quot; batter or a &quot;prospect&quot; pitcher.  The game booklet checks to see if a player has or lacks a certain quality to see what the result of the at-bat will be.&#10;&#10;If a result is color coded (red, blue or purple), the next at-bat will be resolved on one of the three mini-charts.  Either EXPERIENCE(red chart), the RIGHT NOW (blue), or CHEMISTRY (purple).  In this game, a team's winning streak could give the players a little extra edge to make a tough diving catch in the outfield.  Whereas a losing streak may have the team in a STORMY mood causing players to chase bad pitches or miss the hustle plays.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warhammer Epic 40,000 was the third edition of the Epic system. The first edition and second editions of the Epic system had each been released as two separate games. The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system. Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.&#10;&#10;It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition) world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many old-school fans of the 1st and 2nd edition felt the 3rd edition of the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification, to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.&#10;&#10;Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Adeptus Titanicus II&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented By&#10;&#10;    Epic Armageddon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&amp;D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha. Thus was RuneQuest born.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    White Bear & Red Moon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!&#10;&#10;Lost Legacy: Third Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: Sacred Grail and Staff of Dragons. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set.&#10;&#10;As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For the most part, Han uses the same gameplay as China, also from designer Michael Schacht, but the maps on the double-sided game board introduce new rules and variants.&#10;&#10;In general, players use cards to place pieces (houses or emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. To place in a region, a player must play a card of that region's color or two cards of the same color as a joker; a player can place at most two pieces in a region on a turn, but only one piece if the region was unoccupied at the start of the turn. One side of the game board &mdash; titled &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot;, or &quot;Border Disputes&quot;, and made for 3-5 players &mdash; includes house sites that straddle two regions; to claim one of these locations, a player must discard two appropriately-colored cards. The number of emissaries in a region is limited to the number of houses of the same color in that same region.&#10;&#10;When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for that region. Whoever has the most houses in that region scores one point for each house in the region, whoever has the secondmost houses scores one point for each house of the player who has the most, and so on.&#10;&#10;At game end, players also score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions, scoring as many points as the number of emissaries in both regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board. On the &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; game board, players also score majority points for the houses in the port cities located in multiple regions, these port cities effectively forming their own region. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; has one variant. Each player starts with one fortification in addition to his other pieces. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place his fortification on a house site, then top it with a house. Whenever this house scores &mdash; whether for the region majority, for being a port city, or for being part of a sequence &mdash; the house's owner scores double the points he normally would.&#10;&#10;The other side of the game board &mdash; &quot;Wege der Diplomatie&quot;, or &quot;Ways of Diplomacy&quot;, which is made for 2-4 players &mdash; also has a variant, with each player receiving a marketplace. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place the marketplace on a house site, then top it with an emissary (not a house). This allows a player to compete for emissary points in a region that is otherwise full.&#10;&#10;",
