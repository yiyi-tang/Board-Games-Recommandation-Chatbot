It is played with 24 cards only. The Sixes, referred to as the &quot;ball cards&quot;, are used to keep the scores. The highly original ranking of cards and the card-point values are as shown in the table. The first and foremost rule of the game is to always follow suit, if a player does not have that suit he may play any other card in his deck.&#10;&#10;",

However, Fantasy Defense isn't a legacy game! When it's all finished, you can return to the original version and play that. You could also put back all cards in their original envelope and start from the beginning &mdash; or you can spice things up, mixing and matching different elements as you wish.&#10;&#10;The Stone King provides a more varied and challenging experience for those players who have figured out the basic gameplay of Fantasy Defense.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player for the round rolls a die, gives everyone a chance to memorize the topmost face, then covers it with a die cup that matches the color of the face. The next player then rolls a die, and so on. As soon as no die cup remains that matches the face of the current die, the current player covers this die with the gold die cup, ending the round.&#10;&#10;This player then has the first chance to guess the first die in the line. If correct, the player scores 1 point, then guesses the next die; if wrong, the next player gets to guess. Whoever guesses the die under the gold die cup scores 2 points. Players play multiple rounds until someone reaches a total of 20 points, winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

After they finish moving, if they're on a space all by themselves, they can reveal a tile that has only one bubble on it. If they share a space with other fish, they can reveal a tile with as many bubbles as the number of fish on that space. Thus, players need to keep their school from wandering too far apart as they travel through the reef.&#10;&#10;If the players manage to reveal all 28 tiles before all four fish have swum out of the reef, then they win!&#10;&#10;",

There are a lot of advantages: you don't age; you don't have to see yourself in mirrors anymore; if someone asks you to do something, you can just turn into a bat, and then say, sorry, I'm a bat. There are probably some downsides though. You always think of the statue in the town square that came to life and now works as the tavern barmaid. The pedestal came to life too, so she has to hop around. The village blacksmith turns into a wolf whenever there's a full moon; when there's a crescent moon, he turns into a chihuahua. That's how this stuff goes sometimes. Still, when you breathe in the night air, you feel ready for anything.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Nocturne, the 11th expansion to Dominion, has 500 cards, with 33 new Kingdom cards. There are Night cards, which are played after the Buy phase; Heirlooms that replace starting Coppers; Fate and Doom cards that give out Boons and Hexes; and a variety of extra cards that other cards can provide.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Nocturne is a part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;",

With four players, NYX plays as two partnerships.&#10;&#10;In NYX, you assume role of an immortal Scion locked in an eternal struggle to influence mortal thoughts.  Take the side of Morpheus, God of Dreams and bearer of prophetic visions.  Or take the side of Morpheus&rsquo; menacing brother, Phobia, bringer of phantasms and nightmares.  Use your powers of prophetic dreams, nightmarish phantasms, powerful rifts, and enchanted cloaks in a clash for control of the ancient realm known as the Dream Plain.&#10;&#10;The goal of NYX is to gain the most Victory Points.  You earn Victory Points by composing Divinations to collect Poppies and by building connected territories on the Dream Plain of either Nightmare or Prophecy.  Final scoring is based on the amount of area controlled and the number of Poppies cached.&#10;&#10;The game of NYX is inspired by the legend Morpheus and Phobia.  They are brothers and scions of ancient gods:&#10;Their father is Hypnos, the gentle, black-winged God of Sleep; twin to the Lord of Death; and &lsquo;balm to the mortal soul.&rsquo;  Their mother is Nyx, the frighteningly fierce and powerful primordial Goddess of Night borne of original Chaos, her overwhelming might revered and feared by all other gods...even Zeus himself.&#10;  &#10;The sons of Nyx and Hypnos dwell within an immense cavern buried in the deepest chasm of the Underworld.  Each night, Phobia, always envious of Morpheus&rsquo; renown, wages a great war with his formidable brother.  Since the beginning of time, while mortal men slumber, the two scions have been locked in an eternal struggle vying for absolute control of mortal visions and dreams.  At sundown, the two race from the depths of the Underworld as a cyclone rising like a smokey mist of bats. The two brothers hurtle towards their battle and their destiny on the Dream Plain.&#10;&#10;",

The title &quot;Friegur&quot; stands for: &quot;Feldgraue rangen in Ehren, gewannen unsterblichen Ruhm&quot;&#10;&#10;Exerpt of the description by Elfriede Strey, as suplied at June 9, 1934 to the US patent Office: My invention relates to a game to be played on a board like chess by two persons or two parties and in which the aim is for one party to beat the other, under observation of determined rules.&#10;&#10;Whereas in chess the various chessmen are moved merely according to their nature, the board of my new game has aspecial division or characterization of the squares which prescribes that determined menmust move only on determined squares.&#10;&#10;According to the leading idea of my new game the board represents a terrain which comprises a fortress for each party, a glacis surrounding each fortress, and a battle ground situatedbetween the positions of the two parties. Both in the battle ground and in the glacises there are obstacles of various kinds which are denoted by differently marked squares. These obstacles further determine the moves of the various men, beyond their motion prescribed by their own nature. The rules of my new game, which may represent for example a battle for fortress and flag, further prescribe that the men or fighters may be both promoted and degraded, so that, for example, the &#10; private soldier may be promoted to oflicer, if certain conditions are fulfilled, whilst an officer who has been derelict, may be degraded. Finally, as in chess, my new game provides that the fighters of one party may be taken according to determined rules, in order to break the fighting power of the enemy gradually.&#10;&#10;",

Abandoning the Italian divisions in the South, Rommel ordered a withdrawal to Fuka. Throughout the day the Western Desert Air Force mantained a continual bombardment and strafing of the mass of vehicles retreating along the coast road. The hairpins climbing the scarpment at Fuka and Mersa Matruh proved a deathtrap for the Axis. German and Italian fighters were thrown in to stem the tide of Allied bombing. Small clashes developed all over the sky.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You and the other players are castaways on an uncharted island. A gang of motley monkeys has stripped all your shipwrecks of vital parts. The goal of the game is simple: collect the plunder and monkeys that you&rsquo;ll need to repair your ship and sail home. In order to get those items, you&rsquo;ll need you&rsquo;ll need to outbid and outsmart the other castaways in auctions run by Captain Coconuts, the wily monkey leader who controls the island &mdash; and your fate.&#10;&#10;Shipwrecked is a classic auction game with a twist: Instead of bidding with your bananas, you&rsquo;ll have a hand of six tokens that you&rsquo;ll use to make your bid in a series of secret auctions. Each token interacts with those placed by the other players - but no one knows who has played what until the bids are revealed. Once a round of the auction round is won, the other players can spend their bananas (cash) in order to push the auction to the next level. If they do, more plunder and monkey cards are added, and the auction continues!&#10;&#10;During every round, the cost of winning increases by one banana, as does the cost of pushing the auction forward. Your bid tokens all have unique effects, but once they&rsquo;ve been played in an auction they stay on the board. That means you&rsquo;ll want to save your most powerful bid tokens for the moment when they count the most.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s easy to learn, but the more you play, the more you&rsquo;ll discover the layers of depth and strategy in the bid and push gameplay. The order that you use your tokens not only determines the outcome of the current auction round but your ability to effectively bid in upcoming rounds as well. Winning auctions will give you the plunder and monkeys you need to win, but you&rsquo;ll be tempted to trade in your hard-won booty for short term gain: plunder cards can be traded in for extra bananas, while the monkey cards have special powers that can shift the outcome of the auctions &mdash; and the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scippio is a filler cardgame for 4 players, set in the Punic Wars, around 200 B.C. Two players take command of the Roman Army as Publius and Fabian roman consuls, while the other two players will be Hannibal and Hasdrubal, carthaginian generals.&#10;&#10;The main mechanics of the game are set collection and bluffing. Both players strive to collect a set of three equal cards, and then pass a secret signal to its partner. If the signal is sucessfully transmitted and understood, the allied general may attack and win the battle, but if it is intercepted by the enemy duo, it may leave the army vulnerable to a counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The game lasts about 15-30 minutes per playthrough and is intented for ages 10+. The game has no language dependency, but its rulebook is written in Brazilian Portuguese.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1919, the governments of the victorious Allied powers met in Paris to discuss the post-war order of things. But while they were talking, history continued to move. As the rest of Russia descended into civil war, forces of the Red Army moved westward to exploit the power vacuum left by the retreating German armies. They were met by units of the new Polish Army, who pushed them back steadily into what is now Belarus. After the Polish overextended their forces in an offensive to take Kiev in early 1920, the greatly reinforced Red Army went over to the attack.&#10;&#10;General Mikhail Tukhachevsky&rsquo;s Order of the Day for July 2, 1920 read in part &quot;To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March on Vilno, Minsk, Warsaw!&rdquo; As the new nation of Poland fought for its life and the front lines surged back and forth, both sides grew increasingly desperate. The war climaxed in the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August, as the Poles finally broke the Red Army and flung it back into Russia in disorder &ndash; to this day they refer to it as &ldquo;the Miracle on the Vistula&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Red Horde 1920 is an operational-level game on the action during this fateful summer. The Red Army smashes forward in the name of the Revolution, with masses of rifle divisions and the savage 1st Cavalry Army, commanded by Semyon Budyonny and filled with fierce Cossacks. The Poles resist with units of the Polish Legion, veterans of the fighting in France, and their national army. Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Hungarians and even a unit of Red Polish renegades swirl in and out of the chaos too.&#10;&#10;Designer Brian Train has substantially revised and streamlined his original 2008 design of the same name, incorporating a newly-researched and more accurate order of battle with revised counter values, updated rules and a drastically revised map with a different scale.&#10;&#10;Saddle up, comrades! Glory waits down the road!&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;176 counters, showing Polish, Soviet and foreign volunteer forces at brigade to division scale. &#10;1 22x17-inch map of eastern Poland and western Byelorussia, ground scale 20 miles per hex. &#10;1 Full-color Rulebook, typeset for easy squinting. &#10;2 Player Aid Cards to stare at while the other guy hogs the rulebook. &#10;An anachronistic Ziploc bag to keep the counters in one cat-proof location.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll also need to provide two six-sided dice for the Cause.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a rack of five cards.  The cards have information on both sides.  The back side, which is only visible to the player, shows an X or O.  The front side, which is visible only to the other player, shows a number between one and five in one of five colors.  The goal of the game is to complete a grid of 25 cards - one of each number in each color - without using more than three cards that show an X on the back.&#10;&#10;On your turn, your options are (1) spend a clue token to give your partner a hint; (2) play a card from your rack; or (3) discard a card from your partner's rack.  Whenever you play a card or have one of your cards discarded by your partner, you must draw a new card to replace it.&#10;&#10;Play continues until (1) the deck runs out (at which time each player gets one final turn); (2) someone tries to play an unplayable card (thereby losing the game); or (3) the players complete their grid of 25 cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The year 1914 passed. France survived the Schlieffen Plan with the Miracle on the Marne and the Race to the Sea ended in a stalemate. Unable to outflank its opponent, each side entrenched. A new type of warfare began that would claim the lives of many millions: trench warfare!&#10;&#10;Designed by Renaud Verlaque, winner of the 2003 Charles S. Roberts award for best Pre WW2 game with Age of Napoleon (Phalanx Games, 2003, and Mayfair Games) and designer of The Price of Freedom: the American Civil War 1861-65 (Compass Games, 2008), The Big Push is a card wargame on Trench Warfare on the Western Front in World War One. One player commands the armies of the Entente and the other the armies of the German Reich (a.k.a., Germany).&#10;&#10;The game plays in a maximum of five annual turns, from 1915 through 1919. In each turn, the players are given an opportunity to innovate weapons and tactics, secretly deploy armies to the six sectors of the front line (from Flanders in the north to Verdun in the south), try to gain air superiority in order to reconnoiter the enemy before deciding whether to attack or defend, and then fight to gain the upper hand sector by sector and satisfy political pressure at home to attack and win. Meanwhile the Entente player hopes to reduce the German war effort through the naval blockade while the German player hopes to do the same through U-Boote Warfare, but at the risk of bringing the United States into the war on the side of the Entente. The German player must also contend with the demands of the Eastern Front on his war effort, at least until Russia sues for peace. Victory points are awarded for successful attacks, with each additional successful attack in the same turn resulting in a larger number of victory points than its predecessor as it increases the likelihood of immediate and decisive victory in the war. If neither player has gained enough victory points by the end of the 1919 turn to achieve victory, attritional victory is awarded to the player who accumulated the most victory points throughout the game (but a tie means a draw).&#10;&#10;",
