The players are visiting Story Book Land where they will meet and read all about their Story Book friends such as Mother Goose, Jack Be Nimble, Humpty Dumpty and many others. They move along the path by use of the spinner. When they meet Mother Goose on the path, they must turn the knob on top of the Candy Tower. When they turn the knob, Humpty, who has been sitting on the wall watching them will either remain where he is, or flip off the wall. If Humpty falls off the wall, the player must go back to the nearest black space with a red arrow. The first player to complete the trip through Story Book Land is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hackenbush is played on an image consisting of line segments (either red, blue, or green) where there is a path from each line segment to the ground (a horizontal line at the bottom of the picture). Each line segment is connected to either the ground or other line segments at the endpoints.&#10;&#10;Each of the two players is assigned a color (either red or blue). On their turn, a player removes one line segment of their color (or a green line segment) and then all line segments that are no longer connected to the ground. If a player cannot make a move, she loses.&#10;&#10;Hackenbush was introduced in the 1981 book set Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays (by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy), and is used as a motivating example of partizan games (that is, games in which, unlike nim, each player has moves not allowed the other player).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In the late summer of 1914, the German General Staff informed their Austro-Hungarian allies that they would stand on the defensive against their common Russian enemy. Undeterred by this reality, the Austrians pushed forward with their plans to attack. After initial successes, the outnumbered Austro-Hungarian forces fell back with severe losses.&#10;&#10;Fall of Empires is a stand-alone game in the Infantry Attacks series, our World War One equivalent to the long-running Panzer Grenadier series. Units are companies and squadrons, and the sixty scenarios represent actions from the opening battles of 1914 in on the Eastern Front between the Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies.&#10;&#10;Forces include the Austro-Hungarian Common Army's infantry, mountain troops, artillery and cavalry. The Austrian Landwehr and Hungarian Honv&eacute;ds&eacute;g, the regular armies of the two halves of the Dual Monarchy, also have their own infantry, mountain troops, artillery and cavalry. And the Bosniaken, the fierce Muslim regiments recruited in Bosnia-Hercegovina, appear in their own colors as well. Against that multi-national array, the Imperial Russian Army brings its own infantry, cavalry, Cossacks and Plastuns.&#10;&#10;There are six semi-rigid mapboards, the same type found in Panzer Grenadier games. They are fully compatible with the Panzer Grenadier boards &mdash; you can play scenarios from either series on mapboards from the other game system.&#10;&#10;Stuff Included:&#10;&#10;Sixty (60!) scenarios.&#10;    Six rigid cardstock maps.&#10;    781 playing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Seen from the other side, it is intended to be Blue & Gray: Four American Civil War Battles but with a historical feel in play.&#10;&#10;Currently there are refits for Gettysburg: Lee's Greatest Gamble, Seven Days Battles, and The Atlanta Campaign: Bald Hill and Ezra Church.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tic Tac Total is a game played on a 5x5 grid of squares where players alternate playing X and O chips onto the board in an effort to get as many of your chips in a row as possible while blocking your opponent from creating rows.  You score three points for each row of 3, five for each row of 4, and eight for each row of 5.  The middle spot is wild and counts as either an X or an O.&#10;&#10;The game has an electronic sensor which keeps track of where the chips are placed and provides sound effects and scoring as the game is played.  There is also a 1 player mode where the computer shows you where to place its chips.&#10;&#10;",

The dice shaker is a bamboo tube that has two chambers, one holding colored dice and one holding one black and one white die. When shaken, one dice from each chamber appears in a small window on the side of the tube.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they shake the dice and get two dice in the window. The black die means feet, white means hands. The colored die shows the band color that must be connected. So, if a player rolls white and red, he must connect one his hands (the white die) to any red wristband. In short order, the players get connected and twisted up in all kinds of hilarious ways! A very fun game from Uncle Skunkle.&#10;&#10;",

Numerous different companies using different railway gauges connected to villages, towns and cities across the country.  Eventually the small companies were merged into the Big Four.&#10;&#10;This expansion has two sets of rules.  The first set of rules follows the gameplay of the Railways of the World series.  The second set of rules is a new game from Martin Wallace that features a new share system and economic engine that builds upon the Railways of the World engine.&#10;&#10;Railways of England and Wales debuted at Origins 2009.

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Subway Series is a table-top baseball game that recreates the Brooklyn Dodgers v. New York Yankees World Series of  the 1950&lsquo;s.  All of the plays of  each of the games played in the two historic ballparks (Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field) during the 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956 World Series is &ldquo;charted &ldquo; with mathematical accuracy for the chance of each event happening.  The game is a cleverly unique system that recreates the history of these series games. All of the actions that actually happened during the games from the 1952, 53, 55, and 56 series are charted onto the fields, and by a roll of the 3 dice (producing  216 different outcomes) these plays will happen according to the actual probability of such an event.  All of the ground outs, hits, (singles, doubles, triples, HR's), fly balls, line outs, strikeouts, walks, and errors! Anybody who is familiar with the &quot;Red Barber Baseball&quot; game of the 1950's will recognize the basic game system.&#10;&#10;The game includes simple cardstock ballpark models of Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field.  As well as Roster Sheets for both teams for 1952, 53, 55 and 56. These sheets include dice roll adjustments for each player in each park to better reflect each hitters achievements for each park during each year according to historical probability.  In many ways this is BASEBALL HISTORY at a glance.  Just looking at the ballpark recreations shows where all of the plays took place in each area of each park. This is a BASEBALL GAME which faithfully recreates the hitting exploits of each team in each ballpark, through all four of the Subway Series of the 1950's.&#10;&#10;Additional infomation:&#10;The game as originally published in 1988 came with a short &quot;history&quot; of the four World Series that was written especially for this game by Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob  Broeg of St.Louis.  Very few games were printed and they were used primarily as a promo for BAUER DIAMONDS (maker of model ballpark kits).  Many were sold thru magazine adds, but some were given as gifts to family, friends, and supporters of BAUER DIAMONDS.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ballpark Classics is a tabletop dexterity game that brings together everything you love about baseball into a beautiful tabletop game everyone can enjoy.  Whether you are a lifelong baseball fan or just looking for a new spin on game night, Ballpark Classics delivers the fun, excitement, and atmosphere of real baseball right in you own home. You pitch by placing a steel baseball into the pitching pipe and squeezing it with your thumb or fingers. By changing your finger placement and adjusting the force, you can throw fastballs, curves, change-ups, sliders, and even create your own pitches. It&rsquo;s easy to do, but challenging to perfect, just like real baseball. &#10;Batting is all about timing, bat speed, and getting inside the pitcher&rsquo;s head. Ballpark Classics features batting so realistic that you can get called out on a check swing. You can play head-to-head, in teams, or by yourself. Pitching, hitting, walks, strikeouts, home runs, strategy, it&rsquo;s all here, except for the smell of freshly mowed grass. They&rsquo;re working on that. Ballpark Classics, Inc. was recently granted an MLB license and is releasing scale model field inserts of Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and others in 2009. Ballpark Classics is developing an ever expanding product line of past and presnt MLB parks. By comparison, the Front Porch Classics baseball game is a one-player mechanical pinball game with an inclined playing surface.&#10;&#10;",
