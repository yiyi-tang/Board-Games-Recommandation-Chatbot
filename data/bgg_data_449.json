You try and try and try to correct your drinking problem in REHAB, but you keep falling off the wagon. Whether it's a trip to Willy's Bar and Grill, Club Swank, the New Year's Eve Party or the Fraternity Party, you just can't seem to resist temptation. You'll travel around the gameboard landing in and falling out of REHAB until finally someone successfully defeats his or her addiction to alcohol (by collecting five gold stars). Along your road to recovery, you may have to reveal personal information about yourself, sing your favorite television theme song or even dance with a lampshade on your head. You may have a drunken hookup, develop cirrhosis of the liver or even get thrown in jail for drunk and disorderly conduct. You are an alcoholic and you're expected to act like one, and that includes lots of drinks. For 2-6 adults.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Whitman game is subtitled &quot;The Scarey {sic} Crossroads Game.&quot; This game was truly ahead of its time: it is a hexagonal tile laying game, with no board, for children. Each player selects 10 &quot;spooky&quot; tiles of either witches, monsters, ghosts, or buzzards, plus one crossroad and one tombstone. The first player then picks one of the 40 road tiles and places it in the center of the table. Each player then adds a road piece, making sure the road continues without a dead end or circling into itself. Every time you form a three-sided space, you fill it with one of your spooky tiles, making sure it does not block the road. After you have added 5 of your spooky tiles, add the tombstone, and then the rest of your pieces. The winner is the first to use all their pieces and add the Haunted House tile to the road.&#10;&#10;",

In &quot;Dunce,&quot; players spin a teetotum that has pictures of the dunce pieces as well as a lucky horseshoe pic. If a player puts together the whole dunce (stool, body, head, and cap - in that order), he/she is eliminated from the game; the winner is the last eliminated. The box also lists Rules for Teenagers and Adults, saying that they can play the old game of &quot;Ghost&quot; by adding letters to a word, with the player who completes the word having to add a part to his toy dunce.&#10;&#10;The die has six sides. Two stools, one body, one head, one dunce's cap, and a lucky horseshoe. You have to assemble the body in order. If you get the lucky horseshoe then you skip a turn, but all your opponents have to put on their next body part.&#10;&#10;This game is also similar to ScareCrow, which also has players building a figure in order, except that in that game the player who finishes first is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Games Research/Design (GR/D) returns Europa to its roots and revisits the best selling Europa title Fire in the East. The new game covers the same time period as the older ones (summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942) but uses a completely new Soviet OB, a new map, and the latest rules for the Europa system.&#10;&#10;Total War gives the Axis player the opportunity to see if he can improve on the massive offensive that pocketed and captured millions of Soviet soldiers. Can you take Moscow or Leningrad? Or are you condemned to suffer the Soviet winter short of victory? The Soviet player must build a strategic reserve large enough to stop the advancing Axis forces and throw them out of Russia. The Soviet player is aided by massive reinforcements that allow him to form new defensive lines in an attempt to slow down or stop the Axis armor thrusts.&#10;&#10;Total War is a historical game on the German invasion of the Soviet Union, from summer 1941 to spring 1942. It charts the titanic struggle of the largest ground campaign in World War II, from the Axis offensives that brought the Germans to the gates of Moscow to the Soviet winter counteroffensive that hurled them back.&#10;&#10;Total War is a two-player game. One side controls the forces of Germany and its allies while the other controls the forces of the Soviet Union. The maps cover Eastern Europe and the western USSR from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the plains of Poland to the steppes along the Volga River. Ground units represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 120 aircraft. Naval units represent task forces of warships.&#10;&#10;Total War is a complete remake and updating of the classic Europa game, Fire in the East. The game&rsquo;s Soviet order of battle makes extensive use of formerly secret Kremlin information on the Red Army forces that fought the war. The game includes a Soviet order of battle for all of the USSR from 1939 to 1942 and is the more comprehensive game OB ever published on the Red Army in peace and war. The Axis order of battle also is updated, reflecting new research since the publication of Fire in the East. The rules for Total War incorporate the latest rules for the Europa system, with on-demand air power, armor effects, combined arms, and much more, recreating both the German blitzkrieg that captured entire Soviet armies and the Soviet deep operations that nearly splintered the invaders in the depth of the Russian winter.&#10;&#10;(from Games Research/Design (GR/D) web site:)&#10;&#10;&#10;The box, counters and maps were printed and sold without complete rules.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns rolling 3 dice and removing colored chips from hexagonal pyramid that is made from six triangular parts.

If there is no chip left on that number then the player takes any number of chips from numbers that add up to the total of the roll.  When a 13 is rolled the player must take chip that sits on top of the pyramid that is worth negative 13 points.  If a player is unable to take chips that add up to his or her number (ie. another 13 is rolled) then they must pass one of their colored chips to the person on their left.  In this way the &quot;minus 13&quot; chip can be passed on.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player rolls dice to determine how many points each colored chip is worth.  The player holding the &quot;minus 13&quot; chip subtracts the appropriate amount of points and the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Introduction text:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Games of GODZ is a unique and highly versatile game tool rather than a game in itself... the board is interpreted or subdivided in four different ways to allow the employment of different mathematical systems. Virtually all strategy game sin existence employ some method of mathematical logic thereby making it apparent &quot;the Games of GODZ&quot; is capable of utilizing many systems as the basis for a vast number of games.&#10;&#10;The blocks are generally considered to be people and are therefore colored according to the four major races of the world. A block has an opening in one of its faces. This is used to indicate masculinity or femininity, depending on how it is placed on the board.&quot;&#10;&#10;General rules explain different moves (where units move a number of squares equal to their value), &quot;trick moves&quot; (where units combine, merge, split, switch or piggyback), takes (capturing or converting the enemy), etc.. Specific rules tell which areas of the board are in play and what moves or takes are allowed. A deck of cards is used with some of the games.&#10;&#10;Some games are mainly &quot;movement&quot; games, where the players have to move pieces into enemy or objective spaces, while others are &quot;capture&quot; games, where player have to kill all or specific enemy pieces. An interesting game in the set is &quot;Cry&quot;, specifically for three players. One player plays with two other players, who are playing a different game, to score points by thwarting captures by either player - in effect, becoming a peacekeeper.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;- one board of 144 squares, divided into many colors and associations.&#10;- 124 plastic blocks: 4 sets of 31 blocks each in red, white, yellow and black. Each set is made up of 16 &quot;ones&quot; (blocks are 1 cubic unit or 1x1x1), 8 &quot;twos&quot; (1x1x2), 4 &quot;fours&quot; (2x2x1), 2 &quot;eights&quot; (2x2x2) and 1 &quot;sixteen&quot; (2x2x4).&#10;144 playing cards: 4 sets of 36 cards each marked in the same colors as the blocks (but not actually so colored) and with an associated letter (G for Brown, O for Red, D for White, and Z for Yellow). Cards are present in the same numbers as with the blocks, with five spares added to make 36 in a set.&#10;- one booklet of 14 pages of general rules and specific rules, as well as rules on how to play Chess and Checkers with the game set.&#10;- one sheet of directions on how to set up the first of the 11 games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adventures in the Dungeon is a small Dungeon-Crawler originally published within &quot;The Official Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Coloring Album.&quot;  The game's rules are cleverly placed at the bottom of each page, and are complimented by a map of the Dungeon in the center of the book.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 1-4 players, who will assume the role of characters seeking The Holy Talisman of St. Cuthbert.  The 4 characters (Paladin, Rangeress, Fighter, Wizard) each have different abilities.&#10;&#10;To find the Talisman, players must wander the Dungeon and face the creatures therein.  Combat is simulated with 2D6, and the players roll attacks for both themselves and their monstrous opponents.  The various monsters have special abilities, and the characters will need to coordinate their efforts carefully to make it through.&#10;&#10;Players win the Quest by finding the Talisman, and a scoring system is included based on how many monsters were slain, and how many characters survive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's catalog: &quot;Once again the German pocket-battleship is loose in the South Atlantic and the British player faces the challenge of finding and bringing her to battle. Graf Spee comes complete with die-cut counters, rules booklet, battle board and two movement boards.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another entry in the long line of AH Bismarck-style search and battle naval wargames, this one is very rare. As the name implies, it covers the search for the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; Graf Spee in 1939.&#10;&#10;With the usual low-quality Third Millenia components (especially the counters) and very simple rules, it is nevertheless a pretty fun game.&#10;&#10;Like AH Bismarck, Midway, et al, movement and search are conducted on the two identical map sheets, and battles are resolved on the battle and charts sheet. Turn order is:&#10;a. German player rolls for bad weather (no searches). German player moves.&#10;b. British player searches.&#10;c. British player moves.&#10;d. German player searches.&#10;e. If both in same hex, resolve battle.&#10;f. When all battles are resolved, advance the turn record and start over.&#10;&#10;The British can search the hexes ships are in, and one more hex within four hexes (search aircraft). Aircraft carriers (4 British and 1 French) can search the six adjacent hexes. The German player can search the hexes ships are in, plus the Graf Spee has two search aircraft that can search within four hexes. The German player can also search any other three hexes on the board (u-boat reports?).&#10;&#10;Both players must keep track of fuel expenditures, and both have supply ships available to re-fuel (or they can re-fuel in ports). Every other turn the German player can roll on a table to sink one (or two) merchantmen. If he sinks any, he then rolls on another table to see how many turns later he must inform the British player in which hex the sinking occurred. The German player must sink a number of merchant ships and escape the map to win; otherwise the British player wins.&#10;&#10;No indication is given of map or time scale. I suspect search board turns are one day. 20 turns to a game.&#10;&#10;Components: two identical 14&quot; x 24&quot; hex-gridded search map sheets, one 14&quot; x 24&quot; battle and chart sheet, one rule folder (five small pages), plus 119 of 1/2-inch die-cut unit counters. &#10;I think there were 24 actual ship counters, some &quot;?&quot; s and &quot;search&quot; counters, and a bunch of blanks (my copy is unfortunately incomplete).&#10;&#10;",

Byzantion was the ancient name of the capital city and Byzantines after the former name of the Empire's capital city, Constantinople.&#10;&#10;Zatrikion is the game of Byzantine chess. This chess has seven variations according to the more ancient board game of &quot;Pessoi&quot;.&#10;&#10;These versions have all the known pawns of the modern chess (&quot;Mad Queen&quot; was the first name) and in some variations there are many other pawns connecting to the philosophy of the Byzantine era.&#10;&#10;Played with Byzantine Greek era letters for 2 players as the modern chess.&#10;In some versions are three dices with the ancient shapes of Byzantium era and in this version the highest roll starts the game.&#10;&#10;Zatrikion has the following items:&#10;1. Seven colorful Boards (Grids).&#10;2. The pawns of each player with different color. In Byzantium era the colors was the veneti (red color) and the greens (green color). These were the political parties in Byzantium era. &#10;3. Three dices with shapes.&#10;4. Other material.&#10;5.

    "Description": "From the Three Monkey Games website:www.monkeypoker1.com&#10;&#10;Once again, the geniuses at Three Monkey Games have turned a classic game on its ear and came up with something BRAND NEW! Introducing MonkeyWinks! The popular indoor game that is easy to learn for kids, and formidable enough to appeal to adults wanting a special challenge.&#10;&#10;Like its predecessor, MonkeyWinks is a game played with sets of small, thin discs (called winks) lying on a special felt mat. Players use a larger disc (called a squidger) to pop a smaller disc into flight by pressing down on one side of the smaller disc. The basic goal of an informal game (easily playable by young children) is to cause the smaller discs to land inside a pot or cup. The formal game has a more robust set of rules, goals, and strategies suitable to serious competition for adults and older children.&#10;&#10;MonkeyWinks is interactive fun for all players, pros and beginners alike. However, MonkeyWinks is a lot more than just a flipping disc game. For example, the included &quot;Go Bananas&quot;&trade; cards incorporate random events and player changes inspired by everyday kids games. &#10;www.monkeypoker1.com&#10;&#10;",

Each successful shot is worth ten points, but also more often than not gives the quaffle to your opponent.

Whichever player catches the ball is awarded 150 points, and the game ends.&#10;The game, which runs on two C batteries, provides sound effects during the game and also keeps track of the score, which can get into the thousands.&#10;&#10;",

The garden is set up and the pears are distributed, depending on the number of players pears are put onto the tree, always at one side, or a player hands on pears to be put up. Pears must be taken with one hand and always from the same side, and be put onto a branch of the three.

    "Description": "ElectraWoman &amp; DynaGirl must reach the Secret Scientific Formula space in their ElectraCar and return to ElectraBase while using different combinations of Computer Power symbol cards to thwart the bad guys:  The Sorcerer, The Pharaoh, The Empress of Evil, The Spider Lady, Glitter Rock, and Ali Baba.&#10;&#10;Each Trouble Space depicts a different combination of Computer Power symbols needed in order to overcome it.  Computer Powers include ElectraData, ElectraForce, ElectraBeam, and a few Super Power cards (a combination of all three).  If a player does not have the right combination of Computer Powers for that particular Trouble Space, they must remain in it until the correct combination is achieved.  A card is drawn every turn, regardless of whether a player can move.&#10;&#10;Additional cards used to obstruct opposing players include ElectraPush and ElectraComp Blocked.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the short-lived Sid and Marty Krofft live action children&rsquo;s television series from 1976, starring Deidre Hall in her first major television role as ElectraWoman and Judy Strangis as DynaGirl.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "April 1863&#10;Union General Ulysses S. Grant embarks on another attempt to wrest control of the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River from the rebels; the fortress city of Vicksburg. Numerous other attempts have failed miserably. The ill-fated campaign from the north, short circuited by that devil Forrest's raid on Grant's supply lines. The jinxed canal, dug through the swamps in an attempt to bypass the city's guns. Now another plan is in motion. Grant will march his Army of the Tennessee through the Louisiana swamps, sneak his ships past the rebel fortress in a daring run of the gauntlet, conduct the largest amphibious invasion in U.S. history, separate himself from his supply base, wedge himself in between two rebel armies, and seize control of the city from the east! All the while battling politicians and public opinion as much as the Confederate armies. Somehow, his daring plan worked, and the Mississippi once again flowed unvexed to the sea.&#10;&#10;But things could have been different. Find out how....&#10;&#10;This operational level game uses the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligence of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location. The game board spans the campaign topography, from the swamps of eastern Louisiana to the mountainous terrain around Jackson Mississippi. A point to point movement system is employed on a 20 x 24 playing map. Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kruzno is an abstract strategy game usually played with two players on a hexagonally tiled board. Though the rules are extremely simple (three minutes to learn for most players), the number of possible moves and interactions are comparable to chess.&#10;&#10;Kruzno uses standard chess pieces (bishops, knights and rooks) but is more closely related to hexagonal checkers and R.C. Bell's Jungle Game. Like the Jungle Game, capturing is non-transitive: bishops capture knights; knights capture rooks; rooks capture bishops. This split between offense and defense means that most standard strategies of move and capture have to be scrapped or reworked.&#10;&#10;Game variants include versions with reduced number of pieces for faster play and expansion sets for three players.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.kruzno.com/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gulf War is a Malaysian board game from 1990, using as its theme the then ongoing war in the Persian gulf. Its game mechanism is borrowed from An Qi (literally dark chess, because pieces are covered at the start and so unknown to the players: it is a game played using Xiangqi pieces). Each side has a number of pieces ranking from President down to Hostages or Civilians, and also Bombs, Fighter Planes and Oil-fields. Like An Qi (and for that matter games like LuZhanJunQi and Stratego), the pieces have a ranked order and higher ranked pieces eliminate lower ranked ones. Pieces start face-down and are randomly distributed in alternate colors on the 6X6 square grid that is the game board. Players take turn to expose pieces and once exposed, pieces may be moved one space orthogonally. Enemy pieces are eliminated by a higher or equal ranked piece moving on to them. There are special rules for specific pieces - the Assassin may eliminate the President, Bombs neutralize (i.e. both pieces get eliminated) all other pieces, capturing an Oil-field/Hostages/Civilians piece allows substitution of your own piece for a previously eliminated piece, etc. The Fighter Plane has the capture of the Pao (Cannon) in An Qi - just like in Xiangqi, it jumps over another piece to land on a distal piece and capture it. &#10;The game is won by the player who is able to capture both the opposing President and Vice-president.&#10;&#10;The game has interesting details - one player takes the Iraqi side and the other is the Allied side. The President, Vice-president and Ally pieces are different and have pictures appropriate to the side (Saddam, Bush, Gaddfi and Thatcher all feature). Another difference is that the Iraqis have a Civilians piece but the Allied forces has a Hostages piece instead (in the game, they are equivalent). The board comes with two sides - one side has yellow and blue circles to show where the pieces go. The other has the same 6X6 grid superimposed on a background map showing the Persian gulf.&#10;&#10;",

Red, White and Blue designs across the battleground are called Line of Shot.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 9 white and 9 black washers that represent Battleships from two Navies.&#10;&#10;Each navy changes form (moves) in turn. Only one move is allowed at a time. The sinking of an opponents ship occurs when you manage to get two of your ships on the same line of shot as that of an enemy ship, with your nearest ship half way between the enemy and your back ship. When the range is so short that your two ships and the enemy lay in 3 consecutive positions then the enemy is captured and not sunk. When that happens you may remove the captured ship and place any of your ships in one of the starting positions. This allows you to fix placement errors by returning your ship to the start.&#10;&#10;",
