    "Description": "Scrabble clone that can be dated to about 1950, before the first official Swedish edition of Scrabble. As in Scrabble, gameplay consists of taking turns to place letter tiles forming words on the board to score points, then refilling your hand of tiles. Once there are no more tiles in the stock, the first player to empty their hand ends the game and earns a bonus. Some specifics:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The board is 17x17 and there are 101 letter tiles.&#10;     Each player has a hand of 8 tiles.&#10;     &quot;Hooking&quot; is allowed.&#10;     If the rules are taken literally, a player may only exchange tiles if they cannot play at all, and must then exchance all of their tiles.&#10;     Base scoring is 5p per vowel and 10p per consonant. White squares score triple, while numbered squares provide a flat but often substantial bonus. It also says you score double for playing in the coloured quadrant corresponding to your tile holder, but the tile holders provided are not coloured.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

No worries however as the Twilight Express will leave the station tomorrow and the next day as well!&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the one who, with a clever strategy, robs the most money from the train!&#10;&#10;Each player secretly chooses cities where their bandits and coals should be sent. When all plans have been made, the players simultaneously reveal their plans and then send their bandits and coals to the chosen cities. Actions will be carried out only in the cities where player's bandits or coals have been placed in a row from the main station in City # 1.&#10;&#10;Depending on the cities chosen by the players, they can rob cargo by repelling security guards, sell collected cargo, or even steal large amounts of gold at the gold mine.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the cargo tiles run out.

The playing board is clear and simple to use, keeping a focus on the action, front-and-centre.&#10;&#10;The board is split with teams facing each other. There are six slots on the board for active players, a field ruler to indicate the position of the ball on the field, and slots for  Player decks and General Play Cards.&#10;&#10;The middle of the game board visualises the action happening around the ball. Sure there are 15 players on each team, but only a handful are in action at any time.&#10;&#10;Each phase of play involves each team taking one action, such as running, bringing in support players, tackling, kicking, etc, and then resolving the outcome. For example, if the attacking team chooses to run (action), they simply move the field marker on the ruler. Play then goes to the defending team who can try and tackle (action), a successful tackle goes to a Ruck, and an unsuccessful tackle means play returns to the attacker.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You bring your ally creatures to life by choosing which of the cards in your hand will be used for their attack and defence. Each of your creatures will be given a turn each round, which they use by attacking or blocking an enemy creature.&#10;&#10;You and your virtual opponent take turns sending creatures into the arena, with enemies in one row and allies in another row underneath. The goal of your enemies is to kill you and anything that gets in their way. Your allies benefit from your spells and can combine some attacks and defences, as well as save certain turns for later use. But your enemies are relentless and have a greater range of attack and defence.&#10;&#10;To win, you must play through the deck and defeat the entire horde of attacking enemies before your life is reduced to zero. You lose if you fail to achieve this objective for any reason.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Let's just say if you think you have the best hand, you're probably wrong.&#10;&#10;Combine your two cards with the five community cards to make the best five card hand. Be the only player left by collecting all the NUTSO bucks.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a starting stack of NUTSO bucks totaling $15,000. Determine who will deal the first hand by dealing one card at a time to each player. First player dealt a NUTSO card deals first. The deal then alternates clockwise for the rest of the game unless someone plays the Pass The Button wild card and takes the deal. Helpful card: You can use the dealer card in the deck to keep track of who is dealing.&#10;&#10;Before each hand is dealt, all players, except the dealer place $500 NUTSO bucks in the middle. The dealer then gives 2 card to each player and deals 5 cards face down in the middle, these are the community cards. After reviewing the 2 cards in their hands players can either stay in the game by placing the same amount of NUTSO bucks that started the hand or quit the hand. The decision to bet or fold starts with the player left to the dealer. After betting is over the dealer turns over the first 3 of the community card for another round of betting or folding. Each player is trying to build the winning hand using a combination of the 2 player cards and the 5 community cards. Dealer than turns over the fourth card for another round of betting and folding. Final community card is turned over for a final round of betting and folding. The showdown begins when all remaining players will expose their hands and the best hand wins all the NUTSO bucks in the middle. Winning hands look a lot like poker hands.&#10;&#10;The real beauty of NUTSO are the wild cards. When played they can take down the strongest hand or turn a losing hand into a winner. Then again if you play one it might ruin your chances of winning. Who knows? That's why this game is called NUTSO.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The West was no longer the West, it was the WILD WEST!&#10;&#10;Now, the year is 1885. The Wild family has made a fortune through various &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; strategies, &ldquo;business&rdquo; ventures, and &ldquo;community&rdquo; projects. More importantly, the Wild family has emblazoned their name on both a territory and an era. After decades of pure wildness, the Wilds are tuckered out and ready for retirement. The family has grown tired of being ridiculously, filthy, stinking rich and they&rsquo;ve done everything there is to do in the West.&#10;&#10;After a raucous family council, the Wilds have decided to give away half of their fortune and head east to retire as New York City slickers. The family wants someone with basic mathematical skills who is also able to wisely manage money without going into debt. Most importantly, though, the Wilds want someone to carry on their Wild legacy in the West; a person with rambunctious spunkiness and tons of true grit.&#10;&#10;The family has designed a simple competition to determine who will win the Wild Family Fortune and the glorious title of WILD ONE. Challengers have come from near and far to participate in this unprecedented event. As a challenger, your task is to manage basic income and expenses and stay as close to &ldquo;1&rdquo; as possible without going broke or into debt. Of course, there are other challengers attempting to do the exact same thing. Besides being known for their immense wealth, the Wild family also has a reputation for being very &ldquo;hands-on.&rdquo; During the contest, they will get down and dirty to help their favorite challenger win.

The column has three positions - front, middle and back. In general, warriors at the front of the column attack warriors at the front of their opponents column. Other warriors can support an attack.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect five trophies. Trophies are won by removing all of the warriors in your opponent's column. Warriors are removed from a column through a strategic mix of attacks and invocations.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, with each turn consisting of four actions. The player may chose from a list of five possible actions, which can be played in any number and order up to a total of four. The actions are as follows:&#10;&#10;1) Draw: The player draws three cards from their deck.&#10;2) Deploy: The player places a warrior into their battle column. The warrior may be a single card or multiple cards of the same type. Warriors made of multiple cards are stronger.&#10;3) Attack: A ready warrior at the front of your column attacks the warrior at the front of your opponent's column.&#10;4) Strengthen: Cards of the same type can be added to a warrior.&#10;5) Invoke: Place a card from your hand into the discard pile to activate the invocation power on a card.

Players use multi-suited cards to win tricks, but winning too much too quickly can make one vulnerable to being purged when the regime changes. Players must anticipate purges to retain influence (won cards) and end on top. Each round takes about 15 minutes, with multiple rounds for optional extended play.&#10;&#10;Based around the political turmoil of the French Revolution, Talleyrand is named after Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord, an incorrigible gambler and political schemer who managed to ride out the manifold purges and executions of the revolution, while maintaining multiple positions in many of the successive governments and lining his pockets. Always able to escape with his head and reputation (mostly) intact just prior to everything falling apart, Talleyrand held key roles during the reign of Louis XVI and the Revolutionary Government; he was at Napoleon's side when he toppled the Directorate and later when he declared himself Emperor, and even managed to survive Napoleon's downfall thereafter with a career intact in the restoration of the Monarchy &mdash; twice. Talleyrand was, above all, a survivor, and this game celebrates that trait.&#10; &mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each &ldquo;Throws Card&rdquo; has a value from 0 to 6, and collecting the right sets of matching cards can boost your end game scoring.&#10;&#10;When two or more players try to catch the same throws, a roll-off occurs. Highest roll wins all the throws!&#10;&#10;&quot;Throw Me Something&quot; cards are specific advantages that allow players to break the rules. You earn them when you lose roll-offs.

Players try to develop their enterprise and turn setbacks into innovations, with a take that element in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Players draw to their hand and then play from their hand. Some cards have special enhancing effects to already played cards. Most of the cards are split diagonally, with a positive side, and a black negative side. When a player puts the card into their tableau, they can turn it to show the positive benefits, or turn it to show the negative failures. Players must build on their failures before they can win.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MatriO is a card and board game based on matrix multiplication. The game is played with standard (usually miniature-sized) playing cards and a special board, using specially designed markers to maintain player scores.&#10;&#10;The board is laid out with three grids, a 3x4 grid and a 4x3 grid of card-sized trays and a 3x3 grid where players' &quot;dot markers&quot; are placed during the game. One of the card-tray grids is positioned to the left of the 3x3 grid, and the other card-tray grid is positioned above the 3x3 grid. The trays are labeled by card suit, a total of six trays for each suit.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt 13 cards (jokers are left in the deck, and the 4 of clubs and 10 of diamonds are discarded in advance of dealing). Players take turns placing a card in one of the trays on the board. If there are empty trays labeled with a given suit, then cards of that suit may only be played in one of those empty trays, and suited cards may not be played in an empty tray labeled with a different suit. Jokers may be played anywhere at any time.&#10;&#10;When a player completes a row-column combination by filling the last empty tray of a row or column, the player places one of their &quot;dot makers&quot; in the cell of the 3x3 grid corresponding to the row and column combination they have just completed. The sum of the products of the correspondingly positioned cards in the row and column become that makers &quot;dot score&quot;. This score can change throughout the game as other cards are laid in trays in that row and column.&#10;&#10;When all 9 cells in the 3x3 grid are filled by players' dot markers, any player with no dot markers on the board is out of the game and their cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;Remaining players continue to place their cards. When those players have plaid all their cards, the winner of the game is the player whose dot scores total is highest.&#10;&#10;Numerical scores of cards are as follows: Queen of Spades: 13, all other black face cards 10, all black number cards their own numerical value. All red face cards are -10, and all red number cards are negative their own value. Jokers are 0.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are many tales of the Frozen City, and not all of them tell of battles between rival wizards. Often, the greatest adventures are those that pit a wizard and his trusty warband against the myriad perils found amidst the ruins of Felstad.&#10;&#10;This new supplement for Frostgrave presents full rules for playing solo and co-operative games in which feuds and skirmishes of wizards take a back seat to the exploration and unlocking of the mysteries of the city. These include guidelines for both dungeon crawls and adventuring in the ruins, new traps, unique random encounters, and four multi-scenario mini-campaigns to get players started.&#10;&#10;Why should wizards fight amongst themselves? There is plenty of treasure for all and the Frozen City is enemy enough!&#10;&#10;",

The Advanced Game introduces air and naval units as well as additional specialized units like cruise missiles, laser defenses and political troops. And beware, there are rules for nuclear, biological and chemical warfare!&#10;&#10;The three 11&quot;x17&quot;map boards represent battle grounds in California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The 480 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show brigade and divisional level forces of the US, the Warsaw Pact (Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland and Czeckoslovakia), the People's Asian Alliance (China, North Korea and Viet Nam), and the Organization of Central American States (Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The brotherhood of the Night&rsquo;s Watch has pledged to keep Westeros safe from all the horrors that live north of The Wall. Forsaking any life they might&rsquo;ve had before joining, they are entirely committed to their vows. Within their number are the Builders. They maintain the fortifications in and around The Wall, as well as all the arms and armor used by the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Their forges create some of the best and hardiest gear, including the valuable crossbow. While there are the massive ballistae that act as siege weapons, as well as the Scorpions that are light enough to be taken to battle afield, they also create hand-held crossbows. They heavily train with them, becoming a fighting force of their own. Next month, Night&rsquo;s Watch players will be able to add the Builder Crossbowmen to their forces. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how they operate.&#10;Being the ones that built the crossbows, the Builders are also experts in their use, having trained intensely with them. This results in the to-hit number for their crossbow attack being a 3+ and rolling seven dice when at full ranks, and even when one rank has been destroyed. The power in these &ldquo;little instruments of death&rdquo; is so great that they can attack at Long Range and apply Sundering. The crossbows aren&rsquo;t the only armaments the Builders have. They also can go into battle wielding longswords. While they are competent in their use, the Builder Crossbowmen would still prefer to reach out and touch the enemy at range. And, if an enemy wants to do them engage via a charge, the unit&rsquo;s Ready! Aim! Fire! order lets them get an extra attack in before the enemy closes in.&#10;On the defensive side of things, the unit shows their weakness. With a Defense Save of 6+ and a Morale value of 7+, this is a unit that really does not want the enemy to attack them. Their moderate speed of 5 also means that they can&rsquo;t outrun most enemy units wanting to chase them down. However, the Builder Crossbowmen would really hope that their last-ditch attack thins the enemy ranks as much as possible.&#10;The Builder Crossbowmen are a perfect unit for Night&rsquo;s Watch players who want to add some ranged attack damage to their force. They should be kept well away from the enemy, but within range of their trusty crossbows. Supported by units able to take a melee hit if necessary, they can do a lot to bring victory to the Black.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Not wanting to stick around and get caught up in an unprofitable war, they take a 100-year loop out into deep space and back in stasis. They awake to find no new wormgate, fractured civilizations, and broken cities. The Captain's first order of business is to find some real food to eat. And to figure out what the frak is going on.&#10;&#10;Dark Metal: Mercenaries in the Deep is a solo or co-op, open miniatures science fiction tabletop adventure RPG. Players can create their own squad leader and allies, or select from one of the pre-made character sets to get started a little quicker. Movement is either distance or hex based and the board is created by the player based on the scenario's instructions. The gamer provides their own minis, terrain, and dice from their existing collection to create the experience.&#10;&#10;Players go through a series of missions and scenarios linked together with progressive narrative elements on their journey to investigate what has happened within the star system since they left. They will grow in abilities, knowledge, and equipment as they are sent out on mission after mission. Player builds range from heavily armored warriors bristling with weaponry, to lithe bio engineered splicers dashing across the terrain to engage in close combat, to half metal cybernetic beings aiming high caliber weapons downrange to plink off enemies at a distance.&#10;&#10;Dark Metal will be initially available as a print and play game with optional accessories.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the War phase they get enough turns to move each unit once. Victory is achieved when you destroy all your opponent's units, get over 1000 Faith, or by having the most Faith at the end of four rounds.&#10;&#10;Playing Units and Objects is free, but when units are destroyed they give Faith to your opponent, making stronger units riskier.

There are many smaller details which are the same, e.g. having only armor units exert a zone of control.&#10;&#10;Five scenarios are provided. Four differ only in length - they cover from Summer 1939 to Spring 1945, Winter 1945-6, Winter 1940-1, and Winter 1941-2 - and can be played by from two to six players. The fifth scenario covers the same period as the first one but players are free to make any alliances they wish; this requires six players.&#10;&#10;A few optional rules are provided, such as having Turkey and Spain enter as minor allies, building new production sources, partisans, etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1811. Tecumseh, a Shawnee leader from the Ohio country, and his brother, the prophet Tenskwatawa, have drawn together an intertribal coalition of Native Americans, with the village of Tippecanoe in the northwest Indiana Territory as its primary power center. This confederation of Shawnee, Lenape, Sauk, Miami, Pottawatomie, and other Native Americans, joined together for mutual aid and defense, is deemed a threat by the US Government, who decide it must be put down before it grows strong enough to resist white settlement of the Northwest Territory. Goals: The Native player must first gather and arm a coalition of warriors, and then lead a defense of the Tecumseh Confederacy&rsquo;s capital at Tippecanoe. If the Native player succeeds, the US may be forced to come to peaceful terms with the Tecumseh Confederacy and treat it as a legitimate political entity to be reckoned with. The US player must march and deploy a force strong enough to overcome Native defenses at Tippecanoe. If the US player succeeds, the Confederacy will be scattered and the Northwest Territory will eventually be settled by whites.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in two stages: preparation and battle. The preparation stage is distinct for each player, but both preparation stages involve creating the deck that will be used to play the battle stage against the other player.&#10;&#10;The game is a history-based deck-building card game. The main thing that makes it distinct from most such games is that the deck is built in-game by each player, and the two players each have a different method of building a deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arcadia Tenebra is a heavily story-driven mystery adventure RPG board game in which you assume the role of the investigator on the quest of stopping a serial killer before The Blood Moon rises.&#10;&#10;The story is set in the late 19th century, in a fictional province of Arcadia Tenebra.  A part of The Hungarian-Austrian Empire, Arcadia Tenebra is located somewhere in a south-eastern Europe, today commonly known as Balkan Peninsula. The setting is not exactly historically accurate: it is partially inspired by history and then fictionally upgraded, with a twist of absurd and dark humor on the trail of Monty Python and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That&rsquo;s why players will meet Nikola Tesla or T-1800, half-man half-steam machine (or vice versa?), who roams Arcadian forests in search for some chick named Marah Pommor that no one never heard of.&#10;&#10;Become one of six antihero investigators with their respectively unique special abilities and explore Arcadia Tenebra following the Leads and collecting the Clues, as each of those will bring you one step closer to busting the mad killer. As the story unfolds, soon enough you'll find out that in Arcadia Tenebra everybody's hiding something and nobody likes you. Moreover, you&rsquo;ll have to face wild animals, marauders, imperial agents and even mythical creatures &ndash; as your investigation will eventually carry you beyond the veils of the rational world.&#10;&#10;Embark on this adventurous journey and meet some unforgettable NPCs. Intimidate, Outsmart or Charm them to obtain the Clues and their piece of the story.  Or do them a Favour in exchange for the Clues. Solve riddles, crack safes, fight your way through or use your wits and charm to progress. Decide whether you will get involved in local politics or even stand in the way of great empires. Or choose to keep your knees low and let politics unfold without your interference. Unlock new possibilities to boost your PC's abilities as you explore new locations in Arcadia Tenebra.&#10;&#10;Build your character by facing the consequences of your action (Luckies &amp; Unluckies Cards) and prepare for the final showdown. If things get too hard, team up with other players and solve the case together before the time runs out! And never forget to roleplay, because every time you successfully roleplay your character, you get a significant bonus on a roll check.&#10;&#10;Arcadia Tenebra has its roots in old CRPGs such as Fallout, Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each year, the world&rsquo;s most elite players gather on a tropical island somewhere in the Pacific. The eccentric billionaire who organizes this tournament has quite a fondness for the &ldquo;Old West&rdquo; and has gone to great lengths to transform the center of the island into an authentic western town, and he encourages participants to dress accordingly...&#10;&#10;As one of the players invited to compete in Western Tropic, your goal is to be the first player to reach 60 points and claim victory, fortune, and fame.&#10;&#10;Western Tropic uses a 5x5 grid that acts as a communal, but ever-changing set of cards that players use to create the best possible poker hand. Much like Texas Hold'em, each player has hole cards that are unique to them. But, the game uses an extra (third) hole card each round that can be traded in, to grant various actions such as moving your character around the grid, or changing the grid, altogether.&#10;&#10;Each suit gives you different abilities, and those can be used in unique ways to either improve your hand or obstruct others. There are also 8 jokers that can provide additional chaos.&#10;&#10;Western Tropic takes the language of poker, and combines it with popular game mechanisms like deck-building and area control.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
