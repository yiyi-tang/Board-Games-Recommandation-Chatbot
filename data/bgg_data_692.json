With Phase 10 MOD, the Phase to be completed is specific to EACH player. Complete the Phase to get to the next hand but if you don't, you'll have to try, try again!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Phase 10 is a game similar to rummy where players race to finish all ten &quot;phases.&quot; The phases are completed by collecting sets of numbered cards, runs of numbered cards and finally flushes of the same color. The first player to complete their own personal tenth phase is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest total points is the winner. If there is still a tie, the tied players play out their own tenth phase again, with the first player to go out winning.&#10;&#10;The new additions in this MOD version are: An attractive, yellow plastic travel case and four &quot;Phase Reference Cards&quot; randomly dealt to every player, each with a different order of phases. The phases themselves remain the same, but the order in which the players attempt them varies card by card.&#10;&#10;",

The pinch hitter is placed in the bull pen and moved up one space as they are used. Place the out disc at the top of the playing field and move it as outs are made. The manager whose team is at bat should place his first batter at home plate (H). Take the dice and say aloud which play he is trying from the ten selection at the top of the game board. Example: Aloud &quot;Bunt for hit&quot;, now pitch the dice. Combine the face value of the dice roll and find the result of the play on the board under the play selection. Each time a base runner crosses home plate one run is scored to that team.&#10;&#10;",

Each team (blue or green) has 56 cards types of ships, aircraft or 41 cards marked &quot;water&quot;. But the rules are differently from the game Battleship.&#10;&#10;Each team has 56 cards described below:&#10;&#10;1 aircraft-carrier&#10;2 submarines&#10;3 frigates&#10;4 corvettes&#10;5 planes and&#10;41 water cards.&#10;&#10;Each participant puts the 56 cards covered plugged into its own board (green or blue depending on the participant's team). The first choose a number and fires.&#10;&#10;If he hits the water, it is the turn of the other participant.&#10;If he hits an enemy unit, he is entitled to withdraw more cards of the adversary according to the chart below:&#10;&#10;air-craft: more 5 hits (he can turn 5 foe cards)&#10;submarine: more 4 hits &#10;frigate: more 3 hits &#10;corvette: more 2 hits&#10;plane: more 1 hit.&#10;&#10;As he hits more enemy units, he will be entitled to accumulate more cards. However, the first time he hits surface water, it loses the remaining shots and passes to the opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;Example:&#10;&#10;The player turn the card in box 33 and hit an air-craft. Then he can turn 5 more cards. The he choose the card in box 27 and hits a frigate. So he can flip more 7 cards (the remaining 4 plus 3). But then, he choose the box 15 and hits water. At this moment he passes to the opponent's turn losing the remaining shots.&#10;&#10;Ther game ends when one participant hits the entire enemy fleet.&#10;&#10;",

Players have two minutes to provide the most compelling argument as to why their chosen CARD wins a controversy selected by a d20 roll from a list provided with the game. The player who rolls the die to choose the controversy also makes the first argument. An independent iudex (judge) determines whose argument is more compelling. That player is awarded a point.

If the spinner comes up &quot;win&quot; then you win, if it doesn't, the game goes on.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players roll dice trying to match fruit machine symbols. They can only move if they match at least two symbols.

They can then bank this money or gamble it by rolling a special six-sided hexagonal metal dice.&#10;&#10;The game is mainly of interest for the incorporation of different luck-based elements: four six-sided dice with fruit symbols, three six-sided dice with numbers, one six-sided metal hexagonal dice to gamble with (which has sides labelled &quot;lose,&quot; &quot;double win,&quot; and &quot;treble win&quot;), and one six-sided spinner.&#10;&#10;",

Same objective as draughts: to eliminate all your opponents pieces, and same rules as draughts / checkers -- jump over opposing pieces to capture. But Quadraughts requires a lot more skill and strategic nous.&#10;&#10;Unique 13 by 13 square grid board with 4 sets of different coloured draught pieces.&#10;&#10;For 4 players or 2 teams, for all the family, aged 6+&#10;&#10;Players: 4 (or 2 playing 2 colors each)&#10;Board: 13 x 13 squares alternating black and white. Some squares have coloured spots.&#10;Pieces: 12 each player (in 4 distinct colors)&#10;Placement: The pieces (men) are placed on the squares on the first three rows in front of each player, on the appropriately colored spots.&#10;Moves: Men move diagonally across the board on the black squares, one square at a time, in a forward direction. Kings (see below) may move forwards or backwards.&#10;Commencement: The players decide who should begin and players take it in turns to move, in a clockwise direction.&#10;Capture: A piece is captured by jumping over it and removing it from the board. Several pieces may be captured in a single move by making successive jumps with a single piece. The men captured do not all have to be of the same color. If a capture is possible, it must be made. Failure to do so results in &ldquo;huffing&rdquo;, the removal of the offending piece by the opposing player.&#10;Crowning: A man which reaches the farthest row of the board, ON A SPOTTED SQUARE is crowned as a king by placing a second man on top of it. It can then move both forwards and backwards. If the man lands on a square (on the farthest row) that is not spotted it returns to any spotted square of the first row of the board to begin again. If all the spotted squares on the first row are full than the man moves to the nearest spotted square to the first row.&#10;End: The game ends when three players either lose all their men or can no longer move.&#10;&#10;",

But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.&#10;&#10;Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.&#10;&#10;Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, two players take turns drawing and placing cards, and construct a gridwork of tracks on the table over which their commuters and other pieces navigate.&#10;&#10;The game uses 2 decks of ordinary playing cards, though more (or I guess fewer) could be done. Each player has a chess king representing his &quot;commuter&quot; and several checkers that act as blockers.&#10;&#10;One player is &quot;black&quot; the other &quot;red&quot;. The players simply take turns drawing cards from the deck, and the player whose color matches the card chooses how to use it. The cards can be used to build a road grid, or to move your commuter, or a blocker. You can only move your commuter onto a card by discarding a drawn card with an equal or higher number. Thus, players try to use high cards either to hinder the opponent's moves, or to move their own commuter. Low cards are used to build out one's own road grid.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Panzer Grenadier: Nihon Silk&#10;&#10;After observing German successes in early 1940 with parachute drops, the warriors of Nihon (Japan) ignited their own airborne program. In keeping with their traditional rivalry, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army competed against each other with equivalent paratroop formations. These lightly armed parachute units were intended to assault coastal areas, support amphibious landings or seize enemy airfields and other strategic objectives. They were not meant to become entangled in heavy, pitched land battles. However, their operational use would prove to be contrary to this doctrine.&#10;&#10;Nihon Silk is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier system from designer Jay Townsend. It takes players from early 1942 through late summer of 1945, as numerous Allied nations tackle the Japanese paratroopers. And for you tank aficionados, we&rsquo;ve included the battle of San Manuel in the Philippines in 1945. This supplement also adds 165 fabulous new playing pieces and markers to your Panzer Grenadier fun! That&rsquo;s right &mdash; Dutch troops and tankettes, Japanese tanks and other armored vehicles, airfield and oil refinery markers, and even an Australian Brigadier (in shorts, of course)! Nihon Silk requires ownership of Kokoda Trail, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Guadalcanal and Afrika Korps to play.&#10;&#10;",

Players only have control over the generals they are playing. All other units are restricted to a color coded group of orders that are given to them, and can only break out of those restrictions when given new orders.

A player can also play one of his own special cards, which will also trigger some special effect: no player scores points, the player may retrieve on of his played cards, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players are out of cards, or when the tribal deck runs out of cards. The player who has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Yakari and his friends start at the location furthest away from the village.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the a player may perform a single action.
