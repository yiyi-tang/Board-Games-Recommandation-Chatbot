    "Description": "In Runaround, your goal is to get your pieces out of your home, all the way around the board, and back again before your opponent.  Sounds familiar, right?  The twist is in the board:  It's a &quot;U&quot; shaped board.  Your pieces frequently pass your opponent's pieces on the other side of the wall.  If your piece lands across the wall from one of your opponent's pieces, you swap places.  Often, this'll jump you ahead and push your opponent back.  As you play, you'll uncover a remarkable depth of strategy from this simple roll-and-move game.&#10;&#10;Runaround is a game for two players.  Runaround uses a six-sided die, five pawns per player, and a custom board.  A two-player game takes about 40 minutes to play.  Runaround is appropriate for ages 9 and up.&#10;&#10;",

The second variant has players move a shared pawn along the tiles, tying to recall what's on the tile the pawn lands on.  The third variant has all players write down what they can remember, then comparing answers.&#10;&#10;16 Memories is a game for two to four players, although you could probably play it with five.  16 Memories uses a pawn, a die, a one minute timer, a custom board, and a custom set of tiles. A four-player game takes about 5 minutes to play.  16 Memories is  appropriate for Ages 7 and up, but all the players should be age-peers (A parent against several children would have an unfair advantage.).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Steamwork Arena is a quick playing, diceless, customizable, miniature-based fighting game.  You're the pilot of a steamwork mecha in an arena battle with one or more other mecha.  During play, you move your mecha's miniature around an un-gridded playing area, attacking and being attacked by your opponent(s).&#10;&#10;Here's the big gimmick: You have a special card for your mecha.  This card is called a template.  Your template keeps track of your health.  It also keeps track of which one of 5 modes you're in.  Your mode dictates your attack, defense, energy, movement, and the range of your ranged attacks.  During play, you'll shift from mode to mode as your needs change.  As you take damage, modes will &quot;shut down&quot; and become unavailable to you.  You win the game by dealing enough damage to your opponent(s) to shut down all of their modes.&#10;&#10;Here's the small gimmick: There are no dice.  During play, you'll spend energy to attack and defend.  To do this, you hide energy tokens in your hands and your opponent gets to pick a hand.  The number of tokens in the selected hand determines how strong your attack or defense is.  All tokens in both hands get spent.  This &quot;pick-a-hand&quot; mechanic encourages bluffing and strategic play that's atypical for miniature games like this.&#10;&#10;Steamwork Arena is a game for two to four players, although you could probably play it with more.  Steamwork Arena uses miniatures, a large flat surface, small tokens, custom templates, and paper clips.  A two-player game takes about 20 minutes to play.  Steamwork Arena is appropriate for Ages 12 and up.&#10;&#10;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/474&#10;&#10;",

Historically the Romans usually raced 4, 8 or 12 chariots.&#10;Each player controls one or more units. A unit can be a chariot OR a driver that survived a crashed chariot.&#10;During a turn each player moves their unit one at a time in the following order decided by track position: The current race leading unit moves first each turn. If more than 1 unit is in the same row, then dice to decide the order of movement for the units in that row.  Highest roll wins; re-rolling ties. If the leading chariot has crashed and the driver survived, it is still considered the leading unit until overtaken by another chariot or driver. The next to move is the unit in the next closest row (not lane), and so on.  Dice for units in the same row as above. If a unit has been lapped, its physical position on the track behind the race leader at the start of that turn counts for movement order, not the number of laps completed. &#10;Crashed chariots do not move voluntarily, but may move as the outcome of a collision (see COLLISIONS). Collisions are resolved at the time they occur and any outcome moves applied, before a unit completes a move. For curves, determine the unit in front by comparing front lines of each space when extended sideways.&#10;&#10;",

A unit can only use up to the number of move points shown in the gladiator table each turn, but does not have to use all of their move points each turn.  Move points not used that turn are lost. A unit cannot move into or through a space occupied by another unit.&#10;The combat phase occurs after all movement has been completed. A player does nothing in the combat phase if that unit is not adjacent to any other unit. Adjacent also includes the touching diagonal spaces.  Otherwise :- Players secretly choose which (if any) adjacent unit they will attack this turn. A player also secretly chooses the aggro level. The aggro level chosen will affect the attack and defense factors for that unit.  This is how aggressive or defensive that unit will be for all combats this turn.&#10;When a unit reaches 0 or less hit points, it is dead, and is removed from the board. A unit scores a victory point each time it inflicts a hit point of damage on another unit.&#10;The winner is the owner of the gladiator who survives, or the gladiator who scored more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

Players can move along board street squares, through &quot;subways&quot; or in to &quot;buildings&quot;, and can also move ghosts in the same way if given the option.&#10;&#10;Action cards give either further movement options or the ability to trap a ghost outside a building.&#10;&#10;Players can &quot;spook&quot; a separate opponent on landing on a square containing, or spinning, a spook option. This is a basic paper-scissor-stone option and the winner takes one of the loser's &quot;ghostbusting kit&quot; cards. Without all three a player cannon trap a ghost.&#10;&#10;Upon moving inside a &quot;building&quot; with a ghost present (or landing on a ghost outside a building if owning the correct action card) you can trap it by using the spinner to select a &quot;powerstream strength&quot; number. If the number is higher than the ghost's &quot;slime value&quot; you trap it, otherwise you move out of building and play continues.&#10;&#10;After the last ghost is trapped, players must move towards the middle of the board to trap &quot;Mr Stay Puft&quot; in the same way as regular ghosts.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person with the highest total &quot;slime value&quot; calculated from all ghosts they have trapped.&#10;&#10;",

The game is a roll and move with each player rolling two dice: a 1-6 die and one with a log graphic. You move the number of spaces indicated, and if a log comes up, you must pull the lever to loose the log down the board. It is held up above the playing pieces and has random magnets that may attach to a player's beaver and pull him back down to the beginning of the board where s/he must start again. There are leapfrog spaces that allow players to skip ahead on the track, and 'duck' spaces that allow a player to lay his/her beaver on its side to avoid the log.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storm Trooper is a solo card game where you control a squad of 9 German storm troopers crossing a section of the Western front eliminating all enemies encountered in the trench-covered, debris strewn landscape of  World War I.&#10;&#10;There are 3 card decks that you must make:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A terrain deck of 50 cards to create the 5 row, 10 column  &quot;board&quot; that you must cross to eliminate all enemies. Terrain cards have a defensive modifier and show start positions of enemy units.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     An enemy deck of 20 cards, representing units of 1 to 16 men. Eliminate all enemies to win the game.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    A storm trooper deck of 45 cards that modify your squad's combat, defense, or movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;As with all Warp Spawn games, every card has a historically inspired title to draw you into the theme of the game and serves as a good description of its function.&#10;&#10;Believe me, when you've got an enemy &quot;Platoon&quot; ahead of you, you don't want to be drawing &quot;Wire Cutters&quot;!&#10;&#10;Your squad is represented by a single pawn or token. You may begin at the foot of any column with a hand of 4 storm trooper cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, after you draw 1 card, your squad advances to any adjacent space and if in range of an enemy first they attack and then you have an opportunity to attack them. Enemies range in strength of 1 to 16 men. Pennies, tokens, or scrap paper should be used to keep track of men. Some battles may last over several turns or you may want to leave some battles unfinished until you get the cards and the confidence to return to them.&#10;&#10;To play the game with 2 players (or more), field two squads of storm troopers playing cooperatively, but competing to be the first to capture an enemy HQ space (say, one of the &quot;blockhouse&quot; cards) agreed upon by the players before beginning the game.&#10;&#10;",

A turn on a wheel determines the accuracy of the hit. Dice determine the direction of flight.

A pion marks the place of the ball.&#10;&#10;There are 9 boards for 9 holes, and the small game/putting is simulated on a separate board. The players can use their own golf statistics to make up their own tables for use in the game.

The basic rules of checkers also apply.  Although two players normally oppose each other, the games can be played by one person opposing himself or by four players pairing up and playing as partners.&#10;&#10;The object of the games is to accumulate the most points by solving correctly the larger number of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems.  Adsubmuldi is designed to reinforce these skills with whole numbers, and Adsubmuldi Fractions does the same with fractions and mixed numbers.&#10;&#10;The game ends, as in regular checkers, when all the playing pieces belonging to one of the players have been captured.  However, the winner of the game is the player with the most points, even if he is the one who lost all the playing pieces.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Players gradually gain information through movement around the dance floor and into and out of the adjoining rooms, and through the actions proscribed by the large number of cards.  One player is designated &quot;One Who Knows&quot; and has special powers (an extra card deck). &#10;There are clear parallels with Clue/Cluedo here, but with quite different (and more complex) turn mechanics.&#10;Although designated 2-6 players, it's really designed for 4 players, with variant rules provided for 2,3,5 and 6 players.&#10;Contents: Average sized board with ballroom design; 24 character pieces (5cm high card-in-stand figures) and correspondingly 24 Suspect cards; 121 Harlequin cards (actions); 21 Clue cards; 5 Thief cards; 11 &quot;One Who Knows&quot; cards; and two dice. There are 60 plastic diamonds for use as currency.&#10;The rules have a fantasy theme to them.  To quote: &quot;Bal Masque is a game, within a game, within a game, an elusive glimpse of far horizons.  As Bal Masque unrolls it's magic carpet of pleasures, players find they have crossed the invisible threshold of NOW into the elegant and eerious, incredibly, fantastic world of Bal Masque&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

And, like the Rummikub tile rummy game, it involves rearranging already-melded cards on the table to the best of your advantage. The deck of standard cards also includes six special TZAP cards which have both strategic and laugh-generating functions that provide twists not found in other rummy games. The game is for ages 8 and up, 2 to 8 players, and can be played individually or as partners.&#10;&#10;TZAP Rummy claims to set itself apart from other rummy games by:&#10;&#10;FIRST, it involves manipulation of melded cards on the table to help get rid of cards from hand, i.e., to &quot;go out.&quot;&#10;&#10;SECOND, it involves manipulation of opponents by strategically &quot;zapping&quot; the right opponent at the right time to improve your chances of going out, while at the same time inhibiting others from going out. This requires some tough decisions on whether to use TZAP cards for melding or for penalizing an opponent.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.tzaprummy.com/&#10;&#10;",

Every player has 3-7 playcards. everytime they slip out during the game by not pointing out the right items, they loose one playcard (it is flipped to the stop-side).

    "Description": "The game is played with 4 players in teams of two. 44 cards are used, consisting of 4 teams numbered 1 to 11 representing footballers from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales from the 1940s. The object of the game is to move the ball counter into your opponents' goal and thus score. The ball can only be moved along the lines drawn on the playing board. This is achieved by winning tricks as per normal whist. However, trumps are chosen by the starting player who moves the ball onto a team's badge (which become trumps) on the playing board. The winner of the trick may move the ball one space. If the trick is won by leading with a trump, 2 spaces may be moved. When a goal is scored, the ball is returned to the centre spot and the player to the left of the scorer starts. The game ends when the cards are exhausted twice, once for half time and again for the end of the match.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An educational game focussing on multiplication (up to 10 x 10).&#10;&#10;The game's main components are 30 &quot;multiplication dice&quot;- dice that have a multiplication problem printed on three sides, and the results on the opposite sides.&#10;&#10;The rules sheet suggests three different variants that can be played:&#10;&#10;1) &quot;The stacking multiplication adventure&quot;&#10;The aim of this game variant is to build an obelisk as high as possible.&#10;Players take turns throwing two randomly chosen dice. If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication, the player repeats the throw. If the player correctly solves the problem (the other players can check on the opposite side of the die), he/she passes the die on to the next player, who uses it to start building an &quot;obelisk&quot; (by stacking one die onto the next). If the active player cannot solve the multiplication, he/she has to start building the obelisk. Then it is the next player's turn. Each turn, another die is added to the obelisk, either by the following player (if the active player correctly solves the problem), or by the active player (if their answer is incorrect). &#10;The game ends when the obelisk collapses. The last player who managed to stack a die onto the obelisk without collapsing it wins the game. If the players manage to stack all dice before the obelisk collapses, they all win together.&#10;&#10;2) The multiplication pyramid&#10;The aim of this variant is to be the first to complete a pyramid.&#10;The dice are evenly distributed among all the players. Players take turns throwing two of their dice. If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication or if the active player can't solve the multiplication, they lose their turn. If they correctly solve the problem, they use the die to start building a pyramid (by stacking dice). Then it is the next player's turn. &#10;The first player to have used up all their dice in buidling their pyramid wins the game.&#10;&#10;3) Speed multiplication&#10;The aim of the game is to find the fitting multiplication problem and grab the correct die.&#10;The first player chooses four dice and puts them on the table with a multiplication problem facing up. He/she then has a look at the results (without the other players looking) and puts them back. They then say one of the results, and all the other players try to grab the die with the multiplication that fits this result. The player who grabs the correct die earns this die. Then the next player chooses four dice. &#10;The game ends when all dice have been claimed. The player with the most dice wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players start in the head and move towards the tail. Landing on a coloured space gives the player one counter (quarter) of that colour; landing on a white has no effect; and landing on a black space causes the player to lose a number of quarters, the colors chosen by player.&#10;&#10;Quarters collected during the game are scored when all players have either finished or dropped out. Quarters forming a circle of a single colour score the most, quarters forming multi-coloured circles score less, while left-over quarters score least.&#10;&#10;During the game, there are four chances to drop out, identified by the grey shaded areas. This may make sense because the numbers in the black segments increase towards the end, and a player that has collected a good set of circles may want to cut her losses rather than carry on.  &#10;(This is the sole tactical choice in the game.)&#10;&#10;Paletti game no. 4065&#10;&#10;",

The fields of these rows are numbered from 1 - 20, so each counter has its definite starting place, making one complete row of either colour.&#10;&#10;The spaces of the central six rows are coloured according to the counters, either red, blue, yellow or brown, and build up a regular pattern. Counters can step one space, jump across one other piece (also more than once during a turn) when landing eventually on a space of its own colour or doing a step plus a jump move in this order in a turn.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game is to get the pieces on the opposite side onto the octagon with the corresponding number (similar to Salta, which maybe adopted this idea from Colorito).&#10;&#10;This game is mentioned in several letters of the Romanov sisters (daughters of the last Russian Tsar) from 1915 and as one of the favourite games of Anastasia Nikolaevna.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The play cards are made up of 5 each of the 4 combinations of backhand/forehand to backhand/forehand and 4 smash and 4 lob cards. Scoring is the same as in lawn tennis. The two packs (service and play) are shuffled and both players receive 4 play cards to form their hand. The server then places the top service card face up to show the type of serve. An ace is a point immediately won and if a fault is drawn then another card is immediately drawn and if this is another fault, the point is lost. If it is any of the other service cards, the opponent can return it only if he has a corresponding card that allows him to play the return type or he can play a lob card. A lob card can only be returned by another lob card or a smash card. A smash can only be returned by a lob. If a player cannot return with the appropriate card then he loses that point. Players replace cards as they are played from the draw deck to make a 4 card hand. Play continues until the correct number of sets (predetermined at the start) is won.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Game of Politics, or The Race For the Presidency was first published in 1887 and patented in 1888. Unlike the later game of the same name by Oswald B. Lord, candidates in this game play cards against each other to reach the office of Mayor, Governor, Congressman, and Senator before moving on to a battle over each state's Electoral votes for the U.S. Presidency. 201 votes out of the 401 for all of the states are required to win.&#10;&#10;While the game is listed as being for 2, 4 or 6 players, in fact there are only two candidates competing for the Presidency. When there are more than two players, the sides form two teams that play in turn to advance their respective candidates.&#10;&#10;Few intact copies of the game seem to have survived to the present day. However, the patent application -- which lists the game's rules -- and surviving game boards give a good indication as to what the components were for the W.S. Reed Toy Company's release. These include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules&#10;     Game board&#10;     Two &quot;wads&quot; (pawns) to move on the board's tracks; one red, one blue&#10;     23 pins for use in the left and right columns&#10;     At least one pin to mark the last bypassed state during the first pass through the state list&#10;     A deck of 48 cards, containing eight each of the following values: 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000, and 10000.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A science fiction infantry tabletop miniatures wargame retaining as many 'realistic' features as possible, while striving to minimize complexity.&#10;&#10;The game, intended for use with 25/28mm miniatures (of whichever manufacturers the players prefer), features morale and fog-of-war/limited intelligence rules which have a significant impact on the battles - at least as much as actually killing the opposing forces.  Troop types from lightly armoured basic infantry (say, Aliens Colonial Marines level) up to heavy power-armoured juggernauts (for example Starship Trooper Mobile Infantry or WH40K Terminators), as well as robots, cyborgs, remotes etc (thus allowing armies from the Terminator films, Cybermen, etc).&#10;&#10;Vehicles are intentionally not featured within the rules, leaving it as a game with the focus on infantry (from high tech to very high tech) and their main support weapons.&#10;&#10;Rather than treating tabletop battles as simply &quot;line up 1000 points per side and fight until one side is gone&quot; affairs, Killing Machine takes a more intelligent, mature look at this kind of skirmish gaming with its morale and intelligence rules.&#10;&#10;",

The druid who best adapts to the tactics of his or her opponents becomes the new head of the Circle.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game with a full had of strategy cards. Each round you secretly pick a shape (lion, peacock, or jackrabbit) and a strategy card to play. When shapes are revealed, you may or may not get to discard your strategy card, depending on the shapes and strategies of your opponents.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re a Jackrabbit, you succeed if you played the lowest strategy card.  If you&rsquo;re a Lion, you succeed if you played the highest strategy card.  If you&rsquo;re a Peacock, you succeed if no one else played a card that matches your card&rsquo;s rank or suit.  If you&rsquo;re the first one to discard all of your strategy cards, you win.&#10;&#10;Druid&rsquo;s Duel is a game for two to four players. Druid&rsquo;s Duel uses a standard Poker deck. You can read the rules at http://www.invisible-city.com/play/470. A four-player game takes about 30 minutes to play. Druid&rsquo;s Duel is appropriate for ages 13 and up.&#10;&#10;",

A &quot;Captain&quot; player keeps score on a laminated scoresheet for all players. With 2+ players, the player with the highest score at the end of 10 frames wins.  With solo play, you try to beat your previous best score. The highest possible score is 300 points!&#10;&#10;The original (1960) edition contained two decks of cards (108 total), enough for 1 to 4 players to play right out of the box. The 1964 edition came with only one deck of 54 cards supporting either one or two players unless you purchased a second set of 54 cards separately to allow play with up to 4 people (the laminated scorecard in both versions includes 4 player lines to support up to four players).&#10;&#10;Trivia: The yellow 1964 &quot;Authorized Edition&quot; box shows the game named &quot;Don Carter's Strike! Bowling Game&quot; and doesn't mention &quot;300&quot; anywhere on the box, but the instructions only refer to the game as &quot;300&quot; and don't mention Don Carter anywhere! The most likely reason is that they licensed Don's endorsement for the 1964 edition of the game but neglected to update the rules sheet to accommodate the newer name. Don was and is (apparently) widely considered the greatest bowler of all time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is about 20 inches long, 14 inches wide, 1 1/2 inches deep. There is a lid which slides out through the top end to reveal the playing board inside. There are yellow wood slats and  blue slats that connect to them to  let them slide up &amp; down. Some versions of the game come with red wood paddles which are 8  inches long with 2 different length yellow pegs attached which fit into the holes along the sides, but not all versions have this.  The game comes with a wooden dowel over 18 inches long and two small steel balls with etched symbols on them. The goal of the game is to move the ball down through the tipped slats so that it ends up going through the 150 metal loop at the bottom in order to score maximum points for your turn.&#10;&#10;",

Limited edition (500 prints) presented at Essen 2005.&#10;&#10;The shotgun allows you to fire between two players and if you shoot at them, you toss two plaster counters (one for each player) - if it lands with the plaster side up that player gets wounded, otherwise nothing happens. So, you can hit 0, 1 or 2 players at once.&#10;&#10;",
