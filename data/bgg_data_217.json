    "Description": "In Windmill: Cozy Stories, players are storytellers who weave short tales based on the hidden picture cards they draw. While one player tells a story, the other players attempt to guess the visible card that matches the story.&#10;&#10;The more opponents who guess incorrectly, the more points the storyteller receives when someone finally does correctly identify the card. On the other hand, if all players fail to guess the picture, the storyteller loses points instead of winning them!&#10;&#10;You score points both by telling stories that are identified correctly and by guessing the stories told by others. Whoever earns the most points over the course of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Remember, even the mightiest of adventurers began with only hopes and dreams. Unsung Heroes is the classic 'leveling from 1 to 2' story.&#10;&#10;Designed by lifelong nerds looking for good games to play with their non nerd family and friends, Unsung Heroes is quick to learn, yet enjoyable to play. The basic premise is simple: roll dice and play cards to earn points. Highest score gets the rat. Yet the game is deep enough to keep even the most ardent board gamers entertained.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;B, Country, Oldies.&#10;&#10;The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.&#10;&#10;",

Yes, no surprise there!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of cards, with each showing a two-digit number, although sometimes one digit is a ?, a &quot;wild&quot; stands for a digit of your choice. Place three cards face up in the pool and one card face up on the floor. A condition tile starts on the pivot side; more on that later.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can play any number of cards from your hand as long as the first number on these cards matches the last number on the floor card. (That last number is the &quot;pivot&quot;.) Arrange your played cards on the floor in the order of your choice with the top card becoming the new floor.&#10;&#10;If you can chain three consecutive numbers, you can play them no matter what the floor card is, then you take another turn.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing or chaining, you can take a pool card or the top card of the deck into your hand, refilling the pool, if necessary.&#10;&#10;Finally, you can reset by taking all three pool cards into your hand, then flipping the condition tile. The side opposite &quot;pivot&quot; is relay, and when relay is the condition, you can play cards one by one, with the first digit of each played card matching the last digit of the new floor card. Maybe you can empty your hand all in one go this way?&#10;&#10;When one player empties their hand, everyone else can only play or chain from that point, exiting the game when they can't put down cards on their turn. Each wild card still in hand is worth 3 points, and each non-wild card is 1 point.&#10;&#10;Play three rounds in this manner, then whoever has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are different rules for the two-player/four-player partnership game and the three-to-six-player game, allowing for more players than usual for an abstract strategy game to play.&#10;&#10;",

In spite of their victory against Feoderoti, the Zealots were finally defeated by the intervention of 4 roman legions.&#10;&#10;This game was first published by Khyber Pass Games.

You still want to achieve combinations with your die rolls, but now you score a combination each with the inner dice and the outer ones. Thankfully, you have some wiggle room when shooting for combination targets as you roll six double dice, but use only five outer and five inner dice when scoring combinations, with you choosing each five as you wish.&#10;&#10;DubbelYatzy uses standard Swedish Yatzy scoring rules, which are somewhat different from Yahtzee rules, but can also be played with international Yahtzee or German Kniffel scoring.&#10;&#10;The playing time is 15 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;",

You can replace a missing token with a pair of another animal tokens, and you can do this multiple times. (Editors sometimes prefer quantity over quality, after all.) The next article in the purple magazine will require seven tokens, then nine, then eleven. The first article in the grey magazine requires any seven animal tokens. Later magazines include bonuses for those who are late to publication.&#10;&#10;The first player to place an article in each of the six magazines wins.

From all corners of the galaxy, spaceships gather in front of the wormhole. But only 1 can pass through at a time.

The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayThe game board consists of three interstellar spaceway routes connected to the center of the Andromeda veil. Here lies a mysterious wormhole, providing a portal to another dimension. Each player has a fleet of 6 to 10 Spaceships, depending on the number of players. Clockwise, every player takes a turn. During your turn, you either place a new ship on the outer rim of the game board, or you move a ship on the game board one node closer to the center.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Navigate your Spaceships trough the wormholeGrab an open Action Card when you move one of your spaceships into the wormhole. Action Cards let you influence the game greatly by repositioning spaceships and will grant or cost you VP. As the 2 Action Cards on the game board are only replenished when both of them are taken, it is crucial to enter the wormhole at the right moment to pick that one card that you need (or to push a spaceships of another player into the wormhole to give him that one card that no one wants).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Need to skip a turn?At some point the interstellar gateway becomes somewhat crowded.

Charleston?&#10;&#10;No, it's the Adriatic, in a short and violent naval war between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Yes, you heard right. Finally, you'll have a chance to see the Austro-Hungarian navy in action. Historically, they did very well. How will you do?&#10;&#10;The &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; of 1866 is also known as the Third Italian Independence War. The Italians want Venice. The Austrians have it. But the Italians are allied with up-and-coming Prussia, and the Austrians have a hard time on land. On the Adriatic, the Austrio-Hungarian fleet is outnumbered and out gunned, more to 2-1 in both categories. But they have aggressive commanders and a willingness to &quot;Ram anything painted grey!&quot; That was the signal from the Austrio-Hungarian flagship (the Italians would be the folks with gray ships). The same signal included the sentence, &quot;There must be a victory at Lissa.&quot;&#10;&#10;And now it's up to you to find out if there will be, or if the Italians succeed in making the Adriatic &quot;an Italian lake.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is a classic confrontation, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, of numbers versus quality, with over 200 multi-sized counters featuring individual ships and the admirals who commanded the fleets. Players maneuver on an operational map and then shift to smaller battle maps when it's time to put their iron to the test.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios - just the conclusive Battle of Lissa or the entire campaign, along with important random events, intrusions by the French and Turks, optional rules for ships and events that could have happened, and more. Will you, as Italian Admiral Persano, see that the Austrian flag is &quot;swept&quot; from the Adriatic? Or will you, as Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff prove that your rams and unusual &quot;flying wedge&quot; formation can overcome superior firepower?&#10;&#10;The choices are yours!&#10;&#10;",

Once all Producers have revealed their Vote cards the votes are tallied.

All Producers that revealed a Yes &#10;Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token and place it facedown in front of them. All Producers that revealed a Yes!

Each turn, players recruit one card from their hand and then pass the rest of their hand to the player on their left. Every time a card is recruited, it goes into that player&rsquo;s army pile. Only the top card is visible in each player&rsquo;s army at any given time. There are two types of cards available in the game&mdash;Monster cards and Hired Hand cards. Each Monster card has a unique scoring mechanism. Players must recruit them wisely in order to maximize the amount of points of their army. Hired hand cards are placed separate from an army and, when activated, have special abilities that affect the game. The player who raises the most powerful army, wins! .&#10;&#10;Overlords easily plays under 20 minutes. The game is simple to teach, yet tough to master.

That struggle historically pitted Rome against Carthage in a titanic clash that shaped the fate of the Western world for the next several centuries. The historical scenario therefore also pits two players against each other, one commanding Rome and the other Carthage.&#10;&#10;Third and fourth players can be added, however, to explore the possibilities had the 2nd Punic War grown even larger through greater Gallic and Macedonian participation. Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to carve out an empire and annihilate his foes. The game uses an evolution of the system first presented in the earlier, and much liked, S&amp;T game &quot;1066.&quot;&#10;&#10;The square-grid map shows all the western and central Mediterranean from Iberia on the west to Greece in the east. Each square equals 100 Roman miles from side to side.&#10;&#10;Each of the iconic units within the large-size counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi, represents about 5,000 to 20,000 combatants. The unit-types represented include: legions, phalanxes, Gaesati (fanatic barbarian warriors), light infantry, cavalry, garrisons, war elephants, and fleets.&#10;&#10;Each of the 17 game turns equals one year, and experienced players can count on being able to finish a match in about four to six hours.&#10;&#10;",

Each scoring card is read as follows: &quot;If the largest contiguous mass of color A is larger than the largest contiguous mass of color B, then score points equal to the number of hexes in the largest contiguous mass of color C.&quot; Lots of contiguity in there!&#10;&#10;A player draws one or two new tiles at the end of her turn, and the game continues until either someone runs out of scoring cards or a player can't refill her visible display of tiles. In either case, each player again receives 3-5 scoring cards adding those to any remaining in hand then players start taking turns removing one or two tiles each turn, playing a scoring card if the player removes only one tile. The game ends once all the tiles have been removed from play, and the player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Oil, silk, incense and spices are the currency used to build tents, establish settlements, and amass riches &mdash; but commerce brings competition, and the space to build is limited. When there is no more room, the player who has maximized his resources to become the most successful merchant is the victor!&#10;&#10;In Bania, players use resource cards to buy and build tents, then strategically place these tents on the board to earn points. When no legal moves remain on the board, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. On a turn, a player performs these actions in order, if possible:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collect your bonus: If your elephant marker sits on a tent tile on the board, collect one resource card of each type in the settlement where the marker is located.&#10;    Buy and place tent tiles OR roll for resources: As explained below.&#10;    Place your elephant marker: If your elephant marker isn't on the board and you placed tent tiles that turn, place the marker on one tile you placed this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with four tent tiles and eight resource cards: two of each type (oil, spice, silk and incense); one side of the tent tiles shows one of these four resources, while the other side shows three resource symbols (e.g., two spice and one silk). If you want more resources, you can roll the four dice up to three times, locking any dice that you wish while doing so. When you stop rolling, you receive one resource card for each resource symbol showing; in addition, if you have both a front and back half of an elephant showing on the dice, then you receive an elephant marker bonus as at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;If you have the right cards in hand, you might instead choose to buy and place tents; if you have twelve or more cards, then you must do so. A tent costs three resource cards matching the three resource symbols on the back and you pay this cost after placing a tent on the game board, but if you place a tent adjacent to other tents, then the cost is discounted based on the colors of adjacent tents, possibly allowing you to place a tent for no cost at all! When you place a tent on its own to start a settlement, you receive 3 points; for all other tents placed, you receive 1 point each. You refill your hand to four tent tiles at the end of your turn &mdash; but if you've placed all four, you can immediately draw four new tiles and keep building!&#10;&#10;A settlement can have at most seven tents in it; when someone places the seventh tent, any elephant markers in the settlement are removed and returned to their owners. The game ends when no more tents can be placed. Whoever placed the final tile scores 3 points, and whoever has the most of each type of resource card scores 2 points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever played the highest trump wins the trick and collects the location and played cards; if no one played trump, whoever played the highest card in the suit led wins. The winner leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players sum the Batman points on the cards and locations they collected. Whoever has the most Batman points (or is tied for the most) doesn't score the chaos points they collected this round.

You'll call upon your favorite Ghostbusters to help you set your ghost trap and capture the highest point ghosts on the board.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds. In each round, players take turns, beginning with the start player and continuing in clockwise order, until all twelve cards from the circle have been captured. On your turn, carry out these three steps:&#10;&#10;1. Take up to two actions, either playing or discarding an action card for each action as you choose. When you play an action card, you carry out its effect, then discard it; when you discard an action card, place it on the discard pile, then draw a new action card.&#10;&#10;If any ghosts you've already captured have action abilities, you may use those during this step, in addition to your two actions. Each ghost's ability can be used only once per round.&#10;&#10;2. Capture the ghost card that the ghost trap is in front of, but only if you played at least one action card this turn. Take that ghost card and place it in your player area with any other ghosts you've already captured, then move the ghost trap to the next ghost card in the circle &mdash; either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the current direction of play.&#10;&#10;3. Refill your hand to three action cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when the last ghost card remaining in the circle has been captured. To prepare for the next round, deal twelve more cards from the top of the ghost deck to form a new circle, and reset the ghost trap to the top of the circle. The game ends after three complete rounds, then players calculate their score for captured ghost cards.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game, only one player&rsquo;s house will be left standing -- will it be yours?!&#10;&#10;Summary of play: Every turn has several steps including Action, Player, movement/combat, cleanup.&#10;&#10;In the action phase, an action card is flipped and there is a number indicating how many monsters enter the current player's field. Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player.&#10;&#10;In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player's fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat.&#10;&#10;In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total.&#10;&#10;The player who is the last person standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

To do this, at the start of your turn you roll two dice, then move forward a distance equal to either of the dice or the sum of them. If you want the tile on which you land, you can place it in your wheelbarrow. The trick, however, is that you need to remember all of the tiles that you've already acquired because once you reach the end of the road you try to fill in your blueprint from bottom to top with those tiles; for each wrongly collected tile, you must discard one that's perfect for your plan. Whoever first manages to use the colored tiles to build their predetermined anthill wins.&#10;&#10;The Ants Go Marching includes anthills of different levels to allow players of different skill levels to compete more evenly.&#10;&#10;",

Do you believe in luck?&#10;&#10;In the card game BOLD, you're trying to match cards that show three kinds of containers that vary in color, size, and pattern. Can you remember where the matches are? And will you be willing to put your points where your memory is? Shuffle the cards, then place them face down in a grid formation. The first player reveals two cards. Do the containers match in type, color, size, or pattern? If yes, that's a pair! Now comes a test of your mettle: Will you take your points and run, or will you gamble them by flipping another card and hoping it shares a feature with the first two? The game becomes more intense as it goes on and you remember more!&#10;&#10;",

The Sultan's absolute reign has lasted 33 years and he has no intent to surrender his power. He controls his entire Empire using the spy network he created. He suspect the Young Turks would dethrone him. thus, the Sultan rules the Empire and paranoia rules the Sultan.&#10;&#10;In &#196;&#176;ttihat, there are 3 factions: The Unionists, the Sultan Abdulhamid II and his Spies, and (with at least seven players) and the Separatists. In the game, the roles of unionists and spies are hidden, while the player who plays the Sultan has his card face up. Other players build their strategies without seeing each others' roles. Players bid for control of key provinces, some of which grant military strength. The Unionist players win if their side controls four of the of the provinces in play at the end of the game or when they stage a successful coup. The Separatist player wins if no other faction controls four provinces at the end of the game. Otherwise, the faction of the Sultan and of the Spies wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is a lord who tries to populate their estate with citizens, fight diseases and succeed in the crusades.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is simple as it is: gain more winning points and there are only two ways to do it - collect as many worthy citizens and win as many crusades as possible.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game is quite similar to Ticket to Ride: three cards lay open in the &quot;market&quot; and other are stacked in the deck. Each player at their turn draws one card from the deck and one card from the market. After that the player has to play those cards instantly in any order in any city.&#10;&#10;Some cards may have negative winning points worth or carry negative immediate effects - this is the reason to put those cards in opponents' towns.&#10;&#10;Apart from three types of citizen cards: knights, priests and commoners players may draw a disease card and play it to start an epidemic. Epidemic goes from one city to another killing inhabitants with weakest immune system. At the same time, some diseases like leprosy prefer to start with priests, others with commoners or knights.&#10;&#10;In addition to easy and pleasant mechanics and fun &quot;Take that!&quot; effect the games offer hilarious and well-designed cards based on &quot;Medieval suffering&quot; memes - excerpts from medieval paintings with comic quotes&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&#208;&#150;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#140; &#209;&#129;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#133; &#208;&#187;&#209;&#142;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#185; &#209;&#130;&#209;&#143;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#184; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#185;. &#208;&#146;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139; &#209;&#131;&#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#143;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#154;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#159;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139;, &#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#173;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#177;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#142;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#142; &#209;&#134;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;, &#208;&#176; &#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#133; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#133;, &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188;&#209;&#131; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#133;, &#209;&#129; &#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140;&#209;&#142; &#209;&#129;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#134;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;. &#208;&#146; &#209;&#141;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#145;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#183; &#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178; &#208;&#184; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#209;&#131;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;, &#209;&#135;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#178; &#209;&#141;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#177;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#188;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181; &#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;-&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;.&#10;&#10;&#208;&#160;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#185;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;, &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;: &#208;&#149;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#154;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#143;?

Players compete simultaneously to be the first to solve the selected tangram. The book included in the game is spiral-bound so that it lays flat, and depicts each of 200 puzzles in four orientations, so all players can see it in its upright form. The book also includes historical information about tangrams, and some nice photos of old sets.&#10;&#10;",

For this first set, the creatures, or Beasties as we call them, are USA based cryptids (i.e. Bigfoot, Mothman, Jersey Devil, etc...).&#10;&#10;What sets MetaZoo: Cryptid Nation apart is its core mechanic of breaking the 4th wall, or &quot;meta&quot;. From a gameplay perspective, this means that the strength of your Beasties and Spells are impacted by the environment you play in. Playing on a rainy day? Your water Beasties and Spells get a power boost. Playing near an open fire while trying to keep warm as it snows outside? Your Flame spells are now twice as powerful, but watch out... the Snow outside not only boosts the strength of your opponent's Snow Beasties, but also makes some of them invisible (unable to be directly attacked).&#10;&#10;This added level of meta means choosing your battleground to best suit your deck build, or rapidly building decks to suit your environment, is a key feature of the game. Imagine playing a friend, but deftly convincing them to play next to a patch of trees to gain additional power boosts for your Forest Beasties!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It covers aspects from Equality to Organic Food, from War in Iraq to Torture Scandal, to Youth Culture, Women's Priesthood and beyond. Those are but few aspects the players wrestle with as they try to convince the deep rows of the people behind their own agenda.&#10;&#10;The players all live in the same society and seek influential power to leave their mark on the surrounding world. The people's opinions, what they feel and think, is determined by four societal values &ndash; militarism, economy, human values &amp; green values.&#10;&#10;The players have game cards which become &rdquo;hot topics&rdquo; in the society once they are played. They will become the issues the imaginary townsfolk talk in coffee tables, what they read from the news and what shapes their view on the world. These issues then shape the four values, but also bring points through them. This means that the more militaristic the society is the more militaristic influence points you get from cards like 'Raise in Defence Budget' or 'War on Terrorism'. With these points you then push through laws that focus on that value. Only these law cards that the players have pushed through with their political influence they get victory points. And as each value has limited amount of laws there is a race who stands as the best advocate for each value.&#10;&#10;Most cards have special abilities that makes them stronger with certain other cards (i.e. Feminism with Equality) or for example prevent certain points to be scored (i.e. Torture Scandal on militarism points or UN in Crisis on Human value points).&#10;&#10;As the game proceeds the players try to sell their world view to the masses. But whether the well-being of the people is trampled as the players thirst for power and whether that society is still worth defending for? That is what the players decide all over again during each game they play the Modern Society.&#10;&#10;",

Li Shimin, the second son of Emperor Gaozu, planned an ambush at Xuanmu Gate leading to the Palace City and assassinated two of his brothers who were in a fierce competition with him for the throne. A few days after this coup, Li Shimin was made the crown prince. His father abdicated two months later, and Li Shimin became Emperor Taizong.&#10;&#10;The Xuanwu Gate Incident is a secret identity deduction game. Each player is dealt a character card that is secret to other players. On a player's turn, they may examine one of the two cards placed facedown in the center of the table. They may choose to swap the card with their own card, or with any other players' card, or keep it where it is. After all players have had a chance to examine one card, there will be voting to determine whether the current round comes to a showdown; if so, all cards are revealed and the winning team is determined.&#10;&#10;",
