You are a band of pirates working together to follow the clues and reveal the buried treasures hidden around Shell Island.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, treasure chest cards are placed face-down beside the board with a series of secret clue cards on top. The first clue for each chest is revealed and an X-marks-the-spot token placed on the board at each clue's location.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players draw a shell from a bag to determine how many spaces they can move. If a player lands on space marked with an X token, they collect that clue card. The next clue card in the hunt is revealed and the X token moved to the new clue's location. If a player collects the last clue in a hunt, they uncover the treasure chest and reveal the treasure inside. Players can also choose to give their movement shell to another player who may be closer to a clue or treasure.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a ship shell, the pirate ship moves one space closer to shore. When it reaches the island, it's time to go- The hunt is over and any unfound treasure is lost.&#10;&#10;Yarrr Har Hunt is designed to allow very young players with limited game experience to play side-by-side with older kids and adults. The surest path to success is for all players to share turns and work together to divide the finding of clues and treasure. A typical game lasts 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a treasure hunt race: players help Captain Casey and her crew discover the Shell Island Treasure by uncovering clues. But be quick: the ship will soon be back to end the hunt! Players work together and problem solve to figure out where the treasure is hidden. This cooperative game has all players working together to win!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Uncover clues together to discover the Shell Island Treasure!&#10;     Kids learn communication, simple strategy, cooperation and shared-decision making.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If a player loses four rounds, they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 54 cards; three each of 2s through 9s, four Holds, six Reverses, ten 10s, four -10s, two Double Plays, and four O'NO 99s (which count only as hand-fillers); there are also 24 tokens that are used to keep track of losses - a player surrenders a token when they lose a round.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four cards and three tokens; on their turn, each player draws one card and then plays one from their hand, all the while the total on the table increasing until 99 is reached. The player that ends their turn on 99 points (or more) loses the round and surrenders a token; those with no tokens left are out of the game. Last player with remaining tokens wins.&#10;&#10;Luck Plus is a unique card and dice game of number matching. The object is to be the first player to eliminate all of your cards by matching cards and dice. Each player is dealt 8 cards face up. The remaining cards are stacked face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up and placed next to the draw pile to form the match pile. Each player will then try to get rid of as many cards as possible by matching the numbers on the cards with the numbers on the dice they roll. There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, but you&rsquo;ll have to see the rules to get the whole picture.&#10;&#10;",

They have different moving patterns that are restricted by the actual landscape.&#10;Once during play, a player is entitled to a double move.

In this game, the player helms the Tritus and sails across a treacherous ocean to find treasure, combat fearsome monsters of the deep, and protect (or plunder!) towns that dot the seascape. With multiple maps and starting conditions, each game offers a unique adventuring experience. And to play again, simply erase the board (or print out a new one) and start sailing!&#10;&#10;In each turn, the player rolls dice and, using a unique movement mechanic, plots a course across the map. When that course encounters a monster, island, or another ship, the player resolves a combat, discovers treasure, or perhaps repairs damage. The captain's log allows the player to track resources and encounters as well as the current level of Danger. By carefully managing damage to the ship and keeping the cannons fully stocked, the player just may survive until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;After the final turn, the player scores victory points based on both the resolved encounters but also on the Motivation chosen at the start of the game. Each Motivation scores encounters differently and also offers a unique bonus. As an Adventurer, Protector, or Plunderer, the total score will determine whether Zemo gains the glory he quests for. Or will he end up in a forgotten watery grave?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The capture of Monte Cassino resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, with German losses estimated at around 20,000.

In short everything is related to the number 4.&#10;    Game-play is based on a special shape resulting from combining 4 hearts. The way the hearts are merged makes each divided in 4 pieces. The whole shape has 9 pieces in total instead of 16 as some are common for two or more hearts.&#10;    A 'quad' is the shape described above with any 4 pieces ('qarts') marked in contrasting colour. According this quads can be divided in two groups (sides): light ('glim') quads if qarts are darker than other parts (as the 4 of qarts is always the minority) and dark ('grim') quads if vice versa. Each qart has value in points depending on the number of hearts it is common for. So it can be 2, 4 pts for glims, -2, -4 for grims and 0 for both. Changing qarts order gives 20 meaningfully distinctive combinations for each side, 40 quads in total. Quads in a side are rank-ordered. The overall ranking follows the qarts configuration (all qarts in one heart is the best) and is subdivided in two dimensions: vertical (4 'piles') and horisontal ('atop' 0-4 according the number of quads above). The priority between sides can be set by game rules and vary in playing progress.&#10;    The system can provide new experience in randomising, solitaire, card and dice playing as well as refresh many traditional games.&#10;&#10;",

Each Policy vote is resolved (Pass or No pass) in turn&mdash;with the Center of Gravity token (COG) moving on the game board as the Policy dictates.&#10;&#10;The Political Animals game board is a grid with the four quandrants and a Moderate center representing player Agendas.

    "Description": "Shattered Lance is a deck-building game with worker placement elements based on medieval jousting tournaments. Knights face-off against each other over the course of a seven day tournament with each round consisting of a Court Phase and Joust Phase. At the end of the seven days, the knight with the most victory points is named King's Champion.&#10;&#10;Knights participate in one-on-one matches and gain reputation and gold for their victories. Between matches they visit the Court to gain new items or mounts, gain favors from nobles such as the King and Queen, mingle with nobles to increase their reputation, or gain additional training for their knight and squires.&#10;&#10;During the Court Phase players place their knights and squires within the Royal Court. Squires spend gold to purchase items for their knights while the knights use their reputation to gain them. Players can build their decks at the &quot;Training Grounds&quot; to be used in the Joust phase.&#10;&#10;During the Joust Phase players will compete against their opponent using their decks. Items gained or purchased in the Court Phase can be used during the joust to aid the knights. There are four passes within each joust. During a pass each player strategically plays three different cards from their hand consisting of the &quot;Herald&quot;, the &quot;Shield&quot;, and the &quot;Levee&quot;. Knights start with 10 stamina which they spend to play cards from their hand and lose it when they are hit by their opponent's &quot;Levee&quot;. If a knight's stamina reaches 0, they are unhorsed and can decide to remount if they still have a chance at victory. The first knight to score 10 points by the end of the fourth pass gains a victory token, gold, and reputation.&#10;&#10;At the end of the seventh day, players combine their victory point total based on their cards, victory tokens, and reputation points. The player with the most points wins the tournament!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players, on their turns, can take one action (move pieces, produce more pieces, convert an area to their religion, or slaughter pieces).&#10;&#10;Each player also has 4 miracle cards that they can use to their advantage (each god has its own unique set of 6 miracle cards to choose from).&#10;&#10;Game can end in 2 ways:&#10;If a player places 10 temple cubes/controls 10 areas on the board (8 in a 3p game), that player wins immediately.&#10;&#10;If every area on the board has a temple on it, the game ends immediately. The player with the most temples on the board wins. If a 3 player game ends this way and 2 players are tied for most temples, remove the losing's players temples and the 2 players that were tied for first continue to play until one of them places 10 temples.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Warbands must survive the irradiated undead to loot the corpse of a fallen preacher.

With plenty of options for customization and rules for resource gathering, this fun campaign brings a near real-time strategy game feel to the TNT wasteland.&#10;&#10;&#10;The TNT Tribal Campaign (Third Place Co-Winner) &ndash; This thematic campaign is a clever set of five warband specific scenarios featuring wasteland tribals, either played with a tribal warband or featuring the tribals as recurring foils for the warbands. In this campaign your warband delves deep into tribal culture by appeasing the wasteland spirits through sacred rights, protecting refugees during a forced migration, and even stopping ritual sacrifices.&#10;&#10;Eight Other Exciting Scenarios &ndash; Great for one-off gaming or easily inserted into an ongoing campaign, these scenarios contain assorted of fun wasteland activities like battling deranged cultists, raiding a underground vault, stalking through bat-haunted ruins, and much, much more!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These dots are laid laid out to form a triangular grid play area, which has one dot of each color for each triangle play location. There is a black dot (6 total) in each corner and the middle of each side of the triangular board, which identify non-playable locations. When the game starts, 4 dots of the same color (two sets for each color) are already connected as a three link line along the outside edges of the triangle game board. The goal is to create a path in your color that connects your two initial lines on two different sides of the triangle game board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns connecting two dots of their color. Each turn the active player chooses an empty triangle play area. Then, they draw a line from the point of their color through the opposing side of the chosen triangle. If the next triangle is not empty there is only one possibility to leave it. The player's line continues in that direction and may go through several non-empty triangles. As soon as the line comes to an empty triangle play area it ends on the opposing point, which is the active player's color. Note: A move that would go through a triangle containing a black dot is forbidden.&#10;&#10;A player wins if they connect their two initially filled in lines along two sides of the triangle game board.&#10;&#10;",

Players each take one item that they can use whenever they wish to create a powerful effect, like taking double turns, hiding discarded cards, or even skipping your discard phase to keep an extra card! But whenever you use a Cursed Item, it turns into negative points at the end of the game&mdash;the more powerful the effect, the more points you lose!&#10;&#10;Add three new suits to the game: Develop your realms with Buildings, attract powerful mythical Outsiders, and raise the Undead.&#10;&#10;Includes 47 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Immediately, they decided to hire a zoo architect, and collected many people to work on it. You are first-class architects assembled for this project. Take a breather and complete the best zoo!&#10;&#10;Every round, you&rsquo;ll choose one of your two hand cards to lay down, and everyone reveals what they laid at the same time. These cards go in the middle, eventually forming a 6x6 grid of 36 cards. Once all the spaces have been filled, the next stage of the game begins.&#10;&#10;Now you all have to decide how to make one line to connect the START and the GOAL that also connects nine different animals. If you can do that, you successfully complete the game and everyone wins!&#10;&#10;If however, you can&rsquo;t complete the line or find a way to pass all the animals, or if you can&rsquo;t find a

    "Description": "ElevatorUp is the brand NEW kid-created, kid-designed, kid-marketed, and kid-shipped (yes, they're all me) card game! Elevator Up will keep you smiling through Ups, Downs, and even getting Stuck!&#10;&#10;ElevatorUp is fast-paced, easy-to-learn, and never gets old. Uno, GoFish, and other classic card games begin to become monotonous. Luckily, ElevatorUp provides a much needed innovation.&#10;&#10;It is perfect for Travel, Camp, Sleepovers, Parties, Game-Nights, and any other occasion for a card game.&#10;&#10;THEME:&#10;An elevator going Up, Down, and sometimes Stuck in a building!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;Object - Be the first one out of cards.&#10;&#10;Setup - Give each player 3 cards face down on the table (no one is allowed to look at these), 2 cards face up on the table (everyone can see these), and 3 cards for their hand (only that player can look at those).&#10;&#10;Gameplay -  There are three sections of the game: Beginning: Hand Cards, Middle: Face Up Cards, End: Face Down Cards.&#10;When it is your turn, you must discard a card that is either an equal/higher floor than the previously played card or a special card. If there is no previously played card, then you can play any card. Continue taking turns and discarding cards until someone does not have a special card or an equal/higher floor, meaning they must pick up the entire discard pile and add it to their hand. Players must keep at least 3 cards in their hand at all times, replenishing from the remainder of the deck. The special cards, including New Building, Stuck, Penthouse, Door Closed, and Down to the Lobby, throw exciting twists and turns.&#10;Once the deck has been completely used up and players finish playing the cards in their hand, they move onto the face up cards, leaving them for all to see. The rules are the same for this section, but their hand can be seen by other players. Once they've gotten rid of their face up cards, it is time to play their face down cards. When it is their turn, the player will flip a card onto the discard pile. If it is an equal/higher floor or a special card, then shout &quot;YAY&quot; or any other celebratory exclamation. If it does not, then put on your game face and pick up the entire discard pile, adding it to your hand. The first player out of cards WINS!&#10;&#10;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.&#10;&#10;Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.&#10;&#10;Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.&#10;&#10;You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.&#10;&#10;",

Player one has to guess is it Truth or a Lie and gains a point if they identified it correctly. This can also be played as a drinking game where the wrong guess means you take a drink. Suitable for 2-8 players 16+y/o for normal games and older if its a drinking game.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-cooperatively, where all questions are Truth and take turns to ask the other(s). Lose a point for no answer given or you want to skip. Alternatively focus more on the answers and interesting conversations normally ensue for clarification or shared experiences together.&#10;&#10;",

War spreads around the globe, eventually engulfing the empires&rsquo; South American allies.&#10;&#10;Like all the other Second Great War at Sea games and books, Tropical Storm uses the rules from Second World War at Sea and is fully compatible with that series&rsquo; historical games.&#10;&#10;Tropical Storm includes a map (covering Argentina&rsquo;s central coast) and 80 new die-cut, silky smooth playing pieces (60 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 20 standard-sized square ones). Thirty new scenarios move the story along, and put even more hot battleship action on your gaming table.&#10;&#10;Tropical Storm is not a complete game.

Players take turns drawing a card, playing up to one card from their hand, and making up to one character exchange per turn. This process is called a &quot;swap&quot; and it &quot;levels up&quot; your cards from rank 1 all the way to rank 4.&#10;&#10;To win, earn 20 &quot;CHEER&quot; points by challenging your opponent's cards to Trick Battles that appeal to each tribe's fan base. CHEER is earned whenever you challenge your opponent but they fail to defend. They can defend their turf by matching up their own Tricks against yours, but the lowest scoring Trick will be removed from the game and placed into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Strategic play involves knowing when to challenge and when to defend. It also requires smart swapping to maximize the Ranks of your characters while preparing for counter play. There are 3 types of cards: Tricks that score points, Assists that boost Tricks, and Disses that remove other cards from play.&#10;&#10;",

The King ordered all the other alchemists&nbsp;to share their own Ingredients and findings with the Royal Alchemist to help each others&rsquo; progress.&nbsp;However, wanting to be the future and only Grand Alchemist, you will secretly sabotage the other alchemists using powerful spells while avoiding punishments from the King.&nbsp;Who will rise to the top to become the Grand Alchemist?&#10;&#10;In the beginning, each player is dealt 1 Sabotage card which can be played an unlimited number of times and an assortment of Ingredients or Spells.

However, you can choose to sabotage by playing the Sabotage card or a Spell instead. As all the cards are played face down, nobody knows what anyone else is playing. The Royal Alchemist reveals all the cards and determines the fate accordingly. &#10;There are 3 possible scenarios:&#10;&#10;     If half or more than half of the cards played are Ingredients: The Royal Alchemist collects all the Ingredients played and the spells will be cast.&#10;     If less than half of the cards played are Ingredients: The Royal Alchemist collects all Ingredients played and players who played Spells or Sabotage cards must instead give the Royal Alchemist any 2 cards from their hand.
