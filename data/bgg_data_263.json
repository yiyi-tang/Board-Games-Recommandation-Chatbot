    "Description": "The Crunch is here! Financial foundations are crumbling, while our nation's cherished traditions of greed, profit and exploitation are threatened.&#10;&#10;As the CEO of a global bank, it's your personal responsibility to do whatever it takes to ensure a comfortable retirement. Call in government bailouts, award yourself bonuses and - when no one's looking - embezzle as much as you can, before it all comes crashing down around you.&#10;&#10;Crunch is a card game for 2 to 4 players that allows you to experience the upside of down. Placed in the role of a global banking CEO, you have to juggle the conflicting demands of your ailing bank and your flourishing bank account.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the game also replicates our modern banking system and foreshadows the inevitable collapse of capitalism, but that's just a bonus.&#10;&#10;It's a Trust Thing&#10;Each player starts the game with a number of Assets in their bank, a small workforce and a few Trust cards. Trust is essential to your bank's survival. Not only will capitalism falter without it, but each Trust card hides on the reverse a potential Government Bailout.&#10;&#10;Government Bailouts can be called in at any time you're feeling the pinch (that's at any time) in return for a variable cash injection. Occasionally though you get nothing, so spend them wisely.&#10;&#10;Debt Makes the World Go Round&#10;Using your workforce, you lend out your bank's Assets as debt. You can dabble in high risk debt for potentially big rewards (and big losses) or stick to the safer (but less profitable) low risk debt. Either way, clever playing of the markets will bring in big returns.&#10;&#10;Bonuses and Embezzling&#10;But then that's all immaterial because what's really important is how much money you can secure for your own personal fortune. You do this by awarding yourself bonuses at regular intervals and by brazenly embezzling your own bank's Assets and hiding them when no one else is looking. If you get caught embezzling, you lose a Trust card and you remember how important Trust is, right?&#10;&#10;Surviving the Crunch&#10;Occasionally, the Crunch will hit and all CEOs have to make sure they can cover all the money they've lent out with the total value of Assets in their banks. If they can't, it's government bailout time or bust. But don't worry too much if that happens because if you've managed to bonus and embezzle enough, you can still win the game, even if you go bankrupt first.&#10;&#10;Remember, you could run a model bank for the entire duration of the game, but if you fail to look after number one, you risk ending up yachtless.&#10;&#10;",

This &ldquo;Symbol&rdquo; is in the center of the board.&#10;By doing this you will be invested &ldquo;Kingdom Knight&rdquo;.&#10;The first one in being invested as a Knight in three different cities will win the game.&#10;&#10;The most special thing about this game was his &ldquo;Dadofetiche M&aacute;gico&rdquo; (&ldquo;Magic Fetish Dice&rdquo;), a very big plastic dice modeled as a totem.&#10; (IN SPANISH / EN ESPA&Ntilde;OL)&#10;&#10;Los reinos de Dag&oacute;n est&aacute;n bajo el maleficio del hechicero, al usurpar &eacute;ste el s&iacute;mbolo m&aacute;gico, que se encuentra custodiado por la &ldquo;Criatura de la Laguna&rdquo;.&#10;El Reino de Dag&oacute;n est&aacute; formado por cuatro ciudades liliputienses.&#10;Dag&oacute;n pide ayuda al mundo exterior, a su amigo Gulliver, quien re&uacute;ne a los m&aacute;s intr&eacute;pidos guerreros para ir en su ayuda. Pero hay un problema, las ciudades son muy peque&ntilde;as para ellos, por lo que deciden mandar a sus descendientes.&#10;&#10;Para ganar el juego debes ir a buscar el &ldquo;S&iacute;mbolo de Dag&oacute;n&rdquo; y llevarlo a una de las ciudades. Este &ldquo;S&iacute;mbolo&rdquo; se encuentra en el centro del tablero. &#10;Por esta misi&oacute;n ser&aacute;s investido &ldquo;Caballero del Reino&rdquo;.&#10;El primero que sea investido tres veces caballero de tres ciudades distintas gana.&#10;&#10;Lo mejor del juego era sin duda su &ldquo;Dadofetiche M&aacute;gico&rdquo;, un enorme dado de pl&aacute;stico con forma de t&oacute;tem.&#10;&#10;",

These last two dice must be rolled as a pair (if you roll a 5 and a 1 you must keep both or re-roll both). If the player fails to get his ship, captain, and crew, he scores 0 for that round.&#10;&#10;The game may be played to a certain point level (first player to X points wins), or as a simple one-round game where highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Another common version is needing a ship (6) and a captain (5), with the other 3 dice being the crew.&#10;&#10;",

You can force your opponent to miss their turn (Pigass), draw 3 additional cards (Greedypig), change the direction of play (The Pig-go-round), change the color of the card in front of you (Pigameleon), forbid any talking at the table (Silent-Pig), or check the reaction time of your friends (Lightning-Pork). Finally, it will be up to you to steal your friends&rsquo; turns right from under their noses, or sick the Pig cards on them. All in all, you&rsquo;ll have to be a real pig to your friends.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Swintus 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The interesting part is that there is also a visual component as well.  You can roll a My Play or an All Play category which will play a short movie clip, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, Hannibal, etc. and then ask you questions about the clip, it could be something as simple as how many glasses of water were in the clip to what state did the clip take place, or even who was the actress who played that character's mother.  The game is very fast paced and a lot of fun.  The graphics on the DVD menus and the changes are very nice to watch.

If the player fails to complete the trick in the number of tries, then the next player attempts the same trick.  Follow the same rules for completing the trick.  If all players fail, then discard the trick and move on to the next trick card, it would now be the original first player's turn again.&#10;&#10;You can play until any preset goal you want, first to three tricks, five tricks, or until the deck is gone and count up the totals.  The game even recommends combining 2 or more trick cards into &quot;Expert&quot; tricks.&#10;&#10;Each of the three versions has their own trick deck, so if you purchased all three you can combine them into one 90 card deck.  Also included are blank cards for making up your own.&#10;It's actually way more fun than you would think, and the cup lights up and makes sound effects unique to the version you purchased.  The cards are really just stepping stones to making your own even more elaborate tricks.&#10;&#10;-----From the Box-----&#10;&#10;What exactly is CUPONK? The object: sink your ball into the cup and light it up. Get it in and you&rsquo;ll hear the sweet sounds of victory, YEAH! You rock. Miss the shot and your friends get the chance to one-up you. When playing CUPONK your entire home can become a legitimate playing field. Tables, walls, chairs &ndash; IT&rsquo;S ON! Test out sick trick shots like Door Jam, Stairing Contest and Wall Banger. What you don&rsquo;t like the names? Okay tough guy, make up your own! &#10;Show your skill and sink sick shots. Features lights and crazy (gorilla / wild wrestling / killer zombie) sounds! Includes 1 CUPONK cup, 2 CUPONK balls, 30 trick cards, a ramp accessory and instruction guide. &#10;Requires 3 AAA batteries (not included). For 1 or more player(s). Ages 9 and up. &#10;[Taken from HASBRO Site]&#10;&#10;There are three versions in the first wave: Gorillanator, El Campeon, Let it R.I.P.&#10;&#10;The second wave includes three versions: Boomshakalaka, Monsterosity, King of L.A.&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, Le Flush Royale,was released alongside the second wave. It includes a cup with a plastic lid/backboard, Cuponk head band, five stickers, six balls, a set of thirty cards and instructions.&#10;&#10;There are also two different sets of extra balls.

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Champion of Earth is an easy to learn, quick-play card game where the players defend the Earth from an alien invasion.&#10;&#10;It has both both a co-operative and a competitive element because, while you want to defeat the invasion, the winner will be the one with the most enemy kills.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of three types of cards: Player cards (which track your character's status), Monster cards (which represent the invaders) and Equipment cards (which represent the equipment the characters may use to defeat the Monsters).&#10;&#10;The players take equipment and must match or exceed the power level of the invaders by playing that equipment. Many of the invaders have special abilities, and so does much of the equipment - these are listed on the cards where relevant.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they choose between 1 and 3 equipment cards to draw and the same number of invaders are drawn and placed face down. The player then chooses how many of the invaders they wish to fight. That number of cards is turned over, beginning from the first card dealt. The player must then play Equipment on the Monster cards to defeat them and claim the corpses.&#10;&#10;If they succeed in defeating the enemies, they chose to fight, it becomes the next player's turn. If they fail, they become Injured. If they are injured a second time, they die.&#10;&#10;Even dead, a player can win - the victory condition is defeating the invasion and having the most enemy kills - you can be the Champion of Earth posthumously!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qubic, which has been released multiple times by multiple publishers under various names and credited to various designers, is a placement game played on the 64 positions in a 3D board with four levels and a four-by-four grid on each level. The object is to get four in a row, whether on one level or between all four levels, straight or diagonal. It is essentially a Tic-Tac-Toe game in a 4x4x4 cube.&#10;&#10;The cube needs to be emptied before start. Each player choose a color of their pieces and take turn to place their pieces in vacant positions, one piece at a time. The player wins who first gets four in a row of his own pieces - either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. A player cannot remove or replace pieces that have already been placed. If all positions are occupied without anyone having four in a row, then the game is called a tie.&#10;&#10;A rule that makes it less advantageous to begin is to prohibit the first player from placing his first piece in either a corner position or in one of the eight center positions.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid&#10;    4tec - which is the same game on the 4x4x4 grid also&#10;    Flix - which uses dice to control placement of men on 4x4x4 grid &#10;    Four Letter Words - played on 4x4x4 grid, though with words&#10;    Q4 - which also played on 4x4x4 grid but with only 12 markers&#10;    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.&#10;    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also&#10;    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up&#10;    Dimensions (1970), Hi!Noon: Das Duell (2009), Tic Tac Turn (2011), and X: Die 4. Dimension - the 4 individual horizontal board layers (4x4 each) of the 4x4x4 grid can turn&#10;    3D5 - which is played on a 5x5x5 grid&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling &quot;TOWER&quot; and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!&#10;&#10;When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where &quot;things happen&quot;. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the &quot;TOWER&quot; Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.&#10;&#10;Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause &quot;mayhem&quot; when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!&#10;&#10;While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.&#10;&#10;The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!&#10;&#10;",

The title comes from a rather audacious act of the Roman admiral, Claudius the Handsome.  He was told by the official augurs that the portents were not good for a naval battle: &quot;the sacred chickens will not eat.&quot;  Claudius threw the sacred chickens into the sea, saying &quot;then let them drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game comes with 100 counters representing both ships and informational counters, an 11&quot; x 17&quot; map (28x43 cm), and eight pages of illustrated rules with sidebars.  A small game by wargame standards.&#10;&#10;The basic sequence is mutual assignment of speed to galleys, Carthaginian ships move then board, and finally Roman ships move then board.  Facing is important, ramming, fouling other ships and shearing oars are all possible.  Melee fighting is common.  There are optional command/control/formation rules.&#10;&#10;All in all, fairly low complexity as wargame simulations go.&#10;&#10;",

For ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;From a review in &quot;Games Quarterly&quot;, Winter 2005:&#10;&#10;The Domination board is a seven-by-seven grid of squares with sets of numbers that resemble half a domino at each corner. Each player starts with seven dominoes. When it's your turn, you lay down a domino along one edge of a square so that the numbers on both corners match your domino. Then you draw another domino.&#10;&#10;If your play closes off the fourth side of a square, you put a poker chip in the center of that square to claim it. You keep playing until all the dominoes are used, which fills up the entire board. At that point, the player with the most chips on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Against the Odds magazine #6&#10;&#10;A solitaire game simulating the three day battle for the pass at Thermopylae from 18 August to 20 August 480 B.C.  Includes a 23&quot; by 34&quot; mapsheet, 240 half-inch die-cut counters, 8 page rule book, and two copies of reference charts.  No ground scale is specified, each combat unit is 100 men, each full game turns represents one full day of time (there are action rounds and segments within each full turn).&#10;&#10;In this solitaire game the player takes on the role of Leonidas, Spartan commander in charge of the Greek forces, against the overwhelming invasion force of the Persians.  The rule set governs the movement and combat of the Persians.&#10;&#10;The battle field itself only takes up a portion of the 23&quot; by 34&quot; mapsheet, which also areas for tracking game turns, Greek and Persian morale, and a missile fire priority diagram.  The battle field has a grid (not hex) pattern.  The Thermopylae pass was very narrow (20 meters at the narrowest point), so unit deployment is the essential mechanic instead of side ranging maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Although this is primarily a solitaire game, there are minor rule changes provided for two-player play (Greek and Persian sides), and even a three-player option (commanding different contingents of the Greek force).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Do you remember the movie of The Thing? That of the eighties, that of John Carpenter. You liked it, did not you? Well, look no further. If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.&#10;&#10;In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.&#10;&#10;A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?&#10;&#10;The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.&#10;&#10;It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).&#10;&#10;The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...&#10;&#10;Overview.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Event Phase&#10;     Voting phase&#10;     Movement phase&#10;&#10;&#10;During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.&#10;&#10;In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.&#10;&#10;The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human. The bad thing is that there will be moments during the game in which no one will know who is who, further sowing chaos in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each category is accompanied by a value from one to ten.&#10;&#10;Two to five players are dealt all the cards and hold their hand with only one card visible on top of their deck. The game is played in rounds. The current first player chooses a category. The round winner is the holder of the card that shows the highest value for the chosen category on all the currently visible cards. The round winner adds all the visible cards to their hand and everyone turns over a new card. The winner of the round then chooses the next category. The winner of the game is the first player to hold all of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",
