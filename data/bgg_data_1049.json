Each hunter tries to cature the fox of the same color by getting on the same area as the fox. Movement is one area per turn. After each third move the players have to inform the opposite team of the name of the area he is standing on. There are 1 item of 12 areas and 2 items of 18 areas on each board. If a hunter gets on the same area as the fox of his color and claims the fox to be captured, the hunter has won, if the fox reaches the opposite edge of the game board, the fox has won. In both cases both are eliminated from the game. The last fox captured or escaped decides the winning team.&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equiped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.&#10;&#10;But where to begin? Clearly, the problem was not finding an idea but choosing the right one from my vast amount of ideas&hellip; The arrival of the FFI dice and order tokens tilted the balance. Reading up on the subject along with finding several internet images pertaining to the French Resistance provided inspiration. My vision on how this page of our history is intertwined with the secret war in the universe of Achtung Cthulhu prompted me to create a new FFI unit and different options.&#10;&#10;For a long time I wanted to expand this faction so as to turn it into a complete and in certain cases independent army. Initially made to represent only the French Resistance, an FFI army can be used to depict any group of civilians that has taken up arms, regardless of their nationality in the scenario or whether they are deployed in the HoN or SoN universe. I spent many hours in front of my screen, with trials and errors, corrections, new attempts&hellip; So finally today, I have the pleasure of presenting to you, my first punchboard. It is approved by Yann and Clem and validated as an official DPG product.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game is quick, but encourages contemplative interaction and logical thinking.&#10;&#10;There are alternate rule sets that allow a competitive game, where you try to prevent your opponent from meeting their goal while trying to make yours, or to play solo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Another winner of our Nano Game Contest, this one stood out right from the beginning due to its range with just 9 cards. Jason actually developed it as a system with multiple different ways to play, and we may release additional rules down the line.

    "Description": "Abak Evolution is a variant of the traditional Backgammon game that includes different classes of checkers in the game, with special features each. These features are the ability to go backward, trapping a checker instead of hitting it, limited movement (an analogy of wounded soldiers), and extra strength (or an analogy for it).&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;General RulesAll of the backgammon rules are present in Abak Evolution, with 3 general additions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A point or column can only stack five checkers (this is known as the Egyptian rule on standard backgammon, but is not often used in the classic version).&#10;    The checkers in a column must be moved in order from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Classes:&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;There are 6 classes of checkers:&#10;    General: It can move backward.&#10;    Druid: It immobilizes an opponent, instead of hit it.&#10;    Guards (x2): It can block the column being alone in it.&#10;    Regular (x9): No difference with backgammon.&#10;    Wounded:&#10;         Odd: It can only move if the die number is 1,3,5. Odd numbers.&#10;         Even: It can only move if the die number is 2,4,6. Even numbers.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Each of these classes has its own set of rules, and all rules must be fulfilled to make a legal move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description of Classes:&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;General:The General is a checker that can go backward. Some limitations are applied:&#10;&#10;     During a turn, when it goes backward, it can no move again, neither backward nor forward.&#10;     During a turn, when it goes forward, it can not move backward on the next movement.&#10;     It can only move forward if there are other checkers of his team outside its home.&#10;     When playing from the bar, the next movement can be backward.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Druid:The druid Traps a checker, instead of hitting it. The druid is placed over that checker, not allowing it to move until is off.&#10;&#10;     This feature is present only in the middle camp. At any home, it hit the checker, behaving like a regular checker.&#10;     It can be hit by any other class.&#10;     While the druid is trapping an enemy checker, it can stack more checkers over it. If it is alone over the checker, it can be hit by any checker, or trapped by the enemy druid.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Guard:Guards behave like two checkers together. Being alone in a column is a blocked position for a regular checker. The special rules on guards are the following:&#10;&#10;     A checker can't hit a single guard unless that checker is another guard.&#10;     The druid can trap a guard when it is alone.&#10;     Two no-guard checkers can hit a guard that is alone if both hit on the guard position in consecutive movements during the turn (a movement known as Jane in the Middle East).&#10;     Each team has 2 guards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Wounded:The checker in the wounded class has limited movements. There is the Even Wounded and The Odd Wounded.&#10;&#10;Even Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is even (2,4,6).&#10;&#10;     When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.&#10;&#10;&#10;Odd Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is odd (1,3,5).&#10;&#10;     When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Soldiers:&#10;     Regular checkers that behave like backgammon checkers.&#10;     Each team has 9.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

That minor change is in fact huge for how we treat our faction buildings. Amazons are a unique faction that will not discard their faction foundation when used to build another card, and will put back in their faction deck instead.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s more, you will also gain the ability to discard cards from the hand, which will help you control your next moves.

They also get a lot of bonuses for building their cheap faction cards. How will you help them secure their place among others?&#10;&#10;As you may have realized by now, all new Imperial Settlers factions begin with the letter &quot;A&quot; &mdash; and this is no exception!

Embrace your dark side and play the part of a monstrous Demon or join a desperate band of Exorcists attempting to banish it. Either side can win.&#10;&#10;The Exorcists must resolve all Ritual cards in play to banish the Demon. This is done by playing cards to match Ritual components. They may alternatively choose to use their cards for effects to buy time and protection, but this sacrifices their action in the process.&#10;&#10;They must manage their resources carefully, as their cards can be played to satisfy the requirements of Rituals, but are also needed to defend themselves against Demonic attack.&#10;&#10;The Demon wins when their Demon Dice reaches 10, and each turn that passes brings them closer to their moment of victory. The Demon is more powerful than the Exorcists, taking more actions and  disrupting the Exorcists on multiple fronts.&#10;&#10;Banishment is highly interactive and almost every aspect of the game can be manipulated with the right cards.&#10;&#10;The Cult War expansion set adds powerful new relics to the Exorcists' arsenal, as well as foul magicks that favour the Demon.&#10;&#10;If you have two copies of the Banishment base game as well as the expansion cards, you can play the Cult War variant, a 6-player game where two teams called Cults attempt to be the first to summon the dreaded Dark One.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Points are awarded points at the end of the game for the areas they created. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, every player gets an &quot;Entrance&quot; tile (featuring all four areas). Shuffle the layout cards to make a draw deck (cards face up), and place a number of layout tiles equal to the number of players face up. The player that has most recently visited an aquarium goes first.&#10;&#10;Each round, there are two phases: a tile acquisition phase, and a building phase.&#10;&#10;During the tile acquisition phase, players take turns picking a tile from the available layout tiles. Play proceeds clockwise, and each player may decide to pick immediately, or postpone their decision (&quot;pass&quot;) and pick a tile after others have picked theirs. Players can only pass once: if a player decides to &quot;pass&quot; they will have to pick a tile after the other players have picked their tiles or passed. This continues until all players have picked a tile. The last person to pick a tile will be the starting player next round.&#10;&#10;Examples: 4 players, A-B-C-D, A starts&#10;1. A: picks, B: picks, C: picks, D: picks. Every player has a card, acquisition phase ends. D is next round's starting player.&#10;2. A: picks, B: passes, C: picks, D: picks, A: does nothing, B: picks. Every player has a card, acquisition phase ends. B is next round's starting player.&#10;&#10;During the building phase, player place their tiles in their own Aquarium. The following restrictions apply:&#10;1. The sides of the tiles have to touch completely. The orientation of the tile does not matter.&#10;2. Tiles cannot go outside a 3 by 3 frame. Entrance does not have to be in the middle.&#10;3. Areas on the tiles do not have to match.&#10;4. Once placed, tiles cannot be moved.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, the layout cards are replenished.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players will have a 3 by 3 grid.&#10;&#10;Scoring points is easy: &#10;&#10;     You can only count connected areas with 2 or more animals.&#10;     For each area, count the number of tiles in that area and add the number of animals.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Feel the thrill of racing like never before with DRIFT, the next level in tabletop racing games for 2-4 players, featuring the exciting world of drift racing!&#10;&#10;Unlike most other racing games, DRIFT simulates the feeling of driving a car using a completely innovative movement mechanic called the TrajecTile system.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, they use a uniquely shaped set of tiles, TrajecTiles, to plot their car&rsquo;s movement on the track. The tiles represent the gears of a car, 1 through 5. The higher the gear, the further the distance the car moves. The special shapes at the ends of the tile mean that each tile can pivot in the previous tile to simulate steering. The lower the gear tile played, the further it is able to pivot in the previous tile. So, in first gear, although the car is not moving very far, it has the most maneuverability, while in 5th gear, the car is moving quite far but has the least maneuverability.&#10;&#10;Five tiles are played each turn, one after the other, and players must chain through the gears like in a real car. Each tile must be followed by a tile that is either the same gear, or one gear higher or lower than the previous tile. So, a 3rd gear tile can be followed by a 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear tile, but not a 1st or 5th.  This has the effect of simulating different handling characteristics at various speeds and, as the tiles must be chained together, simulates acceleration and braking as well. Once 5 tiles have been played, their car is moved to the end of the last tile and the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;There are two special types of tiles in the game and it&rsquo;s here that drifting comes into play. The first is a handbrake tile, which is used to start a car drifting. A normal gear tile cannot fit into a handbrake tile. A handbrake tile must be followed by one or more drift tiles. The unique shape of a drift tile means that they fit into the corner of a previously placed tile. They can be pivoted in a previous tile, like a normal tile but, if rotated all the way, may also be &ldquo;slid out&rdquo; along their flat side to &ldquo;feather&rdquo; the drift.&#10;&#10;Drifting, if done in special Drift Zones around the corners of the track, will earn players Edge Points. These points can be used on subsequent turns to break certain rules of the game. For instance, Edge Points can be spent to &ldquo;Powershift&rdquo;, allowing players to skip up and down gears. i.e. Jumping straight from 1st up to 5th gear or vice versa.&#10;&#10;There are, of course, more rules to the game but that should be enough to give you an idea of how the TrajecTile system works.&#10;&#10;In addition to a full set of TrajecTiles, DRIFT features 4 highly detailed plastic car miniatures and a set of modular track sections for unlimited replayability as well as player boards with gearshifts to track player&rsquo;s Edge Points and gears from turn to turn. A set of cards to track race positions and reference cards for the various &ldquo;special maneuvers&rdquo; that players can purchase with Edge Points earned through drifting are also included along with sand timers to time the players turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The board for this game is displayed on the wall in the museum. The board displays the names and logos of 48 different railroads of the united states circa 1948. The board shows the routes of these different railroads and the major cities they services. I assume this was a pickup and delivery game, but I am not sure.&#10;&#10;The game board is 15 X 24 inches.&#10;&#10;A little more information from the Museum on this:&#10;&#10;&quot;The box was falling apart and so was discarded, as was the instruction sheet. I recall there were also small, lightweight cardboard markers, probably some original and some added by a previous owner.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The object was to earn points by delivering carloads of freight to destinations named on the board, and to earn more points than opponents by controlling routes so they could not make deliveries.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of the 48 railroads named, only two still operate under those names: Union Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.&quot; December 2016&#10;&#10;UPDATE 01/03/2025&#10;The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York has a partial copy of the game in their collection. They obtained it in a lot of games they purchased that previously belonged to game designer and collector Sid Sackson, object ID 111.3058.&#10;&#10;",

As soon as a card moved to the completion area, follow this process:&#10;&#10;1: Advance the technology token of that card's field.&#10;2: If the tech token has reached the rightmost space of a track, take another tech token from reserve and place it on the first space of that track.&#10;3: Apply completed card's effect.&#10;4: Put the card back in the center's appropriate position.&#10;&#10;The game ends if all flask tokens or all tech tokens run out. Then calculate various scoring factors: flask tokens, tech tokens, fields, etc.&#10;&#10;All cards are always visible to players and this is the game with no luck element. No random cards draw, no hidden components or no rolling dice.&#10;&#10;In a game, always use 12 types of cards among 48 types. So every time in play, players are needed to set the strategy regarding the combination of visible cards.&#10;&#10;",

The ice wall must be set up with the color-coded blocks in a specific order. Players then roll a die to determine which color piece they need to remove. Instead of using their hands, players must use the snowflake wand to remove the blocks. After a block is removed, the player lifts the balcony, and stacks the block to build the palace on top of the ice wall. Players beware because if the balcony falls at any point during your turn, you are out! The first player to build the ice palace 10 blocks high, and then place the Elsa figure in the balcony, wins.&#10;&#10;",

The scent of spaghetti dances in your nose and you can almost taste the roast beef being slowly cooked and it&rsquo;s almost as if the kid shaking sprinkles on their ice cream is happening right in your ear. You&rsquo;ve never been this hungry and you can not take it much longer. The cashier asks for your money and you dig into your pocket looking for your wallet and as you grab it you see yourself shaking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; you think to yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there&rdquo;. You hand the cashier your money and with a smile as warm as fresh cinnamon rolls you hear &ldquo;enjoy!&rdquo;. But as you walk through you start to notice something is terribly wrong. People are fighting with one another, stealing from unsuspecting victims, and devouring food for the worry that it might be gone any moment. Fear hits you suddenly as you notice a sign at the front of the buffet &ldquo;NO REFUNDS!&rdquo; and before you can gather your thoughts you hear someone whisper in your ear, &ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&rdquo; is a 2-5 player game played in about 30-45 minutes. Over the course of three rounds you will earn points by devouring the most amount of dishes at the table, but be careful as your opponents will be trying to steal your food! Food cards are placed faced down in front of you; hiding their respective point values.  Using a wide variety of action cards you will be able steal from opponents, play defensive cards, and even gross dishes removing them from play; but beware of opponents tricking you into taking their rotten foods.  Spice up your dishes by playing add-ons on your dishes or trap other players by placing add-ons of opposite flavors onto a dish causing it to be worth negative points.  Still hungry? Fill up your plates using empty plate tokens to steal even more food, all is fair game until a dish is devoured.&#10;&#10;",

Each child takes turns being the leader and reading the current question card, which presents players with an A/B option, for example, &quot;Stand up if you think the rice dish paella comes from Spain. Sit down if you think it comes from Greece.&quot; All children sit or stand at the same time, then whoever is incorrect is out of the round. This continues until only one child remains. This child collects a point token, and whoever has three point tokens first wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Walk with Me&rdquo; is a Scenario designed for two Survivors (either two players, or one player controlling a Survivor and an Ally).&#10;&#10;While the memorable The Walking Dead scene that serves as the inspiration featured Michonne and Andrea on a stealth mission to a downed helicopter while Woodbury rivals and Merle hunt them down, the scenario can be played with almost any two Survivors.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Walk with Me&rdquo; makes heavy use of Rivals.&#10;&#10;The event deck is now called Lay Low, during the campaign they were referred to as Walk with Me&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear&quot; reunites Rick and Morgan in a battle of sanity while Michonne and Carl retrieve a memento.&#10;&#10;In this three-Survivor Scenario, you return to Rick&rsquo;s hometown in search of supplies, trying to grab an important memento while you&rsquo;re at it. When you arrive, you unexpectedly discover another remnant of the past waiting for you: Morgan, Rick&rsquo;s first friend after the apocalypse, who now stalks the streets of the town consumed by madness, driving away Walkers and people alike.&#10;&#10;In terms of gameplay, Morgan behaves a lot like a Rival. Each round, after the Survivors have taken their turns, Morgan performs a Reaction based on the Approach type of the Event selected by the Leader.&#10;&#10;Normally, when faced with an enemy as dangerous as Morgan, the simplest answer in the cold, harsh world of The Walking Dead would be just to kill him. However, in this Scenario that course of action actually causes you to lose! Your goal is to SAVE Morgan, pulling him out of the dark pit into which he has fallen. If you can get through to him, there may be a way to bring back the good man that still lies buried in his heart.&#10;&#10;You can save Morgan through Coordinate Actions. In &ldquo;Clear,&rdquo; whenever a Survivor near Morgan uses any Coordinate Action (whether it&rsquo;s the standard Assist Action, or a Special Action like&ldquo;Inspire&rdquo; from Rick's &ldquo;Born Leader&rdquo; Survivor Card), there are two extra success effects he or she can choose from. The first lets the Survivor reveal the top card of the Clarity deck, and discard it if he or she wishes. This gives the Survivors a chance to either gain some insight into what Morgan will do next and adjust their plans accordingly, or to bypass something particularly dangerous altogether.&#10;&#10;Clear Cards represent Morgan&rsquo;s more lucid moments and are basically &ldquo;safe&rdquo; cards when drawn from the Clarity deck, since&mdash;unlike the Hostile Cards&mdash;they have no instructions for Morgan to perform. While no Clear Cards start in the deck at first, more and more can be added over time, as Morgan begins to listen to reason. These cards not only help make Morgan more manageable during each cycle through the Clarity deck, but also happen to be the goal of the Scenario. While the Survivors won&rsquo;t be able to bring Morgan completely back, once all five Clear Cards have been moved to the Clarity deck, Morgan will be well enough for the Survivors to leave him and head home.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;- double sided map tile&#10;- 20 event cards&#10;- Morgan clarity deck&#10;- Merle rival board&#10;- rival board&#10;&#10;(from Kickstarter page)&#10;&#10;",

Players draw scenario cards that will aid or inhibit their progress while trying to collect ghosts.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards, Ghost Cards and Haunt (scenario) Cards. Each turn, players go through a scenario and then try to collect as many ghosts into their canisters as they can, but they have to consider that ghost types do not always match, so they will have to empty out canisters quite often to make room for new ghost types. This can cause heartbreak, but it can also put a player in the lead if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Players' hands represent the radars used as the Ghost Raiders, therefore they can't rearrange the order of cards in their hands.&#10;&#10;Players take their turns by doing the following:&#10;1. Draw a Haunt card.&#10;2. Draw or Discard Ghost cards.&#10;3. Play a Ghost card.&#10;4. Re-scan the room (Draw a Ghost card face-up, draw another Ghost card face-down).&#10;5.

    "Description": "You are a mad scientist with one goal... WORLD DOMINATION.  There's only one problem, there are other mad scientists in your way. To defeat the other mad Scientists  you will create a gang of Grunts using Gamma Juice, a radioactive goo. You&rsquo;ll need to disrupt the actions of the other mad scientists and ultimately Smash your opponent. In this deck builder, your Gamma Grunts Will help you Smash your opponents' forces and decks bringing you closer to world domination.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts with the same 15 cards consisting of 4 Discoveries, 5 Brutes, and 6 Gamma Juice cards. The Discoveries help you gain Infamy throughout the game, bringing you closer to winning. They also can help you get extra Gamma Juice. The Brutes are small Gamma Grunts without abilities that will get you started in combat and help you smash other people's decks. Gamma Juice is the resource of the game that is used to create Grunts and play Disruptions to get in the way of other Mad Scientists.&#10;&#10;There are also cards players can draft from to build up their decks. The cost varies from 1-4 and there will always be a revealed card of each cost players can draft, in addition to a blind deck of each cost people can draft. Players also get to choose 2 cards to displace, either by removing them from the game, or covering the displayed card. This enables you to create your own destiny with which cards you get to draft.&#10;&#10;The most important part of this game is that your deck is your life in this game. So when you damage a player, they are forced to smash cards from their deck and thus reduce their life. Knowing when to build up your deck and knowing when to battle others is a constant struggle. Just be sure you don't find yourself unable to draw because if you do, you lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SUMMARY &#10;All but one of the players will take on the role of a hero (who are part of the same guild) that is participating in a great competition known as &ldquo;The Dungeon Games&rdquo;. These events, created by the world&rsquo;s greatest magicians, are pulse-pounding, unpredictable and timed. Each player will need to make use of every round they have available to them, either trying to complete the main objective or grabbing &ldquo;Arcane Keys&rdquo; that are scattered around the environment for some vital extra points. The last player will take on the special role of Storyteller, who uses the prewritten adventures (or their own) to run the story the other players participate in. They function as a referee of sorts, playing all the NPCs and baddies in the combat (in Dice Odyssey, the Storyteller will try to defeat the heroes in combat by choosing a good combination of baddies and selecting their actions carefully).  The game is composed of 2 main systems, Exploration and Combat.&#10;&#10;EXPLORATION SYSTEM&#10;Each adventure will give the players a set number of rounds to complete it in. When a player takes a turn, he will tell the Storyteller what he plans to do, it&rsquo;s up to the Storyteller to gauge how many rounds it would take to accomplish it. Another simple element that makes this game feel completely unique are the Arcane Keys. They are collectables that are scattered everywhere, each one having some sort of puzzle or trial involved in getting to it. The Arcane Keys allow more opportunities for each person on the team to be helpful. For example, if the main objective requires Stealth and Athletics, then the Arcane Keys that are close by, will be Wits and Lore based. At every moment, all attributes are useful, and Arcane Keys are the main reason why.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player attempts to do something difficult, they will have to roll dice to see if they are successful. The number of dice they roll is determined by the attribute the Storyteller says is needed for the task and how many of that type of Attribute Card they have. For example, if a player needs to push a large sleeping giant out of the way, the Storyteller will tell him it will take an athletics roll, and what number he will have to roll to be successful, in this case, a 6. The player will look to see if he has an athletics Attribute Card, and will roll an additional die for each that he has. The base roll being 3 dice. There are 8 attributes; Athletics, Dungeoneering, Fortitude, Lore, Luck, Stealth, Vigilance and Wits. On each Attribute Card there is also some sort of boon, perhaps for Fortitude, a hero may have &ldquo;Bark Skin&rdquo;. This element can be used creatively to help the player throughout the quest, and ultimately is up to the Storyteller. Generally, the rule is, if they can explain how they are using it for a task, they can convert the Attribute Card to a different type. Using the card above &ldquo;Bark Skin (Fortitude)&rdquo;, a player hides next to a tree after stripping down. This could convert the Attribute Card from Fortitude to Stealth for the use of that one roll.&#10;&#10;COMBAT SYSTEM&#10;In most RPGs, heroes have some base stats that do not change, such as HP, defense, attacks, etc. But in Dice Odyssey, players can change their heroes &ldquo;base stats&rdquo;. Imagine a normally defensive, tough hero, who is putting his guard down to do extra damage this turn, in Dice Odyssey, that means he would have chosen a different Combat Card this turn. Players begin combat by assessing the baddies they are fighting, their teammates strengths and weaknesses and from that, what Combat Card would be most appropriate. Most heroes have 5 different Combat Cards, and can swap between those cards during the game by buying them at the store.&#10;&#10;After the baddies have been laid out, the players will also each grab 4 of the dice from their bags and roll them to see which of their Loot Cards they can use this round of combat. Each point rolled on a die, will allow the player to activate that many points on the corresponding Loot Card. For example, if they roll a 1 on a Fey die, they can pick which Fey card they want to activate (if they have more than one) and then pick which of the 3 (1 point) powers they want to use. If they were to roll a 2 instead, they could choose 2 (1 point) powers on that card. The Loot Cards serve as an add-on to the player's Combat Card. After 2 uses the Loot Cards break, at which point, you have to discard it and put one of your dice of that type back in the main bag. &#10;There is more to the combat system, but this covers most of it.&#10;&#10;CONCLUSION&#10;If the players are able to finish the main quest in the time allotted, they receive a point for each Arcane Key they were able to escape with. Depending on how many points they have, the heroes will be in 1st &ndash; 5th place. The actual victory is if they are able to complete the mission at all, the bonus points serve as a high score mechanic. It is also fun to replay the same quest to see if you can get the number one spot!&#10;&#10;",
