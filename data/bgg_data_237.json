Carlos Hatchcock&#10;&#10;You and your spotter enter play on one of four terrain maps: jungle, desert, countryside, or ruined city. Though you are at distance from your mission target, you will need to score morale points to be able to move into new zones, getting closer to your target. As you do, enemy hostiles may be seen, forcing you to avoid detection or they may need to be engaged to complete your mission. Movement into new zones closer to the target, is achieved by KIA enemy hostiles which gives you morale points that are expended in order to move but beware of the trip wires and claymore mines. Doing this all the while trying not to draw too much attention to yourself. The enemy may call in reserves looking for you. Many items may help you such as scopes and med kits and other useful equipment.&#10;&#10;A hand of cards gives the player options to fire, move, crawl, and hide. Location cards are used in each zone and the player will gain cover from these cards but also may find a surprise event. The player will need to earn morale points to be able to move into the next zone, these are earned by killing enemy hostiles. A player only has a certain number of wounds that can be taken during a mission and critical wounds will see the player in real trouble. Taking a shot is a tense moment the wind and other factors could affect the shot, if missed enemy hostiles will move closer towards the sniper and may even attempt to conduct an assault against them.&#10;&#10;Not only may single missions be played. A campaign is also possible consisting of ten missions. As each mission is completed, you will accumulate kill points which may be used to upgrade your weapons or obtain additional equipment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As legends foretold, he was inspired by the footprints of animals on the ground, and began to create all kinds of different symbols according to the forms of all things in nature, hoping to replace the conventional, yet unreliable, knot tying way of remembering things. For conveniences, Jie decides to name these symbols &quot;Zi&quot;, which means &quot;character&quot;. This is the origin of &quot;Hanzi&quot;, the &quot;character from Han dynasty&quot;.&#10;&#10;In H&agrave;nz&igrave;, players travel back 3600 years and serve as one of the pupils of Master Cang Jie. As you learn from the Master, you will create new characters that serve as the foundation of modern Chinese culture.&#10;&#10;In game terms, you lay out double-sided cards on the table that show the old letters on one side and the newer traditional letters on the other. On a turn, you choose a task card that shows a theme and score points by identifying two of the many kanji that match your theme from among the old letters. Whoever first earns ten points wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you must play a card that beats the value of the top card currently in play, play a mercenary (which automatically beats the top card), or play a battleground (which has an effect like &quot;the next player loses a turn&quot; or &quot;change the direction of play&quot;). Heroes, for example, gain +2 when played on Beasts, but are otherwise worth their normal value. Some races have the power to play a second card at the same time as the first or give an opponent a card from the player's hand. If you can't play, then you must draw a card instead.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have no cards left in your hand, so players will have to think strategically about which races they take to battle at each opportunity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the new card game of the Starnberger Spiele publishing house and the author Tanja Philippeit, the aim of the players is to collect the lowest possible scores in a display of nine initially hidden cards. You could almost mean &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot;. But far from it! In addition to a bit of luck in drawing cards, &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot; is especially about clever tactics. Otherwise you end up with an unintentionally high score. And as if that was not enough, then a drama lama or a karma lama can get in the way.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine cards, which he disguises in a rectangle arranged in front of him. These are revealed during the course of the game and exchanged with cards from the stack. The goal is to have the lowest possible card values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;in your display at the end of a round. You can even achieve minus points by collecting three identical cards in a row or a column. A round ends as soon as a player has revealed all nine cards. Who then has the lowest score, wins the round and may grab a piece of wood in the form of a lama. The first to collect three Lama pieces, ie to win three rounds, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Of course, it's not that easy. The collection of triplets is very attractive, but at the same time quite risky. Because the trick here is: the higher the numbers of the cards are in a treble, the more minuses you get. However, if a teammate finished the round, before you could complete the treble, you sit on solid plus points. And you definitely do not want them in this game. So you better play it safe and only collect low cards or rather speculate on the highest possible triplet? Some players even come up with the idea to end the round intentionally fast, when his teammates are currently working on a treble with high cards to mess up their tour. For proper vortex care in between all the special cards. With the drama lama one buzzes additional points on a fellow player. With the Karma Lama on the other hand, you have to give away minus points. There the joy is great - for the others!&#10;&#10;So while you optimize your own display, you must constantly keep an eye on the players. Most importantly, you should avoid discarding a card that the next player can use for his triplets collection.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The aim of the game is to build the best motorcycle in 8-10 playing rounds. The higher the HP, the more points the player gets for it. At the beginning each player gets 8-10 cards, depending on the number of players. Turn after turn he can get new cards, but must also put cards into the discard pile. If one player has enough parts to put a motorcycle together, he knocks on the table, if it is his turn. Now all players can draw one more card before phase 2 of the game begins. Successively the players lay out a motorcycle, normally the smallest possible combination. A motorcycle consists of a front wheel, an engine and a rear wheel with the gear change. Then the knocking player begins and plays one of his cards. This can be done in four ways. If possible, one can attach another card to the motorcycle; one may also exchange a card of the owned motorcycle and put the exchanged card on the discard pile. And a player might also put a covered card on the discard pile, if he has no more use for it. Apart from that players can play cards against other players to bug other players, if the target player does not have a defense card.&#10;When all cards have been played, players count the points they get for their motorcycles (HP multiplied with the amount of gear shifts(rear tire) and front tire). The HP is entered in a block, and a new round begins. After 10 rounds the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game where you choose a character with some different stats, and then play cards and draw new cards from the stack until the stack runs out of cards. The one with the most &quot;votes&quot; in the end gets elected to high scool president and thus wins the game.&#10;&#10;It's a humour-based, hilarious but rather complicated card game where a lot of the enjoyment relies on you knowing the clich&eacute;es in japanese animation concerning high school comedy. Though there's a lot of japanese text on the cards, it's playable without knowledge of japanese if you have a translation sitting nearby. Moreover, you learn what the cards do rather quickly.&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;There are two card piles: the play card pile and the &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile. The &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile contains only cards with a number of votes, 1 to 6 on each card. The play card pile consists of special vote cards (can be worth a lot, and also may have special powers), action cards (that affect other players) or event cards (all players have to sumbit to certain conditions).&#10;&#10;At your turn, you draw a play card and (unless it's an event card wich affets all players) may either take 2 actions OR draw yet another game card. Actions include drawing a standard vote card, playing a game card from your hand, or using a special power (from your special vote card or your character).&#10;&#10;The &quot;standard vote&quot; cards are kept hidden, people can see how many you have but not how much they're worth. The special vote cards however, (which are worth much, representing votes from whole clubs like the baseball team, the newpaper club and so on), are placed before you. These can be &quot;attacked&quot; by action cards, either nullified or stolen. Some action cards can cancel other action cards, and some special votes cards can be immune to attacks like these if you discard cards from your hand etc.&#10;&#10;So the game goes on until you've taken 2 laps through the draw pile of game cards. When the fourth event card is drawn, game ends immediately, and the person with most votes win.&#10;&#10;As said, much of the flavour of this game consists of clich&eacute;es in high school anime. The names of the standard vote-cards are sometimes hilarious. Some one-vote cards are named &quot;the ghost girl who nobody has ever seen&quot;, &quot;the maid robot&quot;, &quot;the one who secretly goes to a certain market selling certain home made comics&quot;, other cards include &quot;the I don't know whatever&quot; (3 votes), &quot;the ones with a boyfriend&quot; (2 votes), &quot;the diet girls&quot; (4 votes) et cetera. The special vote cards are typical high school clubs in japanese high schools.&#10;&#10;A very nice game but probably only for those who enjoy the style.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player plays a card face down on the table, making a claim such as &quot;I have seen one Yak&quot;, then draws a new card. Next player adds to that stack, raising the claim, either by raising the number or the size of the animal. The cards in the stack represent the animals which have actually been around. Play continues in clockwise order until a player calls a bluff and flips open the stack. If it doesn't contain at least as many animals of the last kind as were announced, the bluffing player takes the stack as a penalty, if it does, the caller takes them.&#10;Beware, there are some special cards that players can sneak into the stack, those which reduce the numbers on the cards or those that make all animals appear as the same kind.&#10;When the draw pile is exhausted, the player with least penalty cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a simplified reimplementation of Bluff im Zoo.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the classic tale of cooperation comes this simple game where players work together to &quot;cook&quot; a soup by making matches of ingredients. Match all of the ingredients before the fire under the kettle goes out and everyone wins! Turn all cards face down on the board. Players take turns turning 2 cards face up. If they match, place the 2 cards in the kettle area of the board. If they do not match, turn them face down. If a player turns a Fire Out card face up, the Fire Out card is placed on the fire area. If 10 Fire Out cards are placed in the fire area before all 12 matches are made, players lose. But wait, there is 1 magic stone card that can turn any Fire Out card face down again on the board. Players decide together when to use the magic stone card to help keep the soup cooking!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     1 game board&#10;     24 soup ingredient cards&#10;     1 magic stone card&#10;     10 fire out cards&#10;     A Tale of Stone Soup story&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One hundred and fifty years have passed since the first match in the Galactic Arena. This ancient mystical arena was originally located in an abandoned Serpente subsystem forgotten by time. After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.&#10;&#10;The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7. Only five heroes will survive to face the coming Apocalypse. The Oracles have spoken the words: &quot;May the Zenites shine upon you.&quot; Those who cannot understand their meaning are destined to meet their doom.&#10;&#10;Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena, the first of five projects set in the Apocalypse Universe, is a strategic science fiction &quot;hero vs. hero&quot; game that takes place in the Galactic Arena of CETUS-7. The guiding principle of this game is replayability. Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.&#10;&#10;The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.&#10;&#10;Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever first completes his planning grabs the sand timer in the center of the board, starting the timer for everyone else to finish their plans. Once time runs out, this player moves his character on the island, moving it to an adjacent space matching the color of the first die in his plan, then moving it again, and so on &ndash; ideally picking up lots of turtles along the way. The other players take turns in clockwise order. A player who lands his character on a corner space can move to either adjacent corner space (as long as he's placed the correct color in his movement chart).&#10;&#10;Players add turtles to the board to bring the total available to five or six, then start a new round. Once all the turtles have been collected, the game ends and the player score for the turtles they've collected: 8 points for a set of six differently-colored turtles, and 1 point for each other turtle. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Scrabble with math&quot; is how this game is generally described, and the description is apt.  The board is much like a Scrabble board, including spaces equivalent to &quot;double-word score&quot; and &quot;triple-letter score&quot;.  The difference is that, instead of placing words formed of letters, players of Equate place equations formed of numbers and symbols on the board.  The beginners game (consisting mostly of addition and subtraction of integers) is pretty simple, but the standard game, bringing in multiplication, division, and fractions, can be something of a brain-burner.&#10;&#10;",

Take turns flipping over one tile at a time. If you ever have a mix, bake and decorate tile revealed, then start the sand timer, draw a recipe card, and quickly try to fund and assemble the proper cupcake parts. If you finish before time runs out, draw a new recipe card and keep going. Once the sand timer runs out, flip all the tiles face down and start again.&#10;&#10;If you ever reveal all four clock tiles, then time has run out and the game is over. Your collective score is equal to the number of cupcakes you've created. Will you be suffering from a cupcake crisis, or will you be ready to host a perfect princess party?&#10;&#10;",

Actions consist of Drawing a card from the deck or playing a card from your hand and following the actions.&#10;&#10;Playing cards may result in forcing other players to draw cards, peeking at other player's cards, swapping hands with a player, attacking an individual player or forcing every player to take extra actions.&#10;&#10;When drawing you may draw a card that will instantly kill one of your Beans.&#10;&#10;If a player is attacked or if you draw a Kill card, you may defend against that attack or death by playing an accident card with a corresponding icon.

The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.&#10;The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.&#10;A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip. But the theme, the striking board and cards and that weird die makes this a fondly remembered game in the UK.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, flip cards from the deck until you either:&#10;- draw a witch: discard all cards revealed this turn; end of turn&#10;OR&#10;- decide to stop flipping: add the revealed cards to your collection&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all 6 ingredients wins. If no one has 6 after the deck is exhausted, the person with the most different ingredients wins. Duplicates are irrelevant, except in a variant (suggested for if playing with many players) where you allow trading.&#10;&#10;The Ravensburger editions contain 60 cards : 20 witches (red) and 40 ingredients (green).&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, they first rotate two cubes 90&ordm; two times; to do this, you sandwich two cubes with your fingers, pick them up to rotate them, then place them back in the holder. You can rotate the same pair of cubes twice or two different pairs.&#10;&#10;After rotating the cubes, the player moves the corresponding playing pieces &mdash; no matter to whom they belong! &mdash; according to the symbols now on top of the cubes along four racing tracks. Note that everyone is able to move everybody's playing pieces, and since the playing pieces can give each other &quot;piggyback rides&quot;, you have to be clever to make the right moves at the right time in order to move all of your own playing pieces off the ice first.&#10;&#10;",

The board is divided into a grid and a treasure detector is used to search for the buried treasure. The gold bags are magnetic and the treasure finder has a window that turns red when it has passed over treasure. A die is used to determine how many squares can be searched in a turn. The detector has a window that must be closed prior to searching for treasure. After moving the detector over a number of squares, the window is opened and if it has turned red, the detector has passed over a piece of your opponents treasure. By strategically searching the grid, a player is able to determine where the buried gold is hidden. A treasure map is provided to aid in remembering possible locations. The winner is the player that can locate all three treasure locations before his opponent. If you are not correct in all three locations, the opponent automatically wins.&#10;&#10;",

Play continues placing cards, either new credit cards (total of 4 types) or merchandise underneath credit cards until a player declares that he has the $10,000 or more, in which they count up the purchases.  The person who declares the round over gets a $2000 bonus, providing that the $10,000 has indeed been reached.&#10;&#10;There is also the ability to spoil your opponents.  There are Lost Card cards which are played on an opponent causing them to have to discard a credit card and the merchandise underneath.

Each player starts with a set of nine tactic cards (three of each tactic: Attack, Block, and Taunt). At the beginning of each round, you set your hand by selecting five of your nine tactics, setting aside the remaining cards until the next round.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, players engage in a series of clashes, using each card only once. (Tactic cards are discarded after use.) They secretly select their tactics, then simultaneously reveal them and resolve the clash: Attach beats Taunt, Taunt beats Block, Block beats Attack. The winner of a clash takes possession of the Leaf Totem, and whoever possesses the Leaf Totem at the end of the round scores a point. The first player to 3 points wins.&#10;&#10;In a three- or four-player game, the first clash is a free-for-all clash for the Leaf Totem. After that, play proceeds around the table in a king-of-the-hill style. Each challenger clashes against the current totem holder. If you can defeat all challengers consecutively without losing the totem, you score a point. As in the two-player game, first to 3 points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
