'90s Nostalgia works great as a standalone card game, or as an expansion pack for the Smart Ass board game.&#10;&#10;The start player draws a card and begins to read the eight clues aloud. All other players get one try at answering each card. When someone guesses the answer correctly, they collect that card but if no one answers it, the start player keeps the card for themselves.

The Air Forces, finally granted independence from the US Army, carry the burden alone in Europe. The more familiar aircraft of 1943 are gone. Only the experimental Mustang and Spitfire fighters and the bombers are left. In the place of the P47s and Bf109s, Europe is criss-crossed by High-Altitude BV-155 and Jet powered F80's.&#10;&#10;Komet Und Meteor is a variant to a favorite game of ours, Foxbat and Phantom. We recommend the use of a Spitfire [SPI] Counter set for the piston engine aircraft. K&amp;M grew from the experimental Me262 Flight Chart given in JP#3. This chart can be, of course, used in this game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;This variant for SPI's Cold War tactical-jet-combat simulation Foxbat &amp; Phantom was published in the fourth issue of JagdPanther magazine. Rules are added for piston-engined aircraft and rocket-powered fighters to allow players to recreate late-war World War II air battles.&#10;&#10;Flight charts are included for a number German and Allied aircraft. The German aircraft portrayed in the variant include the Ta-152F-4 radar interceptor, Ba-349G rocket-powered interceptor, He-177A-5 heavy bomber, Ar-234C-3 jet bomber, BV-155C-6 high altitude interceptor, Me-163C-1A rocket-powered interceptor, and the He-162-A2 jet fighter. Allied aircraft include the Meteor, F-80C-3, F-84B-2, and P59C jet fighters; B17-H, B24-N, A26-E, and B29-E piston-engined bombers; P-51F and Spitfire X piston-engined fighters; and the Soviet B2b rocket-powered interceptor. Six scenarios are included. These cover situations such as intercepting bombers, high altitude recon, and fighter duels.&#10;&#10;Komet Und Meteor is currently available in PDF format as Amarillo Design Bureau has digitally rereleased all issues of JagdPanther magazine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s free to download.&#10;&#10;This very early version is in black-and-white with very simple graphics.&#10;&#10;The Dark features a classic group of adventurers exploring a dungeon. One player lays out the dungeon cards, while the others control the adventurers. Adventurers leave torches to light the way through the dungeon as they explore, and for each torch placed the character player gains a point. Roles are then rotated, and scores compared to determine the victor!&#10;&#10;This set contains:&#10;1 double sided dungeon entrance card.&#10;6 adventurer cards, each with their own deck of 7 cards.&#10;47 dungeon master cards, including 4 instant cards.&#10;1 deck box.&#10;&#10;The Adventurers:&#10;Guard: Loves a scrap. Good at the stabby-stabby. No so good at the hygiene. Scared of water, so cannot cross the many and varied puddles dotted around the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Librarian: Great at magic. constantly coughs up warp-points. Carries a lot of books around, and is scared they&rsquo;ll get destroyed by the bonfires in the dungeon, so cannot cross doorways blocked by fire.&#10;&#10;Miner: Intent on ignoring the normal passageways of the dungeon and blasting new tunnels through the place. Spends most of his time underground so is terrified of heights, and cannot cross the cracks in the floor.&#10;&#10;Vampire: Here for a long time, not for a good time. Hated by the other adventurers, but kind of useful. Can&rsquo;t go through doorways without being invited and there&rsquo;s no one around to invite them.&#10;Aversion to silver.&#10;&#10;Explorer: Jack-of-all-trades kinda person. Bit of a coward. Rubbish at fighting monsters.&#10;&#10;Zombie: Barely alive. Probably still braindead. Rarely does anything, but oh so great at this adventuring business when they wake up and start smashing heads together.&#10;&#10;The Decks:&#10;Instants: Most adventurer deck cards and some dungeon master cards are Instants. Reveal the card, do what it says, then discard the card. Simples. Instants only affect cards in play, not cards in the decks.&#10;&#10;Permanents: These cards stay on the table until the end of the game or until another card causes them to be discarded.&#10;&#10;Dungeon cards: These make up the dungeon for your adventurers to explore. They&rsquo;re played dark side up with the nasty stuff on. To win the game the character player needs to flip these cards over to their light side, revealing nicer stuff.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Misplaced&rdquo; cards: The dungeon deck contains 4 instant cards. Some of the adventurer decks contain cards that can be played as part of the dungeon as if the character player were the dungeon master.&#10;&#10;When placing cards that form part of the dungeon:&#10;&bull; Cards must be played adjacent to another dungeon card forming a grid. Cards should meet along the full length of a long or short&#10;side of the card.&#10;&bull; Cards may not be placed corner-to-corner.&#10;&bull; Cards may be rotated 180 degrees, but not 90 degrees, they must always be in &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; orientation, not landscape.&#10;&bull; Cards can be placed in a way that rubble or other obstacles make the dungeon impassable in the next turn, but cards cannot be entirely blocked by rubble.&#10;&bull; Cards cannot be placed further back than the dungeon entrance, otherwise the table gets very messy very quickly.&#10;&#10;Reach:&#10;At many points during the game you&rsquo;ll need to check if an adventure can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; a monster or chest. Checking this is simple, just draw a line with your finger through the dungeon from the entrance card to the monster or chest in question. If you&rsquo;re not blocked by items that your adventurer is afraid of, or by more doors than you have keys, your character can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the monster or chest in question.&#10;&#10;The Adventurers will be blocked by:&#10;Rubble: Impassable. Find another way around.&#10;Locked doors: Can only be opened with a key.&#10;Kind of like locked doors in real life. Vampires have trouble with these.&#10;Puddles: Easy to walk through, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Bonfires: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Cracks in the floor: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Open Passage Ways: All characters can freely pass between rooms with open passage ways.&#10;&#10;In the dungeon you might find such varied items as:&#10;Monsters: The dream-team for any dungeon master. They look different but all do the same thing: cause the character player to lose cards until the monster is defeated. Don&rsquo;t hate the monster; hate the game.&#10;Wooden chests: Like silver chests, only made of wood.&#10;Silver chests: Like wooden chests only made of silver. Vampires really don&rsquo;t like silver that much, so can&rsquo;t travel through rooms containing silver chests.&#10;Warp Points: Any adventurer can travel from any warp point to any other warp point.&#10;Mine Shafts: Any adventure can travel from any mine shaft to any other mine shaft.&#10;Keys: For opening doors. All doors in the dungeon can be opened with any key, but you need as many keys as doors you want to open on a single character route. For example, if in order to reach a monster, the Guard needs to travel through 3 doors, you need 3 keys. No, you can&rsquo;t just take the key with you along the way&#10;because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why not. But that&rsquo;s not how the game works, okay?&#10;Bombs: Classic little bomb type bombs. When a bomb is revealed, the dungeon master can instantly discard a card from the top of any adventurer deck that can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the bomb. If the bomb is on an instant the dungeon master can pick any adventurer deck.&#10;Torches: This is how you win the game. As dungeon cards are flipped, torches will appear. The more torches, the higher your score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Rapid Fire (5) gives it a good Anti-Air gun built in giving it a roll in most West German Platoons, especially if you know your opponent has Hinds in their collection. You also have the ability to mount a Milan missile to it using the Mounted Milan card. This is a interesting upgrade because it gives you a good Anti-Tank Attack when you need it and if you already have that covered in your platoon, you can choose not to add it and save yourself 2 points.  On top of all that the Marder has Scout, an ability that lets it double the Defence bonus it normally would get from Cover.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Reallocation Phase - Move your Units card first between your World cards, and then to other player's World cards that you intend to attack.&#10;&#10;4.

Players then choose one from their hand each turn, and place it face down in front of themselves.  All of those cards are then simultaneously revealed. Typically, the player who chose the card with the highest value will score a point. However, duplicate cards cancel each other, '1' beats a '5', and '0' can be any value between 0-5. After all six cards have been played once, each player picks up their entire hand and play another set of turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends one of two ways: The first player to score 9 points immediately wins, or after 3 complete sets.  In the latter case, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#230;&#136;&#191;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;6&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#229;&#137;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#189;&#158;5&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&lsquo;Then from the little hills, the Desert Column called down joyful greetings to this splendid army. What boyish-faced, cheerful lads they are! And so on, right until after the sun dimmed down, tramp, tramp, tramp. It is late now, we feel that Constantinople is ours.&rdquo; &ndash;March 25, 1917 diary entry by Trooper Ion Idriess of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, ANZAC Division.&#10;&#10;Hell in the Holy Land: The First and Second Battles for Gaza is a wargame simulation of the first major offensives by Allied forces in in Palestine during World War. Following defeats along the Suez Canal the Ottoman government forcibly evacuated the civilians of Gaza and began fortifying the town and nearlby high ground. The Allied forces occupied the Sinai but could only slowly build up forces for a sustained offensive, and only after extensive work was completed on rail lines and water pipeline from Egypt. In the Spring of 1917 this work was completed and both sides prepared for a fight. In the meantime the Ottoman Empire had won significant victories over the Allies at the Gallipoli peninsula, and in Iraq where a British and Indian army were compelled to surrender after a grueling siege. The Allies brought to Gaza hundreds of artillery, the largest concentration of this weaponry outside of the Western Front, including gas chemical shells, as well as tanks. The Ottomans had also rushed reinforcements, including veterans who were at Gallipoli, German advisors, and aircraft.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

Different in tone to the co-operative Z War game, Agent Z is a 2 player &quot;versus&quot; game which pits two secret agents against each other in a variety of different scenarios. Of course it's all set to the backdrop of a world overrun with zombies and other infected, but now those zombies can be used against your enemy. Throw a pheromone grenade and see your opponent swarmed, grab a passing corpse and use it as an undead human shield or, using a director card, take direct control of a digger and give the opposition something serious to worry about.&#10;&#10;New Agent Z missions are to be released regularly online, using assets from all the future Z War One issues.

The game allows solitaire play.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 55 cards numbered 1-10, and the number on the card equals to the number of that card in the game. Of these 55 cards, the deck is shuffled and thirty-five cards are placed on the table. Players take turns playing cards from their hand to remove cards from the table.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the players make a tableau of 35 cards, in overlapping skewed rows. Some are face up, some are face-down. (Place five of them in the first row. Then place next five cards in the second row, covering half of the previous row, sliding half of the card length rightward. Continue placing until the seventh row is made. By doing so, only the bottom (seventh) row is fully visible, and most of the cards are partially hidden by two cards of the next row.)&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play a card from your hand to remove a fully visible card of the same value. Alternatively, you play two cards from your hand to remove a fully visible card whose value equals to the sum or difference of your two cards.&#10;&#10;After you remove a card from the table, new cards can be fully visible. If there is a pair of fully visible cards of the same value, they are removed immediately. Continue this chain reaction until no pair is made.&#10;&#10;When you can't remove any card by playing from your hand, you must spend a joker to remove any one card. All players lose the game if five jokers are spent and still you can't remove any card.&#10;&#10;All players win the game when all cards are removed from the table.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Rescue the people trapped in the kingdom! A co-operative card game using a total of 55 cards, from one &ldquo;1&rdquo; card to ten &ldquo;10&rdquo; cards.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn uses cards to make pairs with the cards in the center to remove them. The players are considered as the winners if all the cards in the center are removed. Although you may not talk about the numbers in your hand, you may form a strategy based on the number of cards of each type and aim for a win by communicating with your fellow players. It feels wonderful when you get a chain reaction!&#10;&#10;Aim for a high score by using techniques such as adding/subtracting the numbers of two cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;&#233;&#150;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;1&#227;&#129;&#140;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#239;&#189;&#158;10&#227;&#129;&#140;10&#230;&#158;&#154;&#232;&#168;&#136;55&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#233;&#142;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#136;&#189;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

You are now ready to begin play.&#10;&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;The active player takes the die passed to her, draws two dice and rolls them. On the first turn of the game, roll all three dice drawn in setup). She selects one die. Using the color to determine column and the number to determine row, she marks off the corresponding tile, and draws that tile on her mosaic. The other players do the same, selecting only from the two dice she did not select. Multiple players may select the same die from the remaining two. When you select a die pointing to a tile that is already marked out mark out a different tile in that column, and mark off and place a 1-stone tile from your reserve. After all players are done, the active player passes her die to the next player, and discards the other two dice. If the dice bag is empty. place all discarded dice back in the bag. Pass the bag to the next player, going clockwise, and continue playing. In Solo play, draw two dice per turn, do not keep any dice from turn to turn, and refill the bag when there is only one die left in the bag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once powerful relics are being drained of their magic, and strange solar flares are interfering with your spellcasting. Can you gather the paradox crystals before the continuum is beyond repair?&#10;&#10;The new cards are:&#10;&#10;Depleted Relics (4)&#226;&#128;&#139;: You may use the number and object on these relics to travel as normal, but they do not have an element. They also may not be used to form paradoxes.&#10;&#10;Solar Flares (2)&#226;&#128;&#139;: These cards may never enter your hand. This means you cannot travel to their location, nor can you form a paradox that would require you to pick up a Solar Flare, including a potential game winning paradox. They may be discarded when new cards come out of the deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;from the publisher&#10;&#10;In the Solo Flare single player version of the game you are still collecting Paradox Crystals in a manner similar to the base game.  Depending on the difficulty you choose, you will be aiming for 5-6 of  them. However, like all good games, there is a timer that creeps toward a loss condition in the form of a deck of cards. After all, without an opponent there are three cards (which would normally be the opponent&rsquo;s  hand) and the six new cards from the expansion that you mix together to  form a draw pile. If this pile is depleted, you immediately lose the  game. The unused staff card is set next to this deck with three crystals placed on it to serve as counters.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you remove a counter  from that staff card if you do not complete a Paradox. When the third  counter is removed, you draw the top card of the deck and replace any card in the Continuum with this card - but it must match at least one feature on the card. However, the card it replaces is removed from the  game. Which means you are reducing the number of possible Paradoxes you can form any time you remove a base game card.&#10;&#10;To further complicate matters, you  also draw a card off the top of this deck when you form a Paradox! Yes,  you read that right. When forming a Paradox you remove a card in your  hand from the game, draw the top card of the deck and place that into your hand, shuffle those three cards, and then place them into the  Continuum as the formation of your Paradox. The other way this deck can play cards is by skipping your entire turn. This allows you to draw the  top card of the deck and use it to replace a card in the Continuum, but it also does not remove a counter from the staff because you skipped your entire turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Everything is color-coded and just makes sense. Maps look like maps complete with mountains and valleys. Everyone has a set of Chess-Dice they use to gather resources and dominate the map. Combining polyhedral dice and Chess pieces is what really brings Jafabit to a new level.&#10;&#10;Jafabit is modular, with countless possible game maps to play on. A typical game lasts between a half an hour and a full hour, but can go a little longer. Jafabit is designed for ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;Jafabit is more than just a game it&rsquo;s a game system. There are numerous optional expansions already in the works. The first of these optional expansions is The Mists expansion and will be included in the initial release.&#10;&#10;Layering new rules and pieces on top of Jafabit can result in an infinite world of possibilities - entirely new games with a simple and fun interface to tie them all together! The base mechanics just meld so nicely and are completely open to expansion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Libertadores del Sur is a two-player military simulation wargame of the Southern Theater of the Latin American Wars for Independence. The Patriot player controls the Argentine Ruling Directory forces and various federated and allied forces, while the Royalist player controls Spanish Regular Army, trained Loyalist South American forces and militia units. Several other historical armed factions contend for each player's attention when formulating strategy, from a land grabbing Portuguese-Brazilian Imperialist army, to local guerrilla units, breakaway Federal Republics, and a native Incan Rebellion in the Andes Highlands. Each player will face similar daunting logistical and political challenges as they attempt to impose their military will on their opponents over a vast theater of operations spanning Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts Bolivia &amp; Brazil.&#10;&#10;Libertadores del Sur is an operational level simulation with a point to point card driven game system. Each turn represents one year's campaigning season. The players have a chance to raise and reorganize new forces prior to beginning operations, and reset their sides' morale, depending on how many provinces they control. During the Operations phase, players take turns playing cards causing historical events and/or activate forces to move and attack. Operations continue until the player's run out of cards, or run out of morale. When operations end, the players have a chance to consolidate political control over provinces where they drove out enemy forces, and combat units fall back to controlled areas. There are three scenarios allowing the players to start at different points of the campaign. The 1810 scenario starts with the first of the local juntas establishing themselves in response to Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. The 1814 scenario begins with Argentine General San Martin superseding Argentine General Belgrano, and the Patriots attempting to recover from various strategic set-backs. The 1817 scenario is a mini-game covering only the liberation of Chile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beat The Bookie is the highly entertaining, sociable and strategic board and card game depiction of a day at the races.&#10;&#10;Celebrating a race days three main characters; the Bookie, the Punter and the Horse Owner, players can purchase and sell horses, win prize money and gamble on the Bookie's odds on each of the eight races at the race meet.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to collect the highest value combination of trophies from the eight races. Trophies are awarded to the player who makes the most profit from each race, either through prizemoney, bet winnings, payouts from players' cards or through horse sales.&#10;&#10;There are three types of trophies on offer. Races 1-3 are known as Maiden Races, and are the least valuable. Trophies awarded for these races are bronze in colour and worth only 1 point each. &#10;Prize money for winning owners in the three maiden races are 1x the Profits (100k for a win, 75k for second place and 50k for third).&#10;&#10;Races 4-6 are known as Handicap races, and are more valuable. Trophies awarded for each of these three races are silver in colour and worth 2 points each. Winning horse owners get 2 x the profits if their horses finish top 3 (200k for a win, 150k for second and 100k for third).&#10;&#10;Finally, races 7 and 8 are known as the Feature Races and are the most valuable, worth three points. Prizemoney is tripled for these two races (300k for a win, 225k for second place and 150k for third). The trophies awarded for these two races are gold in colour.&#10;&#10;Beat The Bookie can be played with 2-8 players. At the beginning of a race meet, a player is nominated to act as the Bookie. The Bookie is a banker of sorts, and is responsible for auctioning the horses, collecting money, calling the horses, laying the horse cards on the track and settling any successful or unsuccessful bets. The Bookie also assigns the trophies are the end of each of the 8 races, but counting up the winnings of each player. The Bookie can also play as a player, but must keep their cash wallet and assets separate from that of the main 'bank'.&#10;&#10;Once a Bookie has been assigned, each player is provided with 300k of Beat The Bookie currency. This is to form each players 'cash wallet'. Player are also given six Bet Slip cards, which depict the names and pictures of each of the horses in the field. These cards are used to place the players' bets.&#10;&#10;The Bookie then conducts the pre-meet auction, and auctions off each of the six horses in the race, with a reserve price of 100k. Players may or may not bid on the horses, with the successful/highest bidder awarded an ownership card for the particular horse bought. The new owner must keep the ownership card until he/she elects to sell the horse to another player or back to the Bookie.&#10;&#10;Once the pre-meet auction has concluded, all players must draw a players card from the left hand panel of the game board. If a player owns a horse, they must draw an Owners Card, which features any fees due or payable to/from the Bookie for their horse. Even if a player owns multiple horses, they need only draw one Owners Card. If a player does not own any horses, they must draw a Punters Card, which offers a special or exotic for the upcoming race. Finally, the Bookie must draw a Bookies Card, which features the odds for the upcoming race. Players can then bet on the odds provided by the Bookies Card, by overturning their Bet Slip Card to reveal the name of the horse they intend to bet on, and placing their chosen bet amount on top of the Bet Slip Card.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are placed and accepted by the Bookie, the Bookie then shuffles the Horse Card deck. There are six cards for each of the six different horses. The Bookie then lays the cards out in order of the Horse, with each horse advancing once space down the game board each time it is drawn. The Bookie draws all the Horse Cards until there is a winner, a second place getter and a third place getter.&#10;&#10;At the conclusion of the race. The Bookie pays out the prize money to the winning owners. If a horse, that finishes first, second or third, is not owned, no prizemoney is awarded in respect of that horse. For races 1-3 (Maiden Races), the Bookie awards 1x the Profits. For races 4-6 (Handicap Races) the Bookie awards 2x the Profits and for races 7 and 8 (Feature Races), the Bookie awards 3 x the Profits.&#10;&#10;The Bookie must then payout any prizemoney owed under Punters Cards. Once done so, or if no prizemoney is awarded, the Punter must place his Punters Card back under the pile.&#10;&#10;Once prizemoney and punters payouts are awarded, the Bookie either pays out or collects on players' bets on the calculation provided for by the Bookies Card. If the Bookies Card showed odds of 4:1, and the player bet 10k, the Bookie must pay the player 40k. Unsuccesful bets are collected by the Bookie and placed back in the 'bank'.&#10;&#10;When all prize money and bet money is awarded, players must count their profits. A trophy (bronze for Maiden Races, silver for Handicap Races and gold for Feature Races) is provided to the player with the most profit from that race. The player keeps the trophy with their cash wallet for counting at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once trophies are awarded, all players draw their players cards again ahead of the next race.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players then count the value of their trophies. Bronze trophies are worth 1 point, Silvers are worth 2, and Golds are worth 3. A Player could win the game by not having won any feature races. Conversely, a player might head into race 7 not having won any races for the entire meet, and could win races 7 and 8 and win the game.&#10;&#10;Players can trade their horses with other players at the conclusion of any races for an agreed price. Horses are valuable as they provide an alternative revenue stream. Horses drawn frequently in races may be worth selling, as chance would mean it's unlikely to win again. Players who do not purchase horses at the initial pre-meet auction may wish to purchase horses ahead of the more valuable Feature Races.&#10;&#10;A player is eliminated if they are declared bankrupt and have no more money or horses to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

However, if a player holds the Great Old One and has already played the Cultist card in their play area, they win! Otherwise, the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;With the Horror cards and game mechanics, there are a lot of fun strategies to keep the fast-paced action going, but there still remains a luck element as well to help give less experienced players a fighting chance against players who are more familiar with game possibilities.&#10;&#10;The Deluxe version is basically a whole new game drawing inspiration from the original, but re-implementing the system with new cards, new card types, new turn style and play mechanics, and updated card looks and text.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Turmoil, the fifth expansion to Terraforming Mars, takes players back to Mars, and the struggle for control and progress of human society on a big and dangerous planet.&#10;&#10;The expansion includes new corporations, new projects, and a new type of cards &mdash; Global Events, from dust storms to riots to rising alloy demand &mdash; that give you something to plan for 3 generations in advance.&#10;&#10;At the heart of this is the political arena of the Terraforming Committee. A new action allows players to add delegates to different parties, the first delegate each generation being free, and additional ones costing 5 MC. Neutral delegates are added by the global events, representing the wishes and trends of society.&#10;When a player (even the neutral player) has more delegates in a party than any other player, that player takes over the party leader seat for that party, and when a party has more delegates than any other party, it becomes dominant. The dominant party will become ruling during the next generation, imposing its one-time bonus, its ongoing policy, and granting chairmanship for its party leader, awarding that player 1 terraform rating.&#10;&#10;Party:       Bonus:                     Policy:&#10;Kelvinist    1MC/heat production        10MC -&gt; 1 heat production + 1 energy production&#10;Scientist    1MC/science tag            10MC -&gt; draw 3 cards (once per player)&#10;Unity        1MC/planet tag             Titanium is worth +1MC&#10;Mars First   1MC/building tag           Placing a tile on Mars gives 1 steel&#10;Greens       1MC/biological tag         placing a greenery tile gives 4MC&#10;Reds         1TR for the lowest player  Increasing TR in the action phase costs +3MC&#10;&#10;The political arena also determines the players' influence, which can be used to moderate or enhance the effect of the current global event. Influence is gained from being the chairman of the Committee, being party leader in the dominant party, and for having a non-leader delegate in the dominant party.&#10;In order to pay for all these new bonuses, the Committee is revising the terraform rating, lowering it for all players by 1 step each generation.&#10;&#10;In Turmoil, players can try to force their own agenda, or push it in a more moderate, economic way. They can play to mitigate the global events with influence, or adjust their play to better take advantage of them. And they can anticipate the competing players' agendas and try to benefit from them, or counteract them.&#10;&#10;Turmoil is an expert expansion - be prepared to meet the full spectrum of human civilization in the era of terraforming Mars!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Table Fighter is a fast paced fighting card game for 2 or more players. It's easy to pick up and play, but has enough depth to keep even the most skilled players hooked. Table Fighter is inspired by traditional fighting games: you are rewarded for anticipating what your opponent will do and your skill completely replaces randomness. &#10;In Table Fighter, both players have a deck of six cards that they arrange before playing, and a super card which sits face up on the table. Because each player chooses the order of their deck, there is no randomness created in shuffling.&#10;&#10;Players can intentionally rearrange their decks using a &quot;betting&quot; mechanic to super-charge their moves and avoid their opponent memorizing their order, but the order of one's deck is always a direct result of their actions and combos.&#10;&#10;Players select actions in their hand and then simultaneously reveal them. The winning card is chosen through a rock-paper-scissors-like mechanic. Each player starts with 20 health, last player standing wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "John Theissen&rsquo;s streamlined approach to operational warfare in the nineteenth century in games such as Hood&rsquo;s Last Gamble and Campaign of Nations has won him a number of admirers. Now he turns his attention to the last war of the Roman Republic, to the marching of Legions and the sailing of fleets, to the rise of Augustus and the fall of Marc Antony and the savvy Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; each player must raise troops and build ships, using these military forces to enact their will and conduct campaigns against the enemy. Along the way, they will face the challenges inherent in ancient warfare: the difficulty of keeping troops supplied, perilous storms at sea, the spreading of plagues, and the opportunistic assaults of Rome&rsquo;s external enemies. As the war wears on, both sides will attempt to chip away at the other&rsquo;s prestige and standing. If your prestige falls low enough, your troops and provinces might defect, tipping the balance. And should it fall to zero, you lose this high stakes battle. The winner shall rule over an empire. The loser? Well, as Octavian said before Cleopatra&rsquo;s son was strangled, two Caesars are one too many.&#10;&#10;The spoils of victory and the consequences of defeat might not be quite as serious as all that when the troops are made of cardboard, but Antony and Cleopatra allows you to refight this epic contest for ultimate power in the relative safety of your home or gaming club.&#10;&#10;Though somewhat more granular and detailed than Mr. Theissen&rsquo;s other games for Hollandspiele, this remains a quick, compelling, and accessible exploration of this fascinating subject.&#10;&#10;",

Until they are sent to Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker, that is!&#10;&#10;Sea of War was created to give those that love tactical play a chance to get their friends involved without having to spend hours to learn.

Players take turns being judges; each judge draws a new style, and each player gets a new suggestion when they get their three slides. Whoever wins that round - it can be Judge's Choice, like Apples to Apples, or the point system suggested in the rules, or some other criteria - gains the style card from that round.  At the end of play - decided on by the players, how many rounds they go - the person with the most style cards wins.&#10;&#10;",
