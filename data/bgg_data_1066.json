Allright, allright, you win. We will tell you the story!&#10;&#10;In Portugal - similar to other countries - we have annual conventions to play boardgames with people from everywhere.&#10;We belong to the boardgamers group of Aveiro, a city that is known as Portugal's Venice :)&#10;This city is well known for it's river named &quot;Ria de Aveiro&quot;, an arm from the sea that passes through the city.&#10;That's the reason why this convention is named RiaCon and the card received the name by inheritance.&#10;&#10;As volunteers in RiaCon we had the crazy ideia of designing one card to Sagrada to mark the difference in this event.&#10;In this way, we could encourage the participants that didn't knew Sagrada to try it out and the ones that already knew the game to play it once again.&#10;&#10;Now we are sharing it with you and we hope that you enjoy playing with this expansion as much as we do!&#10;&#10;",

The game has 3 separate activities, a variant on the classic tile matching game, and a draw bag with tokens that ask for the players to discuss a part of their day, and a book that tells the story illustrated on the tiles.&#10;&#10;The book tells the story of a day in the life Max the Hedgehog. During the day he experiences &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;stormy&quot; events. The draw bag contains 3 tokens, a sun, a cloud, and a rainbow. They ask the participants to share part of their day that was sunny, stormy, or to share something they are looking forward to. The book and the tokens support the game in teaching about emotions but are not a part of the game.&#10;&#10;Twenty sunny and stormy scenes from the book are paired together to create 10 matching sets (for example having fun splashing in puddles and being cold and scared in the rain). The goal of the game is to find all the pairs. The rules state three variants of increasing challenge. Variant 1 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face up. Variant 2 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face down. In variant 3, Max's day is almost over and he is remembering the sunny and stormy parts of the day. He must find all pairs before it is night and time for bed. This variant adds 4 nighttime tiles to the cooperative matching game that when revealed require the players to add a puzzle piece to a night puzzle. To win the players must find all matches before the puzzle is completed (6 puzzle pieces). Night tiles are not removed from the board when revealed. There are 4 tiles and 6 puzzle pieces so if players remember where the tiles are they will win.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, terrain may be used as a feint to trick your opponents before you surprise them with an unexpected battle card.&#10;&#10;Weather cards are shuffled into the land deck at the start of the game. When a weather card is drawn, its effect continues until a new weather is drawn to replace it. Weather will affect the battles in unpredictable ways, forcing you to adapt your strategy to what the battlefield is giving you. Will you charge your troops through the snow to capture a valuable bridge? Will you send your troops to battle during a severe drought? It is up to you to decide if the risk is worth the reward.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Viva la Muerte!&rdquo;&mdash;Rallying cry of the Nationalist forces during much of the Spanish Civil War.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The boys were confident and kidding. But there was a solemn, deep undertone to all the kidding for we realized fully that many would not come out of it alive.&mdash;Reflection by Samuel Levinger, member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, about the eve of the Republican Brunete offensive.&#10;&#10;The first half of 1937 was an almost complete series of disasters for the Republican cause in the north and west of Spain. Only in the territories leading to Madrid and to the south were the Nationalists thwarted, but at an increasingly bloody cost. The Soviet Union sent massive amounts of weaponry and equipment, while volunteers poured in from throughout Europe, the US and Canada to support the Republican cause. The leadership of the Republican military decided to launch a counter-attack against the Nationalists that were deployed directly west of Madrid. The plan was to attack from the Republican held northern salient to take the crucial town of Brunete, and the main highway leading to Madrid to its south. Success here would compel the fascists to withdraw from the territory closest to the national capitol, and give the Republicans a badly needed victory. One of the largest battles of the war to-date was about to unfold.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

    "Description": "The Battle for Formosa was the final large-scale campaign associated with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95.  The island was ceded to Japan in April 1895 by the Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war but the island proclaimed its independence from China and formed a republic in May 1895 following Japan's victory.  The Japanese, therefore, mobilized their forces to gain control of their new territory.  Although ill-prepared for the Japanese onslaught, and the Chinese Empire unable or unwilling to offer any support, the island's garrison and inhabitants put up a bitter and protracted resistance, one that cost both sides dearly.&#10;&#10;In 1884 and 1885, France invaded Formosa in an attempt to wrest control of the island from the Chinese following their campaign in Indochina and the attack at Foochow that resulted in the destruction of the Fukien Fleet. Already over-stretched and with most of their warships badly in need of refit and repair, Admiral Courbet still went ahead with the invasion. The French landed at Keelung, but then became bogged down in trench warfare. The Chinese were able to send reinforcements and supplies to the Formosan garrison through the rather weak French blockade. Although stalemated on Formosa, the French were able to capture the Pescadore islands when they took control of the key island of Peng-hu. In January and February, both sides sent reinforcements, escalating the conflict that threatened possible intervention by other governments to end the French aggression. This scenario covers the last months of the conflict when it could have gone either way.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The shocking defeat of France in 1940 created a unique opportunity for Thailand to regain territory it had lost decades before. When Vichy France refused to give it back, fascist leader Plaek Phibunsongkhram launched a blitzkrieg attack in January 1941. The fighting stopped eighteen days later, and with Japanese mediation, Thailand won back her lost provinces.&#10;&#10;This obscure conflict is the subject of designer John Gorkowski&rsquo;s The Lost Provinces. This is a simple, small, and soloable game that can be played in an evening with new wargamers and grognards alike. It often utilizes traditional mechanisms but with twists and nuances that make them fresh again. For example, combat strengths are compared, to arrive at odds ratios, but those ratios are expressed via a die roll modifier rather than a column on a CRT, which results in greater uncertainty about how a given battle might turn out.&#10;&#10;The attacking Thai forces use army, artillery, and air power to bear in along three separate thrust lines. The French forces are more concentrated and have the advantage of defending along interior lines. They&rsquo;ll have to know when to retreat and when to make the Thai Player fight for every hex.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The play surface is suggested as 3' x 3', with at least some indication of terrain.  The game assumes figures will be used to denote participating units.  Ranges are given in inches and play assumes the use of a tape measure.  Resolution requires a D6 and a D8.  The game rules primarily deal with fire and movement (as you would expect).  The default starting situation finds two opposing teams (&quot;posse&quot;) of six fighters each.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds; during each round each participant takes a turn.  Turns are executed in specified order and effects take place immediately.  Units utilize a simple facing mechanic and gain benefits depending on type.  Some complicating rules (e.g., &quot;town folk&quot;) are optional.  The rules are presented as a single, color PDF document - included are the rules, optional rules, and twelve scenarios (eleven are standard westerns; one is a weird western (zombies).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Play as Biff the scared wrestler, Spiff the rubber sword-wielding teen, his mom Ivanna and her charms, Randi the out-of-work model, Yodel the chef, or many others.&#10;&#10;WAPLEworlds is similar to a dungeon crawler game in that players move their characters, members of the Waple Family, around an 8x8 tile, while encountering Bad Guys and exploring exotic locations such as Pepe's Motor Lodge and the Scam and Save Pawn Shop. Yes, it is comedy themed.&#10;&#10;The starter box includes eight playable Waple figures and their Hero Cards, 25 Bad Guy Cards and their standees, over 40 item cards, over 20 Something Happened cards, Mission cards, 12 location tiles a WAPLEworld &quot;newsletter&quot; with rules and pre-made scenarios, 10 dice and money, damage and level tokens.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, he moves his character and can perform an action: search, confront a Bad Guy, use a card, or enter a building. Confronting a Bad Guy can mean to either fight him, bribe him, or run away like a chicken.&#10;&#10;Confrontations with Bad Guys: Fighting, Bribing and Running Away, are all controlled by dice rolls based on the stats listed on both the Hero's and the Bad Guys cards.&#10;&#10;After that, if not in combat, the player will draw a Something Happened card and execute what it states. If the player enters a location he rolls a die to see if a Mission is currently available there. If it is then he may try to resolve it to save that area by placing the appropriate new tile and Bad Guys onto that tile with the Waple and any that join him.&#10;&#10;The third phase of a turn is for any Bad Guy that the player is controlling to either move peacefully or attack the player.&#10;&#10;A game can be played with a simple one tile and one mission limit to up to five tiles and over a dozen missions completed, based on the time limit the player wants.  Missions increase in difficulty by placing more Bullies (minions) along with the Big Shot (boss) on the Mission tiles.&#10;&#10;On the first tile everyone starts at level 0. After the tile's mission is cleared, all Waples level up and can enhance their skills in the way the player wants, increasing dice rolled for certain stats. Bad Guys level up and roll one more die per level as well. On the second tile the Waples search and complete two missions. The game progresses as such until the final Scenario Mission has been conquered.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However, one of the players is secretly possessed by the Prad&uuml;n demon: his goal is to score points without being caught while the other players must find out who is it.&#10;On her turn, a player can decide to attack one of the Demons and if she succeeds (having cards that grant a power greater than that of the Demon) she collects the Demon as a Victory Point (VP). During the fight, other players can help or interfere by playing additional cards. Alternatively, the player can draw additional cards to strenghten her hand.&#10;VP can be spent to attack another player, hoping to reveal its objective card: if it is the Prad&uuml;n, the player wins; if not, the game continues. However, if the Prad&uuml;n scores 2VP, the player controlling it wins the game.&#10;The game is very funny, with Demons like the &quot;Damned alarm clock&quot; (whose power is equal to the time of the day, in hours) or the &quot;Were-elevator&quot; which tries to crush and block you.&#10;Power-ups can be temporary or permanent and they include things like &quot;Bunny's kiss&quot;, the &quot;Garbage sack&quot; or the &quot;No-purpose knife&quot;...&#10;In the simplified version, character's special abilities are neglected and the family members simply race through the house fighting demons to be the first to beat the Prad&uuml;n; however, other players can also be attacked and slowed down.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Let Them Eat Shapes&quot; is a print and play, and entirely abstract, version of the game Let Them Eat Shrimp. The game board (which is printed on one sheet of paper) has hexagonal spaces, many of which contain shapes that are either hexagons or may be combined to make hexagons. You begin with 4 shapes in your supply and players take turns &quot;placing&quot; them onto the board (i.e., by filling in matching shapes on the board). If you fill in shapes on the board, you gain that shape and mark it as acquired in your supply. When there are no shapes to get from the board, the game ends and players tally their scores. The player with the most points win.&#10;&#10;Players familiar with Let Them Eat Shrimp will almost immediately understand the game.&#10;&#10;",

A player loses if all his characters die or another player completes his goal. Basically players move in turns, trying to take a profitable position and not to give another player to go to the key mission elements that he was unable to achieve his goal. By completing missions, a player acquires money, resources and new battle cards. A battle takes place if players are near, within one cell.&#10;A player can accumulate 30 cards in the deck, but he can use only 10 in a battle. A battle consists of 1 round. All battle cards have a description of the action. Players count the number of points (written on the cards) at the end of the round. Who have more points - the winner. But you need to take into account the ability of the cards, if any. Card abilities are diverse: plus to protect, to attack, and so on. The winner gets money or a new card. The loser loses the character who participated in the battle.&#10;Cards: &#10;Special cards has description of their action and no points. &#10;Special cards are very powerful. One card can cause damage to 3 cards or, for example, to revive your squad. &#10;Battle cards has description of their action and there are points on them. Battle cards places to battlefield board which divided in three rows (for each player).&#10;The characters are divided into 3 groups. Each group placed in a row.&#10;1st row - melee group.&#10;2nd row - middle range group.&#10;3rd row - long range group.&#10;Each row corresponds to the icon: melee, medium range, long range. A card can be placed to the correct type of row only.&#10;A melee character can only be placed in a melee row and attacks enemy's cards in a 1st row. Also melee group can add points for your group in another row.&#10;Middle range character can be placed in a middle range row only. Middle range group can attack enemy's cards in 1st and 2nd rows.&#10;Long range character can be placed in a long range row only and attacks enemy's cards in all three rows.

Two or more contiguous numbered tiles are called runs. Two or more numbered tiles must be touching, otherwise no points will be given. A player can have multiple runs.&#10;&#10;There are several different ways to attack opposing players or to protect a player's troops. The use of offensive or defensive tactics makes the game interesting, and is central to the game's strategy.&#10;&#10;The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins.

The game has two primary objectives.  Brawl and fight to the death or control areas for victory points.&#10;&#10;There are two primary game mechanisms in Dwarves with Swords.  The first is Group Building, where the player picks from four different dwarf classes and builds groups of nine to use in combat. Each of these different classes has things they are good at and things they are weak at, so it's important to build the groups based on the map objectives and personal play style.&#10;&#10;The second is the actual combat, which is determined by rolling dice according to both the actions that are chosen for the groups and the relevant stat value (Armor, Dexterity, Strength, Knowledge, and Wisdom). The comparison of the attacking roll and the defending roll is done in a way that is unique to Dwarves with Swords, and makes use of all of the different die sizes that we love.&#10;&#10;Another major component of the combat is Drunkenness. Every point of Drunkenness that the group has increases its combat stats while decreasing its Speed - but if the group reaches a Drunkenness level equal or greater than its Memory, the group Blacks Out and is removed from the board. All good dwarves know how to hold their booze, so being eliminated from the game this way is incredibly embarrassing!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're a fresh Commander-In-Chief spending your first day in The Oval Office. There are a million promises you need to keep that you made on the campaign trail, but there's one that echoes through those who've supported you: build the wall. The only problem is there are those who want to do it before you and take all your glory. But you can't let that happen, you're the greatest! Nobody is better than you.&#10; Executive Order is a game of quickness and trolling as you fight to complete your wall before your competitors. But will you go straight for the glory and complete your wall? Or will you instead make it as difficult as possible for your competitors to complete theirs?&#10;&#10;Use cards to create strategic moves and shuffle things around. Don&rsquo;t like your current hand? Play &ldquo;Alternative Facts&rdquo; and draw a new one. Somebody put down a Wall card before you? Play &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; to have it taken away.&#10;&#10;Ideal for 2-7  players 13 and over. Gameplay averages 30 minutes or more.&#10;&#10;In Executive Order, the goal for players is to be the first to have three active Wall cards in front of them on the table. Players take turns by playing a card from their hand, resolving its action, and then drawing back up to their hand size. Some cards that can be played include &quot;Wall&quot; cards, &quot;Budget Cuts&quot; (reduces a players hand size by one card), &quot;Congress&quot; (removes an active wall card from in front of a player), &quot;Deport&quot;  (cancels a players card and returns it to their hand), or &quot;Umm, No!&quot; (cancels a players turn). Players can even debate on the table by creating a stack of &quot;Deports&quot; and &quot;Ummm, Nos&quot; until someone claims victory!&#10;&#10;Players can also add  new rules by playing the &quot;Executive Order&quot; card. But be careful, a &quot;Court Ruling&quot; card can put your rule to a vote to see if it remains or a player can play &quot;AltTwit@ExeOrder&quot; to exempt themselves from the rule!&#10;&#10;",

The killer has less than five minutes to secretly signal their murder target without revealing themselves to the police. If the killer's murder attempt is successful, they will need to wait for at least 10 seconds before making another attempt. In the meantime, the killer is also trying to confuse the police into capturing the wrong player.&#10;&#10;Civilian roles make the game more complex and interesting. The Journalist, for example, is an innocent civilian with the ability to expose other player's characters.&#10;&#10;The game includes 30 characters with 10 unique roles. Each roles has a different agenda. Various characters can help the police or the killer or even themselves to win the game.&#10;&#10;This game is easy to play, and can be played anywhere--in a small circle of friends or with family or as a team-building exercise.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the fall of the greatest dwarven city, Arar, many years ago, almost all dwarves left the Valley of Three Passes. Now, Olaf's farm &mdash; the last one in the valley &mdash; has been struck by an earthquake. Dwarf Olaf sends for you, his grandchildren, to help him rebuild his farm and find his lost animals. He promises to reveal the biggest secret of the fallen city to the one who helps him the most.&#10;&#10;Farmer Olaf is the first &quot;no.table&quot; family tabletop game (or so the publisher seems to think), which means it can be played comfortably on a big or small table &mdash; or on no table at all. The unique box design allows discarding and storing cards while holding it in one hand or being attached to a belt. Other advantages include starting or stopping game in seconds, quick save/quick load game ability, burst card dealing, quick independent release, and rules storage that doubles as a displayable cheat sheet. The maximum number of players is determined by game boxes used (with  four additional players for each game box).&#10;&#10;In Farmer Olaf, players perform four farming activities to gather green cards with points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Farming activities include sowing and harvesting a field, milking a yak, making wool from alpaca, and making ham from a boar. Each player receives five cards at the start of the game and one card on each subsequent turn. Players try to collect appropriate cards for farming actions. For the most part, there is a shortage of buildings and animals needed for production. This means that in order to increase their chances of winning, a player needs to engage in trade with others. There are no limits of how to structure trades: from traditional 1-1 card exchange to more exotic deals like leasing or deferred payment. The game is carefully balanced as, for example, the best cards are steam machines that can be used only to sow and harvest a field. However, to do that one needs a fertilizer that can be obtained only by cleaning a boar pen or cowshed.&#10;&#10;Simple rules and design (no text and no numbers on cards) allow children aged 5+ to participate in the game when playing with adults. The most demanding part is being a game master and managing cards in the box, thus the overall 10+ age rating.&#10;&#10;",

But your fate is not entirely in your hands; progress will continually be shaped by Contingencies that reveal unexpected traits within yourself, deliver useful power-ups to accelerate research or introduce game-changing events - such as AI Attack - that can instantly change the balance of power.&#10;&#10;The path to AI supremacy is clear. Collect tech and victory tokens as you research technology pillars, or overtake them from opposing forces. Complete critical secret missions that strengthen your claim of AI control. Once the Grid is fully developed, the scientist with the most points has won, unlocking the infinite potential of AI for all of humanity.&#10;&#10;But be careful not to focus too much on the scientific rivalry.

When the time comes, put aside differences and work together to repel it&hellip; or risk giving this artificial force the power to escape into the world and confront mankind with an uncertain future.&#10;&#10;When you set out to master The Grid, you do so with numerous decks of exquisite cards and tokens that have been carefully crafted to immerse you in a futuristic frontier of self-aware intelligence.&#10;&#10;Fight to harness the phenomenal power of The Grid.

You will plow the ocean, exploring the islands and collecting gold coins. Of course, it will not do without battles with other captains! Despite the seeming simplicity, the game has many strategies and options for progress towards victory!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is collecting gold coins. To win, you need to collect more coins than other players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will travel between islands (you choose your way), fight with other players and, using dice, play different events (good or bad).&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:&#10;&#10;Players turn consists of three phases: moving, battle and event.&#10;&#10;- Moving:&#10;        Move your pawn to any neighboring island (including any starting position). You can move only vertically or horizontally (orthogonally). If another player is already on the island, go to the battle phase. If the coin is on the island, pick it up and put it in front of you, then go to the event phase. If the island has neither a coin nor another player - go to the event phase.&#10;&#10;- Battle:&#10;        If you moved to an island on which another player is already located, it means that you attacked him. Proceed to battle. Each player has three health markers that represent the state of your ship. The battle consists of a series of rounds - attacks. Both players roll one die each. The player, who has less value, gets damaged and turns over one of his health markers. If both players have the same values, the dice are thrown. Attack is repeated until one of the players turns his last, third, health marker - this player lost in this fight. After the end of the battle, the winner takes half of the coins from the loser (rounding up), and the loser returns to his starting position. Players reverse their health markers (repairs the ship). If the losing player does not have a single coin, the winner does not receive anything. This ends your turn.&#10;&#10;- Event:&#10;        The event is played if you moved to an island on which there is no other player. Throw three dice and play the event which corresponds to the rolled dice value. This ends your turn.&#10;&#10;",

The players agree on a famous real or fictional person who fits the &quot;patient profile&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players scan over the flower cards and turn over 1, 2, or 3 cards that their eyes land on first. Each player turns over his or her own cards. Read the separate cards and pick one that relates to the symptom or symptoms, explaining to the other players how this addresses the symptom. Each player in turn plays one flower card that best addresses the symptom or symptoms, explaining how this applies. Players scan over the remaining cards in front of them and pick those they wish to turn over. Repeat these steps until all the cards that each player wants to introduce have been played.&#10;&#10;Discuss which of the flower essence cards introduced into play by the players best fit the symptoms. Refer to the Flower Essence Repertory as needed. There may be more than one right answer. The goal is to agree on up to 5 essences for the perfect blend to fit the patient's symptoms.&#10;&#10;Items required&#10;&#10;&bull; One deck of Affirm a Flower affirmation cards (published by FES)&#10;&#10;&bull; One deck of Green Apple cards from the game Apples to Apples&reg;&#10;&#10;...&#10;&#10;Example of play:  If Marilyn Monroe is considered to be the &quot;patient&quot;, the following might happen when the flower cards are examined. The first player played &quot;Pretty Face&quot; which says &quot;I accept all parts of my self. Light shines through darkness and pain. My whole self is my beautiful self. I am this Shining Star.&quot; The second player played &quot;Dogwood&quot; which says &quot;My body is healed by flowing grace. I release what has become hardened. This gentle purity fills body and soul. I feel the blessing of grace-filled life.&quot; It was determined that either flower card would help address the life challenges of Marilyn Monroe, and both players were considered to have right answers.&#10;&#10;There are also solitaire and advanced versions of this game.&#10;&#10;",

Then taking an adjacent flower. Finally taking all isolated flowers from the board (soliflowers; those that don't have orthogonally adjancent flowers).&#10;&#10;Optionally, at the beginning of the turn, the players can execute special actions by 'purchasing' them with 3 flowers of the same colour. Each action can only be executed once during the game:&#10;&#10;- Randomly pick 3 flowers from the game case (don&rsquo;t look), if there are at least 3, and add them to your reserve1.&#10;&#10;- Jump orthogonally (not diagonally) over a peak to a space not occupied by a martian. If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!&#10;&#10;- Move diagonally to a space not occupied by a martian (you cannot jump over peaks). If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!&#10;&#10;- Pick any flower from the board and add it to your reserve.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of your martian and any one peak or planted flower.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of any one peak and any one planted flower.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of any 2 planted flowers.&#10;&#10;- Move any one planted flower to any empty space of the garden.&#10;&#10;- Move any peak to any empty space of the garden.&#10;&#10;- Pick the wildflower and add it to your reserve. Do not place a black counter on the circle; when this unique wildflower is gone, this special action is unavailable.&#10;&#10;GAME END AND SCORING&#10;&#10;If a player can't move her martian to a space occupied by a flower the game ends.&#10;&#10;To get your score, count the number of flowers of the colour you have the least (consider the 6 colours, even if you don&rsquo;t have flowers of some of them!). The wildflower acts as a wildcard; it can be used as any colour but you have to declare which one before scoring.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins. Ties are broken by the second colour you have the least and so on. If the tie persists play again.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

A third player describes this time, but can only use one word to do so - so make sure you're paying attention to everyone's description rounds throughout the game, as it may come in handy!&#10;&#10;If you are the one attempting victory and get more correct quickfire guesses than your defending opponent, you have successfully Cast your Quest, and won the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Can it be that you set up the tactic that leads to the goal? Are you ready?&#10;&#10;Regardless of the game variant, it&rsquo;s about being the first to defeat another army, so there are no more cards in front of an opponent. Always keep in mind that a wrong move may allow another player to win the game.&#10;&#10;On your turn: Pick up two cards from the middle of the pile (or your own - depending on the game variant). You can attack with the face-up cards you face. You can play some action cards in your hand at any time (during an attack or while another player's turn takes place), others only when it's your turn. Once you've completed your attacks, you can reveal up to two face-down cards (or just one or none at all) and put them forward and replace them with hand cards. A maximum of 3 cards may be revealed and two cards face down. Think good of your strategy, because if you make too many attacks, you may not be able to defend yourself.&#10;&#10;If an attack is made and it succeeds by higher value, both cards are placed on the open stack in the middle. If the attacker's army card value is lower than the defending card, the attack failed and the attack card is placed on the open stack in the middle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Although it&rsquo;s not necessary to play the missions in order, should players wish to do so, a short narrative campaign is included in the game.&#10;&#10;Gain weapons and armour from the chests scattered about the rooms on-board in your attempt to defeat the forces of space pirates that are attacking your ship.  Missions have different objectives ranging from simply surviving a massive rush of pirates or escorting a VIP, to securing and defending vital parts of your ship.&#10;&#10;Do you take on the role of a marine and attack the enemy head on or the role of medic or engineer and assist your fellow players in staying alive as wave after wave of blood thirsty pirates swarm the ship.  Maybe you are the voice of command and as captain organise the others to follow you.  Perhaps you want nothing more than 2 really big guns and a singular purpose and take the role of the robot.  Maybe you are stealthy and tactical and can take on the pirates with nothing more than a chefs cleaver?&#10;&#10;Each crew character starts with 3 action points which they can then spend freely on either moving, combat (melee or ranged) or on a special action, though only one special action maybe completed per person per turn.  Special actions include healing, repairing doors, searching chests and trading etc.&#10;&#10;Characters gain further actions and special abilities as the &quot;Alert Level&quot; on-board ship increases.  While players start with a modicum of gear as play progresses they may pick up and trade items to suit either their own play style or that of the persona of the crew member they are playing.&#10;&#10;Want to design your own campaign where you keep the items on your character and progress through your own customer scenarios?  This is entirely possible with Repel Boarders modular double sided game tiles, corridor tiles and board connectors.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player then draws 3 cards from his deck and places his remaining cards aside. The person to win the first turn of the first round chooses an opponent from among the remaining players. To attack, he lays down one of his three chosen cards. The chosen opponent also lays down one of his three chosen cards.(Right before each player lays down his attacking card,it is best to snap the attacking card out of one&rsquo;s own hand in a showy and extravagant manner. This is done to intimidate the other player. It is also quite enjoyable.)To determine the winner of the attack, each player must roll a die, combine that number with the value of his card, and whomever has the highest overall score wins the battle. Each number card is worth its face value (the Ace is worth 1 point, the 2 is worth 2 points, etc,), and each face card is worth 10 points. However, when attacking with a Jack, the Jack gains one offensive point becoming worth 11 points, and when defending with a Queen, the Queen gains 1 defensive point becoming worth 11 points. If a tie takes place, the defender wins the round. Play continues in clock-wise fashion with each player attacking only once each round. If a player has no cards when it is his turn to attack, then he is out for the remainder of the round.&#10;&#10;Each successive round is begun by the person clock-wise from the person to attack first in the previous round.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is determined by the player with the last King left alive. If a player loses a King during game play, he may continue playing but cannot win the game.&#10;&#10;Suit powers&#10;&#10;Hearts: Healers. At the end of each turn roll 1 die for any one card that fought during that turn. If the roll is odd, healing failed and proceed to next card or end turn. If even, roll die and regain health up to number rolled or max health (whichever comes first)&#10;&#10;Spades: Necromancers. At the end of each turn, if any cards 1-6 &ldquo;died&quot; during that turn or in a previous turn they are eligible to be revived. Roll a die and revive any eligible card covered by the die. Example: If a 1 is rolled then an the ace (if eligible) can be revived. If a 5 is rolled, any card 1-5 that is eligible can be revived.&#10;&#10;Diamonds: +Defense every card. +1 health and 50/50 chance to &ldquo;block&rdquo; an attack by rolling die when attacked. If even, a &quot;block&quot; happens and negates an additional damage point.&#10;&#10;Clubs: +Offense every card. +1 to attack roll and 50/50 chance to do &ldquo;double damage&rdquo; on an attack by rolling die when attacking. If even, a &quot;double damage&quot; happens and adds an additional damage point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

By using city part cards in a tile-placement mechanic, they will have to build the project always paying attention to the Contest Requirements, sorted at the beginning of the match.&#10;&#10;There are 3 game modes: Populist (using sorted Contest Requirements, one of each of the types A, B, and C), Military (using all of the D Contest Requirements), or Elite (using both previous requirements). These requirement cards are the ones that tell the player how they are going to score in that match.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the game mode, the game flow is always the same: players have 1 phase to buy cards using inspiration points (always 5 at the beginning of the phase), and 1 phase to place them in their projects (put them on the table). This continues until someone projects the 10th city part card, triggering the end of the game, when players check the Contest Requirements to see which cards have scored, and how many set-collection points they have won.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

To defeat the security, you form a group of five criminals. There are six types of security, and each criminal has an advantage at one of them and a disadvantage at another one.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, place 12 security chips, forming three groups of four chips  (A, B, and C). Chips in group A are revealed, meaning they are not guarding the treasure. Chips in Group C are never revealed until end of the game, meaning they are guarding the treasure. Chips in group B are partial information; a player can see two of them during the game. Then players are dealt nine criminal cards each.&#10;&#10;During a round, the first player takes a chip. The first two players may look at it, and discards one card from their hand. The other players may not look at that chip but guess it from the discards, and discard one from their hand. Instead of discarding one, you may discard two and take the card the previous player discarded. Play four rounds so that everyone has five criminal cards.&#10;&#10;At end of the game, reveal one security chip from group C, each player passes the security if they play one criminal who is advantageous to that security, or any two criminals who are not disadvantageous to it (other conditions apply).

Bacon is a wild in the game, representing any of the five basic food groups as the player chooses. Each player rolls the food die during their turn to see what they crave during the round, then either acquire a matching meal card in play from the meal card pyramid of five community meal cards, or veto a specific meal card and discard that card into the dumpster (the bottom of the game box), then draw a wallet card. Wallet cards can be used during the game to purchase a corresponding meal card, better their turn, or impact another player's turn.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get the most meal points as others decide to go along with your food choice.

The artwork on the cards is taken from classic Japanese painting. Animals are shown as if human, and they play out folklore tales, frogs, rabbits, birds, and foxes. This gives the game a light, surreal feeling.&#10;&#10;In this game, all players try to make a manga. Players start with a certain number of cards in hand. These cards act as a single frame with an empty dialogue balloon. In clockwise order, the active player plays a card and all players discuss about what quote should be included in the dialogue balloon. A new card played acts as a continuing frame from the previous cards so all players will attempt to make a totally original manga with an original story.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#232;&#171;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#231;&#182;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Roll the dice and then press on the chicken&rsquo;s chest the number of times shown on the dice-then you&rsquo;ll hear a funny 'squawk!' If you&rsquo;re lucky, the chicken will lay an egg that you get to crack open. Does the token land egg side up or chicken side up? Hope for chicken side up because then you get to keep the token! The player who collects the most chick tokens is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
