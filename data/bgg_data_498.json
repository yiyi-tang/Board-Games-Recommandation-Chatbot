Beware, or pirates will steel your gold coins, even before you have made your first move towards finding the treasure of Lame Max, the notorious pirate king of ancient times. The treasure of Lame Max was not lost when his ship was sunk. Scattered across the playing field are old coins, which you should try to gather and keep safe from competing pirates! It is your goal to retrieve most of Max&rsquo;s treasure and become the next Pirate king.&#10;&#10;The pirate game is intended to stimulate counting, comparing and playing together for children at a young age. The different game variants are constructed in such a way that the game follows the development stages of the children in the period between ages 3 and 9, for children interested in board games a crucial time. Whereas the younger players depend on a simple game structure and a relatively short playing time, they gradually develop towards a stage where they will want to have control over the game development, their progress as well as that of their opponents. In fact they desire that their own strategic insight can make the difference between winning or losing. In the most elaborate game variant the Pirate game is a challenge even for grown ups!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Canadian-made horse racing game, endorsed by champion jockey Sandy Hawley.&#10;&#10;Game summary;&#10;The players each start the game with the same amount of game money with which they buy horses and bet on them in 6 races.  The horse cards are dealt to the players and each player decides to buy one or more of those dealt. Horses not purchased are returned to the bank and are offered again after the first race.  The odds paid to the winning bet are determined by dealing the &quot;odds&quot; cards to the players' horses.  Each player may bet up to $1000 to win on horses that the player owns.  A race consists of 4 or 5 quarters.  There are 5 identical decks of &quot;race cards&quot; that have on their face one of the ten available horses.  For each of the quarters a &quot;Race Card&quot; deck is shuffled and then laid out in a row on the game board, the horse pictured on the last card is in the lead of that quarter.  The leading horse earns a bonus for the player.  The horse pictured on the last card of the last deck is the race winner.  The winning horse earns the bet times the odds for the player.  After 6 races, the horses are sold back to the bank for the original purchase price and the richest player is the game winner.&#10;&#10;From the game box:&#10;&quot;The high stakes horse racing game.

    "Description": "This &quot;variant&quot; of Xiangqi is played on a 19 X 19 grid (Go board). Seven armies represent the seven warring states of the late Zhou Dynasty (1045 - 221 BC):&#10;Qin (white), Chu (red), Qi (indigo), Yan (black), Han (orange), Wei (green), Zhao (purple).&#10;&#10;Each army is played by one player. For less than 7 players, there are several predetermined &quot;allies&quot;, so one or more players direct two armies.&#10;&#10;Every army has 17 pieces, which makes a total of 120, regarding the central single piece, representing the kingdom of Zhou. This piece does not move at all and cannot be captured.&#10;&#10;Each of the armies consist of the following pieces:&#10;1 General - moving like the Queen in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Deputy General - moving like the Rook in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Officer - moving like the Bishop in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Diplomat - moving like the Queen, too, but cannot capture or be captured.&#10;1 Cannon - like the Cannon in XiangQi (moving like the Rook, but capturing over one intervening piece).&#10;1 (Unit of) Archers - moving like the Queen, but only for 4 spaces.&#10;1 (Unit of) Crossbowmen - moving like the Queen, but only for 5 spaces&#10;2 (Units of) Swordsmen - moving 1 space diagonally.&#10;4 (Units of) Broadswordsmen - moving 1 space vertically or horizontally.&#10;4 (Units of) Cavalry - moving 4 spaces: 1 in a straight line and then 3 diagonally.&#10;&#10;There are several rules regulating possible allies and winning conditions over single states. Residual pieces of beaten armies are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Simplified, it can be said, that to gain a victory over another state, a player has to capture the general or more than 10 pieces of this state. The player with the most captured pieces at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;There are similarities both to Go (the central piece as the centre of the universe/representing the Zhou Dynasty, or the removing of &quot;dead&quot; armies) and Xiangqi  (the pieces, the armies ...); this and the 7 players make this game unique in the history of strategic boardgames.&#10;&#10;",

The value is recorded as part of the score.  Any plane that comes to a &quot;Change Altitude&quot; space spins the spinner for a new altitude.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all bombers have been shot down or have reached the finish line.

While some things are in the game for realism, others are in it just for fun. One goal was realistic movement of some sort.

The top layer has a race course with hole on each square surrounded by a plastic rim to hold upright the narrow player pawns. The bottom layer is on black card with various holes and sits inside the box. When the upper board is placed on top most squares on the race track have a solid footing for the pawns, but some have holes that allow the pawns to fall through into the box and out of the game. The boards are square so that they can be rotated in relation to each other to provide variable distribution of the holes.&#10;&#10;Each player takes 5 pawns. The winner is the first person to get a pawn to the end of the track. Players roll the dice and move one of their pawns the distance indicated. If they have multiple pawns on the track they can chose which one to move. When a hole is discovered by a player losing their piece to it all players need to remember where it is so that they don't repeat the mistake.&#10;&#10;",

Elite characters get a second card but receive fewer actions when it comes up.&#10;&#10;Task rolls are done with a single six-sided die and generally scale by distance.  Better trained characters receive a larger bonus to their tests.&#10;&#10;Damage is an opposed roll (damage versus strength) and can inflict death or one of several wound states.  Wounds reduce movement and penalize a character on skill tests.&#10;&#10;The morale rules are tucked away in the back of the rules, but boil down to checking morale for certain casualty-based triggers.&#10;&#10;The rulebook does not provide a points or scenario system, though there is a system for generating squads.  Wargames Journal has published at least one scenario for the game as a free PDF download.&#10;&#10;",

Even if the player does not know the definition of the word, he must bluff one that will be the most believable.  All sheets are then turned over to the dictionary holder so that he can number them and mix them up. Then he will read each definition out loud. He is allowed to repeat them up to 3 times.  Then everyone votes for the definition they think is the right one!  Points are given for getting the right spelling of the word, and for every vote each player got etc. The first player to reach 40 points  is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",
