And how much?&#10;&#10;During the game, each player flirts with all several other players. All the actions &ndash; such as flirting, sending text messages or giving your heart away &ndash; bring in flirting points. Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).&#10;&#10;If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him. If no more cards remain in the draw pile, the player can either give one of his cards away or ask to receive a card from another player (who then has to give one of his cards to the asker).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pair of characters have married. Now, each player scores points as follows:&#10;&#10;    For the highest relationship status achieved (with any one other character): 4 points for being in love, 8 points for being engaged and 12 points for having married.&#10;    -1 point for each of your own hearts, +2 points for each heart from another player.&#10;    -1 point for each negative text message, +2 points for each positive text message.&#10;    +1 point for each remaining relationship token.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What is the fastest series-produced car in the world? When was the first crash test dummy built? And what is the Michelin Man's real name? Welt des Automobils (World of Cars) is a quiz game with 600 questions about car models, car manufacturers, advertising slogans and technology.&#10;&#10;In each round, one player reads the question on a card, followed by the five possible answers. Unlike most other trivia games, the number of correct answers to the question ranges from one to five, but players don't know how many answers are correct. After reading through the answers once, the player reads them again one by one. Players secretly decide whether they think an answer is correct, hiding one of their answer tokens in hand if they think it is. Players reveal their guesses simultaneously, then place their tokens on the numbered answer card.&#10;&#10;After players have guessed on all five answers, the correct answers are revealed, and the players may move forward on the scoring track:&#10;&#10;     If a player has placed one or more tokens on incorrect answers, he does not move on the scoring track.&#10;     If a player has placed tokens only on correct answers, he moves forward a number of spaces equal to the number of (correct) answers he selected.&#10;&#10;&#10;After an agreed-upon number of questions, the game ends, and the player who is furthest on the scoring track wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yodd is a drawless connection and territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board). The suggested board size is between 6 and 10 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient supply of black and white stones.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, pass or place one or two stones of any colors on empty cells. On their first turn, Black can only place one stone. At the end of your turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board. A group is an entire set of interconnected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.&#10;&#10;When both players pass in succession, the game ends, and the player with fewer groups on the board wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesDouble placement serves as both a first-move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.&#10;&#10;Apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has some tactical implications that lend the game a loose single-placement feel. For example, groups separated by two empty cells cannot be merged on a single turn, as the player would need another placement to restore the group count to an odd number. Also, the diamond connection (two stones at each end of a four-cell rhombus) is safe if the opponent has exactly zero or two groups adjacent to the intermediate cells, and unsafe otherwise.&#10;&#10;Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you will often want to merge two of your own groups or create another enemy group, but you will be unable to do so because you can no longer restore the group count to an odd number.&#10;&#10;",

The juxtaposition of incongruous concepts, the odd but perfectly understandable expressions for familiar concepts that often result on at least one side of the anagram, and the deadpan stock photography illustrations are all played for absurd humour.&#10;&#10;This sort of memory based on playing with words is more difficult than the usual one.

Confined to a predesignated area of play, the Runners earn more money for every second that they avoid the Hunters until the game time expires.  Should a Runner choose to surrender before time is up, they can use a pay phone to exit the game and they will receive money equal to the time until they quit.  However, if a Runner is tagged by a Hunter not only are they eliminated from the competition but they also receive ZERO cash.  To make matters more interesting, the Runners are given missions via their cell phones.  Successfully completing a mission may give the Runners more cash or it may prevent more Hunters from entering play.  From start to finish, Tousouchuu is a game of risk vs reward.&#10;&#10;In Tousouchuu THE Board Game, 2-5 players assume the role of Runners as they try to earn the most money possible without being caught by a Hunter.  As Missions come up, the Runners have to decide whether or not they will risk participation or if they'd rather hide to avoid being discovered and eliminated.  But unlike the TV show, Missions have an added bonus: Runners who successfully complete a Mission earn powerful Items that will help them avoid capture by the Hunters.&#10;&#10;As the time ticks away and the money adds up, the Hunters continue their patrol.  Once a Runner is spotted by a Hunter, the chase is on!  Escaping the inhumanly fast Hunters will require both luck and endurance.  Run out of either and you will be caught and sent off to Detention.  But even while eliminated, you may find that sometimes even the Hunters are in need of Informants...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the winner is the Runner with the most earned cash. Will you last until the time line hits zero?  Will you Surrender and walk away with only a portion of the cash?  Or will you get caught by the Hunters and receive absolutely nothing?&#10;&#10;Tousouchuu THE Board Game features a double-sided game board and time-line for either a Short Game (for beginners) or Exciting Game (for those wanting a challenge).&#10;&#10;",

He will then roll a die, which determines whether he should answer the blue, yellow or red question on the card. The colour also determines how much time the player gets to answer the question: 60 seconds for a blue question, 45 seconds for a yellow question and 30 seconds for a red question.&#10;&#10;A player doesn't need to answer the question alone, though. He can offer other players points for their assistance. If a correct answer is given within the time, the player and his helpers score points.

Beneath the golden lion on a crimson field as red as spilt blood ruthless lords, devious ladies, cunning knights, and vast armies are forming to proclaim to Westeros the words of House Lannister: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;&#10;&#10;Lions of the Rock is the sixth Deluxe Expansion for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, featuring 165 cards new to the LCG card pool &ndash; three copies each of 55 unique cards &ndash; that add deck-building opportunities and strategic depth to your game.&#10;&#10;The cards included in Lions of the Rock deepen the existing strengths of House Lannister, as well as adding some new avenues of strategy to explore. Forming the core of Lions of the Rock are the formidable members of the Lannister family: the ruthless patriarch Tywin, the treacherous queen Cersei, the Kingslayer Jaime, and the beguiling Tyrion. Each wields power as naturally as dragons breathe fire, backed by the limitless wealth of Casterly Rock and the unbreakable will of House Lannister's honor and willingness to repay any debt in blood. As anyone in Westeros will tell you &ndash; a Lannister always pays his debts...&#10;&#10;In-game, each Lannister represents a different approach to victory, around which entire decks could be built, from Tyrion's synergy with the Clansman trait, to Tywin's breathtaking seizure of power based on having lots of gold in play during Dominance, to Cersei's ability to claim power whenever you win intrigue challenges (playing very well into the new The Power Behind the Throne agenda). Working separately, the Lannisters are merely powerful. Working together, the might of the Lannisters can become unstoppable.&#10;&#10;",

Each of these elements are worth a certain number of victory points. Knights can be sent on quests to find treasure and more vassals for the King, (i.e. drawing more cards).  Opposing players can attempt to disrupt plans by sending rogues to steal from the treasury or kidnap ladies, knights, barons or baronesses.&#10;&#10;The round ends when a player with a complete court and castle discards their last card.  Scores are totaled based on the victory points of the cards in play.&#10;The goal is to have the most total victory points at the end of four rounds of play.&#10;&#10;",

The Grand battle sees you choosing were each drawn tile goes in an 8x6 spread.Each tile has a representative number that when rolled with a town built upon it, generates a resource. These resources can be used to build armies or towns.&#10;&#10;Combat is undertaken by your armies that can stack up to a total of 3 armies per tile. Armies have different properties and abilities based on their stack size, Smaller armies can raze towns and move quickly, bigger armies can control occupied towns but move slowly. &#10;Combat is resolved using standard D6's. Each Army receives 1D6 when attacking or defending and receives a success on a 5+. results are compared and if the attacker has a larger number of successes they destroy one of the defenders armies.&#10;&#10;Towns, Mountains, and Mountain passes can generate defensive bonuses for your armies and Towns built upon Mountain Passes act as fortresses. creating an interesting tactical imperative for the placement and disposition of your towns.&#10;&#10;-Items you'll need-&#10;1 Yellow City State- Triangle Stand&#10;1 Green City State- Triangle Stand&#10;10 Yellow Towns- Houses&#10;10 Green Towns- Houses&#10;10 Yellow Armies- Stackable Pawns&#10;10 Green Armies- Stackable Pawns&#10;6 6 sided dice (6D6)&#10;(or some other equivalent, coins were used in early iterations)&#10;&#10;-Items included in the PDF's-&#10;24 Barley Resource Cards&#10;24 Ore Resource Cards&#10;48 Tiles&#10;&#10;Available on DrivethruRPG.com and BGG.&#10;&#10;CopyRight DigiPen IoT&#10;&#10;Created by Keith Leiker&#10;Leiker Games&#10;Give us a &quot;Leik&quot; on Facebook!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flipp! is a game where you came up with words that are difficult for the opposing team to explain.&#10;&#10;Players are divided in two teams. Then dice are rolled to determine which letters teams have to use in their words. Then hourglasses are turned and teams formulate words based on the letters given earlier. The opposing teams has exactly the same amount of time to figure out the words that your team spent formulating them.&#10;&#10;A team gets a point for every word they guess. For every word that is not guessed the opposing team gets two points. Both teams have a pawn that is moved forwards on a game board when they score points. The first team to make it to the finish is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Nordic version has seven dice of which four are language dependant.&#10;&#10;This game is actually an early version of Tic Talk and Wordy Word; in later versions the dice have become d12's, otherwise it's pretty much the same game.&#10;&#10;",

Reds uses some interesting mechanics, including an anti-trump suit which will almost always lose a trick, bidding which encourages risk-taking and rewards skill, and variable exchange of cards which leads the game through several different stages of luck and strategy.&#10;&#10;Called &quot;Reds&quot; due to diamonds being trump, this is an interesting use of a three-suited deck.&#10;&#10;Each round is 5 tricks, and each game is 9 rounds.  The deal is a straight rotation, moving clockwise every round.  Each round, players bid before a pre-determined amount of cards in their hand are passed to another player.  This allows for interesting strategy and even an element of bluffing.  As the game wraps up, fewer and fewer cards are passed, lending the game a transition from heavily luck-based to heavily skill-based.&#10;&#10;Playable with a standard deck (hearts removed), a pad, and a pencil.&#10;&#10;",

(Three or four figures per player is best.) To start the game, each player places a small object on their side of the table and nominates it as their base. Next all of the Smurf figures are placed in contact with their designated base. The object of the game is to be the first to tag your opponent's base. Each turn, a player may move his entire team of Smurfs. To do so, he may move the length of one standard playing card (such as the the enclosed rule card) an any direction indicated by the arrows on the smurf figure's base. If at anytime you can move one of your Smurfs into base contact with an opponent's Smurf, you may immediately move EVERY Smurf on the opponent's team (including the one you tagged) the distance of two short sides of the card, again in any direction indicated on the Smurfs base. The first one to tag the opposing base, wins!&#10;&#10;",

The next player must follow suit if he has an Oliver Twist character in his hand. The next does likewise and if a trick is completed, the player completing takes the cards and they will form one trick. If a player wins 3 tricks before the cards are exhausted, he wins the game.&#10;The date is a guess but it must be in the late 1850's because three books are not mentioned, including Great Expectations, which were not published until after that time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "VECTOR CHESS is a war game that was developed from a combination of the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo;, which is a quantity used to represent magnitude and direction, and &ldquo;chess&rdquo;, one of the world&rsquo;s oldest war games. Each piece in this game has a rank that determines the distance it may move, and a directional characteristic which indicates the direction that it may be moved. In this way, each piece represents a vector, having characteristics of both magnitude and direction.&#10;&#10;PLAYING SURFACE: Vector Chess is played on a square playing area divided into either 49 or 64 smaller squares of equal size. The squares may be alternately light and dark colored, but it is not necessary. A game played on the board having 49 squares will usually make for a shorter game when compared to a game on the 64 square board.&#10;&#10;THE PIECES: Depending upon the type of board used, enough pieces must be used to fill the first two rows of squares on each side of the board, with each piece set facing the opposite side of the board. Only two types of pieces are used in this game: the MAJOR pieces, and the MINOR pieces. The major pieces, which are line up along the first row of the board, have the highest rank and may be moved from one to four spaces along a straight line in the direction that they are pointing. The minor pieces are lined up on the second row of the board, and are identical to the major pieces except that they are shorter and may be moved only one or two spaces in the direction that they are pointing. Each piece in this game maneuvers like a soldier on a battlefield &ndash; it may turn and move to a new position, provided no other piece blocks its path, and it may attack any enemy piece that is directly in its path and within range. The range of movement is the number of spaces that the piece move can move as was previously described.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME: The object of the game is to &ldquo;check mate&rdquo; the opposing player by maneuvering pieces into his first row squares until the defending pieces in that row are outnumbered. If the first row squares are empty, only one attacking pieces is required to put the opposing player &ldquo;in check&rdquo;. The defending player must break the check during his next turn as described below, or he will be considered &ldquo;check mated&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS: This game includes 32 round wooden playing pieces in 2 colors that are similar looking to a rook in chess but have a directional arrow in the top. For each player there are 8 'tall' pieces and 8 'short' pieces that otherwise look identical. The board included has a 7x7 grid on a rolled up vinyl board (although the game can also be played on an 8x8 grid - presumably a standard chess board would be suitable)&#10;&#10;",

It was published about 1992-1994 as a Volksbank promotional giveaway.&#10;&#10;In Zahlenspiel players try to build ascending rows of 6 cards.&#10;The 32 cads are numbered from 1 to 32. The deck is shuffled and than each player is dealt 6 cards face down. Each player places his cards in front of him in a row with the face down. The rest of the cards go in the center to draw from. The starting player reveals the first card of the stack and chooses a card in front of him that he replaces with the drawn card face up. He than reveals the replaced card and gives it to his left neighbor. That player again chooses one of his cards to be replaced by the given card. &#10;The first player to form a row of six ascending numbers wins the game.&#10;&#10;Flaggenspiel is a regular game of Memory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game covers almost every aspect of a cycling race. It features rules for ascension, sprint, time trial (even a different rule for mountain time trial), and provides mechanism to run a single race.&#10;&#10;The board is customisable with the provided little arrows.  It is just a plain 100-field board.Before the race you must decide how long will it be (recommended: 150 to 250 squares long for a one-day race, that is one and a half to two and a half laps) and where you place the different mountains and sprints.&#10;&#10;What is puzzling is that you have to remember (and possibly write down) in which lap are placed the mountains. In effect, it is recommended to have three climbs during the race, and each climb takes place in a different lap. The same applies to special sprints. So you end up with a board with too many arrow pointing at mountains and sprints that might or might not be there.&#10;We have six national teams  of 5 riders each, and every rider has different abilities which affect the probability of having a good throw on a given type of road. As you can see in the team cards, riders have values for flat road (LL = &quot;llano&quot;), mountain (M), sprint (S), time trial (CR = &quot;contra reloj&quot;) and mountain time trial (CRM).&#10;&#10;On an even closer look, you will guess that good values is the lower one (9) for flat roads (LL) and the higher for mountains sprints and time trials. This is because in flat road riders throw two dice and they have an extra throw if they match their number on the team card (and of course, it is more probable to throw 9 than 12 with two dice, though when you get an extra throw after a double sic, you really advance a lot)&#10;&#10;The mountain rule is quite strange. You still throw two dice, but you only advance the value of the blue one. The red dice is just added to the blue to see if you match the number on the card and you have an extra throw.&#10;&#10;Similar rules apply to sprint and time trial. Just roll and move. No decisions to be taken. The only strategic issue in the game is the demarrage card. One is given to each player, to be used only once during the race, and giving you an extra throw for one rider. &#10;The game is intended to run a full season, so we have special maillots (yellow, green and rainbow jerseis) medals and a trophy, and rules to decide how many points is worth a given race. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Here the cold sea is studded with floating mountains of ice, turning the waters into a frothing tempest that can crush the hulls of the strongest ships and freeze the bodies of the unfortunate sailors who dared to sail there. The land beyond the frozen sea is Ultima Thule.'&#10;&#10;Wargods of Hyberborea is a tabletop miniatures game using metal miniatures that is closely related to Wargods of Aegyptus and Wargods of Olympus. Unlike many other tabletop miniatures wargames, the Wargods system uses hidden activation counters in order to simulate fog of war.&#10;&#10;In this reincarnation, players simulate massive battles in the land of Ultima Thule by taking control of a race of fierce creatures called the Wendigo, who are led to battle by formidable Ice Witches, masters of snow and wind. Although one off clashes occur frequently between warring factions, Wargods of Hyberborea offers dedicated warmongers an immersive game play experience through campaign play. In campaigns, players play through scenarios, progressing to differing scenarios and acquiring new special powers for their Wargod depending on who the victor is.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Numenko board game resembles Scrabble in that players have wooden tiles and lay valid combinations of tiles in horizontal and vertical rows, sometimes reusing tiles on the board in their current plays.&#10;&#10;What differs is that the tiles in Numenko feature digits (0-9), a Multichoice symbol (that stands for the player's choice of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or &quot;is equal to&quot;), and a Freechoice symbol (that can be a digit or Multichoice).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with eight tiles on his rack. On a turn, a player plays one or more tiles to the game board (possibly using tiles already in play) to create a valid equation, with the operators being resolved left to right or top to bottom, except for division which always takes place first. A Multichoice or Freesymbol tile can be used as a new operator or number if a player adds tiles to an existing equation. If a player places tiles adjacent to tiles already on the board, he does not have to create a valid equation (unlike Scrabble in which each multiletter combination must be a valid word). The sum or product of a player's equation is that player's score for the round; if any part of the equation's answer covers a &quot;D&quot; on the game board, that player's score for the round is doubled. The player then refills his hand to eight tiles.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing tiles, a player can swap any number of tiles from his hand for new tiles or simply pass.&#10;&#10;When one player has no tiles and the bag is empty &ndash; or when all players pass in succession &ndash; the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ligretto Twist features the familiar Ligretto game play, with players trying to rid themselves of cards from their personal stack as quickly as possible by playing them to shared central stacks. The twist comes in that players must lay a hand on top of the card they most recently played, and they can't use that hand again until they lay a card on another stack &ndash; thereby imprisoning that second hand until the first hand plays again. What's more, no other player can lay down cards on a covered stack, so everyone will be fighting to slap stacks first. Finally, unlike other Ligretto games, these cards have only colors &ndash; no numbers.&#10;&#10;When a player plays the final card in his personal stack, the round ends and all other players score one point for each card remaining in their stack. The player with the fewest points after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The scene is set in summer 1941 as the Axis launched Barbarossa, the greatest military campaign in history, which set the course for the rest of the Second World War. Will you lead the Axis and Soviet Union along this path of history or will you attack southwards to acquire the oil rich Middle East or strike the Empires a death blow? As the USA player can you thwart an Axis surprise attack on your Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor and avoid the USA&rsquo;s sudden entry into the war?&#10;&#10;A Moral Conflict game can be played in either a co-operative or non-co-operative way. The rules you need to play are not difficult but Moral Conflict requires many skills to master the dimensions and the game. In this fast moving non-turn based educational game, opportunities are continuously presented to make decisions and act. You can sit on the sideline and watch as world events occur. You can co-operate with other players to defend and develop your lands, or you can trust no one but yourself, as you build up your power and influence around the globe.&#10;&#10;How will you guide your power? Set your heart and mind on one or more of the 5 dimensions:&#10;&#10;Military war: great land, sea and air battles.&#10;&#10;Economic crisis: the struggle for strategic resources and economic growth.&#10;&#10;Diplomatic pressure: coerce or persuade new nations into trade or war.&#10;&#10;Technology race: develop new weapons or production methods.&#10;&#10;Moral conflict: the eternal fight between good and evil.&#10;&#10;As your courage grows you can add the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th dimension games. As the intricacy increases with added dimensions, you will enjoy the growing challenge to plan more strategically, think more long-term and more effectively leverage the interdependency of the dimensions. Interact with your friends in 5 dimensions and watch how victory is won and lost as players use different resources and skills to gain advantage. The interplay of each dimension on another makes each game different and gives the opportunity to test your skills, as you develop your power and learn in all 5 dimensions.&#10;&#10;Moral Conflict 1941 the version for highly sophisticated and skilled strategy game players&#10;&#10;Are you ready for war in all five dimensions?&#10;&#10;A relentless pursue of limitless possibilities: the intellectual challenge to grow in military skill, negotiation, teamwork and master the 5 dimensional interaction with other players.&#10;&#10;This game pushes players to the limit of their game playing abilities; turning them into real generals, diplomats, economic and technological leaders who are able to distinguish between good and evil. Moral Conflict 1941 delivers a detailed and highly realistic global warfare experience that makes the players want to come back to play again and again.&#10;&#10;If Moral Conflict 1941 was a car this would be the high power Ferrari sports car.&#10;&#10;",
