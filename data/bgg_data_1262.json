    "Description": "The aim of the game is for the players to increase their wealth in the game. The initial money received from the bank, can be invested in stock or one of the 4 companies, with the aim of turning a profit. The winner is the player that had the highest profit throughout.&#10;&#10;There are three types of stock in which the players can invest. The three types can be differentiated through the level of Risk/Reward.&#10;&#10;There are 4 companies which can be bought by the players. The owners of the companies will earn income from the other players or the bank.&#10;&#10;The game is played with two dice. The result of every throw determines the wins and losses. The gains and losses are decided by the value of the dice and the P&amp;L board.&#10;&#10;How the P&amp;L board works.&#10;&#10;If for example your dice score is 5, you will receive from the bank 600 dollars for each orange share you own, pay to the bank 400 dollars for each green share you own and receive 1000 dollars for each blue share you own. Also you will have to play 2500 dollars to the owner of West Diamond Mining.&#10;&#10;If your dice score is 6,7 or 8, beside the gains or losses on the shares you own you also receive from the bank 2500 dollars for each company you own and must invest in a High Risk Deal anything between 2000 dollars and your total worth.&#10;&#10;After deciding the amount to be invested in the risky deal you will roll again the dice and If your score is 7 or higher you win twice the amount invested. If the score is lower than 7 you lose half of the invested money.&#10;&#10;Risky Deals are very important  in the game as it often change the leaders and set the game winners. A player that goes ALL IN  in a Risky Deal can triple his or her worth, while only risking to lose half of it.&#10;&#10;The players may decide how many rounds a game will last. A 10 rounds game with 4 players lasts about 80 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The expression &#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#130; means the final big boss you must defeat, such as at the end of a video game.&#10;&#10;This is a co-operative board game in which the players, as adventurers, aim to strengthen themselves in order to eventually defeat the boss enemy.&#10;&#10;The boss enemy keeps moving to reach the goal called the &quot;Fountain of Angels&quot;. The players will win if they strengthen themselves and defeat the boss enemy before they reach the goal. On the other hand, if the boss enemy reaches the Fountain of Angels, the players all lose.&#10;&#10;The game has a large amount of attractive components, such as the A2 size game board, 227 cards and 70 tokens.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#134;&#146;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#179;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#179;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#229;&#140;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;A2&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;227&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;70&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#173;&#133;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#229;&#174;&#185;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

They learn different coping tools by playing with parents, family and friends.&#10;&#10;24 YOGA POSES &#10;- WITH THE BENEFIT OF RELAXING AND RESTORING&#10;All the poses we selected in this collection have the benefit of restoring the body and relaxing the mind. Children can practice becoming still, focused, and self-aware. Once they have mastered these simple techniques, they can use them in any instance to stay calm and access their inner wisdom.&#10;&#10;EASY TO LEARN AND SAFE TO PRACTICE&#10;The back of each instruction card breaks down each pose into four steps. You will see photos of our experienced yoga teacher demonstrating how to safely get into each pose. The names of the poses were inspired by animals and nature to be fun and easy for children to memorize.&#10;&#10;How to play the game ? &#10;Each player takes turns drawing a random card, each displaying a different yoga pose. The players do the pose and whoever has that symbol on their bingo board fills in that spot. The first to fill in five spaces in a row either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally wins! The objective is to help children channel their emotions and relieve stress through yoga. This also connects families and encourages healthy parenting methods.&#10;&#10;",

Unable to move in daylight because of marauding aircraft, they began loading supplies onto destroyers, using the vessel&rsquo;s speed to complete the journey in a single night, reducing the chance of air attack. The Japanese named these supply runs &ldquo;Rat Transportation&rdquo; because they took place under the cover of darkness.&#10;&#10;The supply runs began in the summer of 1942 and continued until the capture of Guadalcanal in the winter of 1943. Originally, the Allies called the runs &ldquo;Cactus Express,&rdquo; but the name was changed to Tokyo Express in press reports to preserve Guadalcanal&rsquo;s military code name.&#10;&#10;WHAT YOU&rsquo;LL NEED&#10;&bull; A copy of the Victory at Sea starter set&#10;&bull; A set of Tools &amp; Counters, dice &amp; a tape measure&#10;&bull; A 3&rsquo;x3&rsquo; play area&#10;&bull; A copy of these rules&#10;&bull; At least 6x US Navy Destroyers (any type)&#10;&bull; At least 3x IJN Destroyers (any type)&#10;&bull; 1x USS Chicago &amp; 1x USS Northampton&#10;&bull; 1x Kumano, 1x Furutaka &amp; 1x Mogami&#10;&#10;",

This kit allows the players to play their ACQUIRE game with the original Sid Sackson rules that were found in the first test market games of ACQUIRE.&#10;&#10;The original edition of ACQUIRE used varying amounts of stocks and the ACQUIRE 1963 World Map Conversion Kit will allow players to use that same concept to play with the following stock amounts: (Variety of Stocks Certificates used in these kits depends on inventory on hand)&#10;&#10;(22) Continental Stock Certificates&#10;(24) Tower Stock Certificates&#10;(26) Luxor Stock Certificates&#10;(29) American Stock Certificates&#10;(31) Worldwide Stock Certificates&#10;(33) Imperial Stock Certificates&#10;(35) Festival Stock Certificates&#10;&#10;The ACQUIRE 1963 World Map Conversion Kit consists of the following items to allow you to convert your version of ACQUIRE:&#10;&#10;1963 Style Instruction Booklet&#10;(6) 1963 Style Information Cards&#10;(1) Luxor Stock Certificate&#10;(4) American Stock Certificates&#10;(6) Worldwide Stock Certificates&#10;(8) Imperial Stock Certificates&#10;(10) Festival Stock certificates&#10;&#10;The ACQUIRE 1963 World Map Conversion Kit allows a quantity of 60 stocks to be shuffled and randomly dealt out to the players before the beginning of game play. The amount of each company stock to be distributed is listed on the information cards. The rest of the certificates are kept in the bank for purchase during the game. Players can only buy one stock certificate per turn. All stocks begin at the same price level.&#10;&#10;This concept allows mystery during the entire game as to the holdings of all players. It is harder to establish strategy for gaining majority when the available amounts vary and the knowledge of other players holdings are unknown. The decision of choosing a company when opening is predicated on the hand that is held from the original dealing of stock.&#10;&#10;Since players are only allowed to purchase one stock certificate per turn, their money supply will usually last longer. Most players never run out of money throughout the entire game. The other benefit derived from the lower amount of stock purchases is that the player's ability to make quicker decisions for purchases is enhanced. Therefore, the rest of the players are not waiting as long for other players to finish their turns.&#10;&#10;Play your game of ACQUIRE in a manner that allows mystery and a little bit of nostalgia. With the ACQUIRE 1963 World Map Conversion Kit your ACQUIRE board game can go back in time to the way it was first played 50 years ago.&#10;&#10;",

The time has come for Don Quijote, Sancho Panza, Carmen, Don Juan, Celestina, Segismundo, Fortunata y Jacinta and many more! And also for Alfonso X, Maim&oacute;nides, Wallada, B&eacute;cquer, Teresa de Jes&uacute;s&hellip;!&#10;&#10;In this new &Ntilde; game (the fourth in the series), the players have to combine cards correctly with the aim of acquiring more points than their opponents before everybody has played their hand. There are five types of cards: 1) &lsquo;Character cards&rsquo;, 2) Object cards, 3), Scenario cards, 4) League cards, and 5) Action cards.&#10;As is the case with Mahjong, there are special card combinations that add up points (&lsquo;Character&rsquo; + &lsquo;Object&rsquo;; &lsquo;Scenario&rsquo; + &lsquo;Character&rsquo;; or according to &lsquo;Work&rsquo; or &lsquo;Author&rsquo;). There are also card combinations like &lsquo;Heroines&rsquo;, (Benina, Teresa or Esperanza), or &lsquo;Villains of Literature&rsquo; (Do&ntilde;a Perfecta, Bernarda Alba). The value of each card is determined according to the &lsquo;&Ntilde; value&rsquo;, (main value), &lsquo;Wisdom value&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Strength value&rsquo;. Unless an &lsquo;Action card&rsquo; specifies otherwise, the &lsquo;&Ntilde;&rsquo; value is the one that should be used to score points.&#10;&#10;During the game, players have to take turns choosing cards that allow them to score or undermine their opponents. The cards can be found in four different states of play: 1) in the players&rsquo; hands (each player receives a set number of cards at the start of the game), 2) on the table (visible to all players), 3) in the scoring area of each player, or 4) out of the game (used cards). Cards in the hand or on the table can be used to score points, while cards in the scoring area of the players or among used cards are irrevocable, meaning that they can not be placed in another area.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "2040: An American Insurgency simulates a US civil war in the 21st century. In this 2-player, 3-hour game, the blue team is the Federals, agents of the government in Washington. The red team is the Rebels, militia groups trying to seize control of states, highways, and cities. The conflict spreads across the entire continental US, from Miami to Seattle and from Los Angeles to New York.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are presented. One depicts a rebellion that emerges from rural areas in the Midwest and South. The other puts the rebellion in urban areas along the coasts. As such, the game is open to multiple interpretations of future politics in the US. The game was designed not to make political statements of one kind or another, but rather to accurately model counter-insurgency operations in the continental US, regardless of who the rebels happen to be.&#10;&#10;Many of the game mechanics are familiar from the existing body counter-insurgency sims. The resources and operations available to the two players are different; the insurgency is depicted as an asymmetric conflict. Gameplay is card-driven, however with events depicting situations that may arise in the US context. For example, if a civil war to occur, the Supreme Court is likely to make rulings that affect the conflict. Therefore, there are SCOTUS cards involving the Second Amendment and the government&rsquo;s ability to make arrests. Other uniquely American features include truck stops as information networks, police brutality events, and the sports-entertainment complex.&#10;&#10;While some of the game&rsquo;s mechanics are familiar, 2040 brings many new mechanics to the table. For example, there is a fully fleshed-out social media system that affects the power of the rebellion. The Rebel player does his recruiting and fundraising through the internet, so that Federal online control measures can dramatically reduce the Rebel&rsquo;s money and troop levels. This net-based conflict adds a third dimension to the insurgency, one that has not been extensively modeled in previous commercially-available simulations.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy feature, unique to the US, is that the suburbs and central cities of an urban area can be at diametrically opposite poles of the revolution. This creates a difficult strategic problem, in that operations that pass between two urban cores must necessarily go through the suburbs of both cities along the way. If those suburbs are enemy-controlled, the transit may be blocked. Forces inside cities can effectively be trapped by hostile suburban forces. Thus, the suburban / urban political conflict in the US has important implications for operational effectiveness.&#10;&#10;The game components include a 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map of the continental US, broken down by regions, cities, suburbs, and highways. Wooden pieces represent Militias (red) and Federal Security Agents (blue). Counters are used to indicate the status of a given space, from Order (pro-Federal) to Revolt (pro-Rebel). Each player has a Player Aid that summarizes the possible actions of both players.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire suitability: 8 out of 10 (similar to games like Twilight Struggle)&#10;    Time scale: Not specified, but approximately one year per turn, covering a 4 to 5 year conflict&#10;    Unit scale: one unit = paramilitary cell&#10;    Players: one to two, best with two&#10;    Playing time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The non-spy players will taste a certain combination of spices, and all of the players will describe what they are tasting, including the spy, by drafting taste cards from a face up pool and creating a menu name for the prosciutto/cheese they tasted.  The players then discuss who the spy is, and an accusation process follows.&#10;&#10;In the other game, the Cyber Gastronomy Club has developed a new way to communicate through spices. One player creates a spice mix and the players attempt, through taste, to determine the spices.  The player creating the mix reveals three sets of 2 taste cards, with the top card of each pair obscuring the second card.  The second card includes an arrow which points to one side of the top card.  The player creates a mix of spices such that the other player(s) will be able to deduce the menu name of the prosciutto/cheese flavor (where the arrows are pointing.)&#10;&#10;",

Republic. Empire. Roma Victrix &ndash; &ldquo;Rome Victorious&rdquo;.  Rome was forged in war.  Even the story of its legendary founding was rooted in a fratricidal conflict.  From her humble origins to her ultimate fall, Rome was either in a constant state of war, or preparing for it.  &#10;Beginning with the Punic Wars until the deposition of the last emperor in the West, Rome was the dominant force in the Mediterranean basin.&#10;&#10;Roma Victrix is a game which endeavors to re-create the conflicts between Rome and her neighbors to achieve and maintain that dominance.  A simple interactive sequence of play guides  each player through the process of revenue collection, recruiting and maintaining military forces, conducting land and naval operations, diplomacy, field battles and sieges.  Special rules are included to emphasize the importance and effects of leadership, cavalry superiority, mobility and attrition. Random events are also represented, adding an element of unpredictability to even the best laid plans and the likelihood that no scenario will ever play the same.&#10;&#10;Seventeen historical scenarios range from the 2nd Punic War through the attempted reconquest of the lost Western territories by Justinian in the mid-6th century A.D.  The rivalries of the later Republic, the Year of the Four Emperors, Imperial expansion and civil war, the Parthian and Persian frontier, the upheaval of the third century and the Germanic invasions are all represented. Three hypothetical scenarios are also included in which players can create their own history. Of the twenty scenarios in Roma Victrix, two are ideally suited for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: 1 year per turn&#10;    Area Movement Map&#10;    Unit Scale: Legions, Legionary Equivalents, Barbarian Warbands&#10;    Players: one to six&#10;    Playing Time: 3-8 hours depending upon scenario&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It wants to convey, through a game experience, the social transformations of the peoples who inhabited Sardinia through Nuragic, Phoenician, Punic and Roman times. Players go through history by living it in a game, looking for resources and being careful not to get enslaved.&#10;&#10;The players assume the role of different populations in Sardinia. They are represented by nuraghes (ancient megalithic edifices) of different colours, that must collect resources (minerals, grape, oil, wheat, livestock, wood, brick). Depending on the number of nuraghes built in a territory, they will be considered free, masters, or slaves, and in the latter case, they will have to deliver the harvest to the master. During the turn, the players can increase their nuraghes population, move the nuraghes on the map, fight the opposing nuraghes to hunt them or to rebel against the masters, plunder the enemy's harvest. They also use the accumulated resources to improve production (mine, vineyard, quarry, field), transport, or start trading.&#10;&#10;The aim is to solve more objective cards than the other players, trying not to hold unresolved objective cards on hand at the end of the game.&#10;The most skilled players will be those who will be able to adapt to what history asks them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board game that requires creativity, strategy and a little back stabbing. Make your finest sculpture in a short amount of time and try to avoid your friends crushing your creations, and your dreams.&#10;&#10;The basic premise is each round there is a new judge. The judge selects an idea card for the players to create during the round. A time limit is selected and the players frantically sculpt. The judge rank the sculptures on the table and the players will move accordingly. 1st place moves forward 3 spaces, 2nd place moves two spaces, 3rd place moves 3 spaces, and the rest don&rsquo;t move at all.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will encounter rule squares, penalty squares and star squares, if you land on one of them, pick up a card with the corresponding symbol. Penalty squares make you sculpt with one hand or move back a space, stuff like that. Star squares typically give players the best card in the game, a Clay Crusher card. This means at the end of any future round the player can use their Clay Crusher card to smash another player's creation before the judge sees it. First one around the board wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You will play script cards from the cast of characters to gain points as you advance Shakespeare&rsquo;s script, and play staging cards to disrupt the play of your rivals. Also play intrigue tokens, character coins and spotlight tokens to strategically improve your position. When you control the lead character, Iago, your opportunities to gain points increase.&#10;&#10;Alas, opportunities also exist to steal points, so take heed: opponents playing the other characters as 'The Company' may try to upstage you! The actor who accumulates the most points at the end of Act V wins the game by stealing the spotlight and landing the role of Iago!&#10;&#10;No Shakespeare knowledge required.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Only you can prevent it!&#10;&#10;Set years after the main campaign of Nova Aetas: Renaissance, in Under Siege you will find your favorite heroes to be more mature and engaged in an impossible mission! This new Campaign made up of 10 new frenetic Missions will see you engaged in the desperate task of resisting the Imperial assault and saving the Pope, before it's too late ... but you will have to be shrewd and brave, the enemy army is not composed only of humans!&#10;&#10;Each Mission will be a race against time, always with different mechanics to manage the massive clashes between the defenders of Rome (including the miniatures of the core box faction of Rome) and the ruthless assailants!&#10;&#10;In Under Siege, you will find 4 new Tiles and new scenic elements to represent Renaissance Rome, such as the spectacular Aqueduct/the door to the City/Passetto (an elevated secret passage)!&#10;&#10;In Under Siege, you'll also find a new Hero, Brynhildr the Lancer, a warrior of German origin who came to Rome to help the Pope against his former compatriots.&#10;&#10;Finally, Under Siege introduces the Allies to NAR! Allies can be added to your company and will help you with Missions. Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, the brave captain in defense of the Eternal City, will be able to join your group as a model in its own right and you can control him as if he were an additional hero, but with more limited rules.&#10;&#10;Plus, you'll have fantastic new miniatures, new special items, and new rules to represent the German tide sweeping through the city's neighborhoods!&#10;&#10;Get ready, the siege is about to begin!&#10;&#10;-description from kickstarter&#10;&#10;",

Entering its corridors in search of riches, you will have to face Nero himself (well at least what remains of him) and his horde of undead constructs, awakened by a dark primordial force, and ready to invade the city sowing terror and destruction!&#10;&#10;But the potential of Catacomb does not end there! Since the vestiges of the Roman Empire are found everywhere in Italy, you can throw yourself into the exploration of other catacombs in any city that has the keyword &quot;Catacomb&quot;, and face always different dungeons created with a simple procedural system.&#10;&#10;The really super thing about this mode will be that you will also be able to meet other factions of Enemies within the Catacomb, representing other groups of tomb raiders, who descended into the dungeon with the same intentions as you!&#10;&#10;Whenever you want, you can take a break from the normal Nova Aetas: Renaissance Missions and spend an evening in dungeon crawler style, throwing yourself into the Catacombs in search of loot!&#10;&#10;Plus, Catacomb is perfect if you want to play Nova Aetas: Renaissance one-shot games without worrying too much about having to keep track of the Mission for the future!&#10;&#10;Descending into the catacombs will give you a completely different gaming experience from the base game and will reward you with special loot cards and new recipes for creating powerful special items.&#10;&#10;But you will not be alone in facing the hordes of undead legionaries, a new Hero: Luca &quot;Skavino&quot; will join your group and guide you through the maze of dungeons with his skills and taking advantage of the many relics of the past that he found in his underground forays!&#10;&#10;A survival expert, and ever resourceful, Luca will be a very different Hero from the others and will use a special Relic Deck to help his companions or easily eliminate Enemies! Obviously, it can be used in any Mission and not just inside the Catacomb.&#10;&#10;What are you waiting for then?

The breeze seems to rot and die from the festering tension, sensing the oncoming rampage that will shake the world.  Typhon bursts from the forest with his hundred dragon heads scrambling over each other, creating havoc to disrupt his competitors.  Angrboda wields her frost giantess magic to freeze the others with Fimbulwinter cold.  Arachne, ever patient, takes her time to weave and scatter web traps far in the distance, beyond the sight of those without eight eyes.  Tiamat, unwilling to risk another defeat, unleashes her ten monstrous children throughout the battlefield to ambush her foes and help her when she needs them most.  Grendel, the living dreadnought, bashes his way past the others, refusing to be slowed.  And the Qilin, well&hellip;this dragon deer doesn&rsquo;t care about the violence, opting to prance ahead, helping whoever they feel like, swaying the tide of the race with benevolent magic.  Who wins?  What do they do at the end?  That&rsquo;s up to you to decide.&#10;&#10;Now imagine that with any combination of 100 monsters from all across the globe.&#10;&#10;Monster Marathon is the wild 2-6 player race to set back your friends.  Each character has 6 abilities that match your dice roll, so you&rsquo;ll have to use what you get to survive the 40 spaces to the end.  (My original intent for the game was for each player from 3-6 to control one monster, but over the course of playtesting, I've discovered that it also plays quite well at two if both players each pick 2-3 characters on a team.)&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s a glance at the basic rules:&#10;&#10;All players can select the monster they want.  Then, choose a lane to start in.&#10;&#10;Pick a monster figure and the matching color of tokens.  Some abilities will give you tokens for wards, curses, or traps.  When you use an ability that gives you a token, select one with a number that matches the ability.&#10;&#10;During each turn, you will have two separate rolls of a six-sided die.  You roll a die for an ability at the beginning of each turn.  The number you roll determines the ability you get to use.  After you&rsquo;ve used your ability, you roll a die to move on the board.&#10;&#10;First to the finish wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Throughout history alchemists have been tirelessly working on unlocking the most coveted secret of the universe: the Philosopher's Stone. Following the success of Trismegistus: The Ultimate Formula, Trismegistus Roll &amp; Write sends you once again into a race against other alchemists to follow in the footsteps of Hermes Trismegistus and to become the greatest alchemist the world has ever known!&#10;&#10;Trismegistus: Roll &amp; Write is played over five rounds. In each round, players take two turns by drafting dice. Additionally, each player may take one reaction per round. With their actions and reactions, players gain elements, transmute them, perform experiments, and prepare for their publications. During the game, players receive and track victory points (VPs) from experiments. At the end of the game, these are added to VPs gained from a player's Philosopher's Stone, their elements, and completed publications.&#10;&#10;In addition to the print-and-play materials themselves, you need ten dice from Trismegistus: The Ultimate Formula. If you do not have Trismegistus dice, you can make your own using regular dice and a sticker sheet provided with the print-and-play materials for Trismegistus: Roll &amp; Write.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Witch Hunter is set in a 14th century town in Europe. The worried townsfolk fall prey to a witch hunting frenzy.&#10;&#10;Each of two teams (villagers and witches) aims at surviving the hunt by avoiding the accusations and death sentences of other players. However, the players themselves do not know their own character: instead, the character card is seen by all the other players.&#10;&#10;Players must observe the actions of others and use their reasoning to figure out their team and survive. Power cards allow for extra tactical actions. The townsfolk decide victims by circulating two death sentence tokens. Whenever both arrive on the same player the character is eliminated. However, even when their character is removed, players can still speak and participate in the game, and so influence the outcome.&#10;&#10;Although the game is short and compact, it can become challenging.&#10;&#10;",
