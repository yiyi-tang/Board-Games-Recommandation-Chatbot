    "Description": "This expansion for Magic: The Gathering is the first-ever draftable Commander experience!&#10;&#10;In the Commander format, players have a legendary creature who serves as the deck's commander. That creature is set aside at the start of the game, and can be cast as if it were in your hand. Normally, this is done with a 100-card singleton constructed deck. However, Commander Legends gives it a new twist. When drafting Commander Legends, each player opens a 20-card booster pack, selects two cards from it, and then passes the pack to the player sitting next to them. They then pick two more cards from the pack they've been handed, and so on, going around the table until all cards are picked. This is repeated with a second booster pack, and again with a third, until everyone has picked a total of 60 cards. Players then choose a commander (or a pair of commanders that both have the Partner ability) from among the cards they drafted, add any number of basic lands, and build a 60-card deck. Then everyone shuffles up their decks and battles in a free-for-all! (A larger pod of drafters splits into two groups first.)&#10;&#10;The set is sold in draft boosters and collector boosters, and contains 361 cards (141 commons, 120 uncommons, 77 rares, and 22 mythic rares, plus the Prismatic Piper, a special helper card who appears more frequently than a common), plus a selection of 32 legendary reprints from past sets who appear with an all-new foil-etched treatment in collector boosters and, on rare occasion, in draft boosters as well. Two preconstructed Commander decks, &quot;Arm for Battle&quot; and &quot;Reap the Tides,&quot; were also released alongside the main set.&#10;&#10;",

It is our daily environment.&#10;&#10;It is not necessary to know architecture to consider certain buildings iconic: they are the ones that give identity to our cities. The aim of this game is to to get the best collection of this architectural icons... avoiding the obstacles put by the rest of the players!&#10;&#10;Arch-hunt is an English contraction of &quot;architecture-hunter&quot;. It is a game that aims to promote architecture by giving visibility to some of the most emblematic buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries. But its main purpose is to entertain during games in which resource management and strategy will be essential to win.&#10;&#10;Each player represents an era through a famous architect. The goal of each player is to get as many points as possible by building the best collection of iconic buildings. To do this, each player must build 8 buildings using coins and cards from their hand. It is, therefore, a management and strategy game in which luck plays an important role. The game ends when a player manages to complete his collection, but this does not mean that he wins the game: the value of the buildings and the possible bonuses at the end of the game can make the difference.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first in this series is no surprise &ndash; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&amp;A Arnhem &rsquo;44.&rdquo;  With the familiar miniatures representing tanks, infantry, artillery, 88s, fighters, bombers, Airborne units and Waffen SS, this game is exactly what the community has been waiting for. 52 Action cards enhance the historical &ldquo;storyboard&rdquo; of the battle while a simple, yet realistic combat system means every decision and roll of the dice makes a difference. With a big, beautiful map created by Marc Von Martial and an easy-to-read large-print highly-illustrated rulebook, this game is ready to hit the table the minute you get the shrink wrap off! &#10;The game has 114 minis and 52 game cards, plus the map is two big, bad 22x34 mounted sections that fold out and fit together for the ultimate Market-Garden experience.  All segments of the campaign are included - from Eindhoven through &quot;hell's highway&quot; to Nijmegen and the dangerous route to Arnhem to cross the lower Rhine.  The players get to re-fight the whole battle from the initial airborne drops to the final showdown between the II SS Panzer Corps and Allied XXX Corps.  Supply, Air combat and ground attack, Drop Zones, Engineer, Air defense and Reinforcements are all included - along with leadership effects, historical events, and plenty of &quot;easy&quot; chrome built into the design via the event cards.  It's only 10 simple turns and it plays quickly, but even the hardcore gaming enthusiast will discover a well-balanced challenge that is not to be taken for granted!&#10;Can you capture the bridges along &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Highway&rdquo; and hold them long enough for the XXX Corps to make it over the Rhine at Arnhem? Or will you dash the allied plans as the German player, slamming the door on the bold allied gamble? This one can go either way every time &ndash; history depends on YOU.&#10;&#10;",

He can transform his entire body into organic metal, granting him superhuman strength, durability, and stamina. Colossus is a gentle giant, however. He is sometimes reluctant to use his physical strength in combat, feeling a responsibility to use his powers to improve the lives of mutants and humankind.&#10;&#10;Illyana Rasputin is the younger sister of Colossus. Abducted at a young age by Belasco, the sorcerer and master of the realm known as The Otherplace, Illyana trained in the art of magic and overthrew her captor to become Magik, the Sorceress Supreme of Otherplace! Her mutant ability to teleport herself and others through space and time by using stepping discs, pieces of Limbo that act as a midway point between locations and points in time, allows her to be anywhere and anywhen her mystic power is needed.&#10;&#10;This pack gives players the chance to round out their X-Men teams with these powerful characters, beginning with beautifully-detailed, dynamic Colossus and Magik miniatures for them to paint and customize. Already featuring a combination of powerful mutant and mystical abilities, players can unlock even more power from this pair with three Team Tactic cards that allow them to tap into the power of Limbo or throw Wolverine with the famous Fastball Special.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Borik&eacute;n &mdash; that is, modern-day Puerto Rico &mdash; is now home to a people that proudly trace their heritage back to its Ta&iacute;no, African, and Spanish roots. These three different cultures were brought together by some of the worst measures of the human condition &mdash; greed, slavery, and genocide &mdash; but the result is a vibrant culture, rich with history and traditions, and known for its beauty and passion.&#10;&#10;The Ta&iacute;no people are gone, but they live on through the people who are trying to connect the broken pieces of their culture almost five hundred years later. To that end, this game tells the story of Borik&eacute;n through the eyes of the Ta&iacute;no people, a people who existed and faced their own challenges even before the Spanish arrived on their shores (pre-1493), who rallied together to try to rid their home of the overwhelming invaders (1493-1512), and in failing to do so had to make hard sacrifices so that a few might survive (1512-1529).&#10;&#10;In designing and developing Borik&eacute;n: The Ta&iacute;no Resistance, we decided that in an effort to convey a holistic picture of the Ta&iacute;no people, no part of their story could be left out, so the campaign game combines three unique scenarios, each covering one of the three eras of Ta&iacute;no history, focusing on the type of conflict in which the Ta&iacute;no people were engaged.&#10;&#10;These three game scenarios can be played individually as standalone games or played as a three-part campaign in which the end state of each game serves as the set up for the next. Each game scenario accommodates 2-4 players and takes between 45-90 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

While deciding on a character, a &quot;summon card&quot; will also be drawn. The player who draws a summon card becomes a demon king summoned by the Ancients and fights against other players secretly.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the end of the map, the map exploration phase will end and the identity of the Demon King will be revealed.&#10;The next step is to enter a one-on-many card battle, where other players have to join forces to defeat the player who has become the Demon King.&#10;Will the player who becomes the Demon King be inspired by the values of the ancients and win?&#10;Or will the player with modern thinking and debating ability be able to overrule the ancients?&#10;&#10;Here comes the battle of ancient and modern arguments!&#10;Debate Card: The wisdom of Eastern and Western classical thought will become the basis of your debate.&#10;The &quot;no contest&quot; card: the slippery slope, the face ......, the modern way of &quot;discussing&quot; things, will become your best trick.&#10;The unexpected event card: in the process of exploring the map, the effect card will be randomly drawn, and you have to sense the direction of the wind in case of emergency!&#10;&#10;Five Demons, Five Levels&#10;The five demon lords and five levels are drawn by &#232;&#145;&#137;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#233;&#157;&#146;, the artist who won the 2021 Japan International Manga Award, and have both ancient and modern aesthetics.&#10;&#10;Mulan&#10;In this game, you designate the size and wind direction of your own card.&#10;Defiant card: 5 effects and one more &quot;symbolic struggle&quot;.&#10;Debate card: 3 cards exclusive to Mulan + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile&#10;&#10;Emperor Qin Shi Huang&#10;Invalidate the opponent's disobedience card once.&#10;Disobedience card: 5 effects and 1 more &quot;facepalm&quot; card&#10;Debate cards: 3 cards exclusive to Qin Shi Huang + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile&#10;&#10;Mencius&#239;&#189;&#156;I am doing this for you&#10;Replace a card played by your opponent with a blank card.&#10;Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 additional &quot;Karma Blast&quot;.&#10;Debate cards: 3 exclusive cards of Mengmu + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile&#10;&#10;Pu Songling&#10;You may replace a card from your hand once after you open a duel.&#10;Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 more &quot;Slip&quot; card&#10;Debate card: 3 cards exclusive to Pu Songling + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile&#10;&#10;Zhuangzi&#239;&#189;&#156;Northern Meditation with Fish&#10;1. 1 point of blood is returned at the end of each match&#10;2. not take any damage once&#10;Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 additional &quot;Sleep&quot; card&#10;Debate cards: 3 copies of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; + 4 blind draws from the debate card pile&#10;&#10;Explore the map with the topic!&#10;The map of &quot;Call of Ancient Fighters&quot; combines five issues: gender roles, authority, parenting styles, media literacy, and philosophy of life.&#10;&#10;In order to create a richer &quot;educational and fun&quot; experience, both the map design and the play style are intended to combine both the issues and the player's own reading experience.&#10;&#10;For example, in the &quot;Mulan&quot; map, we designed three special exploration points: jeans, car keys, and pens. Players need to explore these points and open the map card before they can successfully summon Mulan to appear.&#10;&#10;These three exploration points correspond to the &quot;gender roles&quot; we want to convey in this map.&#10;Jeans symbolize the imagination of women who no longer have to conform to a specific feminine temperament.&#10;The fountain pen represents the power of women to speak, to argue, to write, and to enter the public sphere.&#10;The car key is a means of transportation, signifying the independence and mobility of women.&#10;&#10;While novels and comics focus more on the plot, the board game is based on the concept of classic humanistic sentences, focusing on the four protagonists, who enter the realm of the Ancients' obsessions and need to defeat them to regain their freedom. The tabletop game is a combination of two modes: map exploration and card battles, plus role-playing and camp battles.&#10;&#10;The five ancients (five maps) represent the following issues: Mulan (gender roles), Qin Shi Huang (authority), Mencius (parenting style), Pu Song Ling (media literacy), and Zhuang Zi (philosophy of life).&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two types, one is the &quot;debate cards&quot; which are based on sentences from Chinese humanities classics and Western contemporary thought classics, divided into three main parts: rational, emotional and value, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the cards are played in the way of point size comparison. The second is the &quot;disobedience to battle cards&quot; that use concepts commonly found in modern slang to trigger events or effects, such as: karma detonation, facepalm, slippery slope, etc.&#10;&#10;&mdash;another description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

Each tribe will have its own actions and skills (most of the actions will be resolved by rolling dice and their success will depend of the cavemen characteristics). The game has different ways to counterbalance the randomness of the dice (rage token to reroll dice, idea cards with special actions that can be activated if you meet specific condition, etc.). There are four tribes in the base game and a lot of interesting content (a solo mode, a skirmish mode, a campaign mode, a lot of different beasts, scenario with different winning conditions, items to win, etc.).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The deck includes cards numbered 1-15  in 4 suits, or 60 cards in total.&#10;&#10;In setup, 4 cards are dealt to each player and 4 face up to the centre. Players take turns putting down one card from their hand and are trying to take as many other cards from the centre as they can. Aces are worth one point each, and two lucky cards are worth three points if captured - 3 of triangles, and 10 of lozenges. Build (compile) piles of cards up over the round, but beware - the other player may be able to capture your pile!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

And aircraft will be forced to &quot;retire&quot;, as newer, better aircraft become available.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions are two-fold, and are scored at the end of each turn - most cash on hand, and most major airports under control.&#10;&#10;In addition to this, the game has a Bot system that not only allows every game to have 6 companies, but actually speed up play in the process.&#10;&#10;Turbofans comes in two flavors - the Introductory game can be played in 60-90 minutes, and the Standard game comes in around the time it takes to play most 18XX games.  There are also optional rules, regional startup scenarios, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This new Roguelike expansion allows Heroes to complete challenges in order to level up the content of the game in current and future playthroughs.&#10;&#10;Challenge cards are drawn at the start of a session, which can be completed to gain the honor points depicted in the upper corner of the card. Is it worth taking a detour on your path to Doomrock to accomplish one of these challenges? Sure! Nothing could possibly go wrong, could it? Once earned, these points can be used to level up the game semi-permanently. This is comparable to a legacy mechanic, but completely reversible: powered up cards can be removed at any time.&#10;&#10;When spending an honor point, Heroes choose which of the 3 types of decks will be upgraded and draw 3 cards from the powered up decks of the Roguelike Expansion. One of the 3 drawn cards is chosen and will replace the card with the same name already in the deck.&#10;&#10;The new cards are more powerful versions of their originals, bringing minor advantages like improved stats or reduced attribute requirements.&#10;&#10;When upgrading the Ability Deck, cards will often have more powerful effects or easier/improved dice results. As you complete more challenges, more powered up cards will be present in the game decks. These powered up cards will show up in the game more often, tempting you to pick them up from SHOPS and during Level Ups.&#10;&#10;This expansion will add some additional decision making and richness, and make the game marginally easier each playthrough.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Building on the innovative gameplay of his Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series, designer Rick Young has reimagined the best parts of FAB to introduce a new game system: Battle Command. The goal of the Battle Command system is to provide a fresh and engaging way for various conflicts across different eras to be fought with minimal time wasted on setup and complex rules, making this both a great introductory system for new and veteran players alike. &#10; Each Battle Command volume includes TWO different games in one box. Volume I brings players to the forests of the Battle of the Bulge, and the sun, heat, and sand of North Africa during Operation Crusader. The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty, and time of play. With a low total counter count and density, these quick playing (though still realistic) simulations present players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted, and movement has been streamlined.&#10;&#10;For those who prefer to use a paper map, or who would like to be able to set up both games side by side, we are including a double-sided paper map along with the double-sided mounted map. This is for those of you who have 3 friends who would like to play, or play at conventions, or just plain prefer a paper map.&#10;&#10;Battle Command (BC) is a refinement and simplification of the old Fast Action Battles (FAB) game series. Those familiar with the FAB games will recognize that the scope is the same, with higher echelons, artillery, events, and combat assets that can be assigned as available. FAB however was rules intensive and procedural, and those elements have been streamlined in the BC series. Most players do not need to pick up the rulebook after the first turn or two, as everything you need to play has been printed on the map, including a flow-chart with extended sequence of play so that no turn segment will be overlooked, and your attention will be placed solely on the battle at hand. Special rules needed for each event are printed directly on the event cards, so you can play them and forget them without having to refer to the rulebook.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Two Rulebooks&#10;220 playing cards (110 per game)&#10;1 double-sided mounted map (34&quot;x22&quot;) with one game on each side&#10;1 double-sided paper map (34&quot;x22&quot;) with one game on each side&#10;2 counter sheets&#10;4 Player Aids&#10;2 dice&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bord&eacute;locratie is a game that puts players at the heart of the French political &quot;bordel&quot; (or shambles). Find yourself at the head of a political party that will leave its mark on the Fifth Republic (or maybe just a dent).&#10;&#10;But to reach the supreme position of President and get to move into the Elys&eacute;e palace, you must first increase your popularity, get more votes in the Assembl&eacute;e et vote laws for the good of your part... country !&#10;&#10;Designed as a party game that can also be played in a more political version (longer, more intense and with more knives stuck in your back by the end), a game lasts around 1 hour and brings to the table 4 to 6 fans of the best televised political debate of the Fifth Republic, or 4 to 6 players who want to feel powerful while disdaining your nobody opponents (until they become somebody).&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;Every turn, players draw 2 Action cards then can only play one.&#10;Then the First Player draws three Bills, submits one to the Assembl&eacute;e and draws a second random one.&#10;Players vote on the Bills submitted (each one giving victory points to player based on specific conditions).&#10;Then the turn end and we start again.&#10;&#10;THE ACTION CARDS&#10;&#10;The Action cards you get to use have different abilities. Events change the course of the game, Campaign increases your popularity and backers bring you more weight at the Assembl&eacute;e. You can also play fraud cards to turn the tide in your favor, or rip the tide away from another player.&#10;&#10;ELECTIONS&#10;&#10;Mimicking the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic (with a few liberties of course) every 5 turns, a President will be elected in a two round system. In the first round only the two players with the most popularity get to the second round. Then for the second round, every other players has to endorse one of the two finalists and lend them their own popularity.&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;&#10;At the end of turn 12, it's time to see who collected the most victory points through being elected or Bills that gave your points based on the backers you have accumulated.&#10;&#10;Of course there is much more to discover in the cards and positions within the government, but that's for you to discover in the game !&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (English)&#10;&#10;Bord&eacute;locratie est un jeu qui vous plongera dans le bordel politique de la Ve R&eacute;publique.

When all players have finished their tokens, they proceed to reveal them; bluffs are discarded. If only one player has a valid token on the card, the puppy is adopted by the owner, adding at the end of the game the victory points indicated at the top of the card. If several tokens are placed on the puppy card by different players, the puppy is cuddled, producing the effect shown at the bottom of the card. Adopted puppies are replaced in the same number by other cards. The winner is the one who, at the end of three rounds, has the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

The idea came to the designer whilst editing rules for games and looking for typos. It is based on the internet meme Typoglycemia.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns asking the question. They read the answers to two texts and then show the texts to the other players. But certain parts of the text are blocked by round images, so the players must work out what is really being said. When they have solved two sections, they must perform the action being instructed. The player with the answer declares the first and second winners to perform the action required, who get points.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach six points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The illustrated texts show examples such as round ladybirds, fairy lights, koi, lanterns, a baseball, and an owl on the branch (the publisher being an owl).&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;This is a new, easy party game that combines &quot;quiz&quot; and &quot;action&quot;.&#10;Players are divided into contestants and respondents.&#10;The contestant chooses one question from the list of questions and checks the answer. Afterwards, the answers are published for the respondents to see. Respondents look at the published hole in the text and try to guess what it says.&#10;As soon as they have an idea of what it says, they move on to the next question. As soon as they know what it says, they take action.&#10;If one of the respondent's actions matches the answer, the contestant points out, &quot;Correct!&quot; The first correct answer is unconditional.&#10;The first correct answer gets one point unconditionally, and the second correct answer gets one point if it matches the answer to what they read in the text.

    "Description": "As a village leader, you want to help your people be as happy as possible. You can improve their happiness by sending them to one of the four temples; at the end of the round, the most pious at each temple will get the biggest happiness boost. You may find it more efficient to bus them from the temples to the local bar, casino, or market for some immediate happiness. Even better, you might get them to come back to the temples again afterwards.&#10;&#10;Players start with an identical supply of six action cards, and there are six different action cards in the pool. In each of the four rounds, players assemble a hand of cards to play from their supply. Then, one card at a time, they choose a replacement card from the pool (getting a bonus from the top of the card) to go to their supply, before playing one of their hand cards and discarding it to the pool.&#10;&#10;Once per game, a player can enlist one of the six advisors for a unique and powerful advantage. Timing is tricky: Some are better if taken earlier, some later, but each player may only take one, and each may only be taken by one player.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four rounds, with two to six actions per player per round. (Two at the start, but more may be earned.)&#10;&#10;",

The Unseen Domains are treacherous, but might lay the foundations of a new future if it is not destroyed by greed first.&#10;&#10;In Unseen Domains the players compete for victory points over three rounds using their unique decks. In the end, the player who has the most victory points wins. During the rounds, each player can perform actions by playing their cards. Actions are used to recruit new units and move them, activate area abilities, and perform various maneuvers for a positional advantage.&#10;&#10;Victory points are scored for controlling the domains at the end of each round. They also let the players use the given area's abilities. In the Wilderness, various quests can be completed for powerful Bloodshards.&#10;&#10;Each player can perform actions in their turn, but only one of each action type. With certain abilities, and the precious Bloodshards, this limitation can be exceeded, so the pace of the game can be manipulated.&#10;&#10;Once the first player has run out of cards, the round ends. Everyone else has one more turn to play, and the player who ended the round gets a free bonus action. With this bonus action in mind, it might be worth it to play your hand as early as possible. But some players who read the game well can make an even better deal by leaving the bonus to the others.&#10;&#10;The key is to carefully assess your options, use the abilities to your advantage and time your actions right. Those who can do this can dominate the Unseen Domains.&#10;&#10;",
