    "Description": "It was 2012 when the Mayans predicted the end of time, but few listened and prepared for the inevitable.  Almost without warning, the Fall of Man came to pass and Man ended his dominion of the Earth with a whimper. Continents were erased, new seas formed, and only a very unlucky few survived the apocalypse. The angle and orbit of the planet had changed, and the only habitable areas remaining on Earth are between the 30th and 45th parallel. As the Earth slowly dies, burning under a closer Sol, the remaining inhabitants struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;70 years have passed since the Fall, and what was once the western seaboard of the United States is the last bastion of humanity on the planet.  New settlements have grown over the ashes of the old, the largest being the Free Republic of Phoenix. Phoenix has grown and prospered, its guarded, high walls protecting it from the hazards of the open wastes. Phoenix is the center of the world now, having formed political alliances with many of the remaining settlements, providing electricity and protection in the form of its Centurions in return for manpower, goods, and food.  Ruled by an elected dictator, its laws are strong and absconders are dealt with harshly, but life in the wastes is harsher. Providing tens of thousands a stable life, Phoenix truly is the last hope for civilization, but not everyone wants civilization.&#10;&#10;The Anarchists, as the Phoenicians call them, are made up of freedom loving people that will bow to no man&rsquo;s law but their own. Cut off from the much-needed electricity and fresh water produced in Phoenix, they scavenge the lands as their ancestors did, killing anyone that they encounter to survive.  In a perpetual state of conflict with Phoenix and their merciless Centurion warriors, and led by their High Priest or Mor, they will stop at nothing until Phoenix falls and the Free Cities are allowed to be truly Free.&#10;&#10;Your adventure begins with the high council of your small, Northwestern village calling you, one of its strongest, bravest citizens to the village hall.  The council tells its chosen ones that the city generator has begun to fail and that you must find and recover a suitable replacement within 30 days or your people will perish and your village with fall to the wastes. Not knowing where to begin and provisioned only with what your village could spare, you set off into the wastes.&#10;&#10;&#10;Beyond The Fall is a post-apocalyptic game of survival where players must make their way south to Phoenix before running out of food or being killed by Anarchists, starvation, or the wasteland itself.  Along your way you will come upon settlements where you may barter or desperate men who may try to kill you.  The wastes are an inhospitable place for the weak, and only your strength, courage, and your choices will carry you through safely.&#10;You may undertake missions which will reap glory and rewards, may perform acts of courage that will craft your story into legend, or you may take up the cause of the Anarchists who wish to defile and rape the lands for their own benefit.  The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An abstract strategy game of building networks.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a hexagonal grid of hexes. Six hexes, located along the outer edge of the board, are labelled with a letter. Players, on their turn, add a path of their colour that connects two adjacent hexes and a wall that blocks a path from being built there. In addition, players may convert a path to a wall and a wall into a path. Eventually, the six lettered hexes will be connected by a network of paths. At this point, the game ends. There will be three scoring routes on the board. Each scoring route connects a pair of letters and usually contains paths owned by more than one player. Players score one point for each path they own along each route. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;To assemble the print-and-play version, simply print the board, insert it into a plastic sheet protector, and use dry erase markers to draw paths and walls. Alternatively, print one of the other boards, which have smaller dimensions but larger hexes, and use Settlers of Catan roads as paths and small counters as walls.&#10;&#10;",

These maps, like their locations, couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Rainforest is all about fluctuating goods prices while Sahara is a mean, unforgiving map that adds a layer of strategy to Age of Steam and Steam games that&rsquo;s heavily focused on location.&#10;&#10;Amazon Rainforest takes place deep in the Brazilian forests, where you&rsquo;re building railroads between the few small cities scattered about. Unlike most Steam/AoS maps, Amazon does not have towns...and there&rsquo;s no way to get them on the map. Fortunately, your income isn&rsquo;t tied to links. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s tied to the &ldquo;wood market&rdquo; where each color cube represents a different kind of prized and scarce South American wood. The more wood that&rsquo;s delivered, the scarcer the supply, which drives up the price. The less wood on the board, the cheaper the wood. You&rsquo;ve got to find the rare stuff and deliver it before anyone else does. Due to the limited number of cities, the track network you build is critical. Amazon Rainforest is for 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;Sahara Desert takes place on the northern portion of Africa. In possibly one of the harshest climates ever to build a railroad network, you won&rsquo;t survive without lots and lots of water. However, you can only get water from the oases throughout the desert, and once they dry up, they dry up for good. If you don&rsquo;t have access to water you can pay per delivery, or if you&rsquo;re really crafty, you&rsquo;ll choose the Water Import action and not worry about water for this turn. Regardless of how you do it, it&rsquo;s going to be tough, and there&rsquo;s going to be more moisture slowing coming down your face in the form of tears than anywhere else. Sahara Desert is for 3-5 players who won&rsquo;t acknowledge their limitations.&#10;&#10;The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double size expansions. These maps can be preordered from Bezier Games and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; 7th map is only available through preorders. Age of Steam/Steam California Gold Rush &amp; Underground railroad have been previously announced. More details about the remaining 3 maps will be coming in the next few weeks from Bezier Games.&#10;&#10;",

After that, the player tries to move his pawn to the Art Club space, where he receives the valuable artwork Leonard Cheshire. Then, the players check the value of all their possessions, including artworks, money and stores that sell the artist&rsquo;s products, and who has the highest amount is the winner. Artworks and stores can be directly purchased from other players or by auctions or can be earned on special spaces on the game board.&#10;&#10;",

The type of card is chosen based on the movements of the pawns after the counting of points at the end of each round. Except for the third type of card, for which all players answer independently, the other two types allow the players to write false but convincing answers or definitions. Players score points by both hitting the real answer and convincing other players that your definition is the correct.&#10;&#10;",

The only problem is that the boss has put a promotion out for the player that builds the strongest case against the Serial Killer. This means that the players will do anything to further their own investigation and all possible to hinder their opponents even though it has to look like they are both working together.&#10;&#10;The players will play a card each that indicate a certain coorordinate. A lot of bluffing is involved in the game as there is only a limited cardplays for each player. The coordinates will be stocked with increasing amount of evidence for each day passing of the investigation.The players will also be able to move the serial killer himself in order to hinder the other players investigation by killing off his investigators.&#10;&#10;The player, who has built the strongest case against the Serial Killer in three days, by getting the most Case Points, wins the game. Case Points will mainly be gained by having the most of a certain type of evidence.&#10;&#10;At the moment Graphic design is beeing conducted by Josh Cappel for the prototype that is going to be released at the Hippodice Competition 2011.

The mouse, the hare, the bear, the hedgehog, and the frog want to help Princess Rosie by trying to find the most beautiful fairy dress that has even been worn at a ball. Pupsi, the pig, has taken command and you can support the animals to find all the parts of the dress. But hurry up - you have to be ready before the ball starts at sunset.&#10;&#10;The game board and box fit together make a diorama scene that all the players sit in front of, much like a stage. The scene is of a beautiful meadow with seven berry bushes, a castle, and blue sky beyond. The berry bushes are cards that are shuffled and placed randomly. Most of the bushes have a picture of part of Princess Lillifee's dress printed on the back so the players don't know which dress part is behind each bush. The pawns have one of the helpful animals on the back side. Pawns are placed on the board so the players cannot see which pawn is which animal. The Pig sets the goal by showing a card with a combination of a dress piece and an animal.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling a die and moving the pawns behind each of the bushes, trying to match the animal and dress parts shown on the Pigs easel. Since the players don't know what is behind the pawns and bushes, they use the mirrored magic wand to look behind the bushes to see if they found a match. A sun mover acts as a timer as it moves from cloud to cloud showing that the ball is getting ready to start. If the players can collect all the dress parts before the sun sets, they win the game!&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ll need one set of Nestortiles in order to play it.&#10;&#10;DEFINITIONS&#10;&#10;The value of a tile is the number of pips on that tile.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Place all the Nestortiles face-down in the middle of the playing surface (drawing area) and shuffle them.&#10;If this is the first game, the starting player is determined randomly. If not, the player that lost the previous game starts.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases.&#10;&#10;DICE BUILDING PHASE &mdash; This phase is played in turns.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must do one of these two things:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a tile from the drawing area and place it face-up before you or...&#10;     Discard one of your tiles face-down (first show it to the other player) and draw as many tiles from the drawing area as the value of the discarded tile (You can't draw the discarded tile itself). The value of the discarded tile must be lower than the number of tiles left on the drawing area.&#10;&#10;&#10;If, after drawing the tiles, you have 6 or more tiles, you must build a die. To do this, choose 6 of your tiles and assemble them into a die, and discard the rest face-down to the drawing area.&#10;If the drawing area has no tiles left, the dice building phase ends.&#10;&#10;COMBAT PHASE &mdash; Before this phase starts, 9 or 10 dice should have been built.&#10;&#10;Both players roll their dice at once (try not to mix them).&#10;Now, for each of the 10 colors, do the following:&#10;&#10;     Sum up the total value rolled for that color for each player. The player with the highest sum for that color gets 1 point.&#10;     In case of a tie, no points are scored for that color.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score after the 10 colors have been checked is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the highest total sum (pips rolled on all dice) wins the game.&#10;&#10;VARIANT&#10;&#10;The discarded tiles are placed face-up.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player adds one of her pieces to the tree by placing it on the nub protruding from the base or the nub on any other piece already attached to the base. A player can use only one hand and cannot support the tree while placing a piece. A player cannot place a double piece on a double piece of her own color, but she may cap an opponent's double piece.&#10;&#10;If the tree falls over, the player who added the most recent piece loses. Otherwise, the game ends when a player places four pieces of her color in a row, with this player winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

The difference is that cards can be rearranged AT ANY TIME (making for a shorter game).&#10;&#10;During a turn, the player draws a card and chooses to replace a card in their holder. The replaced card is put face up in the middle of the table. Subsequent cards are placed on the same pile.&#10;&#10;Interrupts: if a discarded card allows them to complete a set of 3 connecting cards, a player can interrupt and take the card. A die roll resolves simultaneous interrupts. The set of 3 cards are revealed to other players and LOCKED from changes. Play continues to the left of the player who successfully interrupted play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player connects up 12 cards (9 cards for a short game). Each player then tallies up VPs printed on cards, choosing between one of two cards in each link. Completing player gets 5 VPs bonus. Tranport cards = 0 vp. Multiples cards are -1 point for one after the main card.&#10;&#10;The production values are high. The garish board is mounted, the rules and player aids are printed on thick laminated card, the wooden card holders add considerable heft to the box.&#10;&#10;",

The sequence, which represents the events that would take place in about the amount of time it would take a typical gun crew in the 18th century to load and fire a large cannon, is repeated until the victory conditions of one side have been achieved, or all the ships of one side have been lost or have fled.&#10;&#10;",

But that night the Allies began a confused retreat, leaving the French scrambling to mount a pursuit the next morning.&#10;&#10;Already poised behind the enemy right, the French I Corps was in the best position to block the Allies. Ordered to proceed via Peterswalde to seal the exits from the mountains, Vandamme was to act as anvil to Napoleon&rsquo;s hammer, crushing the Allies between them.&#10;&#10;It was a clever plan &ndash; one that might have broken the Coalition had it worked.&#10;&#10;Kulm 20 is based on the battle that occurred during Napoleon&rsquo;s final campaign in Germany, on 29-30 August, 1813. One player commands the Coalition forces under the Austrian Field Marshall Karl Schwarzenberg, while the other player commands the French army, nominally under the command of the Emperor Napoleon.&#10;&#10;Note, Kulm 20 is not a &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo; game.

    "Description": "A Diplomacy variant based on Tolkien&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings.  The game uses the basic mechanic of the original Diplomacy game.  Players control armies on a map divided into areas.  Some areas contain supply centers, the control of which, allows the player to build another army.  Players write their moves secretly, either moving into an area or supporting another unit.  Players may support the move of an another player.  The object is to control the majority of supply centers.&#10;&#10;There are some significant differences that set it apart from the orginal.  The topology is a map of Middle Earth, with Arnor, Rohon, Mordor, Rhovanion, and Gondor, being the &quot;nations&quot; represented.  Mordor begins the game much stronger than the other nations.&#10;&#10;In addition to armies there are double armies and triple armies which attack at double and strength but are supplied at single strength.  The ring is special piece that can be held, worn, or transferred by an army.  If worn, it will increase the army&rsquo;s strength (SA to DA, DA to TA, etc.) and will affect victory conditions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Partner up with a keen and clever horse. A variety of challenging jumps await. The exciting Perfect Stride horse game starts now! You and up to three competitors play skilled riders. Be ready for the unexpected -- sometimes lucky events occur and sometimes trouble comes your way. Collect the most ribbons to win the game!&quot;&#10;&#10;The jump course, made up of up to 10 jumps or obstacles is determined by randomly placing (face down) up to 10 Jump cards in a row.  The game contains a total of 20 Jump so chances are, your course will be different every time you play.&#10;&#10;In Perfect Stride, game play occurs in two phases.&#10;During the &quot;Set the Pace&quot; phase, all players secretly choose the speed at which they move their horse and simultaneously reveal that speed.  This determines the order in which the players will attempt the upcoming jump and how many Skill cards they are allowed to draw.  Skill cards will be used during the &quot;Jump&quot; phase to successfully clear the newly revealed jump ahead.  Rider Jump Order may also affect the outcome of other events which will occur.  The rider in the lead receives the Lead Rider Token and jumps first and can gain bonus points for keeping the lead BUT the faster you ride, the fewer Skill cards you draw.  The lead rider also reveals the next jump during the next game phase.&#10;&#10;Players then draw their Skill cards and the Jump Phase begins.  Each rider in Rider Jump Order, makes an attempt to successfully clear the jump ahead by playing skill cards and activating special card functions.  In addition, unknown events will occur (from the Event card deck) which will affect a riders attempt.  Those that successfully clear the jump win Ribbon Points.  The order in which riders clear the jump determines how many ribbon points they win.  The Lead Rider Token may change hands many times during the Jump phase and the rider who is in the lead at the end of the Jump phase will gain bonus ribbons.&#10;&#10;Perfect Stride is a game with many levels of strategy with just the right amount of luck blended in.  How fast should I ride?  Who is in the lead?  Should I sacrifice my draw to get ahead of other Riders?  Should I save specific Skill cards to use later on?  When should I take the lead from another rider?  Perfect Stride is a game you will want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;Included in the game is a beautifully illustrated 95-card deck, 54 Ribbon Point Cards, 16 Pace Cards, a Lead Rider token and Rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MISSION:I.S.S.  pits player against each other in an effort to win the space race of the 21st century. Acting as the USA, Russia, ESA, or NASDA (Japanese space agency) each player must fund and launch 5 modules to connect to the International Space Station. This is not so easy when you realize that other players can exert political influence requiring you to launch modules for them, and can even be involved in delaying or destroying missions as they happen.&#10;&#10;Featuring 3d modeled graphics, and easy to learn rules, MISSION:I.S.S. raises awareness of the space program and some of the real (and not so real) difficulties faced in space exploration and funding.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Social Security Special is similar to Aggravation, in that players must navigate their pawns around a uni-directional track while avoiding their opponent's pieces, to become the first to bring all their pawns safely &quot;home&quot;,  This game, however, differs in that it is played in teams and that movement is determined by card playing, not dice rolls.  Players begin with 5 regular playing cards in their hand, drawing one card and playing one card of their choice per turn.  Each card allows specific movement on the board.  Landing on an opponent's piece will return it to their &quot;start&quot; space.  First team to reach home with all their pawns wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the summer of 1917, the Turks were blocking the road to Palestine. They had been retreating until reaching the Gaza, where there reinforced and built extensive trench defenses. The Turks were always tough and after the 1st Battle of Gaza slipped through the British hands, the British also re-equipped- with tanks! It was hoped that these monsters would wreck the Turk defenses and cause them to flee opening up Palestine to the British. Naval monitors would bombard Gaza from the sea. The Turks were not easy prey especially in prepared defenses and with the help of German aircraft above. Once again both prepared for yet another showdown.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about 800 yards per hex. Each combat unit is one platoon to company .&#10;&#10;",

Barely taking time to refuel, Japanese carriers and cruisers struck the Dutch East Indies and Ceylon. Committing a basic error of dividing their forces, the Japanese then split their fleet carriers into two groups for Operations MO and MI, which resulted in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea.&#10;&#10;Combined Fleet is a 64-page book supplement to the Second World War at Sea series, focusing on Japanese and American plans and options for these two climactic battles. There are 20 scenarios, or separate game situations, based on both actual actions and potential battles that could have taken place with the forces that both sides either could have committed or discussed sending to the battle zone.&#10;&#10;This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Coral Sea and Midway to enjoy most of he scenarios, with some pieces also drawn from Bismarck, Bomb Alley, Strike South and Eastern Fleet.&#10;&#10;&#10;http://www.avalanchepress.com/gameCombinedFleet.php&#10;&#10;System Description at http://www.avalanchepress.com/line_WWIISea.php&#10;&#10;",

(Actually, he had fun with them all. You can tell by looking. You'll have fun too.)&#10;&#10;This is an expansion for Munchkin, not a stand-alone set.
