    "Description": "A card game for baking perfectionists and those who like to sabotage them.&#10;&#10;Put on your apron and grab your mixing bowls as you vie for ribbons in the cake decorating contest at the Carroll County Fair. Create the tallest, most beautiful cakes by stacking layer upon layer of frosted sweetness. Will you go slow and steady to create a few cakes with extreme precision? Or rush to submit your cakes ahead of the competition? Draw or draft cards to build cakes up to five layers tall. Elbow your opponents to get the types of cake (chocolate or vanilla) and frosting flavors (five fruits, plus a wild) you need to win ribbons in six categories. Only one player may win each ribbon, so you&rsquo;ll have to swipe, swap, and squeeze your way to victory. Some ribbons are worth more than others. Choose carefully which ones you go for in this race to outmaneuver other contestants.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are five identical six-sided dice.  Each face has a picture of an animal on it (opposite face pairs on a die are lizard-koala, kangaroo-emu, and buffalo-crocodile).&#10;&#10;Players roll all five dice, then may select dice for scoring.  The player can reroll twice and select dice each time, if desired. If a player cannot put a score down for any category after three rolls, the player must record a zero in one empty category.  Each and every appearance of a crocodile on every roll imposes an immediate 3-point penalty for that player.&#10;&#10;The rules include an alternative game, optional penalties, and a listing of the odds for each type of dice roll.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a card stock cover (with rules printed inside), five special dice, and a scorepad.  Everything is packaged in a clear plastic envelope.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Berlin Crisis was the culmination of a series of events that heated up the Cold War. Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the inconclusive Vienna Conference, Khrushchev saw Kennedy as a weak and inexperienced leader. He used this as an opportunity to solve the unresolved and aggravating problem: Berlin. East Germans were escaping to the West weekly by the thousands, creating economic chaos. A solution had to be reached. This led to Khrushchev's ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Western armed forces from West Berlin and later, the construction of the Berlin Wall. Events continued to escalate to the point where opposing troops faced each other down gun barrels at Checkpoint Charlie.&#10;&#10;NATO 1961 is a simulation of the potential for war in Germany, covering events that could have led to World War Three. Players assume the roles of President John F. Kennedy and the NATO powers or Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the Warsaw Pact general staffs. Confronted with the crisis, players can manage the conflict at a limited level or escalate it to full-out war between the Superpowers.&#10;&#10;The 17&quot;x22&quot;map covers the Central Front including both East and West Germany as well as part of Czechoslovakia, France and the Low Lands. The 240 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show regimental, brigade and divisional level forces of the NATO and the Warsaw Pact.&#10;&#10;",

They all have one goal in mind... to become the first trillionaire in the universe (or universes)!&#10;&#10;Trillionaire is a card game that comes with pre-built, balanced decks so it can be played right out of the box. Players continue battling until one obtains 10 Cash Cards ($1 Trillion worth) and successfully deposits their full Trillion into the bank. You can only obtain sufficient Cash Cards for victory by Bankrupting opponents' Billionaire Cards.&#10;&#10;Billionaires range from a sentient computer from Neato Prime, who philanthropically solves global problems, to a space traveling asteroid miner from the Bermuda Wormhole dimension. Each player must &lsquo;Lawyer up&rsquo; their Billionaires to make them ready for battle with opposing Billionaires, while also playing Control Cards to influence their own and other players&rsquo; actions.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with a deck of 60 cards. Players may use one of the pre-built decks, or each player's deck may be customized before play begins. Trillionaire was designed from the start to be both highly customizable and strategic.&#10;&#10;There are four categories of cards which make up each deck:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cash Cards - Worth $100 Billion each, these cards are the heart of the game. If you successfully put 10 Cash Cards on the table, you may attempt to deposit them to win the game!&#10;     Billionaire Cards - These character cards serve as your front line to Sue and Bankrupt your opponents' Billionaires. Comes in &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Super&quot; varieties.&#10;     Lawyer Cards - These cards are attached to your Billionaire Cards, enabling them to Sue your opponents. Without them, your Billionaires wouldn't be able to do anything. Comes in &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Power&quot; varieties.&#10;     Control Cards - These cards help you control the game in your favor. Some involve greater risk, but have a greater reward.&#10;&#10;&#10;If players choose to customize their decks, they must follow certain rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are no more than 10 Star Cards allowed per deck. (Every card is either a Star Card or a Non-Star Card.)&#10;     Your deck must contain exactly 15 Cash Cards. &#10;     All players must have exactly 1 Veto Card in their deck.&#10;     Players may only have up to 3 of any card that is not a Cash Card, Standard Lawyer, or Veto card.&#10;&#10;&#10;Trillionaire can be played with a teammate (2 v 2) or as a free-for-all (up to 4 players).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "EverWyrd is a Dungeon crawling adventure roleplaying game where you become the hero(es) in a constantly changing world. Using map cards randomly drawn from the deck, you and your friends will create worlds of adventure, peril, and battle; more importantly, you will collect and horde wonderous treasures while questing your way across the land and towards legendary status.&#10;&#10;The 2020 update will include all-new, original artwork, different playable races, new cards, and an entirely new format. We will also have all creatures and example heroes as 2D print &amp; play miniatures.&#10;&#10;The world of EverWyrd had its origins with the Elves and Dwarves who forged a balance of work and life that allowed them to live in peace and harmony. The elves took the surface domains of Ral and Friijlant, while the dwarves toiled in the caverns and tunnels beneath Ashland Heights and Eryn. In order to survive, both learned the ways of the other, but only as a means to provide for each other. Thus, for thousands of years did they live in peace together; dwarves forging weapons and minting precious metals, the elves hunting, farming, and encouraging life to sustain and prosper above. &#10;All this would change with men. Seeking a better life - an easier life perhaps - man moved north, across the marshes from the land of Ibros, to live amongst the elves and dwarves. Both peoples were curious about men. Those creatures were notoriously greedy and often cruel to one another. Could they learn to live in peace as the elves and dwarves had done?&#10;&#219;&#157;   &#219;&#157;   &#219;&#157;&#10;Each side believing in their cause, each side using powerful magic that would corrupt the lands in which they fought. Their wars would drive the elves from the land of EverWyrd, with the exception of a small band who would become the Sidhe, the last of the elves born with magical abilities and skill to them. The Sidhe built a stronghold in Calus, deep in the forest at the base of great mountains and shunned the human race.&#10;The dwarves, who had made their home in the tunnels and caves underground found their homes collapsing from the heaving of the corruptions of magic. They tried in vain to fight against the power of the Warlocks, but they could not resist them. In the end, the dwarves died out or found safety in the more remote lands of EverWyrd, fearing their numbers would never recoup their loss. The dwarves, like the elves, would never be inclined to share with the human race again. From their icy tunnels in the Frigid Peaks, the dwarves watched man destroy itself.&#10;As the armies of men clashed, great warriors, powerful magic-users, and assassins from the shadow rose and fell in great numbers. Such it was that the humans destroyed themselves. Those who fought were killed however possible, and those who did not die ceased to fight. After years of carnage, so few were left that they finally agreed to end their battles. Practicing the dark power of NecoMagia was outlawed, save for a select few who studied relentlessly and proved their value to the councils. Wyrd, being the purest form of magic became revered and the power behind the thrones of EverWyrd would forevermore be that of the powerful witches and wizards that thrived. &#10;None recognized the damage they had done to the world itself. The tunnels and underground caves, the murky underworld of EverWyrd, had been forever transformed. Creatures that had never before existed now thrived in the corrupted magic left behind by the great war, and they became a threat to the people and other races that now sought to live their life on the surface of EverWyrd.&#10;&#219;&#157;   &#219;&#157;   &#219;&#157;&#10;Thus, does your story take place, a thousand years after that first group of men reached for a better life, only to find their future generations destroying everything they believed in. As man stretched its wings to discover the art of magic and use magic, so too did they actively destroy their own world. What lies beneath the ground for which thousands walk? Are you brave enough to find out? What other things might you learn if you delve into the reasons behind the thrones of EverWyrd? What magic, power, and riches might you discover if you&rsquo;re brave enough to dare?&#10;&#10;",

Each color is shared by three icons.&#10;&#10;The value of each card is the sum of the values of each icon set on the card and is displayed in the center of the card.&#10;&#10;The icon set values are as follows: Can=0; Joker=0; Beakers=5; Pencil=10; Bulb=15; Note=20; Star=25; Heart=30; Plane=35; Gear=40; Key=45; Fire=50.&#10;Play&#10;&#10;There is a core card for every icon. Every round of the game is started by placing a core card in the center of the playing surface. You can play just one round, or you can play multiple rounds, starting with a different core card each time. Choose it before distributing cards to the players.&#10;&#10;Deal five cards to each player. During your turn, play one card from your hand by matching the colors or icons with cards already played. If you just match the color(s), you can only count the value of the card you laid down. If you match the icon(s), you can count the value of your card plus the value of each card(s) where the icon(s) matched. All colors must match, except when a joker is played.&#10;&#10;If you play a core card during your turn, you can play another card during your turn to match it.&#10;&#10;After your play, you replenish your hand by drawing one card from the pile. If you play a core card and are able to match it with another card from your hand, you draw two cards.&#10;&#10;If you can&rsquo;t play or choose not to play during your turn, pick up one card from the pile.&#10;&#10;Jokers are wild. They can match any icon and each of the three Joker core cards can be used to match six cards at once. They have no point value when played, but make sure you play them, because their value switches to 100 points and count against your score if left in your hand.&#10;&#10;Record your score after each play. Keep playing until all the cards in the pile are drawn. Then play until someone has played all their cards or until no other play can be made. Each player then adds up the card values left in their hand and subtracts the sum from their score.&#10;&#10;If you play multiple rounds, you can add the scores from each round to determine the winner. Or, you can treat each round separately, award a point to the player with the highest score for each round, and the winner is the player who won the most rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Horse &amp; Matchlock is the prologue to Horse &amp; Musket: Dawn of an Era. This volume will cover warfare from 1618-1682, when the armies of Europe shifted from heavy pike formations to linear lines of musketeers. Warfare moved towards firepower, although firepower was curbed by the limitations of the matchlock musket. In addition, bayonets were rare and the pike was the infantry's best defense against cavalry. It was also the last time in this era that religion was a major factor in the causes and ferocity of European warfare. The volume includes battles from the Thirty Years War, Franco-Spanish War, English Civil Wars, The Fronde, Franco-Dutch War, and Scanian War.&#10;&#10;The scenarios include...&#10;&#10;White Mountain - November 8, 1620 &ndash; Last Stand of the Bohemian Revolt&#10;&#10;Wimpfen - May 6, 1622 &ndash; Slow Grind to Victory&#10;&#10;Fleurus    - August 29, 1622 &ndash; &quot;Altera Restat&quot;&#10;&#10;Lutter am Barenberge - August 17, 1626 &ndash; Tilly&rsquo;s Greatest Victory&#10;&#10;Breitenfeld - September 17, 1631 &ndash; Gustav II Adolf&rsquo;s Masterpiece&#10;&#10;L&uuml;tzen - November 17, 1632 &ndash; &ldquo;I was the King of Sweden.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Edgehill - October 23, 1642 &ndash; &ldquo;For God and King Charles!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Rocroi - May 19, 1643 &ndash; El Ultimo Tercio&#10;&#10;First Newbury - September 20, 1643 &ndash; Essex&rsquo;s Finest Hour&#10;&#10;Cheriton - March 29, 1644 &ndash; &ldquo;The best shifter and chooser of ground.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Marston Moor - July 2, 1644 &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;he will fight, whatever comes of &lsquo;t!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Aberdeen - September 13, 1644 &ndash; The Craibstane Rout&#10;&#10;Auldearn - May 9, 1645 &ndash; Slaughter on Garlic Hill&#10;&#10;Naseby - June 14, 1645 &ndash; &ldquo;Will you go upon your Death?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Kilsyth - August 15, 1645 &ndash; Slaughter Howe&#10;&#10;Lens - August 20, 1648 &ndash; The Peace of Westphalia&#10;&#10;Worcester - September 3, 1651 &ndash; The Royal Oak&#10;&#10;The Dunes - June 11, 1658 &ndash; The Tides of Battle&#10;&#10;Sinsheim - June 16, 1674 &ndash; Turenne Invades the Palatinate&#10;&#10;Seneffe    - August 11, 1674 &ndash; Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s Last Bloody Hurrah&#10;&#10;Lund - December 4, 1676 &ndash; Return of the King&#10;&#10;Landskrona - July 14, 1677 &ndash; The Sm&aring;l&auml;ndska Peasantry Wins the Day&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;NOTE: This game&rsquo;s title is actually Horse &amp; Matchlock.

    "Description": "Beyond the great river Mississippi, where a part of your nation has gone, your father has provided a country large enough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass grows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours for ever.&#10;&#10;President Andrew Jackson&#10;&#10;As Long as the Grass Grows is a card driven board game depicting the Conquest of the American West from the Texas Annexation of 1845 to the surrender of Sitting Bull in 1881. At the start of each turn a President card is drawn and resolved, to determine the policies of the new administration, foreign affairs, and gold rushes. The players draw Action cards, make agreements, and play their cards as Events or for Action Points so they can move, raid, and fight with troops of cavalry and infantry, or tribal warbands. The United States Player wins by protecting pioneer trails, upgrading them to railroads, civilising tribes, and seizing control of territories, particularly those with pioneers and gold. The Great Plains, Northwestern, and Southwestern Tribal Players win by resisting the westward advance of the United States, maintaining control their homelands, and avoiding the Reservation for as long as possible.&#10;&#10;Includes&#10;&#10;&#10;     Scenarios for 1845-57, 1857-69 and 1869-81, which can be combined into campaign scenarios.&#10;     Two player alternate history game with no US player.&#10;     108 Event cards including Generals, Chiefs, Pioneers, Gold Rushes, and Epidemics.&#10;     10 President Cards representing every president from 1845 to 1881, reflecting the policy of their administration.&#10;     Buffalo, Gold, Massacre, Trail, Peace Chief, and War Chief markers.&#10;     California, Oregon, Mormon, Bozeman, Smoky Hill, Santa Fe, Old Spanish, and Goodnight-Loving Trails allow rapid movement across the continent, may be raided by local tribes, and upgraded to railroads.&#10;     Control of territories by the British, Mexicans, Mormons, Texans, CSA, USA, and Tribes.&#10;     Variable victory conditions, increasing for the US and decreasing for Tribal Factions as the game proceeds.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Kingdom Builder, the players create their own kingdoms by skillfully building their settlements, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.&#10;&#10;By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.&#10;&#10;Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map! Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;All in one box, the Family Box includes the base game, the Nomads expansion, materials for a 5th player and 2 Queenies (The Caves &amp; The Capitol).&#10;&#10;",

They are Elon Musk, and can only babble random words (eg if problem is kids stuck in flooded cave - players say things like &quot;robot divers&quot;, &quot;cave drill&quot;, &quot;waterproof bats&quot;. The player who is Elon says &quot;ipod submarine&quot; or &quot;space roadster&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has had a pitch the players try to figure out who - if anyone - is Elon Musk.

The Sensei is a trainer that you can customize with bonuses or even break the rules.  The trainers are the majority of your workers and they will build your dojo and train your champions.  Champions are workers that are placed in competitions - forms, breaking, and weapons - that when resolved, will earn you victory points.  You can add more trainers and more champions to your dojo, but you will first have to start training them as students in your dojo.&#10;&#10;Tableau&#10;     Champions - players are able to customize up to three champions.  Their basic stats - Strength, Finesse, and Mastery.  As well as use trainers, to give their champions new maneuvers.

These tiles will give you actions and bonuses in the game.  Here you can decide if you want to focus on income, on building strong champions, on performances, on specific competitions, and many more.&#10;&#10;Every play of Dojo Sensei will be different.  The goals you are reaching for to end the game will change, the tiles available to build your dojo will be different every turn.  The maneuvers that are available in the temples to train your champions will be different. In order to win you will need to both focus on how you will bring honor to your dojo, but also be flexible enough to react to your opponents and the conditions on the main board.&#10;&#10;",
