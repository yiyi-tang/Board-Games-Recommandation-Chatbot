This expansion includes the units, rules, and scenarios that gamers need to recreate the desperate struggles on the Russian steppe, ruins of Stalingrad, and partisan-infested woodlands.&#10;&#10;Command Soviet heavy tanks, such as the KV-1, SU-152, and JS-2. Brew up hapless T34 tanks with your incredible King Tiger. Use the Soviet Guards to lead counterattacks in the city, and the new German Pioneers to retake lost ground. Ambush German convoys with Partisans and whip cowards back into line with Commissars.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s armor includes T-34/76, T-70 T-34/85, JS-2, KV-1, SU-76, SU-85, SU-152, King Tigers,A Soviet 76mm ATG prepares to take on a German King Tiger German Halftracks, and Sd 222 armored cars. Infantry additions consist of Guards (two flavors), Line Soviets (again, two types), Partisans, Commissars, Nurses, veteran German infantry, German Pioneers, Molotov Cocktails, DP-28, 45mm and 76mm Anti-tank guns, 82mm mortars, and 12.7mm machine guns.&#10;&#10;The hex halos have been seriously tuned down. 255 die cut counters and three, mounted geomorphic mapboards.&#10;&#10;Not One Step Back is not a complete game.

Unfortunately, some of the world's great monsters that had been captured and placed in this boat as part of the liner's entertainment - a giant ape, a vampire, a fish-man, a wolf-man, a mummy and a man-monster - roam free now that their cages have been broken. It's up to the stalwart heroes who captured these creatures the first time, to take them down permanently. And they have to do it amongst, fleeing passengers, unsuspecting maidens and frantic crew. Oh, and before this ship sinks.&#10;&#10;This game was the winner of a &quot;Monster-Themed Design Contest&quot; that Z-Man Games held on the Board Game Designer's Forum.&#10;&#10;",

His dictionary is widely considered a milestone in the history of Catalan language, as for the first time modern linguistic ideas were introduced in the grammar.&#10;&#10;In the game the players together rebuild Pompeu Fabra's life and works, as well as the various social, cultural and political events that took place during his life: from his birth in Barcelona in 1868 until his death in exile at Prada de Conflent (France) in 1948. Each year in the life of Pompeu Fabra is represented by a card, and the players try to fill in the holes in the chronology, which in the initial setup is formed only by four years. The filling rules are simple and the players receive points each time a grouping of three, six or nine cards is completed.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To setup, you shuffle the Referee's cards and place in a pile, face down. Players determine which side of the board will be HOME and which is VISTORS. Play begins with a jump ball in the center circle. Players spin until both arrows point to the same team (innermost circle) to determine the Offensive player. The ball will move in the direction of their target basket. Offense player spins again and places the ball in the color position on the Court matching the color indicated by the arrow. Players both spin reading the numbers on the outer edge of the spinners. Ball movement will occur based on the numbers spun by both Offense and Defense. The possible outcomes are: the ball moves in the direction of the error on the board, ball is intercepted, ball is stolen, or a basket is made. If Defense ever spins a 4, the Offense picks up a Referee card and follows it instructions. Player is allowed 3 spins for a free throw shot.&#10;&#10;Players determine length of time by agreement on time limit or number of points.&#10;&#10;",

The player in lane #1 spins and moves that many spaces forward on the track, followed by the car in lane #2, and so on. To change lanes, the car moves sideways (not diagonally) on the track. If a player spins or lands on a &quot;Draw Card&quot; space, they draw a card from the &quot;PIT&quot; deck and follows the directions. To overtake another car, players must drive around the car ahead unless their spin lands them directly on the same space. In this case, the overtaken car moves back one space and the passing car takes their position. Use the score pad to track the number of laps. After 6 laps, the game ends and the winner is the first car to pass the finish line.&#10;&#10;",

In terms of Commands and Colors performance, the medium infantry units (representing less experienced legions) and heavy infantry units (representing the veteran legions) will now be able to move two hexes without engaging in close combat, or still move one hex and have close combat (as well as throwing their pilum - a capability acquired in Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Rome vs the Barbarians). You will be able to fight battles with medium and heavy infantry as you have never fought them before!&#10;&#10;Rules-wise, if you've played Commands & Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the few special rules for these legionary infantry units, for the basic mechanics remain unchanged. The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.&#10;&#10;But that's not all... GMT is also going to include another mounted mapboard in Expansion #3, configured to be mated to the mounted board from Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Rome vs the Barbarians.

    "Description": "In Ruby Rush, the players represent prospectors trying to cash in on a sudden up-cropping of rubies in the nearby landscape, while deterring the opposition.&#10;&#10;The deck is 26 cards, and every card has a ruby value.  Most of the cards are action cards that allow players to &quot;Dig&quot; up more cards, steal from other players, etc.  Being too greedy can result in a cave-in, eliminating the player from the game.  When the deck is exhausted, the remaining players total their rubies, and the highest value wins; or if all but one player is eliminated, that player wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The skill sets involved are risk management, and to a lesser degree, card-counting and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Game rules include a variant for 4-5 players with the addition of another set of cards with the same game play.&#10;&#10;",

Waves are stacked upon each other, ships cannot jump over other ships. Movement is determined by the number of waves and playing pieces on the starting space, but a wave must be left back at every crossed space during a move. In this way, the waves shift constantly over the sea giving a really floating sea feeling.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player who has earned a previously fixed amount of gold pieces the first.&#10;&#10;",

When one player has rid himself of all cards in his hand, the other players add up the points left in their hands and another round is dealt.  Play continues until all players but one have passed 50 points.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is Toy Story, and each number card, 1-10, features a picture (drawing) of one of the Toy Story characters.  Buzz Lightyear cards are wild cards and can represent any number (but, if left in your hand, count for 11 points each).  This game would be best for children in early grade school, as they develop their basic math skills.  The suggested age of 7+ is pretty accurate, although enjoyment of the game will depend greatly upon the player's math skills.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Rules&#10;This game was devised to enable the therapist to learn about the underlying psychological processes of such children, in a way that is non-threatening. It utilizes the vehicle of the standard game--so universally appealing to children--and the elicitation of responses via token reinforcement. The game has proved helpful in shortening the therapeutic process--not only because it provides the therapist with information earlier than he would have otherwise obtained it, but also because it facilitates the child's freeing himself enough to reveal his previously suppressed and repressed thoughts, feelings, and actions. The game can be useful in both individual and group psychotherapy with children. And even the child who will engage in direct discussion, psychoanalytic inquiry, and fantasy play can find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience. It is most useful in treatment of children between the ages of four (children younger than that cannot usually  play board games) and twelve (the adolescent will often consider the game &quot;babyish&quot;).&#10;&#10;IMPORTANT NOTICE&#10;Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game was designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children. Accordingly , every reasonable attempt is made to limit the sale and distribution of the game to such professionals. Use of the game by parents with their own children is therapeutically contraindicated. Most parents are not trained to provide appropriate therapeutic responses to the cards. And even those who are, are not likely to have the objectivity with their own children that is necessary for optimum utilization of the game. Lastly, such play with parents will compromise the child's use of the game with his or her therapist.&#10;&#10;",

Any empathetic adult (parent, teacher, counselor, etc.) can assist children to effectively identify, express, and manage their anger. Although anger is a natural emotion in response to conflict situations, it can jeopardize relationships if it is not communicated effectively and appropriately.&#10;&#10;Typically, people react inappropriately to anger in one of two ways. The first is by overreacting to conflict situations by becoming verbally and/or physically explosive to others after allowing anger to build up. Secondly, a person may react to anger by internalizing their frustration with a conflict situation which often results in physiological or emotional symptoms of stress.&#10;&#10;The Anger Solution Game  was developed through the integration of a psycho-educational approach with cognitive behavioral intervention modality. The main goal is to help the client to understand that he/she has control over behavioral responses to anger and that he/she can make choices which can result in positive solutions.&#10;&#10;",

We assume that when children value themselves they will not only be happier, but will develop a strong sense of self. A strong identity will in turn be a resource for them to draw on as they meet the many challenges of growing up. Mental health professionals almost universally agree that lack of self-esteem can be a significant factor in a host of childhood disorder from depression to under-achievement to anti-social behavior.&#10;&#10;The Dinosaur's Journey to High Self-Esteem reflects this multi-dimensional understanding of self-esteem. As children advance along the game board they draw cards which ask them to think about their values, friendships. ability to understand themselves and others, and their resources in meeting life's common problems. Each card presents a unique opportunity for a child to think and experience the building blocks of self-esteem.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box and the game rule book:&#10;&#10;Right Off The Bat - a baseball game that required no skill because all plays would be determined by the roll of the dice.  An accurate and exciting game that could be played anytime, anywhere, with any teams of your choice, past or present - that produced its own realistic statistics.&#10;&#10;You begin the game with the visiting team up first.  Each shake of the dice represents a pitch.  Proceed around the game board until there are three outs.  Leave your game piece on the 3rd out of each inning as you will begin from whatever space your third out is for the rest of the game.  Keep track of each man's at bats, balls, strikes, outs, hits, etc., and enter the total hits, runs, and errors, (if any), of each inning in the designated innings on the score card.  The Home Team does the exact same thing in the bottom of each inning.  Be sure to remove all base runners left on base at the end of each teams ups.  As in real baseball, the game is played for nine innings to determine a winner of the game.  If the Home team is ahead after 8 1/2 innings of play, the Home team wins and does not bat in the bottom of the 9th.&#10;&#10;In the game rule book, there are 3 versions of game play that can be played from this gameboard.&#10;Basic version is approximate 30 minutes playing time.&#10;Intermediate version is approximate 30-60 minutes of playing time.&#10;Advanced version is approximate 60-90 minutes of playing time.&#10;There are also optional variations of play with each version.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a nice little solitaire freebie from daVinci, in which you try to make it from the church steps to the cemetery gate. (Un)Naturally, up to 12 zombies and 2 zombie dogs try to stop you!  You move faster than they do (except for the dogs), and have one whole bullet available, but the undead keep popping up all over the board.  Worse, if you do finally reach the gate, you may find it blocked, and have to spend movement points clearing the way.&#10;&#10;The game is available at: http://www.davincigames.it/giocarea_eng/18/dagiocare.htm&#10;&#10;Warning: the rules are in &quot;Engrish&quot; and almost incomprehensible.  I will put my translation in the files section.&#10;&#10;",
