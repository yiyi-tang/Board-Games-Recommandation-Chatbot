    "Description": "The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.&#10;&#10;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&#10;&#10;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!&#10;&#10;",

The races of a neighboring solar system have a penchant for artifacts left behind by extinct races. In Excavation Earth, you lead one of these races of alien explorers on their quest to excavate rare human artifacts and curate the ultimate art collection to sell off.&#10;&#10;Excavation Earth is divided into three rounds, each of which starts with players drafting a hand of multi-use cards that will be used to perform actions. Players then take quick turns playing actions that allow them to move their explorers around the world map, excavate for artifacts, and deploy traders to bazaars and influencers to affect prices and wheel and deal on the black market.&#10;&#10;The artifacts you dig up can be either sold to the bazaars housed on one of the aliens' ships that landed on Earth or added to a collection that will be sold off as a coherent art collection to museums back home. Excavation Earth ends after three rounds and the player who makes the most money during the game wins.&#10;&#10;Excavation Earth includes a solo mode by Nick Shaw and D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card for the first set depicting an American SPAD XIII.&#10;&#10;The rulebook is the same as Wings of War: Famous Aces and it lists scenarios for each of the two boxes, plus a couple for players who own both of them.&#10;&#10;18 airplane cards are for immediate use. A curious plane, useful for more variated scenarios, is the Nieuport 11 of the German Jasta 1, flown in action by Leutnant Gustav Leffers. In the box there are also a few weapon variants for owners of &quot;Famous aces&quot;: Scaroni's and Fucini's HD.1 with twin machineguns instead of the single one that was the standard from the factory; a British DH4 with a twin machinegun in the rear arc; a DH4 of the American Expeditionary Force with twin machineguns both on the forward and on the rear arc.&#10;&#10;",

Players use resources gained in the countryside to build buildings, trade, and craft valuable commodities &mdash; the value of which varies as ships come and go from the harbor.&#10;&#10;In the city, players gain access to actions, with each spot representing the three actions that surround it. This simple worker placement gives way to a deep engine-building mechanism as not only will building around production spaces utilize the houses you've already built in the countryside, but building near other player's houses will re-activate them, giving other players valuable opportunities outside of their turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends once players have placed all their houses. The player with the most points from all sources wins.&#10;&#10;",

Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of courageous (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon&rsquo;s lair...&#10;&#10;Legends say that the doors of Dragonfire Dungeon open every sunrise, welcoming brave adventurers into its depths. But once the sun sets, the doors close and seal the fates of those who lingered too long. Only a few have ever returned from Dragonfire Dungeon, and those who have usually come back near death. But they return as heroes nonetheless.&#10;&#10;In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...&#10;&#10;While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, in DungeonQuest the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra&rsquo;s keep on your own!&#10;&#10;Great riches and everlasting glory await if you can survive Dragonfire Dungeon. The Dragonlord Kalladra has challenged all heroes of Terrinoth to test themselves against the most dangerous dungeon in all the realms.&#10;&#10;Dare you face the dragon&rsquo;s challenge?&#10;&#10;",

Based on the game system used in Wings of Glory (formerly Wings of War), Sails of Glory uses miniatures, cards and board game mechanisms, with a special deck of maneuver cards representing the different movement capabilities of each vessel. The game will be supported by a range of painted and assembled 1/1000 miniatures.&#10;&#10;Players will choose their maneuver cards in secret, then reveal them all at the same moment. The card features arrows to be put in front of the miniature, then the latter is moved on top of the arrowhead. Several options on the same card are available depending on the wind and, with advanced rules, the sails used. After all ships moved, guns are fired from the sides of the miniature to targets in range.&#10;&#10;The Wings of Glory game system has been modified and expanded to accurately represent battles at sea between the large sailing ships of the past centuries. The first series of Sails of Glory will be set in the Napoleonic Age. If the game is successful, in the future Sails of Glory will be extended to cover other historical periods, such as the Age of Discovery, the Middle Ages and ancient times.&#10;&#10;",

The task cards indicate how the spheres must be placed to earn points: for example, exactly two orange spheres must be on the tray, black and blue must touch each other, and blue must not touch white.&#10;&#10;Complete these tasks while racing against the timer. You get a point for each sphere you use and a bonus token for using all five colors, but you lose two points for each card you don't follow correctly.&#10;&#10;Prove to your opponents that you are the master of multi-dimensional thinking!&#10;&#10;",

Your objective is to knock down all your opponent's troops!&#10;&#10;Starting with the youngest player, choose your family: Chaufort or Cunningfields. Then, use your bricks to build a castle to fortify your troops. Using your catapult, launch boulders in an attempt to destroy your opponent's castle and knock over their troops. When all troops of one family are knocked over, the battle is over. The winning family must have at least one troop standing upright.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. During a round, starting with the youngest player, everyone takes a turn. Each player's turn is divided into four phases: Tactics, Aim, Fire and Cleanup. Perform these phases in order, finishing each one before moving to the next. When all players have had their turn, the round finishes. You keep on playing round after round until there is only one player with troops on the table.&#10;&#10;Warning! This is a game of construction/destruction of plastic bricks and figures...

In this tile placing game, players construct buildings that everyone can use to create materials, refine resources, earn money and make important deliveries to construct the Hamlet&rsquo;s big landmark - the Church.&#10;&#10;The game features irregular shaped tiles that connect together without a grid to form a village that is completely different every time. The tile placement organically creates interconnecting paths that the villagers use to transport resources across the village. This leads players to construct boards where no two games will ever feel the same. Since the buildings are communal, this also creates a fluid economy, where players are always working hard to provide the village with the resources that are most needed.&#10;&#10;The game is designed by David Chircop (Petrichor, The Pursuit of Happiness). It plays between 1 to 4 players, with a solo mode currently being developed. It will be published by award winning studio Mighty Boards (Excavation Earth, Posthuman Saga).&#10;&#10;",

Players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings, while placing a worker on a construction site costs money. Each building has four characteristics (carpentry, masonry, architecture, tilery) rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 10 ecu and an apprentice. Five workers and five buildings are placed face-up on the table, with the others set aside in separate decks. On a turn, you can take three free actions, then pay 5 ecu for each additional action. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Open a site - Take one of the five buildings, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Recruit a worker - Take one of the five workers, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Assign a worker to a building - Pay the cost of the worker (as he won't work for free!), then place him on a building; when the building's needs are met, you earn the points and coins indicated, then flip the building over. The workers return to your pool of available labor.&#10;    Get money - Forgo one, two or three actions to earn 1, 3 or 6 ecu.&#10;&#10;&#10;Some completed buildings join your labor pool as they can be used to complete other buildings. As soon as a player reaches 17 points, players finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then you tally points, with each completed card having a point value and each 10 ecu being worth 1 point.

The team-based play means you can win Honor even if you die, as long as your House prevails. Each round begins by drafting Ninja cards, and no role is strictly better than others. The deadliest cards are also the last to be played, and gathering information can be as valuable as assassinating another player.&#10;&#10;Night of the Ninja contains everything needed for up eleven players: 33 Ninja cards, 11 House cards, 11 Player standees, and 35 Honor tokens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subbuteo is a classic finger-flicking football-simulation action game.  It is played on a large cloth playing field called a &quot;pitch&quot;, with teams of miniature football players mounted on smooth round bases.  The football players are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes them to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball.  The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks.  There is even a large section in the rules devoted to fouling.&#10;&#10;Far more popular in European countries than in the United States, this game allows collectors to buy teams of football players representing dozens of teams and countries from around the world, along with soccer stadium enhancements such as stands filled with cheering fans, referees that stand on the sidelines, even stadium lights.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Capital Lux 2: Generations, a standalone sequel to the acclaimed tactical card game from 2016, introduces a range of exchangeable capital powers that can be mixed and matched as you like. This allows for a total of 256 unique power combinations. One of these combinations plays as the original Capital Lux, while the other 255 present the players new tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;The core of the game revolves around the following dilemma: Do you play character cards in your home base for points, or contribute them to the capital to benefit from their powers? At the end of a round, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your home base for any color than the current total value in the capital. Exceeding the limit makes you lose those cards. At the end of the third round, all cards remaining in your home base are worth points.&#10;&#10;The game therefore turns into an act of balancing on a razor's edge: Secure as many points for yourself without exceeding the capital's limit &mdash; always taking into account the current capital powers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mini Express is a strategic train game for 1 to 5 players in which you and other wealthy capitalists manage four railroad companies. Through careful planning and ruthless execution, players pioneer the western expansion of the 19th century, vying to be the most influential railroad baron and complete the transcontinental railroad.&#10;&#10;Mini Express is a sequel of sorts to Mini Rails in that on a turn each player takes one of the two available actions, although otherwise the games are not similar. Your action choices are to (1) lay track to expand a company's railroad or (2) take a stock from a company.&#10;&#10;To lay track, you take train pieces from the company's reservoir on the game board and place them one per hex to expand that company's network to a new city. When you do this, you gain influence in the goods that are in demand in that city. (The game includes four types of goods, and each type of good is the same color as one of the railroad companies.) Each city can have at most 1-3 companies enter it, and when that limit is reached, you remove the demand tile from the game. When you build into a hex (whether landscape or city), any other train companies in that hex gain a train in their reservoir (to represent them profiting from how your efforts affect that area).&#10;&#10;To take a stock, you must decrease your influence in that company equal to the number of trains in that company's reservoir. If you can't do so without going below zero, then you cannot take that stock.&#10;&#10;When all the shares have been claimed from two companies or two companies have no train pieces remaining, then you complete the round and the game ends. For each good/company, you multiple the number of shares you hold by a points multiplier that's based on how much influence you have in that good/company relative to other players. The higher your standing, the more valuable each of your shares will be. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players who win the election in each state can then &quot;control&quot; that state's army.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, players use cards to move their armies to attack or defend one of seven battles (each tied to a state, and you can't attack your own!) that are up for grabs that round.&#10;&#10;The gameplay mechanic is straightforward, with elements drawn from other Euro-style wargames (especially Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires). What makes Perikles unique is the smooth integration of the area control/voting phase and the military phase.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;Together the Greek City States had defeated the greatest power in the world, the Persians.  Now, though, pride and envy have led them to fight amongst themselves in what we know today as the Peloponnesian War.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a powerful Greek family with political influence spread across the six major city states of ancient Greece.  Players strive to become leaders of these cities, thus taking control of their military forces.  With these forces players will aim to win glory on the battlefield.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They were tough times, the days when swords and magic still ruled the world. A long, destructive war had ended, and the entire continent had been unified. Before the empire's subjects had even come to know peace, however, their great emperor fell victim to disease, having never declared a successor...&#10;&#10;We must not return to that war-torn world! Thankfully you are an influential figure in the empire. Quickly lay claim to the throne and ensure the rock-solid unity and peace of the continent. Though the emperor had no son, there are seven candidates for succession, starting with the two lineal princesses. Now, let's get your favorite princess on the emperor's throne! Garner support from all over the country, clash with rival candidates and depend on your special skill!&#10;&#10;Heart of Crown is a deck-building card game. Each player starts with the same deck, strengthens that deck with strategic cards, and finally one player will declare victory by throning the princess he controls. Each player's deck starts with seven &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards and three &quot;Apprentice Handmaid&quot; succession cards (an unreliable subject). Using the currency (coins) generated by your &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards, you incorporate cards from the market into your deck according to your own strategy.&#10;&#10;Each player's main goal is to give the princess he's fielded the throne. First, collect stronger territory cards such as &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; to increase your coins, and declare fielding a princess using these coins. There are five princesses and one set of twin princesses, totaling six princess cards. Each princess has special support abilities, but with only one of each, you need to be quick to field the right princess and get the support you need!&#10;&#10;For your princess to take the throne, you must collect Succession Points, which represent the support of your loyal subjects and influential figures in the empire. Once you control 20 Succession Points, you may declare a coronation. Your opponents get one more turn to interrupt your coronation, but if your points remain at or above 20 by your next turn, the coronation succeeds and your princess takes the throne!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;The 100 Years War was a pivotal event in medieval European history. In Warriors of God, Multi-Man Publishing and Game Journal Magazine have joined hands to bring a unique perspective to this conflict.&#10;&#10;As always, playability matched with historical accuracy has been achieved to a remarkable degree. Players move their leaders and units using a unique impulse game system that shows both the strategy and tactics of the period. The game also recreates the massive swings of fortune which were so much a part of the Hundred Years War.&#10;&#10;Even with such a simple and easily learned system, all the special rules necessary to give players a full feel for the period are here: archers, Joan of Arc, and much, much more.&#10;&#10;Warriors of God was designed by Makoto Nakajima, English development was by Adam Starkweather, with graphic design  by Mark Mahaffey and counter illustrations by Niko Eskubi.&#10;&#10;",

Each building has special rules as to how the dice can be placed, allowing many tactical possibilities with any roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;Each round ends when one player has placed his/her last die, and after 5 rounds (6 rounds with 2-3 players), the patricians are organized in their provinces, the senate cards are revealed, and the scores are totaled.

    "Description": "Fighting Formations is a fledgling series of games, which will focus on several battles of various individual formations during World War II. The first title in the series is &quot;Grossdeutschland Infantry Division.&quot; Future titles aren't yet set in stone but could be devoted to other famous divisions (Big Red One), Corps (Afrika Korps), regiments (442nd RCT), Commando troops, Ranger battalions, etc.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game is 75 meters per hex with turns representing about 5 minutes of real time. Units are squads, guns with their inherent crews, and individual vehicles. Platoons are also employed.&#10;&#10;The game has card Assets -- including such things as snipers, artillery, air support or demolitions -- but is not card-driven. It is also not the typical Igo-Yougo fare with a strict sequence of play. Instead, the base game engine is an impulse-type back and forth mechanic whereby the various Orders carry with them a certain cost in Initiative, with the person having the most Initiative at any given time being able to take the next action on the map.&#10;&#10;This first game has the following components:&#10;&#10;4 22&quot; x 34&quot; back-printed mapsheets&#10;5 countersheets&#10;55 cards&#10;24-page series rulebook&#10;48-page playbook&#10;an 8.5&quot; x 22&quot; track display&#10;several cardstock player aids&#10;dice: 2d6, 2d8, 2d10, 2d12 &amp; 2d20&#10;10 wooden cubes&#10;1 wooden pawn&#10;&#10;Fighting Formations FAQ&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Wealth of Nations, you take on the role of a national leader.  Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).&#10;&#10;Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.&#10;&#10;The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.&#10;&#10;There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.&#10;&#10;As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.  The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game, i.e., the player with the most valuable combination of Industries and money, is the winner.&#10;&#10;How will you build your Nation?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hamburg is a card game in which each card has five different uses, and players must cleverly choose the best use for each one, all while avoiding disasters and racing for different objectives.&#10;&#10;In the game, players act as mayors of the city of Hamburg in the late 19th century. The game is played over eight rounds. At the beginning of the round, six colored dice are rolled, with players receiving a threat marker in the color of any die that rolls a 5 or 6. The black die is a &quot;wild&quot; threat, with players drawing a threat token with one of the other threat types hidden on the back. If a player ever has three of one type of threat, they receive a penalty.&#10;&#10;Next, players have the opportunity to pay a number of coins (equal to the pips on all dice&#10;showing a 1 or 2) to advance on the mayor's track. The black die also activates the clergy in St.&#10;Michael's Church, which serves as a round counter and awards points for certain building types at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players play five cards from any of five stacks of cards, one for each of the five colors in the game. These cards are in thirteen categories, each representing a different location around Hamburg, with seventeen individual cards within each category. Each card in a player's hand may be used for a number of purposes, including building the city wall, activating boats (if a 3 or 4 is rolled), starting a building plot, and constructing a building (card) on the plot, with this building granting a new ability or endgame scoring condition.&#10;&#10;Players receive points for various accomplishments during the game. In addition, they may receive bonus points by being the only player to have achieved one of five conditions for that round. Whoever scores the most points after eight rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Hamburg is a reimplementation of Bruges, including The City on the Zwin and Pets expansions and some new content, with some moderate rules enhancements.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Ohne Furcht und Adel, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, each player secretly chooses one of the eight characters. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can either earn gold or draw two building cards and discard one, then optionally construct one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Erecting buildings costs gold. At the end of the game, each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The 2012 release of Ohne Furcht und Adel includes fifteen cards not included in the original base game, with seven different types of action cards. These cards are mixed into the building card deck, and one action can be played each turn. Action cards in hand are worth one point at the end of the game. The cards, their actions and their counts are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     (x2) Wahrsagerin (Fortune Teller)  &ndash; Look at an opponent's hand and take one of their cards.&#10;     (x2) Direktor (Director)  &ndash; Build up to two more buildings this turn.&#10;     (x2) Rasputin   &ndash; Negate an assassination.&#10;     (x1) Akrobatin (Acrobat)  &ndash; If there is no king this round, take the crown.&#10;     (x3) Kassenwagen (Ticket Booth)  &ndash; Once per turn, the active player may place one gold on this card to draw two cards and keep one. You may trash this card to gain all gold on it.&#10;     (x2) Lebende Kanonenkugel (Living Cannonball)  &ndash; Replace one of your buildings with a more expensive one from your hand, paying the difference.&#10;     (x3) Zirkuszelt (Circus Tent)  &ndash; You may build this, which counts as a zero point building without color that the Warlord cannot destroy.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 500 BC, Ionia rebelled against Persia's rule and Greece supported it. With this &quot;foreign interference&quot; as an excuse, the Persian empire decided to invade Greece. In 492 BC the Persian forces attacked Macedonia from land and sea. The Persians and the Greeks fought fiercely at Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis. Against the overwhelming forces of the Persian empire, the Greeks used superior tactics and &quot;weapons&quot; such as hoplites (heavy infantry) and triremes. The Greeks had also excellent leaders in times of crises and eventually prevailed over the Persians.&#10;&#10;300: Earth &amp; Water is a wargame for two players. One player controls the Greeks, gathered around the Athenians, and the other controls the Persians, fighting for the hegemony of the eastern Mediterranean. Through all five expeditions, each player aims to control more cities than their opponent.&#10;&#10;The game engine is a &quot;card driven&quot; system. Players raise armies and buy cards during production. Cards can be used to play an event or move an army or fleet. Events can provide advantages in battles or interfere with the enemy, but military action is paramount to win. Moreover, each game will change dramatically according the order the events occur.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple and the playing time is short, but both Greece and Persia have a wide range of strategies, so victory will challenge both players.&#10;&#10;",

It's time to join the factions of Bone, Flesh and Spirit as they work to achieve the goal of the Underworld: to gather enough forces to take on the celestials of Heaven and Hell to end their ceaseless war. If the players work diplomatically in Court of the Dead: Mourners Call to maintain a balance, they can ensure the Underworld survives long enough for them to also complete their collective and hidden individual objectives. The player who best contributes to these goals will earn Death's favor and a place among the elite of the Underworld.&#10;&#10;You are a Mourner &mdash; an allegiant of Death &mdash; dedicated to realizing his noble ambition to end the celestial war and restore balance to the universe. However, Death's purpose includes your own ulterior motives. You and your fellow Mourners must unite and rise, or fall together. But only one Mourner will achieve their particular vision of the Underworld united. Your task will not be easy. While the Underworld is united in its purpose, it is divided in its strategy to achieve that aim. There are three factions in the Land of the Dead: Bone, Flesh, Spirit. Each is a unique path to rise up against Heaven and Hell.&#10;&#10;You will need to strategically manipulate your influence within these factions, their strongholds and guilds, and within the Court of the Dead if you wish to achieve your ends. But beware: The power within mortal souls &mdash; known as Etherea &mdash; is a perilous substance. Use it carelessly, and you risk invoking the Dreadsgrip - a destructive force within every Mourner that consumes all it touches, including its former master. Failing to satiate the celestials&rsquo; war need, or triggering the Dreadsgrip, has dire consequences for all Mourners. Are you strong enough to achieve your own ambitions and be the champion for the uniting force for which all Mourners Call?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Mandala Stones, you use artists to collect colorful stones in towers that you then score.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, randomly place the 96 stones &mdash; 24 each in four colors and 48 each in two patterns &mdash; on the main board in stacks of four. Place the four artist pillars in their starting locations among these stone stacks.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either pick stones or score stones. To pick, move an artist to a new location, then collect all stones adjacent to this artist that (1) bear the same pattern as that artist and (2) are not adjacent to another artist. Choose one of these stones to be first in a tower, then stack the other collected stones on top of this foundation one in clockwise order, then place this tower on an empty space on your player board.&#10;&#10;To score, choose to remove either (1) a color that appears on the top stones of at least two towers on your player board or (2) any number of top stones on your player board. In the latter case, you score 1 point for each removed stone. In the former case, you score points for each removed stone depending on the scoring condition for that space on your player board, which might be based on the height of that stone in a tower or the number of colors in that tower or the height of all towers on your board. Place all removed stones on the shared central mandala, building from the inside out and possibly scoring points depending on the spaces that you cover.&#10;&#10;If a player can neither pick nor score OR if a stone placed on the central mandala covers the game-ending space based on the number of players in the game, complete the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. Each player can then score one of two secret objective cards in their hand, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. &#10;By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms.&#10;&#10;Successors is a 2-5 player card-driven wargame based on those wars.&#10;&#10;Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. &#10;Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. &#10;Then Successors III, built on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards, appeared in the Boardgamer.&#10;&#10;The fourth edition of Successors includes more generals, more scenarios, new Tyche cards, plenty of new components, and a changed map, with Libya and Cyrene being merged.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore the seas! Catan: Junior introduces a modified playing style of the classic Settlers of Catan, giving players as young as five a perfect introduction to the Catan series of games.&#10;&#10;Catan: Junior takes place on a ring of islands where 2 to 4 players build hideouts and encounter the mysterious Spooky Island, where the Ghost Captain lives. Each island generates a specific resource: wood, goats, molasses or swords, and players can acquire gold. Each player starts with two pirate hideouts on different islands, and they can use the resources they acquire to build ships, hideouts or get help from Coco the Parrot. By building ships, they can expand their network; the more hideouts they build, the more resources they may receive. Just watch out for the dreaded Ghost Captain!&#10;&#10;Be the first player to control seven pirate hideouts, and you win!&#10;&#10;What sets this apart from the previous Die Siedler von Catan: Junior from 2007:&#10;&#10;    This game is playable with two as it comes with a two-player map.&#10;    The three- and four-player map is larger and is more symmetrical, so that two of the colors don't operate at a disadvantage.&#10;    The map now shows die faces rather than numbers for resource production.&#10;    Many of the event cards have been removed to make the game simpler.&#10;    There are no cards in the game only tiles for more durability.&#10;    There are no longer harbors in the game. In the original game you had to set up the board with random secret harbor tiles that allow for better trades with the bank. Now the trading to the bank is simpler and can be done from the beginning and doesn't require people to build to the harbors.&#10;    The resources are different.&#10;    There is a race for the Coco the Parrot tiles (rather than 'CoCo Helps' cards) and those that have the most get to put an extra piece on the board (one step closer to winning), tied players take their piece off the island and leave it vacated.&#10;    The market is now a part of the board, and can be traded into only once on your turn&#10;    By default, Trading with other players is excluded and only part of the &quot;advanced game&quot;.  In Die Siedler von Catan: Junior trading with other players could be excluded to simplify the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;As in Die Siedler von Catan: Junior you can't chain ships; you must build a pirate lair before continuing on.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wise One, immortal keeper of wisdom and knowledge, has sent Demigods endowed with earth-moving power to the far reaches of humanity. In Oros each player acts as one of these Demigods. They must instruct their Followers in the wisdom of the mountains through study, worship, and experience. And only in the heights of the mountains can the greatest mysteries be known.&#10;&#10;Oros is a tile-colliding, volcano erupting, mountain-making, wisdom-gathering, action-economy strategy game. On individual player mats, players move their Followers between action spaces, allowing them to manipulate a shared environment like a giant puzzle of plate tectonics. Action spaces allow players to shift rows of land, move and collide land tiles, form and erupt volcanoes, worship to gain wisdom, journey their Followers around the ever-shifting landscape, and build sacred places of study and worship on mountains. Building sacred places and worshipping in sacred places brings wisdom which is used to improve the abilities available for each action space. Wisdom is also used to improve the end game value of each sacred place built as well as reach other goals worth end game points.&#10;&#10;When building sacred places, the Demigods of the Wise One ascend a ziggurat which acts as a timer toward the end of the game. When one reaches the top, players finish the round and then tally a final score.&#10;&#10;At the core of Oros is the unique ability to shift, move, build up, erupt, and reposition the land within an infinitely connected play environment. This mechanic turns every action into a puzzle of creative problem solving, abstract thinking, and a constantly evolving strategy. Another chief aspect of the game is the player mat which uses a minimal worker placement mechanic to govern action opportunity. The mat also maintains an action economy that evolves differently for each player as they invest their gained wisdom into a variety of action improvements. Because of these core aspects, there are dozens of strategies for players to explore, and every game plays out in a different, yet competitive way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Oltre Mare - Merchants of Venice is an engaging voyage through the Mediterranean Sea, in the golden Age of Sail.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;On his or her turn, the player can trade Goods (corn, wine, spices, silk, etc.) for other Goods or for money (which also double as points) with fellow players. He or she then plays cards from his/her hand to perform certain actions that allow you to earn money, to draw cards, or to move your ship on the map (where you can obtain special powers).

The more cards of the same Good type shipped, the more money (and score) you will gain at the end of the game. The cards played will also influence the next turn, so choose your strategy well.&#10;&#10;In order to win, you have to trade wisely, choose the right cards to perform the best actions, and maximize the profit from your ship's cargo!&#10;&#10;The original version from Mind the Move is a small blue box.

There is no farming equivalent. Faction symbols (Empire, Rebel Alliance and Bounty Hunters) provide scoring bonuses regardless of what faction your Meeples belong to. Majority control is determined by dice rolling with the highest result rather than the sum determining the winner, although tiebreaks and defeats still provide some points. A player receives dice equal to the number of his Meeples involved in the majority control plus an additional one for using his large Meeple and one for any matching Faction symbols but this is always capped at three dice. One notable change is that Planets can be conquered by placing tiles adjacent to the Planet tile where the player now has the options of placing a Meeple on the adjacent Planet tile or on the tile he placed.&#10;&#10;There is also a four player team variant where it is the two Empire colours (black/Darth Vader and white/Storm Troopers) versus the two Rebel Alliance colours (red/Luke Skywalker and green/Yoda). Orange/Boba Fett is not used.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Traditional German card game for three players played with a standard card deck (2-6 removed), roughly 200 years old. The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.&#10;&#10;A play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If the solo player wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on &#10;&#10;     type of game announced&#10;     combination of Jacks&#10;     margin of winning (score 90+: &quot;schneider&quot;; take all tricks: &quot;schwarz&quot;)&#10;     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played &#10;     (optional) open play of cards&#10;     (optional) play with the initial hand (&quot;hand&quot; play)&#10;     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 (&quot;Kontra&quot;); re-doubling *4 (&quot;Re&quot;); unofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum&#10;     exception for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick (&quot;virgin&quot;), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied (&quot;geschoben&quot;); a player may also try to &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).&#10;&#10;&#10;The solo player can choose between the following game modes:&#10;&#10;     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)&#10;     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)&#10;     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). &#10;&#10;&#10;Unofficial variants:&#10;&#10;     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraordinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.&#10;     Revolution (in three variants): basically a Null in open play, but the counter-players are allowed to exchange cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Skat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many unofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called &quot;trench rules&quot; later became officially sanctioned.&#10;&#10;The official tournament deck is a compromise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A STORYTELLING BOARD GAME SET IN THE 1970s COLD WAR ERA.&#10;&#10;SMERSH is a portmanteau of two Russian words that translates to &quot;Death to Spies.&quot;  It operated as a counter-intelligence agency by the Red Army during the 1940s. Despite having had a large number of paid employees, little was known about the agency until recently when Russia opened their archives.&#10;&#10;Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters,  and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game.  There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor.  The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance &amp; Flash Point).&#10;&#10;The game is able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book, which contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix to Tales of the Arabian Nights -  or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. The First Edition (2012) of the game came with the Encounter Cards as standard, and the Encounter Book as an optional add-on (although many copies did actually include the book). The Second Edition (2015) includes the Encounter Book as standard, with the Encounter Cards available to purchase from the publisher.&#10;&#10;",

Wake up early, hike deep into nature, and find your perfect spot. Some paintings sell for commissions, others you&rsquo;ll keep for yourself, but you&rsquo;re always going that extra mile to find inspiration.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;Over six days, players gain Renown by hiking to beautiful locations to paint landscapes, which they&rsquo;ll later sell. Each day, players choose a Planning Card, which allows them to travel through the Wilderness and paint (i.e., pick up Landscape Cards). At day&rsquo;s end, they can sell paintings to earn Renown (i.e., turn in Landscape Cards to gain Commission cards worth Renown). Players also earn Renown by completing Daily Goals and by possessing Landscape Paintings at game&rsquo;s end.&#10;&#10;GENERAL PLAY&#10;Each day starts with a simultaneous Planning Phase, followed by individual Trek Phases, and ends with a Clean Up Phase. After the sixth day, a final Scoring Phase occurs.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Planning Phase: Players draw three Planning Cards and select one for the day. This sets the time they'll leave (initiative) how far they can move, and how many paintings they can paint.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trek Phase: Based on when players started their hike, each player completes their Trek Phase. During their Trek phase, they'll move through the Wilderness, paint landscapes, and sell as commissions for Renown. There is also an end of turn check for the Daily Goal.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Clean Up Phase: Once all players have taken their Trek Phase, the Wilderness, Commission Cards, and Daily Goal are updated, and then the next day begins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT Games:)&#10;&#10;Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) &#10;    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) &#10;    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) &#10;    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) &#10;    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) &#10;    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) &#10;    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)&#10;&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.&#10;&#10;It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pente is an abstract strategy game.  Players place glass markers on intersections of a 19-by-19 grid (the same as in Go).  The object of the game is to get five of your own markers in a row (4 with more than 2 players) or capture five pairs of your opponent's pieces.  The first to do either wins.  Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. There are multiple variations of the game for greater challenge and complexity.  The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Timeline is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline Challenge incorporates the original mechanic of the series into progressive game track, of which players can move between 0-4 spaces per turn.  Players will have to make use of pre-determined time periods and guess where the incident depicted on the card occurred.  There are four different challenges, and they are played depending on the color of the game space of the lead player.  Additionally there are two further challenges which allow the two players at the back of the pack to catch up.  Although the game comes with its own cards, it can be integrated with any or all of the previous sets.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Waste Knights: Second Edition is a post-apocalyptic game of adventure and survival for 1-4 players inspired by cult classics of the post-apo movies and set in dystopian Australia destroyed by experiments of a powerful corporation. Each player becomes a rugged hero, travelling through the wasteland, facing unnatural weather and enemies forged in long-forgotten laboratories as well as experiencing adventures full of dramatic choices and disturbing characters.&#10;&#10;The game is adventure-based, with each Adventure branching out into a number of Plots revealed depending on the players&rsquo; narrative choices. Each plot offers unique game mechanics and stories that can be found in the Book of Tales &ndash; some of them are keyed to a particular adventure, some are generic, but all enable the players to immerse themselves in the setting and make decisions that change the world around them.&#10;&#10;Each knight (player) has 2 actions at their disposal, which basically enable them to travel around the continent in their Vehicle, explore the area for ever-dwindling Resources (Fuel, Ammo, Meds), or camp in order to repair their Gear and heal Wounds or Radiation. Each adventure additionally offers a number of unique Plot Actions that let the players affect the story and fulfill their goals.&#10;&#10;However, the heart of the game are stories. Each playthrough is based on an adventure found in the Guide. Some of them are co-op, others competitive, others still may end with the players grouping around different factions and forced to fight their former friends. The construction of each adventure offers lots of narrative choices guaranteeing high replayability and encompasses unique setup elements so that the basic game can be prepared quickly and the players can focus on the plot, not the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF SKYRIM!&#10;&#10;Before the Dragonborn came to Skyrim&hellip;.&#10;&#10;You are surviving members of the Blades, a legendary group who long protected the Empire of Tamriel! Abandoned by the empire, you must work together to thwart a plot that threatens the whole of Skyrim&#10;&#10;Build a unique character in the world of the Elder Scrolls. Choose between a Nord, Dunmer, Imperial, Altmer, Khajiit or Orsimer. Equip your character with a wide range of weapons, spells and armour. Travel across the Holds of Skyrim to places like Riften, Solitude, Falkreath and Whiterun. Attempt a huge range of evolving quests that change the game with each decision, Explore the wilderness. Gain side quests from mysterious characters. Delve into ancient ruins and tombs. Battle Draugr, Frostbite Spiders, Dragons, Dwemer Constructs and Daedra. The deeper you delve, the deadlier your foes will become. Gain experience and amazing treasures. Upgrade and enchant your gear. Level up your character with a wide range of unique skills and abilities. Play through six chapters of two huge campaigns spanning 25 years in the history of Skyrim in this endlessly replayable boardgame.&#10;&#10;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim &ndash;  The Adventure Game is a 1-4 player co-operative game of adventure and exploration across Skyrim. Players take the roles of heroes involved in epic quests, working together to defeat their enemies and exploring the vast expanse of Skyrim. You will be able to choose character miniatures like the Khajiit, Nord, or High Elf; plan your strategy with weapons or spells; and fight your way through forgotten mines, Draugr-infested tombs, or ancient Dwemer cities to find ancient treasures and increase your power.&#10;&#10;The players must keep an eye out as the threat increases across Skyrim as Dragons, Daedra, Trolls, and more roam the lands and wreak havoc across the holds. Players need to work together to keep the lands free, whilst balancing the demands of their most important quests.&#10;&#10;The base game is divided into two campaigns of three chapters each. The decisions the players make from their first turn have a distinct effect on the unfolding story and encounters, making the whole campaign experience different every time you play. You can even save your progress after each game and start the next chapter with the same character, equipment, and skills.&#10;&#10;With the numerous choices of characters, gear, magic, and skills matched with the many decisions each player makes through their quests, there are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay, with some stories not even seen based on your early decisions. The face of Skyrim can change during the game, impacting the course of the players' experience in subsequent chapters. At any time, the players can simply reset, choose another character and play style, make different choices, and experience things differently. Alternatively, pick a chapter that sounds fun and drop in to just play that adventure as a one-off.&#10;&#10;Key mechanics:&#10;&#10;A Living Board&#10;The game board represents the province of Skyrim. Players move their characters &mdash; represented by 32mm scale plastic miniatures &mdash; across the region, visiting Strongholds, exploring dungeons and meeting interesting characters as the story unfolds. But they are not the only ones there; roaming monsters appear, blocking roads and threatening the peace in Skyrim. Several game effects could lead to the fall of a Stronghold so players need to keep an eye on the state of unrest and the active dangers across the board.&#10;&#10;Customizable Characters&#10;There are no classes in Skyrim. Each character has a different starting innate ability and additional abilities that are unlocked as they learn specific skills, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are tied to a gameplay style. For example, even though Nords shine when they are developed with a focus on warrior skills and equipment, a player could decide to make their Nord a spellcaster, or a summoner, and still retrain midway through the game after finding an amazing sword they really want to use. Players can change their progression path mid-game, and enjoy many different play styles.&#10;&#10;Upgradeable Equipment&#10;There are plenty of equippable items: weapons, pieces of armor, trinkets, etc. Most of these items can be customized; by either Enchanting or Upgrading them in a Stronghold. When Upgrading or Enchanting an item, the player draws an Enchantment/Upgrade card, and slots it underneath the item, altering its properties. A piece of armor can be Upgraded so it becomes better against Heavy Attacks, for example, and it can also be Enchanted so it helps the character regenerate Stamina faster. When learning the Smithing and the Enchanting skills, the players get to draw more cards and choose between them, making the experience of customizing equipment richer and letting them focus on the playstyle they prefer. Furthermore, when playing in a group, one player can specialize their character in Enchanting or Smithing and upgrade all their allies' items by meeting in a Stronghold, adding another layer of cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;Quests in Cards&#10;The story in the game is told using Quest cards. Players draw Main Quests &mdash; those that push the narrative forward &mdash; and Personal Quests &mdash; side stories gained by exploring the vastness of the province of Skyrim. By completing or failing them, the story progresses. Many of these Quests give the players a choice at the end. This choice chains the Quest with a new one, creating a branching story that changes every time the game is played. Failing a quest doesn&rsquo;t mean losing the game; instead, failure often becomes another way of choosing. The cards are organized in a way in which, if a card is removed as a result of Quest being failed or a game effect is triggered, the next card will take its place, dramatically changing the story.&#10;&#10;Combat System&#10;With an assortment of weapons, ranging from daggers to bows, players will be able to engage in combat with dangerous enemies, whether they be in a dungeon or part of a questline. Each weapon and spell will inform the player what attacks it can perform and how much Stamina or Magicka they&rsquo;ll have to spend to use them. The player will roll the custom dice and attempt to overcome each weapon&rsquo;s specific Skill Tests; hitting with heavier weapons is bound to be harder than hitting with lighter weapons. Combat is fast, exciting, and deadly, although strategy is a key factor to success. Some enemies, in fact, will employ unorthodox tactics, including the ability to heal themselves or wear nearly impenetrable armors.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Crawling&#10;Players can visit increasingly dangerous caves, mines, tombs, ruins, and Dwemer cities across Skyrim. Dungeons are built with cards each representing a major threat in that area of the dungeon. It might be a terrifying Draugr or a surprise trap that, if you&rsquo;re lucky, one of the characters may be capable of disabling. As the characters level up, the lower-level adversaries are discarded, scaling the difficulty of the dungeons along with the player&rsquo;s level. The more you visit a certain type of dungeon, the more likely you will see its more fearsome denizens, albeit with better rewards!&#10;&#10;Cooperative&#10;The whole game is fully cooperative. Players are encouraged to discuss their strategies and to collaborate to advance in their own storylines. Each player will be following their own storyline, joining together at the end of each chapter, when their plots are woven together into an epic finale for the whole party. &#10;There are some situations where characters, even if they have the same overall goal, find themselves on opposite sides of a struggle, and may interfere with each other as they progress. This gives an interesting layer of light competitive gameplay, whilst still keeping the cooperative nature of the game in the forefront.&#10; Expansions&#10;The Dawnguard expansion will add a third campaign with three additional chapters to play through, new characters, dungeon adversaries, treasures, events, and more. One of our expansions will make the Ghosts of the Blades haunt you throughout Skyrim during the first Campaign of the game and another threatens devastation to Skyrim in the form of a great dragon! There is much more to be revealed through the Gamefound campaign. The team has planned for a massive upgrade kit converting all the wandering monsters over to 32mm scale plastic miniatures which are all compatible in scale with the miniatures game The Elder Scrolls Call to Arms. More information will be revealed in the run-up to the launch of the board game&#10; &#10;All in all, the Elder Scrolls Skyrim Adventure Game will offer players dozens and dozens of hours of adventure exploring the game world. Expansions will ensure there&rsquo;s even more Skyrim to be had.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is set amid the tumult of the 100 Years War, when kings and princes struggle for the throne of France. This is the age of knights and squires, where chivalry is often spoken of, but rarely practiced. It is a time of both religion and superstition. Educated clerics fervently believe that angels guard the pious, and demons scourge the wicked, while the simpler folk watch the night for signs of werewolves and dragons. The game assumes that all of these are real.&#10;&#10;Joan of Arc is a story-driven board game that uses finely-sculpted miniatures and 3D scenery to set the scene for a game of cunning and skill (and a little luck). The game is a combination of interwoven card play, resource management, and position on the board. You will need to master all three to beat the best opponents. Getting your men into the right position, and heading off your enemy, will be no use if you cannot muster the cards and other resources to make the most of it. Joan of Arc allows a huge amount of freedom in your actions. In every turn, you can choose to spend or save resources, and when you come to activate a unit you can choose between combat, interrogation, search, exploration, prayers, and other actions. So, this turn, should you level up a hero, or spend that resource to buy a re-roll? Take extra actions now, or save them for later? Double-move that cavalry, or question the old woman in the woods? When and how to act are decisions you must make based on your objectives, and the situation on the board. And, what is the best decision one turn may be very different in the next.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of the various factions in the war, or of some of the supernatural creatures that have emerged from the shadows. The most famous heroes and heroines of the war are all here: the Black Prince, the Dauphin, Falstaff, and, of course, Joan of Arc herself. Each game is a unique scenario with its own map assembled from the gaming tiles, and a specified set of heroes and followers to achieve the scenario&rsquo;s objectives. Each scenario has its own victory conditions, often different for each side. In one game you may be an inquisitor, seeking out a werewolf hidden among the peasantry; in another you may be a victorious raiding party, desperately fighting your way through an ambush so you can return to the safety of your castle.&#10;&#10;Scenarios range from small affairs with a few models and simplified role-play elements, to full battles with dozens of knights, archers and men-at-arms. All scenarios typically play in under an hour. The game also includes a battle mode, to fight out conflicts between armies of your choosing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to win greater glory in overcoming adventures and in tactical combat than the opposing team.&#10;&#10;Although multiple styles of play are available, the standard DoA game-play involves seven phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Selection of each side&rsquo;s team of 8-12 characters (kept secret).&#10;     Building of the interlocking puzzle map to best suit your character&rsquo;s skills.&#10;     Selection of a Team White and a Team Black based on character Respect.&#10;     Revealing and equipping of characters.&#10;     Bringing characters onto the map based on Respect.&#10;     A sequence of game rounds where characters maneuver on the map to accomplish adventures, hunt enemy characters and avoid dangerous situations. &#10;     Counting of total achievements won. The team with the most achievements wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game can end at a certain time or after a certain number of rounds.&#10;&#10;Game play is an unusual mix of tactical wargame-style combat, treasure gathering, and non-combat character teamwork and adventuring, and has no close comparison to other games. Differences between characters are significant, with many having poor fighting skills. Game play and winning is therefore an act of balancing fighting, treasure-gathering and adventuring.&#10;&#10;From the game box:&#10;&#10;Select a team of characters. Overcome adventures and the enemy team to win favor, achievements, and ultimate victory. And while you are at it, enjoy the stories that your game builds.&#10;&#10;Errata (Changes to cards):&#10;&#10;An Enemy Turned (Lith Card, Secret): Remove the second paragraph. Enemies cannot be switched if they are imprisoned.&#10;&#10;Prince Wallard Blatt (Character): Wallard is killed permanently if he takes damage from anything not caused by a successful Hit. For example, damage from Cube effects or trade damage caused by Hakan. For this purpose, poison damage is caused by a successful Hit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Cinque Terre are five coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy known for their beauty, culture, food, and proximity to one another. Produce carts are commonly found in each village marketplace.&#10;&#10;In Cinque Terre, a game of strategy, players compete to sell the most valuable produce in the five villages. Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Set Up and PlayDuring setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&#10;     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&#10;     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&#10;     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&#10;&#10;",

This trick-taking game ends when one opponent has been injured to the point of death. The player with the most health is then declared the tournament victor!&#10;&#10;In Tournament at Avalon, you also have cards representing the legendary enchantress Morgan Le Fay and a new set of location panels that grant additional advantages to a player when they are the host of a tournament round.

Each game allows for play by two players or one player, playing either side in the conflict.&#10;&#10;The Enemy Action series features:&#10;&#10;        Two-player competition with low complexity and constant decision points for both sides&#10;        Solitaire play of either side with systems governing all aspects of enemy command and tactics&#10;        Card-driven impulse system, with multi-purpose cards played to activate formations, implement command events, or gain tactical advantages in combat&#10;        Diceless and chartless combat system &ndash; players draw combat chits that build a narrative of each combat&#10;&#10;&#10;John Butterfield&rsquo;s unique card-driven mechanic allows players to use multiple resources in multiple ways but each decision has a consequence, many of which aren&rsquo;t evident at the time. Resources include units and cards. So two different cards can be used to activate the same unit/s, but each card may have a different secondary use that could include artillery support or even activation of more units (or group of units).&#10;&#10;The combat chit system is yet another decision-making point. Players choose and reveal a number of combat chits that varies based on a number of factors. The minimum and maximum number is dependent upon unit capabilities, terrain and support, but not combat factors (so no factor counting here). This choice can often get an attacker into trouble by going for &ldquo;a chit too far&rdquo;&hellip; Or it might even be a masterstroke to take that extra chit&hellip;&#10;&#10;Enemy Action: Ardennes&#10;&#10;The first game in the series is Ardennes. The game portrays the German offensive against the western Allies in December 1944 &mdash; the Battle of the Bulge. Each player controls the German or Allied side. When playing solo, the game system controls the other side. So Enemy Action: Ardennes is effectively three games in one box: the two-player game, solitaire playing the Allies, and solitaire playing the Germans.&#10;&#10;Map scale on this module is 2.5 miles per hex. Hexes on the game map are oversized allowing for easy counter handling. Unit scale is regiment, brigade and division, with one to four steps per unit.

Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a teeming metropolis.&#10;&#10;Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon, and politician&mdash;each helping in the development of a hypothetical &quot;Anywhere, USA.&quot; Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game. Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits. These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract. Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.&#10;&#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world&mdash;when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;The grid of streets on the board provides the framework for building the small town. The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area. Each building's value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.&#10;&#10;At the start of a player's turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as &quot;Investments,&quot; gaining Wealth in doing so. Next that player gets 6 &quot;Action Points&quot; (APs) with which to spend on any of the the following activities:&#10;&#10;&bull; Acquiring new Building Permit cards from those available to choose;&#10;&bull; Constructing new buildings from those currently available;&#10;&bull; Acquiring a &quot;Favor&quot;&mdash;a Building Contract that only that player can build.&#10;&#10;Each activity carries with it a variable cost in APs, depending on where the chosen card lies on the board.&#10;&#10;Once a player has spent his APs it's time for a quick reset phase in readiness for the next player's turn. It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige. Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.&#10;&#10;Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts. Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular &quot;zone&quot;&mdash;Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial&mdash;in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office. Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis. Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held&mdash;after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In addition to these tactical and strategic decisions, luck also plays something of a role as not every marriage brings the windfall expected. Perhaps then another marriage will bring more success and influence?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Villainous: Bigger and Badder, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically Syndrome (The Incredibles), Lotso (Toy Story 3), and Madam Mim (The Sword in the Stone). Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;In more detail, just like in The Incredibles, Syndrome will face off against Frozone and the Parr family, using his minions and advanced technology to come out ahead. To win as Syndrome, players need to upgrade the Omnidroid, then defeat it and all heroes in his realm. Lotso seeks to control Sunnyside Daycare by reducing four heroes' strength (utilizing a game mechanism new to Disney Villainous) and moving those heroes to the toddlers' Caterpillar Room. Finally, those playing as Madam Mim will need to win a wizard's duel against Merlin, using Mim's Transformations to defeat Merlin's.&#10;&#10;Villainous: Bigger and Badder is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the other Disney Villainous games.&#10;&#10;",

During 4 races, players will try to place successful bets to gain Victory Points and Gold.&#10;&#10;To reach their goal, they will buy Contracts with unscrupulous citizens of the fairy realm to hire their services and turn the odds of the race in their favor, play Magic cards to straight up fix it, and try to avoid squandering all their hard-earned Gold and be forced to ask the Elf-Mob for Loans. At the end of the Championship, the player with the most Victory Points will be the winner!&#10;&#10;&gt;&gt; GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;HOW DOES THE RACE WORK?&#10;In Unicorn Fever the race is managed by an AI mechanism. When the race starts, you won't be able to perform any action: the unicorns will freely run and sprint on the board. All you can do is watch the race unfold, shouting and cheering for your favorite unicorn!&#10;&#10;WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS OF THE PLAYERS, THEN?&#10;Players will perform 3 actions before each race, allowing them to fix the race with Magic, place Bets, hire shady characters to gain special abilities, or even perform combos between the above.&#10;Since the action tokens available are limited, you will also have to read the intentions of your opponents and perform the actions you need before it is too late!&#10;&#10;WHO WINS?&#10;Players obtain Victory Points and money with each of their successful Bets over the course of 4 races. Bets can be placed on Victory (5VPs), or Podium (3 or 2 VPs). On average, unicorns with better odds run faster than those with the worse odds, but successful bets on slower unicorns pay better! Players must take risks and play wisely to turn the odds to their favor!&#10;&#10;",
