    "Description": "Players roll dice and move colored snails on the board. Along the way, they try to push opponents and get as many delicious mushrooms as they can. Until the very end nobody knows which snail belongs to which opponent, which guarantees great excitement. The game has simple rules, and victory is decided by tactics and the ability to bluff.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;In P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce &#197;&#154;limaki: Na jednej nodze (&quot;Running Snails: On one leg&quot;) every player controls two out of five snails. It may happen that some snails are controlled by two players. On a turn, a player rolls the dice, chooses one of them and moves a snail with a color corresponding to the chosen die. After that, the player passes the dice (except for the previously selected die) to the next player. When the number of dice passed is reduced to one then the current player receives all of the dice.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the snails finishes the race. At this time, snails are awarded points: 5 for 1st place, 2 for 2nd place, and 3 for last place. Snails can also earn points during the race by landing on a mushroom or pushing back other snails.

At some point during each pitch, though, the executive may add a note card to the pitch and force the writer to add some really terrible new elements to their movie.&#10;&#10;At the end of the pitches, the executive chooses which movie they liked the best, with that person scoring a point, then the game continues from there.&#10;&#10;In groups of 6-12, players split into teams of two and must work with a partner to pitch their movie. This also means that there are two executives, and each of them gets to play a note card onto the pitch, leading to some pretty ridiculous movies.&#10;&#10;",

Scavenge resources, complete assignments, and earn rewards, to upgrade your craft. Hire crew and join with your allies to achieve victory against overwhelming odds.&#10;&#10;Zephyr: Winds of Change is a cooperative modular tabletop adventure for one to four players. Each player takes on the role of an airship captain. As a recent recruit to the band of vigilantes called Zephyr, each player must outfit their own vessel and work together defend the last remaining shred of civilization from malevolent marauders and unrelenting warlords.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players upgrade their ship and hire crew members. Each of these brings unique abilities and can help you customize your ship and fill a unique role on your team. Each game you select a mission which shapes its overall structure, length, and difficulty. Join us, a vessel in Zephyr awaits its captain.&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;This is a 1 to 4 player cooperative modular adventure with rogue-like elements set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk environment. Players pick their ship and can spend their starting resource to add tokens to their ship and cards to their deck. They can also hire crew which are a modular component that comes by combining two cards, which each give unique abilities, and adding them to your ship. Players choose a mission which each has a different lengths and difficulty which maps out starting supplies, the win event and the structure between. Players travel on their selected mission through a series of regions. Each of these has a unique global effect for the area. Each turn, or day as we call it, each player draws an exploration card which causes them to make decisions, deal with random events or fight in battles. Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members. These augmentations help to prepare your ship for the end conflict and ultimately win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The dream tiles score you points based on what's visible on your island at game's end, so don't take a Fennec fox dream tile if your island is devoid of Fennec foxes! Palm trees earn points on their own, as does the pairing of a Rukh bird and its huge egg. Have too many bandits, and you'll lose points &mdash; and if you collect a third magic lamp, you have to flip two tiles face down, costing you whatever points you would have received.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This new GMT boxed version of 1918/1919: Storm in the West is a two-player system that also works fine for solo play.  Units are mostly corps (divisions for the USA, whose oversized units were nearly the size of Allied corps), and include infantry, tanks, cavalry and air support. The Germans start the 1918 campaign with large numbers of Stosstruppen, trained to overcome the trench stalemate of the previous  three years. This gives the German player a strong offensive capability in the first half of the game. But these &ldquo;shock troops&rdquo; are a wasting asset, and if the Allies survive the initial blows, growing numbers of US troops and Allied tanks will see the Germans forced into a desperate defense in the game's second half.&#10;&#10;In the Plan 1919 campaign, the Germans are assumed to have used the collapse of Russia to stabilize the Balkan and Italian fronts, forgoing the historical 1918 Kaiser's Battles in the West. The Allies are thus faced with a strong German defense, but with a fully mobilized American army and backed by masses of tanks and planes.  This hypothetical campaign challenges the Allies to leverage these arms into the world's first blitzkrieg, while the Germans fight to force a stalemate that will leave them dominant in Europe.&#10;&#10;The large-hex map, scaled at 8 miles to the hex, covers the active area of the Western Front, from Epinal in the south to Antwerp and the Channel Coast in the north. Terrain includes Forts, Allied trenches, German Secondary and Primary Trenches, Forts, Forest, Marsh, Flood Plain, Mountain, and the Devastated Zone created by the German withdrawal in the Somme sector in 1917. The map is back-printed with separate versions for the 1918 and 1919 Campaigns.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, this new GMT version of 1918/1919: Storm in the West can be played in a single session and offers players a wide range of strategic and operational choices in bloody but dynamic campaigns to decide the outcome of the First World War. With updated artwork by Mark Simonitch and Charlie Kibler, this new combined edition is a must for lovers of classic wargaming.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Romans traces the history of the Roman Empire from its inception as a small Italian Kingdom, through its development and expansion as a Republic and thence to the full blown Empire that dominated the classical world. Enemies mount challenges throughout the game and ultimately the barbarian invasions drive deep into the Empire with Rome itself as their target.&#10;&#10;But this is not just a game of conquest. Senators grapple for power in the buildings of the capital and players will score victory points by developments through the game.&#10;&#10;Players start with four Senators and their number increases through the game as five buildings come into play. These Senators can be placed in the various buildings to gain promotions, recruit legions, take revenue and build cities, fortifications and fleets, gain victory points, and a whole lot more. Alternatively, the Senators flip to become Generals which the player then deploy with armies on their own map board to expand the Kingdom, Republic and Empire.&#10;&#10;Players make a range of decisions as there are multiple scoring opportunities and routes to victory. Game play is speedy and at time simultaneous. The fortune of dice rolling is mitigated by the sharing of many rolls and players who fall behind in the game will benefit from three recovery mechanisms that ensure the game remains tightly balanced until the dramatic climax of the game.&#10;&#10;This is the third quantum game from the Ragnar Brothers and gives players a unique opportunity for each to experience the thrilling rise of Roman power. The game also builds upon the auto-player mechanisms which have been a feature of the solo rules in their recent games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Jerusalem wall has been destroyed. People are filled with great shame and in trouble. Without the wall, Israelites and the Temple are not safe. Nehemiah heard about the situation in the city, travelled from Babylon, and lead the rebuilding works.&#10;&#10;&quot;The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem.&quot;&#10;&#10;And they said to me, &quot;The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.&quot; As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. &ndash;Nehemiah 1:1-4&#10;&#10;In Nehemiah players take the role of Israelite leaders who help to rebuild the Jerusalem wall. The game is based on a unique, worker-placement mechanism:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players will place their workers on ever-changing labor cards.&#10;    When a player activates his worker, he may activate other labor cards in the same row of cards that have already been activated. Doing this will cost him gold, but it may help him utilize his resources better.&#10;    When players are not watchful, the row of labor cards may be changed before they have a chance to use their worker(s), so it's important to place new workers on good cards, but also to use the workers already placed.&#10;&#10;&#10;Nehemiah is a fast-paced family/Euro game with different possible strategies. The course of the game is highly variable and intense. Players take very short turns, so everybody has to be engaged all the time. The game also has two, well-polished variants.&#10;&#10;",

Designed by Joe Balkoski, creator of Atlantic Wall and Sixth Fleet, St. Lo offers a challenging system for the simulation of WW2 battalion-level combat.&#10;&#10;Unit morale is the crucial factor in this game. Morale fluctuates as units move, rest or attack. Should you pull this battalion out of the line to rest ? Or will one more push carry the position ?&#10;&#10;Artillery plays a crucial role too. Good observation posts are essential for accurate fire. You will find yourself fighting many desperate actions for control of hilltop vantage points or church steeples.&#10;&#10;The innovative movement system makes uncertainty another key element of St Lo. You never know who will move next. Even units that have already moved may move again the same turn. You will need to plan ahead, rest your troops and then spring your offensive.&#10;&#10;Outstanding for solitaire play. The rulebook has extensive designers notes throughout and each chapter has numerous quotes from commanders at the battle for St. Lo.&#10;&#10;Designed by a master craftsman this is an innovative, tense and accurate portrayal of WW2 battalion command - the way it really was.&#10;&#10;18 July 1944 13:40 Hrs&#10;Gen.

    "Description": "France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of an original game covering the historical events that led to the liberation of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands during the Allied drive on Germany by renowned game designer, Mark Herman. This new signature edition has been re-mastered and updated and will be linking with an all-new companion game, Russia 1944, slated for release in 2019.&#10;&#10;Changes from the 1986 version include an updated combat system that has been simplified and bloodier.  The game updates attrition rules.  The Brittany Campaign is captured in the game along with V1 rockets.  The mounted map has more terrain features, covers more area.  The game includes an additional scenario that takes the war past the Rhine River and goes to the end of the war.  The game also includes 70 additional counters and a second map that zooms in on Normandy and features larger hexes to better manage the initial breakout.&#10;&#10;This original game influenced Herman's classic Empire of the Sun in that the player will activate a headquarter piece, which in turn activates armor divisions and infantry corps within command range of the headquarters unit.  Instead of cards, though, this game uses chits drawn from a cup.&#10;&#10;The most unique feature, though, is the attempt to model real time through a simple increment chart.  The result is that if a unit moves, it captures an instance of time where all units must do something, even if that means sitting still.  There is no movement phase where you move units of various speeds adjacent to an enemy and then go into a combat phase where they all attack. Coordination is captured more realistically, but in a manageable and simplistic system.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes logistics in how you coordinate combat and movement.  Also, if you move too rapidly, like George Patton in 1944, you outrun your supplies and have to wait while it catches up.&#10;&#10;The game plays in one sitting and has a relatively low complexity for a wargame.&#10;&#10;Scale: 20 miles (32 km) per hex; eleven (11) one-month turns; units are infantry corps, armor divisions and army-level HQs [taken from back of box].&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense is a cooperative board game in which players take on the roles of Rick, Glenn, Daryl, Michonne, and other characters. The Survivors must defend four key locations from Walkers &ndash; the Farm, the Prison, the Town and the Highway &ndash; in order to stay alive. The game board is assembled at random for each game, providing for variability in the locations; a 25-card resource deck &ndash; containing either Equipment, Allies, Food or Ammunition &ndash; is placed at random on one of the locations.&#10;&#10;Walkers and other calamities are triggered in different locations by a 48-card Event deck (every card is unique!), which players draw from each round. They must then figure out how to minimize the effects of these Events, using dice to resolve combat and determine the outcome of some events. Survivors can work together to combine their combat abilities or split up to cover more ground. If the Survivors don't clear the Walkers out of a location, they'll lose resources &ndash; and if any resource deck runs out, the players lose the game. Thus, players need to keep the Walkers at bay while not using up too many resources themselves.&#10;&#10;Unlike most cooperative games, The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes a leadership role that a player can take for one or more rounds. Each player character has a unique leadership ability that provides a bonus while that character is in charge.&#10;&#10;The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes two gameplay modes. In the &quot;Beginner&quot; mode, players share all information on their Event cards so that the leader and others can take everything happening in the game into consideration. In &quot;Expert&quot; mode, players may not share their Event cards, which means that leaders might make decisions that are detrimental to other players &ndash; but those players can defy the leader (for a cost) and make their own moves. Why would they do this?&#10;&#10;In addition to just trying to stay alive, each player has a secret &quot;Ulterior Motive&quot; card that specifies a mission for that player. If he completes that mission, then he earns a partial victory, even if the Survivors as a group would otherwise lose. The Ulterior Motive cards are recommended only for advanced players who like a bit of conflict in their co-operative games.&#10;&#10;",

Each player equips fleets with escort ships and upgrades and uses them to control star systems for VPs. Diplomatic leverage, cunning, and brute force will determine the victor.&#10;&#10;Each round in Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict consists of six phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order. Every round has a new randomized player order. Being first has its pros and cons, so does being last.&#10;&#10;2) Build. The players take turn buying new fleets, escort ships, and upgrades, using their megacredits. The fleets each consist of a flagship and space for some combinations of escort ships and upgrade cards. Which fleet you choose and how you develop it will determine its strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;3) Deployment. The players place their fleets at the different systems they want to control.&#10;&#10;4) Diplomacy. Players take turns using diplomatic actions. There are 2 basic actions: A) Use 2 diplomatic points to retreat your fleet from the board. B) Use 6 diplomatic points to retreat an opposing fleet from a system where you have a fleet. There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.&#10;&#10;5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.&#10;&#10;6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragon Parade is a simple game by Reiner Knizia which is played on a small, beautifully decorated board depicting Chinese New Year fireworks in and around the Forbidden City.&#10;&#10;Players alternate playing cards to move the dragon pawn back and forth along the street in front of the Forbidden Palace:  red cards to move it one direction, yellow to move it the other.  Each player gets a random hand of six movement cards and will play only four of them before the dragon's final position is settled.&#10;&#10;Players individually deploy their three pawns (&quot;street sellers&quot;) somewhere along the red/yellow number line, one at a time after each of the first three cards played, in the effort to be nearest to the dragon once it stops moving.  Then coins (VP) are collected by each street seller depending on proximity to the dragon, the top payoff of 5 going only to the pawn on the exact same space.&#10;&#10;You play as many hands as there are players, with each player going first once.  It's a game of groupthink and should move pretty quickly once everyone gives in to the idea that it's not an exact science!&#10;&#10;",

ACME is not a sequel nor an expansion but a stand alone game using the same multiplayer and solitaire systems as its predecessor with many new and exciting features to intrigue its players.&#10;&#10;ACME is a game of the chaos-inducing wrath of gods &amp; men&mdash;a chaos each player does their utmost to manage, survive, and guide their civilization through to triumphant victory. Spanning the ancient world from the Hellespont to the Indus, from the Caspian to the Red Sea, and from the early Bronze Age to the Hellenic Age, Ancient Civilizations of the Middle East allows you to command not just 10 but 17, SEVENTEEN CIVILIZATIONS!&#10;&#10;If you want a War Game, you got it. If you want a friendly game, this is it too! As in Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea, Ancient Civilizations of the Middle East can be all about war, but it doesn't have to be. It can be a friendly game of exploration, city building, trade, and faith. Players (solitaire, a group of up to six, or even a mix of live players with a system-driven civilization of two or more) can make of ACME what they wish or imagine. Competition can be martial or cultural, warlike or friendly, or a combination of both&mdash;how the game unfolds depends entirely on how the players want it to play. The duration of the game is also up to the players: from a multi-hour odyssey of all four Epochs to a pre-arranged shorter contest of an hour or two or to an agreed Sudden Death Victory Point threshold.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning German General Guderian had planned a pincer move to relieve K&uuml;strin, but Hitler wanted to save troops to retake Budapest. This resulted in changing objectives to the relief of Festung Arnswalde and trying to cut the Soviet supply route towards K&uuml;strin. The historical objective for the Soviets was to drive the Germans out of Pomerania and thereby protect their right flank while preparing to take K&uuml;strin and make the final thrust towards Berlin.&#10;&#10;Stargard Solstice&trade; is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players.&#10;&#10;It is built around the same system of wargaming rules that shaped Plan West, K&#195;&#182;nigsberg '45 and Army Group Narwa and utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: about 3 to about 4 km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 23.5 x 33&quot; (A1) full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (286 9/16&quot; (15mm) counters)&#10;One 16-page rulebook&#10;Two single-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-10 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;",

His report captures his wonder at how the Union army's unexpected turning movement and resulting victorious moment turned into a mass of disorder streaming towards Washington by nightfall. The Confederates had been outmaneuvered and outfought in the morning engagement and seemed simply unaware of the fact that they had been beaten as McDowell and staff clearly saw. That unwillingness to accept defeat brought the Confederates a victory.&#10;&#10;Inexperience and exuberance were present in equal measure in both armies and combined to provide for a uniquely chaotic battlefield. As you review your armies the names of brigade and division commanders will be instantly familiar; Sherman, Jackson, Burnside, Johnston, et al are all present where they began to learn their trade.&#10;&#10;The Blind Swords system provides a custom fit for this early war battle where troops may or may not respond to orders, may hold their fire thinking that the enemy is their friend and where chaos was certainly the order of the day. The Day Was Ours is the sixth game in Revolution Games' Blind Swords series of regimental-level games on American Civil War Battles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fuentes de Onoro 1811 focus on the last events of the fight between Mass&eacute;na and Wellington in Portugal and Spain. It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.&#10;&#10;The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811&#10;The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811&#10;On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.&#10;&#10;El Bodon 25th September 1811&#10;The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:&#10;&#10;    A 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 500 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;",

Managing their hand of five cards players need to make tough calls on what to play while carefully managing their resources of health, food and cards left in their draw deck.&#10;&#10;The players will free themselves from the Tomb of Maeshowe once they've removed enough rubble blocking their escape. By playing a set of four &quot;Excavation&quot; cards to the row, the players are able to remove rubble. The timing of when to start a set of &quot;Excavation&quot; cards will be critical since a row of less than four will result in those cards being lost decreasing player chance for survival.&#10;&#10;If the player ever find themselves having zero health or having run out of cards in their draw deck, they have lost and their dead bodies will be found in the Tomb of Maeshowe by archeologists hundreds of years later.&#10;&#10;Other threats presented by their draw deck includes such things as the passage collapsing and running out of food while some well-needed sleep or Odin himself sending a Raven to watch over you can provide you with some much-needed relief.&#10;&#10;This updated version of Lee Broderick's Print and Play game Maeshowe offers a streamlined version of the core gameplay while adding a series of mini-expansions and alternate set-ups for more variety, challenge, and replay-ability.&#10;&#10;",

Stalin's main strategic goal was a quick recovery of Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia. The German answer was a stout defence for the possession of the strategically important Narva Isthmus. Across The Narva is a board game depicting this event in time. The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river in February. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counter attacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944.&#10; Across The Narva covers the first three months of the Narva Bridgehead campaign and utilizes the same system of command activation chit-pull and base rules as in K&#195;&#182;nigsberg: The Soviet Attack on East Prussia, 1945 also by Revolution Games (II).&#10;&#10;Across The Narva is a reimplementation of Army Group Narwa previously produced by Three Crowns Games.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: .8 miles / 1.3 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Across the Narva rulebook&#10;One dual-side printed Cover Sheet/Players Aid Card&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to supply one 6-sided die for play.&#10;&#10;",

It is the middle of the 16th Century and young, ambitious noble families are reclaiming the dry hinterlands, building fields, forests, and lakes around their castles. Piece by piece - parcel by parcel - their holdings increase. Farmers work the fields, and in especially successful areas, monks found their influential cloisters. But everything happens under the watchful eyes of the nobility. Intrigues are hatched, tax collectors fleece the landowners, and far too often entire tracts of land are lost to locust plagues. Only he who keeps a cool head will become the Duke of Salamanca.&#10;&#10;Through clever use of cards in hand, players obtain tiles for placement (buildings, landscapes, privileges) as well as the ability to carry out certain actions. The tiles obtained are placed on tactically important spaces on the game board. Players can also place ownership markers onto buildings. By cleverly placing landscape tiles adjacent to the proper buildings, valuable regions can be formed that will bring in doubloons. Through the actions that can be gained by playing cards, players can bring plague stones (among other things) onto the board, and thereby block their opponents' tiles. The winner is the player with the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn.&#10;&#10;Gnostica is a redevelopment of Zarcana.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by Zark City, and Dectana.  The former is much simpler and uses a poker deck, while the latter is more complex and uses the Decktet.&#10;&#10;This page has a short URL: http://j.mp/gnostica&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A few months after Finland made its Declaration of Independence from Russian rule at December of 1917 a civil war broke out between Finnish Reds and Whites. The paramilitary Red Guards formed by the worker class took control of Helsinki on the 27th of January 1918. The Senate fled from Helsinki and declared the White guards as their official troops.&#10;&#10;On the 3rd of April 1918 the German Baltic Sea Division landed in southern Finland. By the 11th of April they had reached the outskirts of Helsinki and their commander R&uuml;diger von der Goltz launched an attack to conquer Helsinki. The Russian Navy had a significant naval base and fortifications in Helsinki, but respecting the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk they left Helsinki and did not take part in the battle. The Red Guards made a hasty decision not to surrender but to defend Helsinki. The White Guards had built their own underground paramilitary organization and were waiting for the right moment to take control of the centre.&#10;&#10;Helsinki 1918 is a hex wargame for three players. The game offers a historical representation of the Battle of Helsinki between 11th and 13th of April and covers the whole battle from the outskirts to the centre of the city. Each hex represents an approximately 300 meters wide area and each unit represents a company sized force.&#10;&#10;The German player must execute a well-planned advance to defeat the Reds and avoid high casualties especially in skirmishes on the streets of the centre. The Red player&rsquo;s focus is to maintain a high fighting spirit and recruit new groups to reinforce the defence. Meanwhile the White player must wait for the right opportunity to deploy their hidden troops onto the streets of Helsinki.&#10;&#10;Helsinki 1918 game contains:&#10;&#10;1 map (1050 mm x 850 mm)&#10;1 rulebook&#10;41 cards&#10;76 unit and HQ markers&#10;6 dice&#10;Scenarios for 2 and 3 players&#10;&#10;",

The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.&#10;&#10;In Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples. The auction system guarantees that each game is quite unlike the previous one. Each time the players lead different peoples and adjust to their respective victory conditions, all of which have been modeled on historical requirements.&#10;&#10;Special unit types include Knights, Castles and Elites.

    "Description": "A pirate's life is all about the treasure &mdash; or surviving to tell the tale! Turn yourself into a legend by defeating the enemy, saving the ship, and having the most valuable loot in your hand...but if the ship does sink, be the pirate who survived to tell the tale by having the fewest cards in your hand so that you can be light enough to flee on the lifeboat.&#10;&#10;In We're Sinking!, a 3-6 player, secret action-taking survival game, players take on the role of pirates on a ship under siege. As the ship takes damage, the crew must work together to repair the ship and defeat one of the threats &mdash; kraken, skeleton pirates, megalodon, or sirens &mdash; while keeping the ship from sinking.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose one of four actions: Bucket decreases the current water level; Patch fixes breaches and busted cannon; Fire allows you to fire cannons at the enemy; and Plunder allows you to steal revealed loot cards. Players discuss and possibly bluff about which actions they should take, then they secretly choose their actions on hidden compass dials, place them face down, then reveal them simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Will you or your fellow crew instead choose to selfishly pocket treasure as precious time runs out? If you can manage to take out the threat, the game ends, and you win if you have the largest treasure score. If the ship sinks before taking out the threat, you win by having the fewest cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Players constantly make tough decisions as they change their strategies based on how close they think the ship is to sinking or how trustworthy their fellow mates ar(rrr)e.&#10;&#10;",

His advisors hope to strengthen their influence throughout the imperial palace &ndash; better known as the Forbidden City.&#10;&#10;In turn in Forbidden City, the advisors place down room tiles in an attempt to close off the rooms when their influence is the biggest. To increase their power, they also need as many imperial dragons as possible on their side. The advisor with the most influence in the Forbidden City wins this exciting game of power!&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play the tile from your face-down pile and place it face up on the table. You may place your tile only against a tile of the same color, unless they are divided by a wall. When you close off a room &mdash; that is, when it's completely surrounded by walls with or without archways &mdash; you calculate its total value. Each tile forming part of the room generates 1 point, each dragon in the room generates 3 bonus points, and any other rooms directly accessible from the closed off room through an archway are also added to the score.&#10;&#10;The player with the most advisors in a closed-off room receives the total value in Chinese coins. The player who has the second-most advisors in the closed off room receives half the total score. In the event of an uneven total score, the amount is rounded down. If there are two or more players with the most advisors in the closed off room, each of these players is awarded half the total value.&#10;&#10;The player who has the highest amount in coins at the end of the game is the most powerful advisor of the Forbidden City and therefore wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Somewhere in the heart of 19th century London, shadowy forces are hatching a dire conspiracy. Queen Victoria has enlisted the aid of exceptional individuals to investigate the impending plot and save her realm from its calamitous consequences.&#10;&#10;Victoriana is a cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players move throughout London marshaling and managing resources, investigating leads, and thwarting the agents of an unknown mastermind before time runs out.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of investigators that have influence within different realms of British society (politics, science, occult, and the underworld). The conspiracy's three elements (mastermind, plot, and locale) are represented by cards and tokens selected in secret before the game begins. Leads relating to the conspiracy are represented by facedown cards tied to notable London locations. Players move their figures throughout the city, revealing lead cards, expending their investigator's influence tokens to acquire those leads, and deciding how to apply them toward the conspiracy's hidden aspects.&#10;&#10;Time is not on their side. Mismanaging the clock or their influence tokens causes leads to go cold, traumatizing investigators and bringing the conspiracy closer to its dreadful realization. Worse, as the investigators come closer to the truth, the mastermind dispatches agents to stymie their movements, disrupt their efforts (by forcing them to discard influence tokens), and assassinate them (by causing trauma).&#10;&#10;Identifying the elements of the conspiracy leads the players to a climactic confrontation. If the precise combination of influence is accrued and the investigators assemble at the correct locale, the queen is saved and the British Empire preserved; however, if too many leads go cold, Big Ben strikes midnight, or the investigators are too traumatized, a dire fate awaits.&#10;&#10;",

The game will last until a number of civilizations reach the Bronze or Iron Ages, when points will be awarded for the territories and cities occupied, technologies discovered, trade goods obtained, Wonders built and treasure.&#10;&#10;One distinctive element of the game is the use of a deck/pool-building mechanic mixed with role selection (similar to Eminent Domain) by which players draw a generic action of their choice to boost their hand every turn. This is done with little chips instead of cards, where chips in four different colors are each associated with a couple of possible actions. For instance, players can use blue chips in their hand (fleets/caravans) to expand to an adjacent maritime region, or, to trade goods and discoveries with other players.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses and civilizations advance, the map will become gradually more and more crowded, players in turn will increase their hand sizes, and their chips will become more and more efficient by means of technological advancements, thus gradually increasing in complexity of negotiations and military tension. So the core of the interaction between players comes not much from direct conflict, but from the constant negotiation everyone is subject to, for the purpose of establishing accessible trading cities and beneficial exchanges, all the while procuring secured &ldquo;buffer zones&rdquo; between their Capitals.&#10;&#10;",

Stronger cards tend to be single-use, meaning you need to balance longevity and power when making your choices. Additionally the small card set means you can make assumptions about what your opponent might have, though without total certainty.&#10;&#10;The game's solo mode isn't just tacked on - 20 cards are included just for use in solo play, and allow you to enjoy the game by yourself.

On a turn, a player rolls the blue storm die and either moves 1-3 clouds or stands in place eating a muffin, forgetting all about the race, the crystals, and everything else. If you land on a pink cloud, you roll the crystal die and receive 1-3 crystals; if you land on a present, you give someone else a crystal from the reserve; and if you land on the front end of a rainbow, you slide along the path to the next cloud. Whoever reaches the final cloud first claims the four crystals there, then players compare their holdings to see who horned their way to victory.&#10;&#10;",

The two aspects on each side of a die offer a large choice of number and color combinations.&#10;&#10;While all four games follow the same general rules and last 30-60 minutes, each one is set in a specific universe and offers a distinct playstyle:&#10;&#10;1. CRAZY CUP is a competitive racing game for 1 to 4 players, ages 8 and up.&#10;Participate in a frantic race through the Grand Canyon. What devious tricks will you employ to hinder your opponents, and be the first to cross the finish line?&#10;&#10;2. DUNGEON is a cooperative adventure game for 1 to 4 players, ages 10 and up.&#10;Explore the dungeon with your companions in search of treasures, but beware of monsters and traps. Will you find the Goblin King's crown before he returns to the throne?&#10;&#10;3. CIVILIZATION is a competitive conquest game for 1 to 4 players, ages 12 and up.&#10;Become the ancient world&rsquo;s greatest conqueror!

Players will appreciate the high-production quality of the components which includes a MOUNTED game map and large, 5/8&quot; size punch-out counters.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of the United States or Great Britain over a four-year period spanning the war and its prelude, with game cards for events and operations that offer players the tools to remix the entire scope of the conflict. Events such as &ldquo;Andrew Jackson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Ironsides,&rdquo; &ldquo;Laura Secord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tippecanoe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dinner at the White House&rdquo; recreate the characters and moments that shaped the war, while operations such as recruiting, campaigning, privateering, raiding, and shipbuilding let players take it in their own direction. Each side earns victory points for capturing the enemy&rsquo;s towns and territory, outcompeting them at sea, and outmaneuvering them in politics and public sentiment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, that means sometimes throwing the other orphans under the proverbial bus.&#10;&#10;House of Rath differs significantly in its gameplay, however. It combines elements of deduction, &ldquo;take that,&rdquo; and map reduction to create suspense, but the real difference lies in one key point: During every turn, you&rsquo;re playing as both the orphans and the boogeyman!&#10;&#10;During the Roll phase, you&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to protect your orphans from the dreaded boogeyman, Count Rath: lock doors, rotate rooms, travel via secret passages, and even reveal other hidden orphans. Every decision could be the one that takes your orphans to (relative) safety&mdash;or straight into Rath&rsquo;s greedy clutches. You&rsquo;ll then use the Boogeyman Phase of your turn (while playing as Rath) to suss out which orphans belong to whom, all while steering Rath clear of your orphans (and keeping secret which ones are your orphans when possible).&#10;&#10;If one of your orphans is discovered by Rath, your chances of getting away are slim. But hey&hellip;a chance is a chance, right? You&rsquo;ll either escape (likely to be pursued again at a later time) or come to a grisly end and draw a Run Away card. Though a Run Away card won&rsquo;t help you when it&rsquo;s drawn, it&rsquo;ll give you options later. Use it to give your other orphans better odds of escaping if they&rsquo;re discovered, or use the card&rsquo;s one-of-a-kind special ability.&#10;&#10;The last player with at least one surviving orphan is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Only one of you will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.&#10;&#10;Songs of Far Shores | Omen Game 1 is a standalone card game for two players.&#10;&#10;Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.&#10;&#10;Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City become Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).&#10;&#10;The turn structure is broken into five Steps:&#10;&#10;WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!&#10;&#10;SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.&#10;&#10;PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.&#10;&#10;WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).&#10;&#10;OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.&#10;&#10;While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: A Reign of War title or expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;We are in Barcelona in the late 19th century. The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.&#10;&#10;Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.&#10;&#10;During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Venice Connection is a river-building / tile-placement game for two players. Your goal is to complete the canal in a loop. The game consists of 16 identical tiles, each with a straight section of canal on one side and a bend on the other. All the tiles are available for either player to use, and on a turn you place 1-3 tiles connected in a straight line adjacent to at least one other tile already in play (except on the first turn when you just place these tiles on the table).&#10;&#10;If during the course of the game, one player notices that the canal is now impossible to complete, they say &quot;impossible&quot; to the challenged player (who placed on the previous turn), who now must try to finish the canal alone. If the canal can be completed, the challenged player has won; if not, the challenger has won!&#10;&#10;",
