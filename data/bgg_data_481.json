They receive 12 block-pawns, 18 pawns of their color, 6 pawns of the opponent's color, and 12 neutral pawns. Players secretly insert combinations of 3 pawns in each block-pawn: 1 pawn of their visible color in the window; and 2 pawns of their choice. At the same time as the placement of the block-pawns on the board, the players build their starting zone by positioning the stems. The game begins with 12 blue block-pawns against 12 red block-pawns. The unfolding game will reveal neutral block-pawns, playable by the 2 players.&#10;&#10;With each color a direction with displacement and catch is associated. The catch of an opponent's block-pawn consists in turning over it and replanting it on another stem. According to the internal combination of the block-pawn and the height of the stem, this action involves a modification of color, due to the translation of the pawns. No block-pawn is eliminated materially from the plate, it is transformed. As soon as a neutral block-pawn is present on the play, the players can turn the board a quarter of a turn, to counter their adversary, or to prepare their next blow: another vision of the play arises. The part is finished as soon as a color (Blue, Reed, Neutral) is represented more only by 7 block-pawns on the plate. The players count their respective block-pawns (Blue, Red). That which has some more gained: it is the rule of the 7.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.plimil.fr/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Boardgame News:&#10;&#10;If the Scrapyard Wars title sounds familiar, that might be because it combines the names of Scrapheap Challenge&mdash;a British television show in which teams compete to build working machines out of scrap parts&mdash;and Junkyard Wars, the short-running U.S. program with the same set-up.&#10;&#10;Now, instead of watching others transform junk into functioning junk, you get to assemble a few machines of your own&mdash;robots, to be precise, and preferably robots that will withstand some punishment. &ldquo;Scrapyard Wars is a unique take on a combat arena style game in which players seek to build the best robots they can and then keep them alive long enough to get the most value out of their creation,&rdquo; says designer Steve Sisk.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can add a piece of scrap to his hand (either drawing randomly or exchanging a part in his hand for a face-up one), build a robot, add parts to a robot already in play (to earn more VPs), or retire a robot (to protect the VPs already earned by that bot). &ldquo;Robots are worth VPs depending on the quality and mix of parts used to build them,&rdquo; says Sisk. Robots hold up to four VP tiles worth 1-3 VPs each. &ldquo;The longer the robots are around, the more VP they&rsquo;ll earn&mdash;but the VPs for a robot may be lost if the robot is defeated or destroyed by another robot.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;During set-up, seven parts tiles are included for each player, and the game ends when a players takes the final tile. Adds Sisk, &ldquo;With more players, there&rsquo;s more risk of a more powerful robot being targeted by everyone else, so players must be careful when building. A very powerful robot will earn the most VPs, but will be more at risk of being destroyed. Players become more interested in trying to slip a less powerful robot under the radar of other players and build VPs slowly.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Now there's Open Whist, a modern variation that two, three, or four players can enjoy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Open Whist was originally designed so that two or three players could enjoy whist. In the two-player variant the players have two hands each. They are playing both the role of themselves and their &quot;partner&quot; in standard Whist. The main difference is that all of the cards are played face-up in a pattern that only allows certain cards to be played at any given point in time.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to place tiles on the board, with the coordinates determined by rolling two dice (with opportunities for two re-rolls). When a square of four tiles is on the board, it is considered completed and is turned over to show an 'object worth seeing'. Rolling doubles allows one to roll a special die, which could result in an extra turn, being allowed to place two tiles anywhere on the board, or missing the next turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has completed five objects worth seeing. Scoring points is based on where the tiles in completed objects lie. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Some of these 3D chess variations created new chess pieces while other 3D rules imposed mandatory or unusual moves. In addition, many of these &quot;rules&quot; were generally incomplete causing inconsistent interpretations. None of these game variations offered a truly playable chess game.&#10;&#10;Because of the lack of playable rules, the Millennium 3D Chess rules were written with the objective of extending the traditional chess game into a multilevel environment without distorting the basic game. To this end, Millennium 3D Chess has not &quot;created&quot; new chess rules, but instead extended the traditional rules to allow for multi-board play. Other than the concept of moving between chess boards (levels), all traditional two (2D) chess rules apply.&#10;&#10;",

The evil is the spawn in human form, Wilbur Whately [sic]. To win, the investigator player must find and destroy him before or after he transforms into the spawn.&#10;Player #2 represents the spawn and the cultists that worship and protect him. This player must eliminate all professor, police, reporter, and detective counters from play. At any point that he achieves this goal, player #2 wins the game. In the process of this, player #2 attempts to have Wilbur kill enough people to gain the energy he needs to transform into the spawn. Once Wilbur is the spawn, it will be much easier for him to attack and win.&#10;Wilbur must transform into the spawn by the end of the last full moon phase on the turn track or his opportunity will pass until next year. Should he fail to transform into the spawn by the end of this phase, the game ends in a stalemate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Das Lieblingsspiel Von Adam Riese (the Favorite Game of Adam Riese) is a simple self-published wooden abstract arithmetic game for two that plays in 5 to 10 minutes, and that comes in a pouch.&#10;&#10;Each player (light and dark) plays on the same off-set grid of three rows up and three rows down. Each row has a start value of ten and four spaces to fill, except one space marked (+), resulting in fourteen spaces in all to fill. Each player has 10 stones to place: four square value stones (4, 3, 2, and 1), three round arithmetic symbol stones (the minus sign, the division sign, and the multiplication sign), and 3 tall round scoring markers (two in their own colour and one in their opponent's). Players take turns to place one stone of their own choice from their own supply onto the appropriate spaces. After all stones are placed, the scores are determined. Each player scores all the rows that are marked by the tall scoring stones of their color (one of which is placed by the opponent), and the score for each row is the outcome of the simple formula that players have created with the stones. Whoever gets the most points overall is the winner.&#10;&#10;Adam Riese, in the title, refers to the great German mathematician Adam Ries, better known as Adam Riese (1492-1559), whose work contributed to the phasing out of the impractical Roman numerals in favour of the Arabic numerals that we currently use, and who made it his life's ambition to bring the basics of mathematics and algebra to all people. For that reason, he wrote his science books in German, rather than in Latin, the language of the scientific elite, and was one of the first to do so. The German phrase &quot;nach Adam Riese&quot; (according to Adam Riese) is still used as an expression in the German language to emphasize the obvious correctness of a result of simple arithmetic.&#10;&#10;",

If any opponent thinks you are bluffing then  he declares this.  The player than shows the cards.  If the player lied than he takes all the cards.  However, if he was telling the truth then the opponent takes all the cards.&#10;&#10;2.)Robot Battle: This game is played like the game &quot;War&quot; where you want to be the one with all the cards at the end.&#10;&#10;3.)The Transformers Brainpower: This is a matching game where all cards are placed face down on the table and then two cards are flipped.  If they are the same, then the player takes the pair and goes again.  However, if the cards are different then the players turn is over. The player with the greatest number of pairs wins.&#10;&#10;4.)The Transformers Shout: In this game, each player flips over cards one at a time.  When a card is duplicated, the first person to spot this and yell &quot;transformers&quot; gets all the cards on then table.  This continues until one player has no cards.  At that time, the player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
