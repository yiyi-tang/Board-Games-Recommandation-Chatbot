    "Description": "HiQue bills itself as &quot;the missing link between Chess and Checkers&quot;. Play is on a 7x7 board, but the black and white squares are rotated 45 degrees so as to appear as diamonds to the players. There are 9 pieces per side: 5 &quot;runners&quot; and 4 &quot;guards&quot;. The object is to get a runner from your back row to the opponent's back row. Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards. Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions. Due to the diamond formation, guards are always on black squares and runners always on white squares.&#10;&#10;Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, or all of one side's runners are eliminated.&#10;&#10;This game plays quickly and easily. There aren't a lot of pieces, and the runners are in constant jeopardy from the guards. This is a game of deterrent: making sure your opponent doesn't take your pieces by setting up attacks of your own.&#10;&#10;The sides seem to be the safest places for runners, but they're very vulnerable anywhere.&#10;&#10;A &quot;lite&quot; game that is perfect for a few quick matches on a rainy day.&#10;&#10;",

Funded entirely by sponsorship from local firms who feature on the board and stocks, lead by the Midland Bank who got their logo on the banknotes, this game was actually produced by Sheffield YMCA with help from the City Council. Sheffield YMCA got the idea from Bergen YMCA, where apparently this style of game was a big hit in Norway, with 200,000 copies sold, the result being that all proceeds from sales went to the charity. The product is very good quality, very professional, with an unusual feature of the game board wrapping around a polystyrene contents box to form the game box like a sleeve, held by Velcro! Very strange, with the cardboard held in hinged sections in strong plastic, but the innovative &amp; modern design works very well and the result is much more interesting than many British games.&#10;Still a Monopoly clone though.&#10;&#10;",

Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.&#10;&#10;In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.&#10;&#10;The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.&#10;&#10;",

The aim of play is to meld sets of three &#10;cards, scoring the face value of melded cards at the end of the hand. The Parking meters are wild cards,&#10;which can be used when melding cards, but score nothing at the end of the hand.&#10;&#10;Players have two ways of gaining cards - the first thing they do each turn. They may discard a card and take as many cards as its face value from the draw pile. Alternatively, they may play one or more '1's and take that many cards from the discard pile. The drawback to the latter is that they must then meld at least one of the cards&#10;taken. Players are also limited to a maximum of 12 cards in their hand at the end of their turn and must&#10;discard any excess.&#10;&#10;Having taken card(s), players may then make a meld - only one meld is allowed each&#10;turn.&#10;&#10;",

For movement, a dice is shaken and the points distributed at will throughout a player's armies. When 2 opposing armies occupy the same space a battle occurs. Players state the values of their armies (a player can attack an opponent with more than one army), but in doing so can bluff this value. The defender can admit defeat and pay one 'power point' for every attacking army, or not believe the opposing declaration and cards are revealed. The loser now pays 2 'power points' per army. The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers). If a player runs out of points, a tower must be cashed back in and so a region is lost.&#10;&#10;",

A 2 player tile placement game in which one player represents the Coloured world of the Demons, whilst the other represents the Grey world of Concrete! The tiles have a grey side showing workers, police (baton raised!), managers, houses, schools, factories, offices and computers. The other colourful side shows creatures like penguins, spiders, octopii, cats, mice and more fantastic creatures like chimera, sphinx, dragon, and concepts like death, explosion, ruin, nature, puppet-theater, dice, maze, TV and free-public-radio! The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.&#10;Grey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money. A totally weird and original game, very nice production, with lovely tiles painted in a naive style. Rules in German, French and English.&#10;&#10;",

Players tally up minus points for cards remaining in hand, and anyone with more than 100 points is eliminated. The last player with less than 100 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Conventional chess pieces - with the addition of a second Queen - are used to play the game. The goal, just like in the ancient game, is to capture the opponent's King. The strategy is similar as well, however, the nature of the Z-Chess board requires the pieces to move differently. The Rooks are more powerful than the Queens, resulting from the way they move. A single Rook attacks all 77 &quot;squares&quot; when other pieces are removed from the board.&#10;The &quot;squares&quot; actually are circles at the intersections, same way as on the GLE'X board.&#10;&#10;",

A good enough speed game, the sort of thing Reinhard Staupe could modernize nicely.&#10;&#10;Published earlier under the name &quot;Shock&quot; with different pictures, but people had issues with playing &quot;terrorist&quot;, &quot;machine gun&quot; and similar cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board is a map of the United States c. 1822, the westernmost states being Missouri and Louisiana. Because dice were frowned upon as instruments of the horrible vice of gambling, included a teetotum, a sort of spinner used to randomly yield a number from 1 to 8.  This is used to determine the first player. Lines are drawn on the map to connect cities in a continuous path which players must follow. However, the cities are not named, but numbered.&#10;&#10;Upon arrival, at a new city, the player must correctly name the place and, if playing the advanced version, its population, or lose a turn and try again.. The first to reach New Orleans (population 10,000) wins.&#10;&#10;The first known game published in the United States.  Unlike other games, it was also invented in the USA rather  than being a copy of a British game, as many later ones were. The publisher were sellers of books in New York and later in 1822 also released Traveller's Tour Through Europe.&#10;&#10;A copy is apparently still in existence and archived at the American Antiquarian Society.&#10;&#10;",

'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.&#10;&#10;In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and&#10;to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).&#10;&#10;In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.&#10;&#10;Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.&#10;The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. &#10;The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.&#10;&#10;Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'. In many cases the winner at the end doesn't sell in every round and doesn't play a large role in every auction. The best advice: play Smart!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     A2-sized city board, painted by Annette Wiesman&#10;     real Smarts (actual candies, made of sugar, water soluble)&#10;     real half walnut shells &#10;     play Euros &#10;     Emotionhead board&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a representative of this peculiarly American class of board game produced for political reasons, as a form of parody.  For some reason, most instances of these games come from the right wing (another game in the same class is Capital Punishment, which is much more vitriolic in its political commentary).&#10;&#10;The &quot;object&quot; of this game is to &quot;go broke and go on Welfare with the help of government grants and boondoggles&quot;.  As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FROM THE INTRO: 2028, a fateful year for the human race, the Third World War began about 30 years previously.  By now the world is for all practical purposes destroyed as the nuclear catastrophe descended with undreamed of disastrous effects on the human race.  The face of the earth is changed and numerous areas around the globe are contaminated and destroyed.  Now mankind must fight against aliens, mutants, delinquents, looters, criminals, disease, radiation, and all the other ills the war has brought.  The main objective now is to survive and to attempt to recreate human society as much as possible.&#10;&#10;Holocaust is a fantasy board game in which a hero combats against the horrors of a world devastated by war.  He must fight for his family, find it and save it by leading it out of the devastated city towards the Road to Freedom...&#10;&#10;Each player takes the part of Michael.  With the help of the cards he must find everything he needs in the city and then travel along the Road to Freedom and thus leave the city.  An important difference with this game is that to win it, it is not necessary to come out first.  In fact, since the winner is the player with the most points, even the last to come out can be the winner.&#10;&#10;Content: 6 lead figures to be painted, 6 player cards, 181 adventure cards, 37 market cards, 6 lead cars to be painted, 1 petrol station and 2 lead repair shops to be painted, 3 dice, 400 markers, paper models to be build (optional), and rules.&#10;&#10;This game comes with rules and cards in multiple languages (Italian, French, English, and German).&#10;&#10;",

If the image on the card does not match the image on the chip, the card is flipped back over and the chip is returned to the bag. If the images match, the chip is placed on the card.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who places the chip on a card that creates a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally of 4 consecutive cards with chips on them.&#10;&#10;",
