    "Description": "The Empire of the Sun controls a large island chain far to the east, across the raging sea. They are led by an Emperor who the common folk believe is descended from a divine ancestory. The Emperor is reclusive and mysterious and most of the country is ruled by a warrior aristocracy called the Samurai, or those who serve.&#10;The senior and most powerful samurai in the Emperor's service is his personal warlord called the Shogun. The Shogun does not lead troops in the field but coordinates strategy, administration and logistics among the Daimyo or clan lords. These Daimyo take to the field of battle under the auspices of the Shogun and Emperor. They field their own personal retinues of samurai and ashigaru warriors and lead them into battle. For larger battles many Daimyo will come together and elect a temporary warlord to lead them in battle for that day though this rarely happens.&#10;The Empire has sent trade ships across the Raging Sea and made contact with the Leonid Empire and Sea Elves and does a brisk trade with these nations exchanging rare spices for tin and iron to make steel. The Trade expeditions have also discovered the Land of the Dead and have reported this to the Emperor.&#10;The Emperor now believes that the entire continent to be tainted with the touch of ncromancy and decay. He has sent a large invasion fleet to cleanse the lands and extend his domain into this new world.&#10;&#10;Get Some!

    "Description": "Carthage was founded by nobles from the Phoenician city of Tyre and from Cyprus. From the start it was a complete and independent city on a spot with favorable access to important resources such as clay and sea salt. Carthage in North Africa then became the cradle and center of the Punic state which spread across the Mediterranean. Carthage's military traditions showed its Phoenician roots and reflected native Libyan and Greek influences.&#10;It has traditionally been argued that Carthage was a peaceful city of merchants or a brutal colonial power and both theories were rather dependent upon modern perceptions. Almost all approaches towards Carthage have in common the fact that they do not look at Carthaginian policy-making as such, but rather its structure in a fundamental contrast to that of Rome. However, the polis Carthage was over the course of several centuries the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean and could establish its authority over large territories which were also deeply influenced by the Punic culture.&#10;Ancient authors tend to stress the reliance of Carthage on foreign mercenaries. However, the term 'mercenary' is misleading when applied to the African and Spanish recruits, i.e. from areas controlled by Carthage. They were comparable to Roman Auxilia though Carthage did also employ mercenaries in the true sense as well. These units were mostly deployed in the expeditionary armies overseas, while in Africa Punic militias formed the backbone of the troops. Units were generally segregated by ethnicity which was also a criterion for the respective specialisation.&#10;&#10;Get Some!

    "Description": "The Achaemenid Empire, also known as the First Persian Empire, was founded in the 6th century BC by Cyrus the Great who overthrew the Median confederation. The empire expanded to eventually rule over significant portions of the ancient world which at around 500 BC stretched from the Indus Valley in the east, to Thrace and Macedon on the northeastern border of Greece, making it the biggest empire the world had yet seen. The Persian Empire would eventually control Egypt as well. It was ruled by a series of monarchs who unified its disparate tribes and nationalities by constructing a complex network of roads.&#10;At the height of its power after the conquest of Egypt, the empire spanned three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist foe of the Greek city states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for instituting infrastructures such as a postal system, road systems, and the usage of an official language, Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the King and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.The delegation of power to local governments eventually weakened the king's central authority, causing resources to be expended in attempts to subdue local rebellions. This accounts for the dis-unification of the region by the time Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334 BC.&#10;&#10;Get Some!

Tactics and Command should play the pivotal roles in the battel as well as a little bit of Luck and NOT pimped out units. Armies should be a mix of Melee, Ranged and Magical/Monsterous units. Each should check some of the power of the others in the rock, paper, scissors kind of way, which is similar to actual warfare.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They control a vast empire along that great river and its surrounding rainforest.&#10;&#10;The Wyrmlings use the massive sauroid creatures that dwell within the Great Eleam River basin and other smaller swampy areas around the Known World. Wyrmlings are generally of human height but there are variations such as the smaller Lizardkin who use cameleon like skin to hide among the underbrush and ambush unwary prey and the huge Black Croks who can tear a man in half without blinking. Thier bodies have a natural armor but they make use of shields for extra protection. Weapons tend to be made from natural materials such as bone, teeth and stone.&#10;&#10;Get Some!

Here is a short list of Special Rules you can use with your army. There a few restrictions on the use of Special Rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You have 10 &quot;Points&quot; with which to buy special rules for your army. You can have less than 10 &quot;Points&quot; but not more.&#10;     You can only use a special rule 3 times in your entire list.&#10;     A unit can only have as many special rules as its size characteristic.&#10;&#10;&#10;How to use these rules.&#10;&#10;When you are designing a unit you simply add the points value for the rule to your unit cost BEFORE you multiply for size, confidence level, command skill or mastery level. So the rules become part of your base cost just like weapons, armor and skill.

These intelligences eventually grew and evolved and became new life. These early intelligences wished to be treated as any other sentient being and took the Synod to the courts.&#10;After many years threading their way through the court system and eventually winning in a landmark decision the artificial intelligences who could pass certain tests were allowed to become full citizens of the Universal Synod of Worlds.&#10;They called their new race, the Consensus of Minds or just the Consensus. They claimed dead worlds that none of the other races wished to invest in. These worlds were often rich in metals and cilicates. Eventually the Consensus became the premier operator of mines and factories in the Synod. They churned out legions of bots and drones designed to operate for extended periods in hostile and dangerous environments.&#10;The Consensus spread throughout the Synod and became very influential in all areas of business and manufacturing. Entire systems had been turned into vast hives of drones and massive intelligences that controlled them.&#10;Some of these intelligences began showing signs of instability and eventually all communications were lost with some systems. Any ship that entered these ghost systems never returned. They were quarantined and embargoed. No ships were allowed to enter or leave the system. The Ghost systems have slumbered undisturbed for centuries...&#10;&#10;....until now&#10;&#10;The Ghost forces rely heavily on energy weapons and vast armies of drones. Whether in space or dirtside they seek to overwhelm defending forces with swarms of smaller ships and a phalanx of energy weapons.&#10;&#10;The following pdf will provide unit descriptions and game statistics for a typical Ghost Military Formation and their tactics.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Supplamental Fleet Series&#10;The Supplemental series is meant to provide new units to use in your games. &#10;Some of these units will be unique with their own history and a specific statline that is unique to that unit. &#10;The War against the Synod and their Fallen allies is so vast it is actually numerous wars and battles within the mind bogglingly vast holdings of the Universal Synod of Worlds. Within this enourmous framework literally anything can happen. There is room for any species or government with any level of technology you can imagine.&#10;Some of the PDFs in the series will be additions to already established factions and others will be for completely new factions that are not connected to the struggle between the Terrans and their Allies against the Synod in the Sol Sector. Marauders, Pirates, Interstellar Conquistadores, Mercenaries and Corporate Military Forces all fight for planets and resources within the galaxies controlled by the Synod. New races, new ships, new ground forces and new rules will all be placed in the context of these supplemental PDFs.&#10;&#10;Raiders and Pirates&#10;In this supplement we delve into the Piratical raiders of the Synod Universe. We will see some of their ships as well as some infantry units so you can run boarding actions in your games as smaller sub-games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It uses shared equipment, language and a shared organization to create a unified Terran Defense Force and Terran Expeditionary Legions. It offers citizenship in any of the alliance countries for a five year term of service in the Legions. The Legions take volunteers from any country and have recruiting offices in most countries.&#10;The Legion concept has worked wonderfully and in the last three years since the Centauri and Sentai campaigns 125 Legions have been raised and equipped. They have been training on the new equipment and learning to work together. Legions have been moved to Mars, Botany Bay, Plymouth Rock and Sentai.&#10;&#10;Fighting Vehicles V: Terran Military Forces in the Sol Sector will provide unit descriptions and game statistics for a typical Terran Legion and their tactics.&#10;&#10;This PDF is required to play through the Ghost War Campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Aven prefer to use fast moving, hard hitting but lightly armored forces. They use VTOL based air assault troops, fast GEV tanks and Multi-Mode Fighters. The Aven are natural fighters in urban or mountainous areas as well as the plains. Their use of lightning assaults means they prefer a mobile defense rather than digging in and defending a piece of terrain. The Aven will often mine the key piece of terrain in question and then attack the enemy force from range and try to draw them into chasing the Aven force. If the enemy decides to chase the Aven will pull the enemy force into a series of repeated ambushes by fast moving vehicles while MMF attack from the sky and rear. The enemy force is harrassed until it disperses out of frustration in its inability to bring the Aven to a stand-up fight.&#10;&#10;This will provide unit descriptions and game statistics for a typical Aven War Flock and their tactics.&#10;&#10;This PDF is required to play through the Ghost War Campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Synod Peace Fleet&#10;The Synod is a vast collective of races who pool resources and information. They have a long history of genetic manipulation and terraforming. Culturally they have grown stagnant and some planets are in the process of breaking away from the Synod of Worlds for various reasons. Most of them by force. The Synod has attempted through genetic manipulation to eradicate warlike and violent behavior among the member species of the Synod. The worlds that break away or refuse membership into the Synod are seen by the Synod's governing body, the Allthing, as a dangerous influence to other worlds. Some worlds who are not fully developed but who show violent, warlike tendencies have been destroyed by unknown means. The universe is littered with the bones of civilizations that have been wiped clean from the planets they once populated.&#10;&#10;The following pdf will provide unit descriptions and game statistics for a typical Synod Fleet and their tactics.&#10;&#10;This PDF is required to play through the Alpha Centauri and Sentai Campaigns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The odds are so stacked against the Terrans and their few allies that it literally boggles the mind. They are up against a six billion year old civilization that spans galaxies and controls millions of worlds.

    "Description": "We have stopped two attempts by the invaders to destroy our planet in the last two weeks but we are not safe yet. Not by a long shot. The enemy fleet numbers in the hundreds if not thousands and cover our skies all around the globe. We don't know what is keeping them from a massive attack on all fronts but so far it has worked in our favor.&#10;The intelligence staff thinks they are testing us or possibly trying to learn from us the skills of warfare in a controlled environment but most think that this is ludacris. What they will learn is defeat and destruction.&#10;Already a plan is in motion to learn where these Ghosts come from and launch a counter attack from our fleet in the Sentai system. Before we can do this however we need a Trojan Horse, a Ghost transport ship and the coordinates of their homeworld.&#10;The enemy fleet in orbit has launched another attack, this time aimed at South America. thousands of landing ships and fighters are entering the Earth's atmoshphere. Our Planetary Defense Forts continue to duel with the ships in orbit but they are slowing being reduced one by one to slowly cooling radioactive rubble.&#10;While most of the world's population have taken refuge in deep well hidden redoubts all over the industrialized world the cities and their invaluable infrastructure need to be protected so that when we eventually win we can reclaim our homes and businesses and start rebuilding the world's economy.&#10;It falls on you, our legionnaires to hold back the darkness and prevent the peoples of the Earth from sliding into the abyss of economic and cultural collapse not to mention extinction. No pressure.&#10;&#10;6 more scenarios and background information on the Ghost Fleet's assault on South America during the Siege of Terra.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The two Myrmidons sprinted across the open field and up the cargo ramp, disappearing into the alien cargo ship. The assault team rushed across the open ground and secured a perimeter around the entrance. There were a few flashes of light from deep inside the transport followed by muffled cracks. The radio crackled to life in Carter's ear and a deep voice whispered, &quot;Cargo Bay Secured. Proceeding with Sweep.&quot;&#10;&quot;Sierra, Golf. Rally.&quot; Master Guns' voice boomed over the radio. &quot;Echo, secure this ramp. Eightball, Lucky sweep to the bridge and secure it. Oscar, Victor, with me to engineering.&quot;&#10;Carter and Parker rose up from their covered and concealed position and raced across the open field as fast as they could carrying all of their gear and cumbersome weapons. Their boots squelched in the mud and slowed their progress. Carter's thighs were burning nicely by the time they hit the metal cargo ramp of the alien transport ship. Carter broke left and took cover behind a piece of metal reinforcing rib, while Parker broker right and took up a covering position behind another metal rib. Echo was pulling apart a section of wiring and clipping his black box to it. Echo typed away on the keypad built into his thigh armor. Carter guessed he was trying to hack the craft's control system so they could close the ramp.&#10;The voices of the other team members occasionally whispered or boomed into his earpiece and filled his helmet with information. Giving him something of a shorthand version of the engagement going on inside the ship. The two Myrmidons, Eightball and Lucky, were almost to the bridge while Master Guns and his team where sorting out a brief firefight in a passageway deep within the ship.&#10;While he was listening in he was scanning the right rear of the ship and noticed something in the treeline. &quot;Movement five o clock, two zero zero meters.&quot;&#10;&quot;Roger, almost to engineering.&quot; Master Guns boomed over the muffled sounds of a firefight.&#10;Just as he said that, the metal around Carter began popping and sending small amounts of spalling whipping around the cargo bay. Echo grunted and went down next to him. Blood was starting to spread around his armor plates and Echo began cursing fluently in spanish.&#10;&#10;4 scenarios integrated into the story of Zulu 15, the Frigate &quot;Trident&quot; and the search for the Ghost Worlds during the Siege of Terra.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Ghost 263 system will definitely test the Alliance Fleet's ships and spacers. The system is heavily fortified with roving Ghost ships and fleets as well as numerous ground stations that must be eliminated else the nano machines simply consume local materials and rebuild themselves. The Ghost nano infestation must be eliminated root and branch. Even a simple mining station could expand and become a threat within a few months. The Fleet must drive into the inner system and completely obliterate the core hive world. Only then can the outlying stations and outposts be systematically eliminated. Admiral Holihan and Starpride Leader Wrowk'lo think that the combined forces of Taskforce 7 can accomplish this mission. Admiral Longbeach and the Task Force 5 will cork the bottle in the Kreul system and prevent Ghost forces from escaping into that system. Taskforce 13 under the command of Starpride Leader Lowk'lo and reinforced with SkySword Kreekraw and his fleet carriers will hold the B37c Transfer Station against an escape attempt into that system. The only viable route of retreat for the Ghosts is into the Ghost 152 system and then we have them bottled up we can bring the combined might of Task Forces 5, 7 and 13 to crush them completely.&#10;&#10;The Ghost 263 Fleet Action is the 4th in a series of campaigns to unify the Sol Sector under the hegemony of the Terran Alliance.

    "Description": "The Synod was satisfied, despite the nominal loss of ships and money, that the Terran Alliance had sustained enough damage during the conflict to effectively contain it for the time being. Distracted with numerous wars and encouraged in their complacency by a seemingly contained Terran menace, the Synod has turned to other more pressing conflicts in other sectors. The Synod has contracted the Ghost systems and some Consensus systems to provide garrison troops for Synod held worlds within the Sol Sector. Ghost Fleets patrol the star systems still held by the Synod and provide a deterrent against any Fallen aggression.&#10;&#10;The Ghost Fleet is the primary antagonist in the Great Unification War campaign.

    "Description": "The United States and the European Union have resisted taking sides for almost two decades. Recently, that neutrality has changed. The Joint Special Operations Command has been hunting for the Ghost fleet homeworlds since the siege of Terra. A few weeks ago a deep cover team stumbled upon those coordinates. Posing as a frieghter crew in distress they lured in and captured a courier ship. That ship contained a quantum storage device containing evidence implicating the Synod in a deal with the Ghost systems. The Ghost systems were promised amnesty from Synod aggression and  trade agreements promising the purchase of labor drones in exchange for rare elements. In light of this new information both the US and the EU have sided with the hawks in the Alliance Security Council. A massive fleet and ground force is being assembled in the Alpha Centauri system. Camp Gold has expanded into a sprawling complex of barracks and fortifications. The entire Alpha Centauri System is one huge military complex housing over six million personnel from all of the major powers in the Terran Alliance. Six million humans born and raised to hate the Synod. Cry Havoc! And set loose the dogs of war.&#10;&#10;The Kreul Fleet Action is the first in a series of campaigns to unify the Sol Sector under the hegemony of the Terran Alliance. It provides 4 scenarios detailing the battle for the Kreul space and prepares the way for the ground invasion of Kreul.

The Marine Corps has discovered that units composed mostly of mecha and powered armor are able to drop from orbit and take spaceheads where necessary. Once the spacehead is established the Legions land their Scarab series dropships which haul in hover tanks and APCs into the spacehead.  The Marine Corps mecha and power armor load back up and prepare to drop behind enemy lines or act as a highly mobile strategic reserve. Once on the ground the Legions use their speed and firepower to pin and flank any enemy units they come across.

The Admiral hopes that the confusion and destruction will have stirred the hive and forced them to swarm towards the jump point. The Admiral plans to use a somewhat unstable point called a pirate point near the inner system. The Admiral understands the risks of jumping into the inner system and some ships may be lost to interpenetration due to the gravitational effects of the local star. The advantage of surprise is too great to ignore and may allow the 5th Fleet to land a killing blow right off the bat. The few ships lost on the jump far outwieghs the potential loss of large numbers of ships in a long slow fight from the outer system. Admiral Longbeach will be leading the jump from the Leyte Gulf.&#10;&#10;The Ghost 263 Fleet Action is the 6th in a series of campaigns to unify the Sol Sector under the hegemony of the Terran Alliance.

The missions are pretty generic an can be used in any previous published campaign compatible with either Dirtside II or FUBAR. They can also be used in homebrew campaigns or as stand alone missions.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides 4 complete missions for Dirtside II and FUBAR as well as complete stats for 5 Regiment vehicles and their Dragoon infantry Squad.

    "Description": "Admiral Longbeach needs one of the moons of Jovian planet codenamed, Pool Table, invested and purged of Ghost units. The moon has been nicknamed Eight Ball because its official designation of GS263J8 is not very memorable. Eight Ball is heavily industrialised along the rocky equatorial belt. The rest of the planet is a mass of shifting dunes, hard pan desert and rocky badlands prone to volcanic activity. The moon is a source of strategic metals and gems, like diamonds and rare earth metals. The fact that it is a major hub of Ghost activity makes it a prime source of potential Ghost combat units and must be eliminated if the system is to be secured. The 3rd Marine Landing Battalion supported by the 2nd Drop Brigade of the 4th EuroFor Division and elements of the Russian 6th Guards Tank Division will make a combat drop onto Eight Ball and secure the Ghost factories, minehead and beanstalk anchor. Judas, the Ghost AI turncoat, has provided information on Ghost dispositions and their complete table of organization and equipment. It has also provided Commodore Mestril, Task Force 3-3 Commander, with the enemy communication's code keys and security algorithms. Intel is convinced that this should be a walk in the park.

    "Description": "The Rytec Interstellar Corporation and the Colfire incorporated mining companies both have claims to mineral rights on the planet Zapotec. The planet was initially discovered by a scout probe over a hundred standard years ago and promised untold mineral wealth to anyone willing to invest significant amounts of money in infrastructure and initial colonization. Rytec and Colfire both launched survey ships with an initial load of miners and some basic equipment. The mineral wealth of Zapotec was even more than initial scans indicated.&#10;Both Rytec and Colfire invested heavily over the next three decades and eventually constructed a space elevator together in order to save on transportation costs. At first things went well and miners and equipment flooded into the new colony. In the last few years a new CEO was hired at Rytec Interstellar, Joseph Halsey, and the corporation has become more aggressive in its mining and Colfire has filed numerous protests over claim jumping. Miners have gotten into fist fights with rival miners from both companies. Last month a full blown riot erupted at the space elevator when Rytec personnel insulted a group of Colfire truckers. The final straw was when armed Rytec security personnel seized the lucrative ruby mine #59 on the shores of Lake Nazca.&#10;Rytec has hired Parker's Panthers to seize the remaining mines and raze the Colfire Incorporated executive compound. Colfire has hired the Regiment to secure its assets from Rytec's extremely hostile takeover attempts.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides a complete campaign of 12 linked scenarios for both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II. It also proveds stats for Parker's Panthers vehicles used in the scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mercenaries often work with indigenous forces on their many contracts. These forces are often reservists or poorly trained regulars equipped with second hand equipment that is obsolete more often than not. These forces however are not to be completely discounted as effective fighting forces and can provide a mercenary a cheap bu effective method to hold less important objectives. They can also be used to provide cheap anti-aircraft defenses, artillery support or VTOL reconnaissance and attack capability.&#10;&#10;Opposition forces are often armed with the same equipment as the local forces a mercenary has been tasked with supporting. In these cases mercenaries and their supporting local forces often paint stripes on their vehicles to help mitigate friendly fire.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides complete stats and description of 11 different vehicles and a TO&amp;E for a local Company level combined arms team for both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II.

    "Description": "The Regiment is sometimes hired for a single important mission inside of a wider campaign. These missions are high risk but high reward and the Regiment has been hired because local forces are incapable of accomplishing it.  The missions could be in support of a colonial kleptocrat who is under siege by rebel groups or in protecting vital infrastructure for corporate bloc oligarchs. This missions in this brief are four typical combat missions an can be used to &quot;fatten up&quot; a campaign of storyline missions.&#10;&#10;The missions are pretty generic an can be used in any previous published campaign compatible with either Dirtside II or FUBAR. They can also be used in homebrew campaigns or as stand alone missions.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides 4 complete missions for Dirtside II and FUBAR as well as complete stats for 5 Regiment vehicles and their Dragoon infantry Squad. It also includes a quick points calculation for creating your own vehicles using the FUBAR rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Johnson's Rock is a planet in the Signus system and is rich in heavy minerals and industrial gemstones. The Olepak Corporation sponsored the first colonization efforts in an attempt to exploit the natural resources of Johnson's Rock. Olepak invested heavily in infrastructure and tranportation costs for miners and their familes to relocate to Johnson's Rock. In the past two hundred years the Olepak Corporation has steadily erroded the pay and rights of the workers in order to maximize profits and increase mining quotas to fulfill increasing demand for raw materials, especially metals and industrial grade diamonds. The workers have endured a stagnation in pay and an increase in workhours to the point where the average worker works 70+ hours a week in horrific conditions. Olepak Corporation has also instituted a company store policy and most miners are indebted to the Olepak Corporation for the next decade just to put food on the table and a roof over their families heads. Mining on Johnson's Rock is extraordinarily hazardous and miners have a 10% death rate per year. The mining families are trapped on world and sons an daughters with no other options hire on with the Olepak Corporation as miners or support staff. In the last few months miners have begun protesting their treatment and many mines have temporarily shut down due to strikes by miners. The Olepak Corporation hired thugs to break the strikes and more than a few arms as well. A few ringleaders for the miner's groups have been found murdered or dead in a mine shaft and no one has been charged with the crimes. In the wake of the deaths, the various mining groups have hired the Thunderbolt Division with the promise of a percenage of the profits if the miner's take over operations themselves. The Olepak Corporation in turn has hired the Regiment to squash the rebellion and push the Thunderbolt Division off planet.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides a complete campaign of 12 linked scenarios for both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II. It also provides stats for Thunderbolt Division vehicles used in the scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Ysgard system contains a Bifrost Bridge and could be used as a base of resistance by the Synod or their allies. The Deputy Undersecretary of State for the Terran Alliance has hired the Black Company to supplament the Diplomatic Protection Service in protecting the diplomats sent to negotiate a treaty with the planetary Administrator of Ysgard. The DPS will protect the ambassador directly while the Black Company will be acting as a backup and heavy extraction force in case the ambassador is attacked.&#10;The Synod Security Services (SSS) maintain a substantial presence on Ysgard and would go to extreme lengths to kill,capture or compromise the ambassador.

The Synod Security Services have a tight hold on the Planetary Administrator who will not agree to any treaty as long as the SSS is onworld. The Planetary Administrator needs to have total deniability and suggested to Mr. Johnson during the treaty talks that if the SSS were no longer a viable threat that he would seriously consider signing the treaty. The intel that Bravo Squad acquired during their last visit to Ysgard was significant and has allowed Mr. Johnson and his team to formulate a plan to undermine and weaken the SSS and at the same time winning the loyalty of the people of Ysgard. As former citizens of the Synod of Worlds the Black Company is the perfect choice to infiltrate the world and conduct the mission without arousing suspicion.&#10;&#10;This PDF provides a short campaign of 4 linked scenarios for the FiveCore Skirmish Gaming Evolved and its supplement Five Parsecs from Home.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The British navy saved the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;King &amp; Kaiser is the first scenario book for the second edition of Grand Fleets. Within these pages, you will find everything you need to fight out the near-run thing that was the Great War at sea.&#10;&#10;While great armies slogged through the Flanders mud and clashed over a sun-dried patch of Anatolian rock, the course of human affairs was directed by the men and machines that steamed the oceans of the world. Across the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea, two powerful navies battled for supremacy, a life-and-death struggle that resonated throughout the twentieth century.&#10;&#10;In addition to more than fifty data cards detailing ships of the Kaiserliche Marine and the Royal Navy, King &amp; Kaiser includes half a dozen scenarios from the early years of World War I. Take on the role of Spee, Beatty, Hipper, or Admiral Sir John Jellicoe&mdash;the only man who could lose the war in an afternoon.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to keep the German threat bottled up at Kiel, making the seas safe for democracy? Or can you break the back of the Grand Fleet and provide for the German Empire her place in the sun?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The famous battle at Hoovers Gap started a legend for Wilder's Brigade.  Like all legends it was subject to many stretches of the truth.  Uncovering the story has taken some time, reading battle accounts, sorting through many inconsistencies.&#10;&#10;As with all battles there is much confusion, soldiers recall their perspective which may be clouded by many factors.  Even the various battle maps available conflict with each other, they also conflict with the geological lay of the land.  I decided to use some modern technology, Google Earth, and looked at the actual land.&#10;&#10;Suddenly it became much easier to piece together accounts.  Deployments of the troops had some meaning in relation to the land, tactically the battle now had some meaning.  Battlefield accounts of the time could now be put into place like a jigsaw puzzle.&#10;&#10;This study of the battle at Hoovers Gap does not aim to be the most authorative on the battle.  It does throw a new perspective on the battle, demistifying the legends and providing a more accurate tactical view of the battle.&#10;&#10;This guide includes a study of the forces involved and how to use this with the TFP Games rules &quot;These Fields of Blood&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the complete rulebook for playing Kaiju Kaos: Smackdown.&#10;&#10;The modern world as we know it ceased to exist in 2003 when the Rift, a mysterious tear in the space-time continuum, opened up and Hell itself spewed forth onto planet Earth. Long-dormant arcane powers and abilities once believed to be myth suddenly manifested in unsuspecting hosts, while those apparent charlatans who truly had a finger on the pulse of the supernatural unknown found their powers doubled or tripled in strength.&#10;&#10;Creatures that go bump in the night and ancient deities reappeared around the globe to spread terror and destruction. Terrible, enormous, 50-foot-tall monsters with feet the size of automobiles emerged from the oceans, crawled out from crevices, or arrived from outer space for reasons unknown.&#10;&#10;The United Nations formed an elite unit of the best and brightest soldiers and Specialists from around the world to answer this new Kaiju threat. Meanwhile, greed, corruption, and curiosity drove others to arms in an effort to harness the powers awakened by the Rift and cause further chaos while positioning themselves in places of power. Still others suffered such personal loss that vengeance became their only motivator in entering the fight. And others were driven by belief and conviction, the elements of their faith rejuvenated by the powers unleashed by the Rift.&#10;&#10;Now, we stand poised on the edge of extinction. A new status quo must emerge, for the very survival of the human race hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;What is Kaiju Kaos?&#10;Kaiju Kaos is a tabletop miniatures game where two or more players pit their hand-painted metal and resin armies against one another. Kaiju Kaos is a strategic skirmish game. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of lining up models on the table and the person who goes first is the winner. Kaiju Kaos requires cunning and adaptability because at any time an opponent can drastically alter the current situation with an unexpected action or a lucky roll of the dice. A solid strategy and good implementation combined with a little luck will enable the weakest troopers to bring down the mightiest monster. There are various unnamed troopers and specialists to build armies with, but the true heart of Kaiju Kaos is in the characters &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re human, Kaijin, or colossal Kaiju bent on destroying everything in their path.&#10;&#10;Smackdown is a &ldquo;death match&rdquo; variation of Kaiju Kaos where players quickly battle using one or more 45mm tall character models on a 2x2 foot tabletop. The object of the game is to be the last model standing by defeating your enemies. Every faction in Kaiju Kaos, along with a healthy dose of mercenaries, will be represented in Smackdown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Prior to leaving CA, Dr. Kaos was working on various Top Secret projects for both the government and private investors &ndash; whomever was willing to pay the most. His projects ranged from new armor and weaponry to cybernetics to human gene manipulations and time travel. Recently it has come to light that Dr. Kaos was able to make technological advances in theoretical time travel through a machine he calls the Rift Device. It is believed that blueprints to create a Rift Device prototype were misplaced in the doctor&rsquo;s old lab.

The battle for the Hegemony of the seven seas is about to begin.&#10;&#10;Impersonate one of the four power-hungry captains and lead your ship to the archipelago chosen for the challenge. Create your winning strategy and hit your opponents with cannon shots to conquer the coveted Black Bones title.&#10;&#10;Everything is permissible to attempt to sink the enemy and his rabble; cannon shots, effect balls, lasers and even unleash the wrath of the terrible kraken.&#10;&#10;For all the forks, what are you waiting for? Don't be a bilge rat.&#10;&#10;Raise the flag and set the dust on fire, glory awaits you.&#10;&#10;A fighting and strategy game based on turn mechanics.&#10;Opponents fight in an area divided into squares trying to defeat each other.&#10;Using cards or resources they find by exploring the board.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;A game is divided into rounds of play. In your turn you can move your vessel trying to find the  Cannonball tile to attack.&#10;Then it will be up to the other participants and then back to you and so on until a player gets the win. Use your cards to move and act from your vessel.&#10;During the first round, no offensive action can be taken !!!&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT&#10;During your round the vessel allows to move in a straight line, in an orthogonal or diagonal direction in the number of boxes you want. When you finish a move by stopping on a covered tile, uncover it and play. Once done, the tile must be removed from the board. You can also stop on a box that does not contain tiles, in which case nothing will happen. You have the right to at least one move per turn, if you have Additional Movement cards you can make other moves. You can make moves and offensive Actions in the order you prefer, alternating them as many times as you want based on your possibilities.&#10;For example: your vessel can move three spaces, find a Cannonball tile, use an Additional Movement card and move three more squares, shoot an opponent, play another Additional Movement card by moving five more spaces and end up on a box finnding a Fog card.&#10;&#10;IMPASSABLE BOX&#10;A vessel cannot cross or stop on a space occupied by another player or on a Rock tile.&#10;&#10;OFFENSIVE ACTIONS &#10;To shoot or take offensive actions by using the cards you have find a Cannonball tile.&#10;You can decide to shoot whenever you want but you CANNOT have more than one cannon ball at the same time, so if you already have one and find another in the next round you are forced &#3;to fire a shot immediately. You can shoot along a straight orthogonal or diagonal trajectory from your position. You can shoot enemy vessels or destroy Rock tiles visible from your location.&#10;You can use the cards to change the effect of your shots.&#10;&#10;HIT SHOTS &#10;When you get hit by an opponent vessel, without you being able to defend yourself with the cards you have available, you must place &#3;a hit marker on your score card.&#10;ATTENTION!!! With three hits you are out of the game!&#10;&#10;WIN THE GAME &#10;The last vessel in the game wins the battle.&#10;ATTENTION!!! Should the tiles in the game end and there is not yet a winner, all the remaining vessels have to be placed at their respective starting points, all the tiles, including the Cannonballs set aside, reshuffled and the game board set up again to continue the battle until only one remains!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some spaces on the track are marked with events that may require a player's car to move forward or backward additional spaces, or to lose one or more turns.&#10;&#10;The game's only real outstanding feature is its colorful, cartoonish artwork.

There are also rampant dust storms, errant robotic threshers, and...FrankenCrops? No worry. As they say, the early bird gets the worm, and any taters attached to that worm.&#10;&#10;Farmageddon is a game of skillful hand management for 2-4 players that takes 30 minutes to play. Choose when to plant, what to fertilize, and with a little luck, you'll be the master of the farmers' markets when the dust settles.&#10;&#10;The Farm Fresh Edition of Farmageddon brings several changes to the farm and is the best way yet to get your hands dirty. In addition to beautiful new illustrations and a brand-new layout for the cards, we've used our years of experience to make this the best looking and playing version of Farmageddon ever. For veteran Farmageddon players, the gameplay updates include removing fields, which allows players to stay involved in every turn, and allows for more planting strategies. The FrankenCrops and Farmer cards have been revised or completely re-imagined to be more to be more balanced, more interesting, and to allow for more creative play.&#10;&#10;There's never been a better time to have a weird day at the farm.&#10;&#10;-Publisher&rsquo;s Description&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have you ever been watching soccer and thought man, this is boring!   I wish these humans were vehicles.  Like a tank, a train, a spaceship and even a boat.&#10;&#10;Vehicular Arrangers does exactly that.  Using the basic principles of soccer and some interesting physics, players try to score on the opposing player's goal, just like soccer.  &#10;If you ever wondered what would happen when a sailboat meets a tank on a soccer field, you&rsquo;re in luck.  Spoiler alert! The tank flatters the sailboat!  Each vehicle has a special move that ensures even more mayhem on the field.&#10;&#10;Vehicular Arrangers is a two-player card game that simulates vehicles playing soccer.  The game is played by making simultaneous decisions on each turn.  Those decisions direct players&rsquo; vehicles across a hex grid field.  Some of these decisions will cause vehicles to spin out and crash; others will allow a vehicle to score a goal.  A player wins when they score the most goals before the decks run out of cards.  If tied, players reshuffle, sudden death starts, and the next goal wins.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds.  Players simultaneously assign cards to their vehicles behind a screen and once everyone is ready, they reveal them.  Then they execute the actions of their cards in initiative order among all players. Vehicles will bump other vehicles, vehicles will dribble and kick the ball, and things will lob into the air over other and into other things.&#10;&#10;There are 4 special cards in each player deck that embrace the special properties of each vehicle. Tanks crush other vehicles.  Trains can drag objects behind them.  Spaceships can teleport.  Boats can pull objects to them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
