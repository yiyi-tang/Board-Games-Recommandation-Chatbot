Of course the name sounds like Al Capone, but this game is by Valentin Herman so &quot;Valcapone&quot; fits well.&#10;&#10;This is a more recent Fanfor design and that means it is a DTP publication that was printed in very limited edition and comes as a kit to cut out. Like most of Herman's games, this one is a business and economic game, although this time the theme is the gangster underworld as each player tries to make the most money illegally.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1907, gravel-pit worker Daniel Hartmann found a human lower jaw bone in the pit at Mauer, east of Heidelberg. However, this was no crime scene - it was a scientific sensation. Hartmann immediately realized the significance and burst into the local pub declaring that he had just found Adam! The jaw was actually from Homo heidelbergensis, about 600,000 years old, so not from Adam but from Adam's Ancestor (Adam's Ahn). Until recently it was the oldest known man or woman. This game has been made to mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery.&#10;&#10;",

Just like in the book, it has to be estimated how much the little rabbit loves the big rabbit.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the hare figure is assembled and placed in front of the oldest player. The cords are placed in front of the oldest players. The bunny cards come in the middle of the board and the game can start.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. First of all, all players - except for the player who is just the &quot;little rabbit&quot; - close their eyes. The &quot;little bunny&quot; then pulls a string and attaches it to the rabbit figure. In the first round, the oldest player is the &quot;little rabbit&quot;, then always the next player in a clockwise direction. If the &quot;little bunny&quot; has attached the string, he calls &quot;Guess how much I love you&quot; and all players are allowed to open their eyes.&#10;&#10;Players now need to assess the length of the string that the &quot;little rabbit&quot; has chosen. The players grab as quickly as possible one of the rabbit cards from the middle, on which always a string is shown. Of course, each string on each rabbit card has a different length, of course, if possible, you should choose the rabbit card with the right string length.&#10;&#10;Once each player has taken a card, the &quot;little rabbit&quot; now determines which player has taken the right one. He takes the cord and places it on the respective cards. If a player chooses the right rabbit card, he gets a chip for it. If no player has chosen a correct card, the &quot;little bunny&quot; himself gets the chip. The cards come back to the middle of the table, as well as the string. Then the player to the left of the previous &quot;little rabbit&quot; is the new &quot;little rabbit&quot; and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has collected three chips. This player then automatically wins the game.&#10;&#10;A variant suggests that players can earn an extra chip once they get the right string length and then ask, &quot;Do you really know how much I love you?&quot; as original as possible. As another alternative, the chip can only be awarded for the correct string length if the player brings an original explanation that no other player had before.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The grandfather clock in the Pimpola Manor has stopped. Turns out that there are ghosts living inside the clock, and they don't like the striking of the clock. In order to get the clock working again, you have to find a new place for the ghosts to live in. Luckily, in the attic there's a wardrobe in which all the ghosts could easily fit.&#10;&#10;This is a simple roll-and-move game. The first player to get all his ghosts inside the wardrobe wins. On the way to the attic there are four special spaces. Whenever a ghost lands on one of these spaces, it might sneak out for a nap, go doing pranks, or simply run back into the grandfather clock.&#10;&#10;This game belongs to Peliko's line of children's games illustrated by Mauri Kunnas. Included in the box are a game board, a wardrobe, a die, and 16 ghosts in four player colors.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Skarbnica Gier&quot; means &quot;The Games Treasury&quot;. It is a compendium of abstract board games compiled by Lech Pijanowski - a Polish game expert and designer. The games he described are of three categories: traditional games (about 40%); modern games by various authors (about 40%, a lot by Sid Sackson); and finally his own creations (about 20%).&#10;&#10;The package has a unique form of a double book. The left one contains the rules of the games, the right one the figures. Such a design simplifies understanding examples a lot! Four chessboards are added as separate inserts: 8x8, 10x10, 12x12 and a &quot;domino-board&quot; 6x12.&#10;&#10;Chapters of the book:&#10;- 8x8 board games (8)&#10;- 10x10 board games (12)&#10;- 12x12 board games (4)&#10;- domino games (12)&#10;- pencil &amp; paper games (12)&#10;- simple accessories games (6)&#10;- sophisticated accessories games (10)&#10;&#10;",

The cards have effects on the others' influence groups but also on his own influence groups, in the form of money revenues or expenditures and in the form of credibility gains or losses.&#10;&#10;A standard game has six voting rounds and before the ballot the players could use their diplomatic skills for negotiating good deals with the other players (but of course, they could be betrayed!). After the six voting rounds the winner is the player with more money and which is, at least, among the first three in credibility.&#10;&#10;",

Although the game is quite simple, there is some ambition in it. The riders are supposed to climb  the Tourmalet, Lagos de Covadonga and the Mortirolo mountains. The teams are composed of four riders (well, counters colored in green, purple, yellow and red, each color for a team), one of them being the leader. The leader has the privilege of something called turbo, which is not more than throwing two dice instead of one. This can be done four times during the race.&#10;&#10;",

Another possibility to plant a tree is to collect three cards of a type (animal or plant) in a row.&#10;Every time you plant a tree you get a certificate. The third possible card is a question card, which can be asked to any player. If he has a sin card in his hand, the questioner gets a certificate, otherwise the questioner has to give one certificate to the other player. The player can also lie about having a sin card. Then the player can ask for a vote of confidence and the player, who loses must pay two certificates.&#10;Players then replenish their hands and have to fight off the bulldozers. A clearing card is being revealed and the players have to match the values on the card with the values on their disclaimer cards. If they win, the difference is payed out in form of trees and certificates. If they lose, the bulldozers move for every point of difference into the forest.&#10;In the end the players win, if 25 trees are planted. The player with most certificates is the overall winner.

    "Description": "Mine-Shaft Gap simulates a battle for resources on, above, and under the surface of a lifeless but treacherous planetoid. Players must seek out valuable metals and fuel materials and mine them, using the materials to feed their home planets, and inch closer to victory, while at the same time allocating resources to maintain or strengthen their armed forces and fortifications. Drill tanks tunnel beneath the surface of the planet while drilling stations pound away from above. Drilling stations are faster and more efficient, but are vulnerable to attack from above and even capture by enemy troops. But tunnels can cave in&hellip; And market forces are unpredictable. The resource making your planet rich today might be better off greasing the treads of your tanks tomorrow!&#10;&#10;The game takes place on two maps &ndash; one representing ground level and above, the other representing underground terrain. The rules differ slightly depending upon the map on which action occurs. At the beginning of the game, the subterranean map is unmarked: it is solid. As the game progresses, units will drill beneath the surface of the planet, creating tunnels through which they and other units can explore the sub-surface, mining for riches and engaging each other in combat. Each map parallels the other, in that each hex on one map represents the same coordinates, just at a radically different elevation (above or below ground) on the other map. Maps are labeled in columns and rows so that it is possible to find corresponding hexes quickly. Hex B4 on the surface map is considered to be directly above hex B4 on the subterranean map, and so on. It is recommended that a new subterranean map be printed out for each game, so that it can be marked throughout the game and discarded at the end.&#10;&#10;Counters represent mobile units such as drill tanks, transport vehicles, hovertanks, missile launchers, atmo-craft, and squads of infantry with jump-jet powered armour; structures such as command posts and drilling stations; extracted resources; and rubble. They are printed with varying information. Resource counters show the type and quantity of resource with a letter and number. Units are printed with a movement type, attack strength, range, defense strength, and movement points.&#10;&#10;Elements include tactical level sf combat using a terrain-and-elevation-based combat system, satellite searches for ore deposits, in-game allocation of resources to build units and outposts, resource extraction and re-use, resource allocation towards victory, varying resource value depending on market fluctuations, airstrikes, cave-ins, and underground combat.&#10;&#10;",

Each set has a red, a white and a blue die.&#10;&#10;Server rolls their dice first. If the serve is good (indicated on the red Server die), then receiver rolls their dice as well and proceed as in paragraph below. If the serve is out (indicated on the red server die), receiver scores a point. The appropriate person (according to the rules of tennis) then takes the Server dice and begins a new point by rolling the Server dice as previous.&#10;&#10;The dice are always read in the order Red-White-Blue and alternating between the Server's dice and the Receiver's dice. The dice say things like 'Serve Good', 'Lob Good', 'Return Out', 'Overhead Smash Out', etc. So, first read the red Server die - if the serve is good, read the red Returner die - if good, read the white Server die - if good, read the white Returner die... Continue alternating reading the dice until the ball goes out or all the dice are read and the ball is still good. Score as in tennis. Switch dice when changing server.&#10;&#10;",
