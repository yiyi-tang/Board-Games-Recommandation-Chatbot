    "Description": "After the death of the beloved Royal Mage of the kingdom, the king of the land set out a challenge to find his replacement. Wizards from far and wide came to vie for the position. Not all of them were kind and happy wizards, but the old royal mage made sure to leave some nasty tricks behind just for them. Traps and curses of all kinds were left strewn about his hiding places, now being plundered by the wizards seeking to replace him. Will they survive to claim the prize?&#10;&#10;Lootin' Wizards: Quick Change is the second, and much anticipated, expansion for the group card/board game where you race around trying to get more loot than your opponents. Now, you can you make spells to actually alter the reality of the world your wizard is racing through. This crazy expansion introduces new Markers to place on the board (changing the very face of the map), the ability to play with up to two more players in a game (up to 8 when used with the basic game), and a great mix of new Spell and Loot cards to add to the mix.&#10;&#10;",

There is nothing in the rules for Cadets that would not apply to the full version, too. Only, as in life, also in Pacific 1942it is true that grey is the theory and green is the tree of life. So how does the full version differ? &#10;The basic difference is represented by several slight modifications meant to make it more difficult to keep track of the opponent&rsquo;s strength and intentions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The area the Australians had taken on July 10th included the coastal ridge from Point 26 up to Point 33 and extended from the coast, south to the railway line. The surrounding terrain was flat and open, offering little or no cover.  In such a flat expanse, ridges and rises a mere twenty or thirty yards above sea level give commanding vantage points to their occupants. The height advantage is so slight that one can scarcely appreciate it until actually upon the feature. The 26th Brigade began the difficult task of digging in while reinforcements of artillery, anti-tank guns and machine guns were quickly brought in. Rommel now gave his inevitable response; an all out counterattack to retake this vital ground using threadbare units. Over the next five days, holding this salient would prove extremely tough, with some places changing hands several times. At times the shelling on Tel el Eisa itself made it too hot for either side to occupy.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each turn is 12 hrs, with 400 yard hexes. Units are company and platoons for AFVs.&#10;&#10;After the Australians had nearly ruptured the Italian line on July 10, Rommel diverted many of this available troops to stop the hemorrhage as it threatened his rear area. However, the coastline ridge of hills and the Hill of Jesus (Tel el Eisa) barred their success. Once the Australians had secured their advance and held the hills, Rommel had no choice but to try to seize them back and from the 10th through 15th, this is what he did.&#10;&#10;",

The playable nations are: Germany, Italy, Japan, USSR, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Kuomintang (KMT), France (Free &amp; Vichy), Netherlands, neutrals and Britisch Commonwealth Nations divided into UK, Canada, South Africa, India and Australia.&#10;&#10;The map offers you geographical features such as rivers and mountains that have their own influence on the units. When set up, the game starts with a couple of events that took place before 1939. You have to roll for the Second Sino-Japanese war and for the Spanish Civil War to start with. The Long March, The purge and the Winter War all take place in what is called turn zero.Starting turn 1 you may roll for nation specific technologies. Urban Warfare, Burma Road, Lend Lease, Convoys, International and Territorial Waters, Ports, Elite Infantry, Partisans, Spanish Blue Division, Political Leaders are elements that enhance the realistic feel of the game.&#10;&#10;The goal is to win a bronze, silver or gold (historical) victory over your enemies.&#10;&#10;Rules for which Axis and Allies and Xeno pieces can not be used:&#10;-Weather effects like rain, heat, snow, fog and wind effect your troop's mobility. You can make your own weather markers or use the Litko Aerosystems weather markers.&#10;-Oil Derricks (we recommend Petropolis pieces) and oil drums (we recommend the supply counters from Axis and Allies Battle of the Bulge)&#10;-Commanders (we recommend 1/72 scale minis, Table Tactics jeeps or Axis and Allies miniatures commanders) Commanders allow surrender or retreat options.&#10;-Elite Infantry (we recommend 1/72 scale minis or AA Miniatures&#10;&#10;To get all the miniatures to play all the rules is a bit of work, but remember you can also use them to make house rules for your regular Axis and Allies games or use the Sitzkrieg rules as an expansion to your own games.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with 7 tiles which are used to score the most points by creating sets and runs. If players are able to finish off a run or set, that player receives double or triple the points for that round.

One player draws a tile and describes the image on it while the others search for the matching grid space on their player mats.  The first to correctly identify the matching space wins the tile, and the player with the most matching tiles at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;This is a great game for children who are developing oral language skills or vocabulary, and would be fun with any age to practice a foreign language.&#10;&#10;The game rules come in 8 languages and the game itself is language independent.&#10;&#10;The game suggests an age of 6 and up, but I think that this game could easily be used with much younger children.&#10;&#10;",

There are 49 balls, 24 and 24 in the color in the players and one special ball placed in the inner 7x7 grid (it can be random, or the players put their balls step by step, or they choose a starting position together).

The game end if the special ball has 4 neighbors of the same color (that is the winning color).&#10;&#10;",

Even grandmothers turn into rabid weasels over a game of Pitstop.&#10;&#10;What is Pitstop? A fun family card game based on a simple idea: Players race each other to complete a run of numbered &quot;Lap&quot; cards; then be the first to play the checkered flag card to win the game.&#10;But there&rsquo;s a catch. Pitstop cards lurk in the deck and they can ruin any dreams of a quick win.&#10;A game of Pitstop can be fast and furious because players can play all the cards in their hand in one turn and Lady Luck, in the form of prized wild cards, can make or break a racing career in a hurry.&#10;&#10;One of the best things about Pitstop is that it can take as little as 5 minutes for one game or all day for a Pitstop tournament. Race Season rules are included for a 10-race, 20-race or whatever-race competition.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 108 unique, racing-themed plastic-coated playing cards, divided into two decks. English and Spanish rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Variation of the (German?) classic game &quot;Kofferpacken&quot;. There are 108 item cards. The starting player announces that aunt Klara packs her suitcase and takes item X (puts tile on the table). The next player puts another tile on top, announcing that aunt Klara packs item X and item Y. Continue until somebody cannot repeat the entire list of things stacked up. That player has to take all stacked tiles. The first player to run out of tiles is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In a dividing strip of the game board, there is a &quot;rope&quot; marker, that each player tries to pull to his/her side. This is achieved by setting up certain positions of one's playing pieces, such as three in a straight line, diagonal or certain color combination. The player who pulls the &quot;rope&quot; closest is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cooperative game about protecting wildlife in little ponds. Each player has a pond and tries to fill it with different animals (frogs, dragonflies, etc.). There is a special die showing which animal to put into one's pond, but it also has a digger side. If a player rolls this symbol, a piece is added to a digger puzzle. For the neutral clover leaf side, one can put an environmentalist (pawn) in front of the digger. If eight protesters are in front of the digger before it is completed, the first player to fill up his/her pond with eight animals, wins. Otherwise, everybody loses.&#10;&#10;Only two of each animal can be in a pond. A player who rolls an animal that is already in his/her pond twice, has to &quot;donate&quot; the roll to another player.&#10;&#10;",
