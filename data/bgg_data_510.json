    "Description": "This traditional game of ancient India is described by game historian R.C. Bell as a &quot;square board race game.&quot; The game is played on a 5x5 grid which would have been marked out on the ground. The center space is the castle and the middle squares on each side of the board are serve as a player's palace. Each player uses four small sticks as their pieces. Four tamarind seeds marked with three white sides and three dark sides to function as dice.&#10;&#10;The pieces start off the board.    A &quot;1&quot; must be rolled to move a piece onto the board. The pieces first travel counterclockwise around the outside of the board and then travel through the inner nine squares in a clockwise spiral pattern until they reach the castle square at the center of the board. Once all four of a player's pieces have reached the central castle square, the player begins trying to bear them off the board. For each &quot;1&quot; rolled a player may remove one piece from the castle. The first player to remove all four pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;When a player moves onto a square containing the piece or pieces of an opposing player, the opponent's pieces are removed from the board and must start the journey again. However, this rule does not apply to the palace and castle spaces, which are safe havens. In addition, under certain circumstances a player may pair together two pieces as a &quot;twin&quot; which permits them to move together and which may only be sent off the board by another &quot;twin&quot; piece.&#10;&#10;A more elaborate form of the game, known as The King's Thayaam, is played on a board double the size and uses eight tamarind seeds as dice instead of four.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to the Indian games Saturankam and Ashta-Kashte.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes a spinner, a game board and four wooden pieces as well as directions on how to play the game.

After more spins that piece and others moved around the board and eventually wound up in the home square. Successfully getting all pieces into the home square resulted in you winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

Please note though that they are NOT a 'five minutes and out with the dice' ruleset. The rules themselves run to 48 pages or so, with army lists from the First Crusade and references taking it to a cool 60 pages in total.&#10;&#10;The main principles can be learnt pretty quickly however and after a few games, you will only need the supplied 'quick reference' sheet for much of any game, using the main book for special reference where necessary.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the introduction, p.2:&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules are primarily designed for the wars in the Middle East around the time of the Crusades.  In practice they can be used for warfare in Central and East Asia, the Middle East and around the Mediterranean.  Many armies over this range used tactics and organizations common to the Crusades.&#10;&#10;The rules start with the Heraclean &quot;crusade&quot; against the Sasanids and the early Arab conquests.  They carry through to the Crusade of Nicopolis against the Ottomans (1396AD).&#10;&#10;The rules emphasize the tactics used by the various Latin, Middle Eastern, Central and East Asian armies of this time.  The important feature of warfare of this era was the dominance of the mounted warrior.  A wide variety of tactics were used, from the traditional Arabic karr wa farr tactics to the furious Latin charge and the versatile Mamluk.  The rules are not intended to cover warfare by different armies of different eras.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Cards represent &#10;rocks and geological processes, these must be collected and displayed in the &#10;right order depending on the Rock Cycle (see below). Each single card tells &#10;what are the preceding and the following cards.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Burial: heat-pressure&quot; card is very important as it allows the transformation&#10;of a sedimentary/igneous rock into a metamorphic one. It is essential that the &#10;preceding card and the following card are logically ordered. The exact sequence&#10;is described in the &quot;Burial: heat-pressure&quot; card. That means that if you have &#10;&quot;Granite&quot;, you have to link it to &quot;Gneiss&quot; and nothing else.&#10;N.B. Chalk should be treated as Limestone (i.e. changes into &quot;Marble&quot;).&#10;&#10;1- Shuffle cards and deal 5 each. Place the remaining deck, face-down, at the &#10;    centre of the table; reveal the first card and place it &quot;face up&quot; next to the deck.&#10;2- Players have to arrange the five cards in &quot;rock cycle&quot; order: each player &#10;    have to decide, according to the cards in his/her hand, which &quot;section&quot; of&#10;    the Rock Cycle would be more convenient to build upon. Players should not&#10;    reveal their cards.&#10;3- In turn, clockwise, each player pick either the top card from the deck or the &#10;    face-up card next to it. Then he/she has to discard one card; this will be placed &#10;    face-up next to the deck. Once the card has been discarded, the next player can &#10;    pick a card and so on.&#10;4- When a player has put all five cards in order he/she will reveal them all and,&#10;     if the other players acknowledge the right order, he/she is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "3P2K, or Plain and Precious Parts 2000 is a sequel to the 1984 LDS game, Celestial Pursuit. The game is designed to be played by two teams, but it can also be played by four individual players. The goal is to be the first to get four Touchstones by answering trivia questions correctly. The game includes 2,000 trivia questions in four categories. Book of Mormon, Bible, Hymns, and Prophets/Prophecy. Categories are chosen by rolling a die (which the game refers to as the &quot;perfect polyhedron.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the basic version of the game, players need only collect four touchstones to win. In the advanced version, players need to collect one touchstone from each category.&#10;&#10;The answers to all questions are referenced to the scripture or hymn they come from so that players can study subjects they didn't know.&#10;&#10;The author originally wanted to reprint Celestial Pursuit, but felt that the questions and rules were too complex for family play so he created 3P2K instead.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&quot;3P2K has long been on the mind of one of Celestial Pursuit's authors. Realizing from his own family the need for Gospel-based alternatives to the modern world's fast-paced entertainments, the author created Plain &amp; Precious Parts 2000, or 3P2K.&#10;&#10;The 1984 version of Celestial Pursuit seemed too difficult and timebound in its adult questions and too complex in its rules to simply be reprinted. 3P2K was therefore created to best serve LDS families in the year 2000 and beyond by emphasizing gospel principles and naturally creating opportunities for doctrinal discussion.&#10;&#10;By focusing on four basic areas of Gospel knowledge (Bible, Book of Mormon, Hymns, Prophets &amp; Prophecy), 3P2K simplifies question content and lends timelessness to referenced answers. Specific attention was given to the idea of plain &amp; precious parts of doctrine as the questions were written. Many questions are based on truths learned from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and from footnote references in the LDS Scriptures. Providing both adult and child cards allows family participation from the simplest Sunbeam to the sagest scriptorian.&quot;&#10;&#10;Related game:&#10;&#10;    Celestial Pursuit&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Once a player finds the image he/she will slam their magnifying glass onto it. If it's correct, the player gets to keep the image disk as a token. Many images are tricky to find because all the little &quot;nosies&quot; slightly differ in body position, nose color, costume color, etc. If the player pointed out the wrong image, he/she will have to pay one of their tokens. At the end of the game, the player with the most tokens wins.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 4 games boards, 7 plastic magnifying glasses, 1 bag, 138 image disks, 1 rule book.&#10;&#10;",

The part which Canada is playing in the whole war, and in the crucial Battle of the Atlantic in particular, will undoubtedly be better appreciated by both young and old after playing this game and digesting some of the information contained here.&quot;&#10;&#10;The contents consist of one cardstock sheet, 14&quot; by 35&quot;, printed in three colours and folded into four panels like a menu. Six markers are available to be cut out from one margin of the board, as well as a six-sided top to be used as a die. One side of the sheet consists of a map of Canada, the North Atlantic and Great Britain. The other side of the sheet contains instructive data, graphs, charts and other appropriate propaganda.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played with a standard deck of cards, a marker for each tribal champion, a marker for each tribe, a bunch of territory markers and three six sided dice.  A grid of face down cards are laid out before the players.  The players roll for their number of allowed actions each turn, moving their champion on the cards, looking at face down cards and sometimes taking them into their hands.  Cards may be used to duel other champions or collected to build a promiseland for the tribe.  Face cards may also be used for special actions, like taking an action in the middle of another players turn.  Once a player has collected enough cards for a promiseland, they must cross the board to get their tribe and bring them to the promiseland.  The first to accomplish this wins.&#10;&#10;Itesser Ink sells only a rulebook, all other pieces must be provided by the purchaser.&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes the game-ending convention brings a surprise!&#10;&#10;Senator North (blue), Governor East (red), Representative South (green), and General West (black) compete against each other in 5 campaign rounds to gain delegates, which will be sent to the Piecepack Party Convention (fyi -- all of these candidates compete, regardless of the number of players.)

The discs are used to track the competitors at bat and on base.&#10;&#10;The players play the game by following the general rules of baseball and spinning the four-armed spinner to generate results which are specified by results boxes of varying sizes arrayed in a circle around the spinner. According to the publisher, &quot;the percentages of plays spaced on the board have been calculated from the actual number of balls pitched, hits, put-outs, etc., from hundreds of games played by these leagues.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game board has six metal arrows mounted to it which are used to track the inning, outs, balls, strikes, and the score for each team.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A  seventeenth century French game played on a Backgammon board. Each player only uses three pieces. The pieces race in the same direction along opposite edges of the board rather than circling the entire board as in Backgammon.&#10;&#10;The pieces start off board. Entry and movement are determined by the roll of two dice. The number on each die may be used separately to move two pieces or combined to move a single piece, except when doubles are rolled in which case the player is only allowed to move the amount shown on a single die (i.e. on a roll of double sixes, the player is allowed to move only one piece six spaces). Rolls which may not be played are lost.&#10;&#10;Each player's pieces must remain in their order of entry - there is no passing - and two pieces cannot share a space except when they reach the home space (the twelfth point) at the end of the board. When a piece is moved to a space which is immediately opposite a space containing an opponent's piece (except the home spaces at the end of the board), the opposing piece is sent back off the board to re-enter on that player's next roll.&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise you will not get a ring in the color you asked for. If you have 3 rings of the same color they are safe (on your finger).&#10;&#10;",

Squares on the board share names with landmarks from and areas of the city.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other Utah based Monopoly-style games, this one makes many references to Mormon culture and less to Utah scenery/buildings. Players can land on squares such as &quot;Go to Church,&quot; &quot;Choose the Right,&quot; and &quot;Tithing.&quot; Houses and Hotels are replaced with the ward houses and stake centers (names for Mormon church buildings). Also, all five playing pieces are directly related to Mormonism (CTR Ring, Bee of Deseret, Sunbeam Baby, Scripture Book, Brigham Young's Hat.)&#10;&#10;One interesting aspect of the game is that there are nine squares on each side of the board instead of the usual ten.&#10;&#10;",

Ever since the Hamster incident, the President had suffered bouts of doubt and indecision. Sure the nukes used on the monster Hamster had laid waste to half the country, but hell, that still left the other half radiation free.

Only you can stop them, that or watch the world burn. The sequel to Bad Baby&rsquo;s popular Hamster that Ate the World Mini-Game, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers takes that great game system and stands it on its head.

    "Description": "&quot;Experience the adventure and romance of Isle Royale National Park...yesterday and today!&quot;&#10;&#10;This game provides players the opportunity to explore the geography and history of IRNP as a boardgame.  It's a standard roll-and-move format, on a large 14x40 inch roll-up board.  All players start at one end of the island.  Four dice (provided) are rolled, and players use the value on a single die or pairs of dice to see if they can equal the mileage to proceed to the next location.  Water routes are sometimes available, and you can use those if you roll trips or a four-straight in three rolls, Yahtzee-fashion.  There are penalties for being landed on.&#10;&#10;The locations are campgrounds, scenic sights, fire lookouts, etc., with each type worth so many points to the player landing there or passing by.  Points are tallied on a provided pad with a provided pencil.  Some sights allowed the drawing of a Fortune Card, which can add or subtract additional points.&#10;&#10;The board is very attractive and informative, and the four pawns with the game are solid copper lathe-turned figures.  I imagine the game-play might be just a notch above the average roll-and-move, due to the complexity of the path network, the varying values of the stops, and the &quot;Can't Stop&quot;-ish dice selection mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

Around 200 unmounted counters represent divisions (but actual scale changes between scenarios) and supporting elements (aircraft, artillery, and tanks).&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is quite original, resulting in &quot;damage counters&quot; being inflicted on the target, up to the combat factor (whose value is function of troops quality), at which point capabilities decrease radically. Periodically, the right kind of replacements remove some of the damage, resulting in very durable units but fiddly stacks.&#10;&#10;All other aspects of the game are quite classic, from movement to victory point based on geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;This is a  wargame, dedicated to a not well-covered historical event, with an original incremental losses mechanism with four pages of basic rules.&#10;&#10;El Eco de los Pasos, recreates four campaigns of the Spanish Civil War: &#10;Madrid (October 1936-March 1937), &#10;Teruel (December 1937-February 1938), &#10;Valencia (April-July 1938) &#10;Barcelona (December 1938-February 1939)&#10;&#10;Division-brigade level and 3-7 days per turn. &#10;4 DIN A3 maps, 468 counters.&#10;&#10;",

The striking difference between Neutral and other games in which tricks and trumps figure a part of, consists of the suit of Neutral Cards representing the United States, played under certain restrictions as described in the rules which are supreme over trumps and all other cards.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 48 cards divided into 8 suits. 40 cards represent the 5 principle warring countries; Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Austria. The cards of the warring nations are termed &quot;Belligerents&quot;.  Each set of Belligerent cards consist of The Ruler(value 8), General (7), Colonel (6), Major(5), Captain(4), Lieutenant(3), Sergent(2), and Corporal(1).&#10;&#10;The United States represented by 8 cards plays the role of Neutral and Peacemaker to all of the warring nations.. Any trick won by the United States is neutralized and theoretically removed from the conflict.&#10;&#10;The game is played like most other trump games with players bidding to be able to establish trumps and then win a certain number of tricks. The established trumps win tricks if played on tricks where you have none of the lead suit but Neutral Trumps beat established trumps if they are played.&#10;&#10;If you succeed with your bid you score points, if you fail you score nothing. Each Neutral trick won scores 2 points + 1 point if the ruler card is included in the traick (The US ruler card is President Wilson). Ruler cards won in  &quot;Belligerent tricks scores nothing. Game consists of first to score 50 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Jet Set Casino, you join the distinguished class of people who swan around Europe spreading their fortune over the gambling tables of high-class casinos.&#10;&#10;Eager and hungry to &quot;conquer&quot; more casinos than your opponents in a short space of time, you have various means of transport at your disposal: private jets, sports cars, luxury yachts and the like. Each has particular properties that can help you blaze a trail from Monte Carlo across to Gibraltar round to St Petersburg, back to London and on to Helsinki in time for tea. Whoever has been to the most casinos after each player has been the &quot;dealer&quot; once, wins.&#10;&#10;Jet Set Casino is all about successful negotiations. You must clinch the best deals with your opponents to get hold of useful casino cards and the right transport cards to get there. Those who have successfully visited a casino during their turn have the right to participate in a genuine casino game: they play a round of 'Seven-and-a-half' (not unlike 'Vingt-Et-Un') to compete for a further free casino visitation. The game also demands a good sense of strategy - from choosing the all-important starting casino, to obtaining the best transport cards for each different phases of the game - plus a little luck, as that's what gambling is all about, really...&#10;&#10;Jet Set Casino has just been released in mainland Europe, and will be available shortly in the UK.
