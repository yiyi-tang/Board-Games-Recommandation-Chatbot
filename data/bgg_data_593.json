Unlike full-blown basketball tabletop games, players never have to look at charts and statistical data since all the information are found in the individual player cards. A much more simplified and quicker game but still captures the experience of playing the game of basketball wherein scoring, passing, blocking, faking shots, rebounding and stealing balls take place.&#10;&#10;",

One hell of an understatement, but it was nothing compared to what came next. Zombies. Sure, laugh it up. It&rsquo;s easy to do when you are surrounded by your friends and not by a horde of putrid cadavers breathing rot down your neck.&#10;&#10;If it had just been zombies we would have been fine. What is dead once can be made dead again; but these were puppets of evil humans, or rather, necromancers. They were using found magic to reanimate the thousands fallen during the war. Rumors spread that they had gotten a copy of the true Necronomicon but those were only rumors because we have the only real copy. Now we are fleeing for our lives with it in a battered school bus trying to incant the one spell that will send these blighted things back to whence they came. Our team is ragtag but our vehicles are fast. Hopefully they are fast enough to outrun the necromancers riding double on bikes: that&rsquo;s right, they taught the damned things to ride Harleys.&quot;&#10;&#10;Voting for the contest this game is in can be done:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/439899&#10;&#10;",

Burroughs' Chessmen of Mars' (Jetan). I made a set of the original game Burroughs used as a plot device for the book and quickly discovered the design was flawed - 99% of all games ended in a draw.

As I changed and clarified the rules to make the game competitive and fun, I soon hit upon the idea of dropping the specialized board and introducing secret set-up.&#10;&#10;No longer using the 10x10 square board, EAGLES &amp; KINGS uses a standard chessboard. With 20 pieces per side, this leaves 4 pieces in the third rank. Set-up for each player is done in secret. This makes each game potentially unique, as each player can place any of his pieces anywhere within the first 3 ranks.&#10;&#10;Everything needed to play EAGLES &amp; KINGS can be found in the files section, and permission is given by the designer for print-n-play.

Pieces move vertically and horizontally and are taken by moving over the own pieces diagonally.&#10;&#10;Slalom - Small pieces have to be put in a way that they can be taken in 8 strokes by a bigger piece.&#10;&#10;Colix - You play on the 9x9 side of the gaming board and the red lines can&acute;t be crossed.

It could be played using all cards except the king in a regular deck, with the ace as 1, and using diamonds as gold.&#10;&#10;The player with the 7 of gold plays first.  Players take turns (moving clockwise around the table) placing cards.  You can play a card one up or one down from any cards currently on the table (played on the 7 but leaving all cards visible), or you can play a 7 from a different suit to start another escalera (staircase) in a new pile.  If you can play, you must, otherwise you pass.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play all of your cards.  At the end of each game, players with cards left in their hands receive 1 point per card.  When a player receives 15 points, that player is out of the game.  Once it is down to 2 players, the player with the fewest points wins (as the game is no fun with only 2 players, since you know what cards the opponent has).&#10;&#10;",

The Umenzi Tribesmen draws inspiration from the great Zulu armies of earth as well as a cinematic take on Voodoo, adding a new level of magic to Battleground play. As with previous Battleground factions, the Umenzi Tribesmen is packaged in two decks. Starter decks include all the cards needed to play -- 18 units, the 30-card Command deck and two reference cards -- plus the basic rules. Reinforcement decks include 50 unit cards, including two types not found in the Starter, plus the advanced rules.&#10;&#10;",

But you must weigh up the destruction caused with the political fallout from the images of a burning Fallujah being broadcast around the world.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to capture territory from the insurgency, locate and destroy centers of resistance, capture local insurgency leaders and engage enemy forces in order to regain control of the city.&#10;&#10;The game is still a 'work in progress' so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.&#10;&#10;",

All of the artwork was done by myself - including the counters which were hand drawn!&#10;&#10;22&quot; x 34&quot; map [printed on four 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock sheets]&#10;600 counters [printed on 2 sheets of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; label paper]&#10;2 OOB/OOA set-up sheets&#10;1 OFF-BOARD MOVEMENT CHART&#10;2 Player Aid Cards&#10;1 example sheet&#10;&#10;This is the original TERRAN GAMES dtp publication of BOB showcased at ORIGINS '94 in San Jose, not the TERRAN GAMES, INC. version published a year later with all new [gorgeous] graphics by Mark Simonitch.&#10;&#10;",

It is a game where strategically planning your movements is essential. Every driver has his own deck of &quot;movement cards&quot; which include straight lines, curves, braking and overtaking cards. Each round you may pick up a maximum of 4 cards, in the order you wish to play them, you then move your driver's car according to the cards directions, around the track. But be careful, picking all 4 cards every time could result in collisions with other drivers, going off the track, or running out of fuel.&#10;&#10;Before a race begins, you must choose your fuel load and tyre types according to different variables, such as weather conditions, where warmer temperatures result in quicker tyre wear, and also your fuel strategy, as you must choose your race fuel for qualifying. To make these decisions, you look at the various statistics on your driver's information cards, and place markers upon the starting fuel load, and reliablity statistics, which change over the course of the race.&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions. is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.&#10;&#10;",

Just remember no talking during your turn!&#10;&#10;Each player assembles a clan of archaic Homo sapiens, Dino sapiens, Neanderthals, or Troglodytes. Archaic Homo sapiens are our primitive ancestors. They are physically weaker than their rivals, but make up for it with character types that include the nimble Florz (cave halflings) and Cave Nerds (who create amazing prehistoric &quot;technology&quot;). Dino sapiens are semi-intelligent dinosaur people who enlist fierce dinosaurs as their allies. Neanderthals have brawny fighters and shamans who use powerful magic. Troglodytes are the most primitive clan (making even Neanderthals look civilized) but have fearsome creatures like Trogres and the dreaded Dragonasaurus working for them.&#10;&#10;Sticks &amp; Stones is a 2-4 player card game. There are 110 cards, including characters from each clan, Woot! cards (events, gear, and special items), and Quest cards (challenges faced by your clan). An optional 5th player can serve as the Cave Master for the game. Players must resort to prehistoric roleplaying as they bluff, intimidate, and cajole each other--all without speaking during their turn!&#10;&#10;",

Mirroir the Cyclisme have appealed to the collection of Rene Geslin to bring out this reprint. In the course of years, several versions of this game have been published. For example one with the name &ldquo;Tour the France Cycliste &ldquo; in the Fifties.&#10;&#10;It is a simple game of goose where a cycling game is played along the outer track of the game board and on the other hand a (initially) tourist car game on the track with the map of France. In the original game cyclists, small cars and bonus cards were provided.&#10;&#10;Whit this version comes only the game board and the game rules.&#10;&#10;In the version of the years ' 50 the layout of the game board has been preserved, but the characters and symbolism has been adapted to the era. Also the rules have been strongly simplified. In the original game bonus points could be deserved at stage wins, this has been completely deleted from the rules and everything has been reduced to a simple game of goose.&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each turn, the planes are removed from the grid, so may reappear on an entirely new angle of attack the following turn.&#10;&#10;Rules provide many optional rules and very complete aircraft statistics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Quest: A New Age, the purpose of the game is to take your Adventuring Party into each Dungeon and attempt to complete your assigned Quest Objective.  This can be done as a Solo player or with any number of players controlling and arguing over the party members.  (I have run one of my D&amp;D groups through it with 8 people as the party)&#10;Your Adventuring Party is made up of 5 Unique and Specific Classes that must be represented as you begin the game.  Each class has a Hero that Begins at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 5 during game play.  Most 1st level Heroes need 3xp to advance to level two. 7xp more to advance to level three, 10-15 more to level four, and 18-24 to level five. This depends on the class and individual Hero.&#10;Here is a list of the 19 Heroes that we have at this time and what they are at each level.&#10;Protection Class:&#10;Griff - Journeyman - Fighter - Warrior - Barbarian - Berserker&#10;Sonya - Wanderer - Explorer - Questing - Paladin - Angel&#10;Olli - Son of Hamfast - Pikeman - Squire - Knight - Crusader&#10;Solarion - Footman - Swordsman - Lieutentant - Captain - General&#10;Death Class:&#10;Selene - Outlaw - Bandit - Thief - Rogue - Shadow&#10;Gabriel - Urchin - of the Streets - Minstrel - Bard - Muse&#10;Grimm - Outlaw - Bandit - Enforcer - Assassin - Reaper&#10;Sabban - Rebel - Renegade - Deciever - Deserter - Betrayer&#10;Nature Class:&#10;Richard - Farmer - Woodsman - Guide - Scout - Ranger&#10;Isseili - the Fey - Forester - Naturalist - Druid - Warden&#10;Venr - Awakened - Scavenger - Hungering - Feasting - Vampire&#10;Magic Class:&#10;Marteel - Novice - Adept - Wizard - Mage - Archmage&#10;Callius - Novice - Adept - Cultist - Warlock - Demon&#10;Zaphian - Underling - Adept - Sorcerer - Necromancer - Lich&#10;Rymar - Stonehead - Preserved - Protected - Encased - Fortified&#10;Life Class;&#10;Dana - Follower - Acolyte - Healer - Priestess - High Priestess&#10;Jesse - Follower - Acolyte - Brother - Preacher - Martyr&#10;Sarah - Searching - Enlightened - Forgiving - Redeemed - Guardian Spirit&#10;Mary - Acolyte - Cleric - Devoted - Blessed - Saint&#10;&#10;The Adventure consists of a 60 card Dungeon, which has one Quest Objective, Terrain, Creatures, Equipment, Effects, Fast Effects, Events, and other Items.  There are always two Unigue Tier Creature Cards that can be interchanged after completion of each Tier to make the adventure last longer and become more difficult.  The eight Adventures that we have complete are listed below with the amount of games played, completion rate, and Quest Objective.&#10;Goblin Kingdom -    71/120     60%    Goblin King&#10;Dead Marshes -      58/90       63%    Lord of the Undead&#10;Demonic Rift -          35/63       54%    Balor              &#10;Ruby Mountain -      31/64       49%    Ancient Red Dragon&#10;Forsaken City -        25/51       50%    King of the Streets&#10;Nature's Abundance 23/50      46%    Ancient Treant&#10;Dangerous Seas -    21/47       38%    Captain Davy Jones&#10;Tomb Kingdom -      17/50       34%    Tomb King&#10;We are planning on a total of 10 adventures to become available in the future.&#10;        &#10;Game-play:&#10;In Quest: A New Age there are Abilities, Upgrades, and four stat Values -- Accuracy, Armor, Life, and Damage. &#10;Abilities differ for each Hero and Creature according to their assigned value in the game, (e.g. a Goblin Recruit has no abilities and is worth 1 point value, while a Goblin Captain has a value of 3 and grants abilities to other Goblins).&#10;5 levels of Upgrade are available to each Hero and are earned in the Dungeon as the party delves deeper into the adventure. As you gain XP from Terrain, Trap, and Creature cards, you can spend the XP to make your Heroes stronger. &#10;Accuracy is the Hero or Creatures base accuracy which you then combine with a roll of a D20 to attempt to hit.&#10;Armor is the Hero or Creatures base defense against attacks.&#10;Life is the Hero or Creatures base damage that they can take before dying.&#10;Damage is the Hero or Creatres base damage they can inflict against another.&#10; Phases of the Game:&#10;1)  Quest Deck - Turn over the appropiate amount of cards.  Fast Effects happen at this time and can change how many cards are turned over.&#10;2)  Effects - Any Effects that are turned over happen at this time.&#10;3)  Hero1 - All Heroes have one action per turn, which can be used to either Attack, Heal, Pick Up and item or attempt to Disarm a trap.  The Hero may also Hold their action for Hero2 phase.&#10;4)  Dungeon - Any surviving Creatures may perform one action at this time.&#10;5)  Hero2 - The Heroes that held their action can now act.&#10;6)  Events - Events such as traps that have not been disarmed and other Events take place at this time.&#10;7)  End of Turn - End of Turn abilities such as Regenerate and Aura's take place at this time.&#10;8)  Upgrade - XP that has been collected can now be used to upgrade your Heroes.  When a Hero is upgraded they gain full health.  Once XP has been spent on a Hero, it cannot be used again.&#10;Start the Phases over at this time.&#10; The game begins by shuffling your Quest Deck and turning over three cards.  As the game progresses and your Heroes are upgraded, you start to turn over more cards to make the Adventure more difficult.  The Breakdown is as follows:&#10;Game Begins - 3 Cards per turn&#10;After Two Hero Upgrades - 4 Cards per turn&#10;After Five Hero Upgrades - 5 Cards per turn&#10;After Eight Hero Upgrades - 6 Cards per turn&#10;After Ten Hero Upgrades - 7 Cards per turn&#10;After Twelve Hero Upgrades - 8 cards per turn&#10; Rules Questions:&#10;1)  When Attacking you take the Accuracy and add a D20 roll. That roll must equal or beat the targets Armor.  You do not have to roll when Healing or using an Ability unless it is used as an attack.&#10;2)  Melee characters cannot target Ranged characters unless all other Melee opponents are defeated.&#10;3)  Rolls of a 1 are considered an Epic Fail and always miss.  Rolls of 20 are considered a Critical Strike and always hit, in addition a Critical causes Double damage to the target.&#10;4)  All XP this is collected goes into a community pool which can be used at the direction of the Party's controller or controller's.&#10;5)  As an overall rule: The Cant's outweigh the Can's&#10;&#10;We did a short Demo on youtube which is quite boring but you are free to take a look at the mechanics of the game. :)&#10;http://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/1/hDXivVltVB4&#10;&#10;",

Everyone gets the chance to be &quot;Question Master&quot; and take charge of the time buzzer.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the start square players roll the dice and move. The player is asked a safety or first-aid question related to the topic of the square they land on. A timer is started once the question has been read and the answer must be given before the timer sounds.&#10;&#10;Once a player has completed the external track on the board they enter the central area and then must answer questions based on the spinner result. If answering successfully the player gets to point to one PREVENTIT lettercard of any opponent. If it is the correct colour they add it to their scorecard. If it is not the correct colour the lettercard remains face-down in front of the opponent. In either case play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Win: The first player to fill their PREVENTIT scorecard wins.&#10;&#10;",
