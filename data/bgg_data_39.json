    "Description": "The City-State of Tempest is a lively metropolis &ndash; some say the largest in the world &ndash; yet behind the city's cultured exterior, age-old cabals vie for power, fighting one another for dominance in a society ripe with political and economic turmoil. Led by shadowy figures who command a small cadre of loyal followers, these secret societies work in concert to seize the wealth and power of the fabled City-State of Tempest.&#10;&#10;In Dominare, you are the puppet master of a conspiracy seeking to control Tempest. Agents are the key to Dominare. Use your agents to spread your influence through the city, building a network of hidden power to control the most valuable districts and blocks.&#10;&#10;In the game, players first draft agents they want. Then, each turn, the players reveal one additional layer of their conspiracy. Each agent is a unique person in the City-State of Tempest, with unique abilities. The higher an agent in in your conspiracy, the more powerful that agent is.&#10;&#10;Players spread their influence in key city blocks and districts, use agent and district abilities to further their plans, and manipulate the board to their benefit. Use your agents well, and influence and power will be yours. Use them poorly, and... well, you wouldn't be the first would-be ruler to vanish into the inky waters of the city canals....&#10;&#10;Number 3 in the Tempest Shared World Game Series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Glorantha: The Gods War is a competitive strategy game in which 3 or 4 players (3 to 8 players with the Empires expansion) summon units (minions, heroes, lesser gods and usually one greater god); construct buildings (usually Shrines, Temples, and Ziggurats) and clash in mortal combat. The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.&#10;&#10;Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.&#10;&#10;In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle Masters is a fantasy miniatures battle game by Milton Bradley, presumably licensed from Games Workshop.  The sizeable game box comes stuffed with tons of plastic miniatures, a deck of combat cards and some dice.  Players move and fight their armies based upon what card is turned over from the deck.  Combat is held on a large vinyl mat 4.5 ft square (Actual Measurements: 55 inches by 57 inches).&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of Battle Masters - the epic game where you command mighty armies locked in a legendary conflict of good versus evil!&#10;&#10;The noble Imperial Army is ready to meet the Forces of Chaos. You and your opponent must strategically guide 25 army units, featuring over 100 finely-detailed figures, across the gigantic 4 1/2' X 5' Battle Mat. Beware! Ditches, marshes, river fords and the great Border Tower lie before you.&#10;&#10;The battle unfolds as each turn of a Battle card tells which army units can move and which can attack. Will your army be victorious, or will your opponent destroy you? Who will survive the battle and win the game? The fate of the Empire is decided by you, the Battle Masters!&#10;&#10;Card Deck:&#10;3 Goblins and Orcs&#10;1 Goblins, Beastmen and Wolf Riders&#10;2 Goblins and Wolf Riders&#10;5 Champions of Chaos and Wolf Riders&#10;2 Champions of Chaos Charge&#10;1 Chaos Archers and Champions of Chaos&#10;2 Beastmen, Orcs and Goblins&#10;1 Goblins, Champions of Chaos and Beastmen&#10;4 Choaos Warriors, Champions of Chaos and Chaos Archers&#10;1 Choaos Warriors, Beastmen, Orcs, Chaos Archers and Goblins&#10;5 Wolf Riders Double Move&#10;1 Whole army move (Chaos)&#10;5 The Ogre Champion&#10;&#10;4 Imperial Knights&#10;2 Lord Knights&#10;2 Imperial Archers&#10;6 Imperial Knights and Lord Knights&#10;1 Men-at-Arms and Imperial Archers&#10;4 Men-at-Arms, Crossbowmen and Imperial Archers&#10;4 The Mighty Cannon&#10;1 Whole Army Move (Imperial)&#10;1 Lord Knights and Imperial Knights Charge&#10;1 Lord Knights Charge&#10;&#10;Ogre Champion cards:&#10;3 Ogre Moves&#10;3 Ogre Attacks&#10;&#10;Mighty Cannon Tiles:&#10;1 target tile&#10;4 flying cannon ball&#10;3 bouncing cannon ball&#10;2 explosion&#10;&#10;Note!

    "Description": "You begin with a single tile and a destination. What unfolds is a branching, labyrinthine dungeon of dangerous enemies, wandering monsters, challenging puzzles, and valuable treasure.&#10;&#10;Bardsung is a game of choosing your path as you seek to inspire the bard&rsquo;s songs and live your legend. From your physical passage through the dungeon to your journey of building your character into a fabled hero, your choices define your experience.&#10;&#10;Because dungeons are procedurally generated (like those in a roguelike video game), no two playthroughs will be the same. Lay tiles to build the dungeon as you go, choosing your direction from the options at hand to seek loot and avoid threats.&#10;&#10;Encounter different enemies and challenges each time through Event, Battle, and Challenge decks that spawn new foes and throw curveballs in the form of poisoned weapons, traps, reinforcements, non-player characters, and more.&#10;&#10;Round length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.&#10;&#10;As you continue your campaign, level up your hero to upgrade their stats, access powerful new abilities, and enhance existing skills. You have the freedom to either follow your hero&rsquo;s designated path, or to create your own bespoke hero with a unique set of traits and arsenal of attack combos.&#10;&#10;Enter intelligent and dangerous combat where positioning and teamwork are vital for maximizing your attacks and working with your allies. Your abilities can&rsquo;t be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely. And beware, for the same enemy will behave differently from one encounter to the next. Just like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them...&#10;&#10;Bardsung can be enjoyed as a cooperative game of up to five players, or as an exciting solo player experience. Explore the dungeon in standalone sessions, or as part of a far-reaching narrative campaign that evolves based on your decisions.&#10;&#10;An RPG dungeon explorer, Bardsung takes the best elements of traditional roleplaying games and beloved dungeon-crawling classics, and combines them with a dash of contemporary gameplay to create a powerful new experience.&#10;&#10;With swift setup and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the dungeon will be quick.&#10;&#10;Inspire the songs. Live your legend. Become Bardsung.&#10;&#10;",

These types of transportation, however, are available in limited numbers and can be used only in specific regions. Thus, an exciting race starts among the elves to find out who will make the best use of the available transportation. The one who visits the most towns wins.&#10;&#10;Elfengold, an expansion for Elfenland, adds gold coins to the game that players use to bid for the Travel Counters and other new items. It also adds Gold Value Tokens to the towns that indicate how much gold players earn for visiting a town. Two magic spells and a new obstacle &mdash; a Sea Monster &mdash; are included as well as two round cards to allow for longer games up to six rounds.&#10;&#10;In Elfensea, as in Elfenland, young elves have to pass a special test before they are accepted as grownups. The same rules apply in Elfensea as in Elfenland, except as described in the rules.

    "Description": "Space mining is developing thanks to the cooperation between private corporations and governments around the world. Before the challenge to occupy another planet, however, we need to create a Moon base to extract resources from our natural satellite. Iron, titanium, water, and a powerful fuel, helium-3, are natural riches available in the Moon. To get these riches won't be easy; it'll require lots of work to install lunar probes, process extracted minerals, and ensure the working conditions of scientists and engineers in the crew.&#10;&#10;In Luna Maris, you take on the role of a coordinator in charge of the lunar operations of a big company, organizing the crew, fulfilling demands, supplying worker's necessities, improving rooms in the complex, and respecting the strict environmental parameters. You start the game with six scientist cards, with which you can perform actions; to do so, place a scientist meeple in a room in the lunar complex, discard the appropriate scientist card, pay the activation cost (energy, water, oxygen, etc.), then receive the benefits of that room. The ten rooms each have their particularities and special rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Exploration Plant: Astronauts go out to the base to extract minerals.&#10;    Industrial Complex: Process extracted minerals. Also, control the air filters and decrease the CO2 emissions.&#10;    Greenhouse: Create food to sustain the crew members.&#10;    Expedition Area: Ship cargo to Earth and receive victory points.&#10;    Mining Room: Extract basalt and titanium to sustain a high level of production.&#10;    Communication Room: Hire better scientists and improve the human resources of the lunar base.&#10;    Power Plant: Juice the solar boards for an extra energy supply.&#10;    Recycling Plant: Recycle your waste to obtain resources in a green sustainable economy.&#10;    Laboratory: Use research to improve the Industrial Complex, Recycling Plant, and other facilities.&#10;    Dormitory: Take time off to recuperate.&#10;&#10;&#10;A game lasts five rounds, and during that time you can focus on installing lunar probes and producing raw resources; investing in the industrial complex to guarantee access to water and helium-3; hiring high-level scientists and optimizing your actions; or doing other things that will deliver victory points in the long run. After five rounds, players tally their scores to see who runs the base and who gets ejected into orbit. (Kidding!)&#10;&#10;",

The game strikes a fine balance between luck and strategy, while still being easy to explain and get to the table. Use smart positioning, special abilities of your skaters, and press your luck to outplay your opponent and score the most goals. Whether you are a hardcore hockey fan or a board-gamer looking for a challenging tactical skirmish, we&rsquo;ve got you covered!&#10;&#10;Trick Shot is played over three periods, each period consisting of 10 turns. Whoever scores the most goals by the end of the third period wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may keep activating skaters, as long as the same skater is not activated twice in a row or a turnover is triggered by failing a dice roll. However, after each activation, a die is added to your pool, making each following activation more difficult.&#10;&#10;Rolling a Reaction result lets your opponent perform a short move with one of their skaters, limiting the downtime to a minimum.&#10;&#10;Double fail results in a penalty and gets your skater off the ice and may cost you control of the puck.&#10;&#10;Stamina tokens can be used to mitigate luck by re-rolling failed activations.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As the head of an international archaeological team, it is your job to establish camps across the four corners of the globe and uncover the long-lost golden scarabs of Scarabya.&#10;&#10;Scarabya is a tile-laying puzzle game, in which your goal is to score scarabs by positioning your tiles such that they create enclosed zones of 1 to 4 squares. Each scarab in an enclosed zone is worth a number of points equal to the number of squares in its zone. Players all play the same tiles, in order. Each turn, a new tile is drawn and all players simultaneously place their copy of the tile on their individual boards. The game is over after all 12 tiles have been drawn (and either placed or discarded). The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arimaa, pronounced &quot;a-ree-muh,&quot; is a game where stronger animals like elephants and camels freeze, push, and pull the weaker ones from the opposing team around and into traps, while one of the rabbits tries to sneak across the board and harmlessly reach the other side. The first player to get one of their rabbits to the other side wins.&#10;&#10;This may sound like a simple kids' game, and while it is easy enough for your kids to learn and enjoy, you will find that it is also a very deep game that can take a lifetime to master. Arimaa is one of the deepest strategy games ever invented in the history of mankind, but designed to look intuitively simple. No two games of Arimaa are ever the same. There is much to learn and discover about this intuitively simple, yet intellectually challenging, game.&#10;&#10;Played on an 8x8 grid with four trap squares and 32 animal pieces (16 gold and 16 silver). Each player has an elephant, a camel, 2 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 8 rabbits. Strength hierarchy: Elephant &gt; Camel &gt; Horse &gt; Dog &gt; Cat &gt; Rabbit. The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces first in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on seventh and eighth ranks. Then gold moves its pieces first. A player can move up to four &quot;steps&quot; each turn. All pieces move orthogonally (at right angles).&#10;&#10;Arimaa was invented by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game that could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. (Arimaa is Aamir spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a&quot;). In 2002, Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls one die into the arena, which is set inside the bottom of the box. If any two or more dice show the same symbol, that player then claims those dice and their turn ends.

    "Description": "Not to be confused with divinatory tarot, the game of tarot probably comes from Italy. It is played with a 78-card deck that has 56 suited cards (similar to the 52-card Poker deck, with the addition of a Cavalier or Knight court card between the Jack and Queen in each suit), plus 21 suitless trump cards in ascending rank, and one &quot;Fool&quot;, similar to the Joker but with differing origins.&#10;&#10;In the most popular tarot game, called French Tarot in most English-speaking countries, one of the players will be the taker who will be playing against all the other players. The takers' goal is to make a certain amount of points in order to fulfill the contract which the taker player bids on at the beginning of the game. The goal of the other players (called the defense) is to stop the taker from achieving their score. The defense plays as a team against the taker.&#10;&#10;After receiving their hand, the players will take turns betting on a contract based on whether they think they can achieve the number of points required. The last player to place a bet will become the taker.&#10;&#10;A large number of European card games are played with either the full tarot deck or a subset of it, often re-faced in Germanic or other Eastern European motifs.&#10;&#10;",

Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a German map. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes.  Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder.  The stock manipulation aspect of the game is not as brutal as in 1830.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.&#10;&#10;This game features minor rail companies, layered stock offerings, and the formation of the Prussian railroad from the minor companies. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1911, Roald Amundsen and four companions were the first human beings to stand at the South Pole. Using skis and dog sleds, they beat Robert Falcon Scott's British expedition by just a few weeks. Scott and his men reached the South Pole only to find Amundsen's Norwegian flag planted in the frozen ground. They died on their return journey not far from their base camp.&#10;&#10;1911 Amundsen vs Scott is an asymmetric game for two players, with both of them trying to be the first to reach the South Pole. Each player takes a different route to the South Pole, with these routes consisting of a path of colored dots.&#10;&#10;The game is composed by a deck of cards for both players with a row of 3 visible cards. On each turn a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect cards that are face up on the board, taking one card for free, or taking 2-3 cards by first discarding 1-2 cards from your hand.&#10;     Play cards from his hand to advance toward the South Pole, play cards so that the opponent loses his way, or play cards to activate special effects.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the South Pole wins. If the deck runs out for the second time, both players are lost in Antarctica and lose the game.&#10;&#10;This game includes 4 expansions inside:&#10;- &quot;Patrons&quot; (8 new cards). 4 British patrons and 4 Norwegian patrons with a special effect each.&#10;- &quot;1912 The Way Back&quot; (second board + 10 new cards). The explorers can play the return to the ships with new rules.&#10;- &quot;Damned Weather!&quot; (5 new cards + 1 die). A small expansion to represent the influence of weather and add a little bit of gambling to the game.&#10;- &quot;Food Depots&quot; (4 white cubes). Only in the second edition!. The explorers made previous short trips to create food depots that they could pick up in the final trip.&#10;&#10;",

Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles, but you decide what to do during the game: Do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy? You can bring enemies around to your point of view with a sword as Geralt - or bribe them with gold and threaten to call on powerful friends as Dandelion. If a situation calls for strength in numbers, Yarpen has his own fellowship of dwarves to command, and Triss can rely on her expert skill with magic to save the day.&#10;&#10;Each character has its own deck of Development Cards, so each time you play you can discover something new by trying out varied characters and experimenting with different builds. For example, when playing as Geralt of Rivia, the main hero of the Witcher franchise, you can develop your character either by specializing in brewing and utilizing combat Elixirs, or else by growing your ability to cast powerful Witcher Signs.&#10;&#10;A variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery. Decide whether you&rsquo;ll help the other players or look after your own interests first, and keep an eye on the progress of your friends while you carefully work your way towards victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.&#10;&#10;The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:&#10;1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). &#10;2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.&#10;3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. &#10;Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.&#10;&#10;You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules&#10;&#10;A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.&#10;&#10;",

As the casualties increase, so does the stress and mistakes made, as you try to complete your vaccine before time runs out for all of mankind!&#10;&#10;This strategy game uses simple mechanics in a multitude of combinations to create engaging, deep gameplay as you try to eliminate an evolving virus that could spell the end of the human race. While random events from the Status Report cards might throw a wrench in your plans (or occasionally help you out), you&rsquo;ll use the Lab Personnel and Equipment cards you&rsquo;ve hired to piece together randomly generated Proteins into the different parts of a Vaccine, all while managing dwindling Funding resources as the Death Toll Track climbs; each time that your Containment roll fails you come one step closer to losing this battle, so make sure that you push everyone to their limits before the INFECTION reaches critical levels.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rise &amp; Fall is a full control strategic game. Each player controls a civilization trying to expand and progress in a fantasy world. This world displays a unique landscape where glaciers live on islands and huge cliffs are common barriers and challenges to overcome.&#10;&#10;In this gorgeous land each player starts with a small tribe including a village, a citizen and a ship and will grow to a full civilization with more of the pre-mentioned units but also temples, merchants and the precious highlanders, the only ones able to pass those astonishing cliffs.&#10;&#10;Rise &amp; Fall is a very immersive and addictive game, easy to understand, with no luck or randomness involved. The initial creation of the world by itself is a real pleasure and each game brings a different map to the table.&#10;&#10;The new players will enjoy the game for its &ldquo;easy access&rdquo; aspect. Since all the actions you can do are displayed on the six cards of a player&rsquo;s deck, this makes the game really accessible right from the start.&#10;&#10;The more exigent strategist players will love the game for its full control aspect and the fact that the learning curve seems to be a constant line of progression.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The universe is about to collapse, and your final hope lies in an ancient mysterious artifact, the Ovoid. Whoever controls this &quot;cosmic egg&quot; can shape the birthing of the next universe according to their own agenda. Players are secret agents from a handful of surviving worlds, zipping from planet to planet in special &ldquo;amnion suits&rdquo; that allow for interstellar travel, space combat and planetary landings.&#10;&#10;Each planet has its own envelope of cards. When you arrive on a planet, you decide which cards you want to take and which to leave behind. Knowledge is the most powerful resource in the game, and being able to predict the cards your opponents possess at any given time is a powerful advantage as you build up a handful of weapons, tactical gear, vaults and traps, as well as cards that counter your opponents' cards. The best players will keep their hand fluid, constantly changing tactics while they search from world to world for the Ovoid or find a safe place to stash it.&#10;&#10;Balance your hand of cards, spend your turn actions wisely, and cleverly use your special alien powers to stay one step ahead of your opponents. When the Chaos Clock reaches zero, only the player who possesses the Ovoid will become master of the new universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the teachings of the Catholic Church, an indulgence may be granted to relieve sins. In some cases, this might be by doing good works or engaging in meaningful prayer, but in the darkest of times, indulgences were sold to anyone willing to make a significant &quot;contribution&quot;. As the rising families of the Italian Renaissance conspired and plotted to seize control, the indulgence offered a clear conscience for many a questionable deed committed in the name of power.&#10;&#10;Indulgence is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. On their turn, players choose an edict that gives the rule for the hand. The other players then decide if they want to violate the edict by doing the opposite of what it commands. So &quot;Don&rsquo;t take any Medicis&quot; suddenly becomes &quot;I must take all the Medicis&quot;. Committing a sin can be challenging, but a player attempting it gets the benefit of the indulgence, a token that turns one of their cards into a winning hand. Can you trick your opponents into committing sins without the indulgence? Can you avoid sinning yourself? Whoever can pull that off will end up with a pile of gems and the title of victor.&#10;&#10;Indulgence is a restoration of Dragonmaster, originally published by Milton Bradley in 1981 and designed by Jerry D'Arcey. It was itself a reimagining of D'Arcey's prior game, Coup d'Etat, and its classic progenitor Barbu. Dragonmaster enjoyed lavish production, with oversized cards, art by the incomparable Bob Pepper, and some nifty interlocking gems for keeping score. In addition to the retheming, the restoration evens out the game play. The original game suffered from a runaway leader problem in which an early power play with the dragon card all but assured one player's elimination from contention and gave the other a big leg up. The indulgence token replaces the dragon card to make it more accessible, less powerful, and easier to understand. It also increases the number of contracts from 5 to 20, and ups the deck to 36 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players are placed in command of the opposing superpower fleets. The mighty aircraft carriers and escorting capital ships must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missiles, torpedoes, and bomb attacks. Attack submarines threaten the enemy task forces and replenishment convoys while searching out their submerged rivals. Limited air assets must be carefully assigned to combat air patrols, long-range strategic missions and attack strikes. 2nd Fleet, with its multitude of options and strategies, is one of today's most realistic recreations of modern naval warfare on the high seas.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&#10;About 10 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenario).&#10;&#10;Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mega Empires: The West is a strategy board game for 5-9 players that covers the development of civilizations through history, from the Stone Age to the Late Iron Age, on a map board that concentrates on the Mediterranean Sea. In this colossal game, players lead their historic civilization as they gain victory points by expanding their population, building cities, trading and developing their knowledge and culture. Notwithstanding its large scope, the game's core mechanics are straightforward and easy to learn. A key element in the game is player interaction as they position themselves on the map board and search for valuable commodities during interactive trading sessions.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player starts their civilization in the Stone Age with a single population token on the board. As the game progresses, the population will expand, spread over the board, fight some border conflicts and build cities. Cities bring resources and wealth, expressed in trade cards. The more cities players manage to build on the board, the more trade cards they receive. Trade cards are mainly valuable commodities, but sometimes turn out to be disastrous calamities.&#10;&#10;Trade&#10;Trading is the heart of the game, a social experience where all players interact with each other to optimize the value of their sets of commodities. In addition to the desired commodities, calamities are secretly traded as well, adding an additional layer to the trading dynamics. Once the trading phase has ended, players that end up with a calamity in their hand will suffer its effects.&#10;&#10;Develop Civilization Advances&#10;When the smoke of trading and resolving calamities has settled, players can decide how to spend the wealth gathered through trading. The game includes 51 different advances that can be developed, each of which provides benefits in the game to its holder. For example, Metal Working provides an advantage when fighting conflicts, Architecture facilitates city construction and Enlightenment reduces the impact of (civil) calamities.&#10;&#10;The 51 Civilization advances are divided into the categories Arts, Crafts, Science, Civics and Religion, each of which has specific powers. Each advance acquired by a player provides discounts to other advances that can be purchased later in the game, thereby creating a path of strategic decisions. The ultimate advance in the game, Wonder of the World, is only in reach for players who manage both their trading and purchasing strategy very well.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;The players who have best developed their position on the board whilst avoiding making enemies, and defended their civilization against natural or civic calamities and stand the test of time, will eventually gather the most victory points and compete for winning the game. After up to 12 hours of playing, that is.&#10;&#10;Combining with Mega Empires: The East&#10;Mega Empires: The West can be combined with Mega Empires: The East (2021) to scale up the game to as many as 18 players! Where The West concentrates on the Mediterranean Sea, which stimulates movement by ship, The East covers Northeast Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Southwest Asia, and has a stronger focus on movement by land. Both games were designed as equally balanced counterparts, albeit with unique characteristics. Since many phases in the game are played simultaneously, larger player numbers do not materially increase the total playing time.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;Mega Empires: The Special Buildings (2024) is an expansion set that provides additional flavor to the game through 18 miniatures of ancient buildings historically associated with each of the civilizations in the game. These buildings can be built on the map board and provide additional benefits in play and victory points to their controller.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Upgrade &amp; 3-4 Players Pack (2024) contains rules and components for playing The West with as few as 3 or 4 players. These components are by default included in Mega Empires: The East.&#10;&#10;Accessories&#10;The Mega Empires: The West &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) is a neoprene game mat at 125% scale of the original cardboard map that offers an enlarged playing area and high-quality design for easier and more immersive gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Identifier Cards Bonus Pack (2024) is a set with 18 large player identifier cards, one for each of the Civilizations included in Mega Empires. These can be used for distributing the civilizations among the players during setup, to identify which stack of Civilization Advances belongs to which player, or to divide acquired cards from not yet acquired ones during the game.&#10;&#10;Wrap-up&#10;Mega Empires: The West is a long strategic board game about development, trade, culture, politics and showing resilience when dealing with calamities. The game is a perfect fit for larger groups of strategic board game enthusiasts, which, due to its scalability, can also be played in smaller groups. It is not just a game, it is an experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

A player can fly scenarios representing an individual patrol or use the patrol generator to create an endless variety of realistic individual patrols, multi-patrol campaigns, or larger campaigns covering the entire Battle of Britain. Each patrol will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 and 28 patrols.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;        1 Interception Game Board&#10;        1 Squadron Display Game Board&#10;        1 Me-110 Circle Display&#10;        4 Counter Sheets&#10;        1 Rules Booklet&#10;        1 Situation Manual&#10;        1 Optionals Booklet&#10;        3 Player Aid Cards&#10;        200 Playing Cards&#10;        1 Pad of Roster Sheets&#10;        2 Historical Log Sheets&#10;        1 Sheet of Stickers&#10;        38 Wooden Blocks&#10;        10 Wooden Cubes&#10;        1 Wooden Cylinder&#10;        2 Dice &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yomi (second edition) updates the original Yomi game with slight rule modifications and balance tweaks, in addition to adding ten new characters.&#10;&#10;Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.&#10;&#10;Game Modes&#10;&#10;     1v1, the main mode&#10;     2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom&#10;     A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent&#10;     A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;     Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.&#10;     Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.&#10;     Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.&#10;     Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.&#10;     Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.&#10;     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.&#10;&#10;Note: This item contains:&#10;Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina&#10;Yomi: Midori versus Setsuki&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves to either an empty spot on the path to claim one of the tiles located there or to an occupied spot. In the latter case, the attacking player must sacrifice a viking, then the defending player must sacrifice two vikings or vacate the space; if they sac two vikings, then the attacker must remove three or leave. Eventually, someone must leave.&#10;&#10;You can collect runes with an eye toward having lots of the same type or collect goods to sell at the end of the round. You might gather axes to give you better odds against monsters. You can collect more vikings for your crew.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players score majority bonuses depending on the tiles that were revealed before the round started.

When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed &ndash; but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?&#10;&#10;Cthulhu Gloom takes the game play of Atlas' Gloom and puts a Lovecraftian spin on it. Each player controls a group of protagonists, and your goal is to make them as miserable and insane as possible &ndash; preferably with them dying quickly while your opponents' heroes remain sane and (at a minimum) alive. In the publisher's description: &quot;While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;As in Gloom, the cards in Cthulhu Gloom are transparent, allowing you to stack multiple modifier cards on a character card to alter its stats or undo what an opponent has done to you. While Cthulhu Gloom can be played on its own or combined with Gloom and its many expansions, it does introduce two new types of cards:&#10;&#10;&bull; Story cards can be in play from the start of the game, and the first player to meet a Story card's conditions &ndash; e.g., drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu &ndash; claims the card and gains its benefits (or drawbacks).&#10;&#10;&bull; Transformation cards mutate a character for the remainder of the game, no matter which modifiers might come its way later. What's more, the character's image is replaced with &quot;something hideous and slimy&quot;. You'd expect no less really...&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a card corresponding to one of the dino guests. Players take turns asking each other questions or guessing their dinosaur's name. If someone guesses your name, draw a new card. The first player to guess three names wins.&#10;&#10;",

Share cards, choose the most high-profile jobs...then experience an auction phase as belligerent as it is clever!&#10;&#10;In For the King (and Me), you wish to become the most valuable minister by collecting the right cards while lowering the value of your opponents' objectives. The game plays the same as the designer's earlier game Biblios, while allowing for play with up to five people at once.&#10;&#10;The game lasts multiple rounds with players first collecting cards, then bidding for cards. During the collection phase, as the active player you draw cards one at a time, keeping one for yourself, placing one in an auction pile, and placing the others face up for the other players to draft. Once you take a card, you can't take another, so sometimes it's a tough call to decide when you want to take something. Once you've had multiple collection phases, the cards in the auction pile will be auctioned one by one.&#10;&#10;Some cards are worth points depending on their color, some are worth gold, and some allowing you to manipulate the value of the various colors. Once all the cards have been auctioned, players reveal their hands and tally their points to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

They then launched a clarion call to encourage all homeless adventurers to come live in this new ideal village.&#10;&#10;From all corners of the country, volunteers flocked to live in brand new houses, farms and shops.

But many puzzling obstacles stand in your way...&#10;&#10;In Exit: The Game + Puzzle &ndash; The Deserted Lighthouse, there are riddles within riddles, hidden within four 88-piece jigsaw puzzles. Like other Exit titles, The Deserted Lighthouse has no game board, but it also has no riddle cards. Instead, there are four jigsaw puzzles that you will find and assemble, one at a time. Each completed puzzle reveals a location containing more riddles to decipher.&#10;&#10;In EXIT The Game: The Deserted Lighthouse, you must work to solve the riddles and reach the lighthouse&rsquo;s top to activate its beacon, saving the approaching ship before it smashes against the rocks and sinks to the bottom of the sea.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all you have available to you are the puzzle bag containing pieces with a grayish-blue back and no pattern, and the decoder disk. But there are also strange items to be found within the game that may be used to help solve the riddles found in each of the puzzles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you have solved the last riddle and reactivated the lighthouse beacon to save the ship from sinking.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 4 of 5.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game follows the life cycle of fungi, a journey of creation, expansion, death, and rebirth &mdash; in game terms, growing mushrooms to score points, sporing them to expand your mycelial network, and eventually seeing them decay to unlock special actions.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has two actions to perform from the six options available. Using your decay actions, stealing spores, and blocking other mushrooms are just some of the ways to get ahead in the game. Players can evolve their own playing style, perhaps playing more aggressively to steal other players' spores or disrupt their mycelial network &mdash; or perhaps playing more defensively to try to protect their own area and spores.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of triangle tiles that represent different environments and nutrients that the mushrooms need to grow. These tiles can be added to the board by the players, so the board is always growing and evolving.&#10;&#10;Mycelia incorporates beautiful and accurate botanical style illustrations with over 69 mushrooms that can be found in the wild.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publishers website:&#10;&#10;TARGET FOR TODAY is a solitaire game that recreates American's Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign against Nazi Occupied Europe during the Second World War. Considerable research, including review of many oral histories gathered from veterans who flew heavy bombers in the Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign was done to make Target For Today! function as closely as possible to reality. The game was designed to provide YOU, the player, with the ultimate gaming experience depicting the same types of events and decision making processes experienced by our veterans who flew the real-life missions.&#10;&#10;Now, YOU are in command of an individual bomber on an individual mission over Hitler's Third Reich -flying either the B-17F or G Model Flying Fortress or the B24D, or J Model Liberator bomber. A series of individual missions are strung together in the campaign game to form the player's tour of duty. Just as it was in real life, the objective of the game for the player is to survive your tour of duty so you can rotate home.&#10;&#10;The US Army Air Forces suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any branch of the military services including the US Marine Corps during World War II. The heavy bomber groups of the 8th Air Force flew a combined total of 10,631 strike missions over Europe during the period of this game. The 8th Air Force lost 4145 bombers on these missions. Surviving your tour of duty could be difficult!&#10;&#10;TARGET FOR TODAY is an advanced update of Glen Frank's classic game B17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES. Some familiarity with that game is assumed, but &quot;TARGET FOR TODAY&quot; is a completely new game -you do not need to own B-17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES to play it. New tables are included and the rules are organized according to the sequence of play in any typical mission. TARGET FOR TODAY is designed so that each individual mission is fast and easy to play. The campaign game that comprises your tour of duty offers the player a game that is rich in detail, making the game as realistic as possible while still remaining playable.&#10;&#10;In the tradition of B-17 Queen of the Skies, and following in the foot steps of B-29 Superfortress, comes a new solitaire game from Steve Dixon. Bob Best and Shawn Rife Steve Dixon. Tentatively titled &quot;Bombs Away!&quot;, it has been renamed &quot;Target for Today!&quot;. Fly a single mission, a single campaign or fly the entire air campaign from 1942 to 1945 with the 8th or 15th Air Force, piloting either a B-17F, B17G, B24D, B24J and for those so inclined, the YB-40.&#10; The target list will be greatly expanded for the 8th and 15th Air Forces. Enemy planes we plan to provide are the Me-109, Fw-190, Ju-88, Me-110, Me-210, Me-410, He-162, Me-163, Me-262, and Ta-152.&#10;&#10;For more information visit the Consimworld Forum at http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd58f17&#10;&#10;Battle Board 11&quot; x 17&quot; (mounted) &#10;Game Counters 176 each .6&quot; 56 each 1.2&quot;&#10;Cards (3&quot;x4&quot;) 5 Bomber Types&#10;Rules Book 44 pages&#10;Chart Book 32 pages&#10;Target Book 56 pages&#10;Flight Manual 24 pages&#10;Crew Boards 5 ea. 11&quot; x 17&quot;&#10;Player Aids 10 ea. 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.&#10;&#10;Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map&#10;&#10;&#10;Revised by:   &#10;&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars: Update Kit (upgrade to 2nd edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Wellington&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) (aka 2008 reprint Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each Wet Season turn, they simultaneously select 2 cards from their hand: 1 to immediately place into their personal landscape and 1 to place into a communal row of cards called the Dry Season row. Players then exchange their hands and repeat until all cards have been placed.&#10;&#10;In the Dry Season, players take turns selecting 1 card from the Dry Season row and immediately placing it into their landscape. When the Dry Season row is empty, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Players have an opportunity to score points during both seasons by fully enclosing their paddies with paths. They will score for the size of a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; paddy, which can be increased by adding houses, as well as for farmers (a player&rsquo;s family members) and buffaloes contained within the paddy. A player-specific &ldquo;ancestor,&rdquo; representing the guiding spirit of a revered forebear, will also award that player additional points for achieving certain conditions.&#10;&#10;Strategically, opportunities abound in the card-rich Wet Season, when all share in a plenitude of resources and hands overflow with possibilities. Players must still think ahead to the Dry Season, though, when options will rapidly dwindle as the Dry Season row runs out of cards. The deck is micro and rounds are quick, but a sustainable plan for organically generating points is a must across the seasons.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the most points wins and may proudly boast of having the most fertile rice paddies in the region!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storm Over Stalingrad is a 2-player wargame simulating the Battle of Stalingrad from October to November 1942. One player controls the German army, and the other player controls the Soviet army. The game uses a simplified version of the Area&ndash;Impulse System, first introduced in Avalon Hill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Storm Over Arnhem&rdquo;. The game is 6 turns long, at the end of which time the winner is determined by comparing the players predetermined controlled victory areas to actual.&#10;&#10;The prize at the end of Germany's 1942 summer offensive was Stalingrad. The city, while being a propaganda key due to its name, was also a key industrial city sitting upon both rail and river networks. The German 6th Army hit arrived at the west bank of the Volga by late August and began their assault on the city. &quot;Stalingrad must not be taken by the enemy&quot; ordered Stalin. Now you can command the defense of the city and try to hold versus a talented, but stretched thin, German Army. Or will you find something the Germans didn't and seize both the city and the day?&#10;&#10;As has become common with games in the IGS line, playability matched with historical flavor has been achieved to a remarkable degree. In Storm Over Stalingrad, players alternate impulses where they move or fire, but only rarely both. Cards influence play, but do not drive the game. Can you take most of the city of Stalingrad before the Soviet offensive begins?&#10;&#10;This game uses a simplified version of the Storm over Arnhem system. While it shares the same game system and theme as Turning Point: Stalingrad, it has a different feel due to it covering a smaller time period, using tactical cards, and simpler rules.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 weeks&#10;Area: 1&quot; = approximately 547 yards / 25mm =  approximately 500 meters&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 15x21&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page Storm Over Stalingrad rulebook&#10;One deck of tactical cards (27 German, 27 Russian, 1 proof of purchase)  &#10;Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

If a row is full, then whoever played that final card takes all of the cards already in the row, scoring negative points for all of the bullheads on those cards.&#10;&#10;X nimmt! changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.&#10;&#10;All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.&#10;&#10;A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.&#10;&#10;This game was called Take A Number when included in the two game set Take 5 & Take A Number.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Twin It! challenges you to spot pairs of cards on the table as quickly as you can. To set up the main game, shuffle the double-sided cards, then give each player a similarly-sized stack. Players take turns revealing cards and placing them on the table, leaving all cards visible. As soon as someone spots matching cards, they place a finger on each card, then claim the pair, leaving them in a stack beside themselves. If another card of this type appears, anyone who fingers the twins claims all of those cards! Be the first to claim five twins to win.&#10;&#10;You can also play Twin It! as a team game. When you spot twins, you place your finger on one of the cards and hope your teammate can finger the other before an opponent does, or else the opponent claims the twins instead of you!&#10;&#10;Twin It! can also be played with the cards being held in hand facing away (and toward) each player.&#10;&#10;",

The time period of the game spans the time of Joshua's conquests of Canaan (Joshua), the turbulent years ruled by judges (Judges) through the choosing and crowning of King David (I &amp; II Samuel).&#10;&#10;The game uses the same basic mechanics as Settlers of Catan but adds some unique elements, similar to the Historical Scenarios. In the case of this game, players build the wall of Jerusalem by contributing bricks. The player who contributes the most bricks earns victory points and the right to use a special &quot;rule-breaking&quot; power of his/her choosing. This is contested in the same manner as &quot;the longest road&quot; from Settlers.&#10;&#10;The German version does not use the build Jeruselem and stones mechanisms. Instead there are 13 hero cards that generate God's help. There are events (cards) that take place. Also the German board has 5 hexes not on the English board and one changed hex as well.&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

The game is consistent with other games in the Grimpeur series in that it comes in a colorful small box and has modest components.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Players all start with seed money, used to draft a team of racers. The racers come out in random order, and each have a unique power (mostly modifying movement rules, sometimes giving extra pre- or post- race abilities). The draft is as follows: shift any unbought racers down one step on the board (decreasing prices as they shift), then add a new card to the display. If all spaces full, must buy one. After players have their racers (a few will remain out of game), there will be 4 or 5 races. For each race, players secretly simultaneously choose a racer. Then, in turn order, simply roll d6 and move your racer. Of course, special powers modify movement throughout the race.&#10;&#10;The first 2 finishers score VP (more VP in later races); most VP after all races wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a hand of guest cards, and each guest card has an influence value and its own power, e.g., the peddler, the assasin and the gondolier. The higher the influence, the greater that guest's clout at court. Each player's hand consists of a mix of cards representing members of any of the families currently in play. Use a rival family's guest cards against them, and watch for chances to set up your own house for success.&#10;&#10;Each of the rooms of the Doge's palace offer tokens representing a guild's favor or valuable ducats to be won by ambitious nobles. The spaces between each card that represents a room in the palace are the hallways of the Doge's estate &ndash; the areas in which guest cards are placed to compete for adjacent resources.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Fortress America, the United States must defend itself from three deadly invading armies: the Asian People's Alliance from the West, the Central American Federation from the South, and the Euro-Socialist Pact from the East. Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.&#10;&#10;If the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.&#10;&#10;Fortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.&#10;&#10;The Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.&#10;&#10;Changed in this edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Custom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.&#10;     A ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.&#10;     A &quot;Captured City&quot; track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.&#10;     A few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.&#10;     A deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (1986)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Ugungu!&#10;&#10;When you're the architect on your team, you see a building plan that shows how the blocks should be placed in the finished design. To get the builders on your team to do the heavy work, you must tell them which piece to use &ndash; through gestures like stomping your feet or raising your arms above your head &ndash; and what to do with it. &quot;Manungu&quot; tells them to put the piece at the front of the structure, while &quot;Manungu manungu&quot; means to put it at the back. Moving pieces left or right, up or down, laying them down or rotating them &ndash; lots of details need to be conveyed with only a few commands and your trusty (inflatable) spiked club. When you give a command and your team performs well, tap them on the head once to show approval. Hit them twice, though, and they know they messed up and need to pay better attention. I said, &quot;Karungu!!&quot; (stomp stomp stomp)&#10;&#10;The fastest &ndash; and most accurate &ndash; architect/building team will carry the day...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Keltis: Der Weg der Steine Mitbringspiel, a small standalone game in the Keltis family, the familiar idea of creating a numerical sequence is mixed with a press-your-luck element.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either take a tile from the center of the table and add it to your tableau or flip a face-down tile, then either leave it in place or add it to your tableau. Tiles come in five colors numbered 0-10, and when you place the second tile of a color, you lock in whether you're ascending or descending in that color. For example, if you take a blue 2, then a blue 4, you can place only blue 5-10 in the future. Some tiles have a symbol that grant you another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is flipped, the game ends after that player finishes their turn. If you've collected only 1-2 tiles of a color, you lose points; the same applies if you collect fewer than two &quot;wishing stones&quot;, a symbol scattered across multiple colors. Sum your score for all five colors and wishing stones, then add any bonus points on tiles you collected. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Crew may choose to Act Casual or Act Heroic and each pose has a unique set of actions that the Crew can perform on their turn, but be warned &ndash; while no one&rsquo;s gonna pay much mind to someone with a casual demeanor, acting all heroic is sure to attract unwanted attention.&#10;&#10;When you and the Crew get to work, a Job Briefing will tell you all you need to know; what your Crew needs to accomplish, how they might succeed and how long they have to get it done. Some Jobs are easier and faster, some are longer and more involved. What type of Job you want to tackle is up to you. You can work a single Job, or a series of Jobs, using the Credits you earn from one Job to equip the Crew for the next Job.&#10; Working a Job is never easy, there&rsquo;s always some manner of malcontents standing in your way. You and the Crew are sure to run afoul of hired Goons, whether it&rsquo;s a posse of unruly Cowboys or a gang of Eavesdown Docks Thugs. Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to talk your way out of trouble or distract them with some technical know-what. If not, then the situation may require a bit of violence!

    "Description": "League of Dungeoneers (LoD) is a detailed Dungeon Crawl and party management game. The game is designed to be a solo/coop game but could be played with a game master as well. The main task of the game is to develop your characters both by gaining experience but also by finding gold, equipment, magic and legendary items that can help you in your quest. The game is set in its own fantasy universe, containing many of the races and monsters that you would expect from a classical fantasy setting. You could either run the campaign supplied with the game or run any of the 22 single quests.&#10;&#10;All dungeons are procedurally generated, and all monsters and treasures are randomized making the quests different every time you play them. There is however a theme for each quest you embark upon so don&rsquo;t expect to find a goblin among the undead in a crypt. There are more than 50 different room and corridor tiles, each with details about furniture and 5 different large seized objective rooms. All rooms have different furniture and a chest is likely to contain gold or magic items, where for instance a bookshelf is more likely to contain magical scrolls.&#10;&#10;Party morale and sanity are two important factors to monitor in the game. Meeting fearsome monsters and springing deadly traps will take its toll on the mental state of your heroes and too much strain will give your heroes unwanted disorders such as claustrophobia, arachnophobia or stress syndromes. This will make them less effective and maybe even a liability for the rest of the party. To remedy this, you will need to rest in between quests. If you can&rsquo;t afford to rest due to lack of funds, maybe that stressed out Dwarf will have to stay behind during the next quest, forcing you to solve the task with a skeleton crew.&#10;&#10;Characters are designed around several stats such as strength and dexterity but also around skills such as Pick lock or Heal. Depending on their profession the heroes will excel in some of these, while being quite useless in other. Through levelling, you will also unlock talents which will boost certain areas of your character and perks which are powerful boosts that can be used a limited number of times. There are more than 100 talents and perks in the game. As your heroes levels up, the monsters they meet will be tougher as well.&#10;&#10;Combat is an essential part of the game and is designed to promote movement and prevent those bogged down battles of attrition. With several types of attacks available, both for monsters and heroes, combat becomes more flexible and less of a chore. Add to this the decision if you should evoke that special perk that could change the outcome of the battle or save it to the next.&#10;&#10;Finally, each dungeon has a threat level. This will increase as the Dungeoneers make their way through he dungeon. Making noises such as bashing down a door, or maybe screaming because of your stress syndrome, is a bad idea. This will increase the threat level, which in turn increases the chances of something bad happening. Maybe you will trigger a wandering group of monsters or set of a trap? It can also give the monsters unexpected boosts during combat.&#10;&#10;I've have received some question and I thought I would make some clarifications:&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium+ I would say. There is quite a lot of information defining each character which of course makes things more complex. However, the actual gameplay is pretty straight forward once you get the hang of it. A gaming session can easily be paused by just taking a picture of the setup.&#10;&#10;What miniatures can I use?: You can use tokens, standees or any other miniatures you have. The tiles are supplied with miniatures about 28mm with a 25mm base in mind but can of course be scaled to any scale you want to.&#10;&#10;How many different kinds of monsters are there?: A little more than 80. Some of these are variants, such as Orc, Orc brute and Orc berserker for instance. There are also several special characters that you will face during the quests not included in this list.&#10;&#10;Can I use other tiles or a 3D-printed dungeon with this game?: Yes! This is a simple matter of making your own rooms and corridors table. There is even a template for this in the files section.&#10;&#10;This game does not focus on stream lining, but rather on creating a detailed dungeon crawler experience. It will require more on the behalf of the player than some of the more modern designs, but for me it's the perfect level of detail.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
