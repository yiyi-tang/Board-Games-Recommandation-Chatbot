You do this by answering questions anywhere from logic puzzles to open-ended opinion questions to move across the board. These questions are scenarios you may encounter as mayor or problems that could happen in a city. One player takes on the role of &quot;Council Master&quot; and judge the answers of the two teams deciding whether they can move on or repeat the question. The Council Master will have two biases from the bias deck that inform their opinion about proposed answers.&#10;&#10;This game encourages players to think through logical arguments and their reasoning behind their answers. No matter how good the end solution is, if a player does not support it with a logical argument, they will fail that question. This games also encourages teamwork as the players except for the Council Master are split into two separate teams who must work together.&#10;&#10;The end goal of this game is to be able to use it in the classroom to teach logic, argument skills, teamwork, and engage students. It was created with a math classroom (specifically geometry) but it can be used in any classroom, especially government classes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Congratulations on successfully completing the hiring process for the Corporate Reacquisitions Department. As a newly inducted permanent employee of CORECorp, you will soon have the privilege of answering Distress Calls, urgent summons for aid from fellow employees, where you will proceed to secure all of their issued company property and return it safely to the nearest Processing Facility. Distressed employees are not eligible for rescue or relief at this time.&#10;&#10;In Distress Call, players will assume the roles of crew members aboard a Corporate Reacquisitions ship, specialists who have been tasked with securing specific types of cargo. Taking turns, following the lead of the Employee of the Moment, players will divide up company assets, choosing pallets of randomly sorted cargo.&#10;&#10;Once all the cargo has been seized, each crew member will deposit their pallet's cargo into a locked storage container. The three shared storage containers are only opened at the end of the game, so each crew member will have to remember where they stored cargo as well as what type of cargo other crew members stored.&#10;&#10;After answering three Distress Calls, sorting and securing cargo each time, the ship will set its autopilot for the nearest Processing Facility where the containers with the least Space Trash are deposited and their contents scored. Make more points than the other crew members by ensuring the return of your specialized cargo to win the game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It is a wonderful tabletop game and, at the same time, a beautiful decoration for your home.

I mean real physical attack! Are you ready to get your Endless Column and build your own endless tower now? Let&rsquo;s go!&#10;&#10;Regarding the general gameplay, in each round there will be 3 active players with different roles: Dark Stacker, Pale Stacker and Invader.

The entrance to the buried ruins of the ancient city of Lamur have been discovered, and you&rsquo;ve rushed to put together an expedition. After long weeks of travel, you crest a mountain pass at the head of your caravan, and look down on the lost valley. As you near the ruins, other groups approach from other directions, and who should be leading them but your greatest rivals! None of you are the type to share glory, so one of you suggests a wager: whoever manages to leave the city with the greatest collection of discoveries will take everything, including all the fame!&#10;&#10;You start the game by placing the entrance tile. Each player chooses a Player Piece and places it on the Entrance. Each player gets 5 Discovery cards to start the game, which represent the equipment &amp; supplies you bring with you into the ruin. On each turn, a player can:&#10;&ndash; Explore by placing a new Tile card next to the Tile they&rsquo;re on. If the Tile is a room with a number, you place that number of Discovery cards face-up on the Tile to represent the things occupying the room.&#10;&ndash; Move by discarding a card from their hand. You can move a number of tiles up to the value of the discarded card. You then draw a card to represent discoveries you made along the way. Every player should always have 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&ndash; Claim the top card from the pile on the Tile they&rsquo;re on (if there are any). In order to do this, you need to discard a card from your hand that is worth the same or more than the card being claimed. Each type of card is worth double against one other type, and half against another.&#10;&#10;The objective is to have the highest-scoring hand when the game ends. The basic scoring system, and a few optional variants, are laid-out in the rules included with the game, but house rules are encouraged! The game ends when the last card is drawn from the Discovery card deck. It&rsquo;s also possible for a player to deliberately end the game if no more Tiles can be placed, and they can get to the Entrance tile.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This action made it clear that Giap&rsquo;s objective was to control the Tonkin delta in order to threaten Hano&iuml; from the south. De Lattre decided to block him by launching a vast operation against his supply lines by occupying the Muong country in the Hoa Binh and Cho Ben sectors between the Da River and the Black River. After seizing Cho Ben (Operation Tulip), the French launched Operation Lotus to seize Hoa Binh.&#10;&#10;Hoa Binh, the Battle of the Black River is a solo-player game simulating the combats around the Black River and Colonial Route #6 that occurred from 13 November 1951 to 25 February 1952. The counters mainly represent the French battalions or Viet Minh actions and one game turn represents ten days of operation.

Whoever does the best job keeping their compound and followers safe will be the winner and will lead the remains of humanity as the ashes fall.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You use cards with various operators and functions for the goal.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has 3 &quot;bases &quot;(1, X, X ^ 2). In your turn, you can perform an operation or add a function to their field from their hands. You can choose between attack or defense.&#10;&#10;When you choose Attack: Differentiate the opponent's base and erase it.&#10;When you choose Defense: Add your own base or strengthen it with integration.&#10;&#10;The base disappears when the result of the operation becomes 0 or diverges.&#10;&#10;It seems difficult, but once you learn how to play it, you can always play this exciting game.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to have the most valuable collection of animals after four generations.&#10;&#10;Shuffle all 18 numbered cards except the rabbit and place the first green, blue and yellow card from the top of the pile in the center of the table.&#10;As a deck, you then take the remaining 15 cards in your hand. The red end-of-round card goes behind the deck.&#10;If you play the rabbit variant, the rabbit goes behind the end-of-round card.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you look at the top three cards of your deck. &#10;After that, you have two choices: The evolution pause or the mating.&#10;If you can't or don't want to mate any animals, you put one of the three cards to the right of the three cards in the evolution pause and then you take one of the three cards and put it behind your deck.&#10;&#10;To mate, use the mating options shown on the cards. &#10;Directional arrows also show you action requests for pairing. You turn one of the two cards involved either around its center axis or its long side and then put it behind the deck as usual.&#10;&#10;If you see an exclamation mark next to the direction arrow, put the card aside. If you do, you won't be able to develop it, but it will earn you points in the end.&#10;&#10;The other card used for pairing is placed in the center of the table. Then take a new card from the three already there and put it behind your deck.&#10;&#10;As soon as the red end-of-round card is the top card in the deck, turn it according to its directional arrow and put it back behind your deck.&#10;After the fourth round, total up your points by adding up the values of all the cards (from the center of the table, your deck, and the cards already set aside), taking into account any bonuses you have unlocked.&#10;&#10;For example, if you have upgraded both Chameleons twice, you get nine points instead of six.&#10;&#10;VARIANT WITH RABBITS&#10;&#10;Once you have familiarized yourself with the game, you can use the rabbit.&#10;Play two rounds, one without rabbit and one with rabbit using the same card order in your deck. Before starting the first round, write down the order of the card numbers to be able to create an equal deck for the second round.&#10;Try to avoid a mating rabbit as this costs you victory points.&#10;Your goal is to score more points in the round with the rabbit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

The classes are:&#10;- Knight (take less damage)&#10;- Ranger (escape more easily)&#10;- Wizard (spells pack an extra punch)&#10;- Merchant (save money on items)&#10;- Cleric (restore health over time)&#10;- Assassin (deal more damage)&#10;- Noble (get an extra item when you land on the castle)&#10;&#10;You will take turns rolling and traveling around the board, landing on different space types (note: if you land on another player you may attack them). The rulebook has a standard setup shown, but is customizable so that you can add, reduce, and mix up spaces for variety and replay-ability. The space types are:&#10;- Monster (fight an NPC)&#10;- Random Event (something happens)&#10;- Shop (buy or attempt to steal items)&#10;- Tavern (restore health)&#10;- Castle (start here; get a gift from the King when you pass)&#10;- Arena (battle another player as if you just landed on them)&#10;- Bandit (pay to steal from another player)&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to defeat the other players in combat and earn points, with the first to reach the predetermined number declared the winner, or play last-man-standing in which the last player surviving is the winner and crowned Champion. Players may choose to team up if they wish, but can always end their truce at any time without notice.&#10;&#10;When you land on another player you will have the option to attack and engage them in battle. In battle, you will take turns either rolling to attack or rolling in an attempt to flee, and may strategically utilize a wide variety of items and spells to gain the upper hand. Battle only ends when one player is defeated (their health drops to 0), or when someone rolls for a successful escape.&#10;&#10;Items are purchased (or stolen) from the Shop. These include a huge variety of weapons, spells, trinkets, gear, consumables, and more. You don't have to show what items you have in your inventory unless it is actively equipped (like a weapon), so you never know what your opponent may have in store should you attack them and vice versa; Could be some paltry Moldy Boots and a Vegetable Stew, or an epic spell like Meteor Strike and a healing potion or two. Card-play is an integral part of Nooblings, and knowing when to play a certain card could mean the difference between victory or defeat.&#10;&#10;On your quest to become champion, you will encounter a variety of dangerous monsters and may choose to either stand your ground and fight or attempt to run away. If you successfully defeat a monster you will receive loot (gold coins) which can be spent to purchase items, rest at the Tavern, and more.&#10;&#10;Random Event cards are drawn and flipped over when you land on a Random Event space. Something will immediately happen. These could be good or bad, can affect one or multiple players, and sometimes you might have to make an important choice which could change the tide of the game.&#10;&#10;",

In order to complete these orders, players will have to purchase the right amount of leather skins, and outsource as many workshops as needed.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, players will also encounter opportunities to upgrade their production, whether it's improving revenue from specific cities, requiring less skins for certain products, or simply by acquiring new workshops.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player buys a target amount of workshops (this could be from 2 to 5, depends on the total players and the desired game length).&#10;&#10;The game features beautiful thematic art, and uses exclusively cards in different sizes and formats. It's easy to learn, and apt for beginners and veterans alike, putting their time and economical management skills to the test.&#10;&#10;It is a portable, short, fast-paced game that simulates Ubrique's leather goods production history, as it begun with modest individually-owned workshops, and grew to a town with major factories that work closely with top European brands.&#10;&#10;The game also used insider expertise and consultancy from the designer's father, Inaki Xalabarde, who is a leather goods fashion designer himself, and has lived and worked in Ubrique sporadically.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Every player starts with a weak hand of cards which they attempt to improve upon every round as they accumulate money and play matches against their opponents.&#10;&#10;You will look to strengthen your team so to be more successful in matches, but you'll also need to grow your club's finances so you can buy new players. It's a tricky balancing act to achieve and it might be the case that smart decisions only start paying off as the game goes into the late stages.&#10;&#10;There are five kinds of cards in the game:&#10;&#10;- player cards feature players and you'll use them in matches against an opponent &#10;- formation cards give your playing skills a permanent boost. Keep them on display at all times&#10;- stadium cards increase the money you make when you play a home match&#10;- action cards allow you to weaken an opponent's team or, in some cases, gain extra cards for free&#10;- economy cards give you income you can spend in the Marketplace&#10;&#10;You'll only ever have five cards (six/seven if you happen to have a formation/stadium card in play) in play at one time. Your active hand is known as your Line-Up.&#10;&#10;To play matches, pick an opponent. Add up your total attacking scores across your Line-Up. Your opponent does the same but adds up their total defence score. Then both managers add a dice roll to your score. Highest combined score wins the match!&#10;&#10;The winning team takes three points and moves up the league table. The first team to reach 70 points wins the title!&#10;&#10;Race For The Title is the second game by Webstar Games - the first, Counter Attack, is also football themed.&#10;&#10;Note: Race For the Title didn't meet its Kickstarter goal in 2022. It has since been redesigned (which is why you'll find two different looks to the game) and is ready for a Kickstarter relaunch soon&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Puerto Rico 1897 takes place the year after Puerto Rico achieved political autonomy and separated itself from the colonial Spanish government. In the game, you take on the role of an independent Puerto Rican farmer in this new era and compete against others to hire workers to grow, sell, and trade valuable crops. You will also be in charge of resurrecting parts of the country as you attempt to build vital city infrastructure. Your goal throughout the game is to acquire more wealth and prestige than your opponents and become the most prosperous farmer across the country. Each player has their own small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico 1897 uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops that they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not function unless they are staffed by workers.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action associated with that role. The player who selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so; for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, and the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for occupied &quot;large buildings&quot;. Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players, and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico 1897 includes four expansions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Remote Viewing, players are testing their clairvoyant abilities in describing the possible location of criminals to FBI agents.&#10;&#10;The game includes a large map and 4 levels of clues.  Each clue card represents a different location in the map, but depending upon the difficulty chosen, the image may be more obscured. The player taking on the role of the clairvoyant in a turn chooses a difficulty of card and attempts to describe a location to the FBI agents.&#10;&#10;The FBI agents each get one guess for the location and once they choose a location, they cannot move it and a second player cannot guess the same space.  The clairvoyant has a limited amount of time to describe the scene, and if an agent can guess the location in that time, both the agent and the clairvoyant gets points.  If an agent guesses after the description time, only the agent gets points.  If no agent guesses the correct location, the clairvoyant loses points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches 9 points and that player wins.&#10;&#10;The game is based upon one of the designer's works from the &quot;Is this a game?&quot; exhibit, and includes a two-player cooperative version which most closely resembles the exhibition version.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hill of Death is the first game in the new &quot;Shattered Union&quot; American Civil War series by Tiny Battle Publishing. The series is designed to be accessible and fast-playing, suitable for gamers of any experience level. It is based firmly within the core design philosophy of the Blind Swords and Black Swan systems, but will focus on more obscure or over-looked battles and campaigns, including some fictional &quot;what if&quot; battles that could have occurred during the war. The entire series is governed by one relatively simple set of standard Series Rules, which are altered in each game by a few Game Module specific rules.&#10;&#10;The Hill of Death is the first Game Module in the Shattered Union series and covers the entire Battle of Champion Hill. This critical engagement was fought just outside of Vicksburg, Mississippi on May 16th ,1863, between the Union Army of the Tennessee (under Major General Ulysses S. Grant) and the Confederate Army of Vicksburg (under Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton). Grant successfully landed his Union army on the shores of the Mississippi River and quickly advanced inland towards the Mississippi state capital of Jackson. General Joseph E. Johnston&rsquo;s Confederate force made only a token effort at defending the city and then Johnston instructed Pemberton to sally forth from the Vicksburg fortress and attack Grant&rsquo;s line of supply. On the morning of May 16th, Pemberton&rsquo;s Army of Vicksburg was in route to fulfilling that mission when it received new orders from Johnston to turn around and join him near the town of Clinton. Pemberton hesitated and as he contemplated his next move, Grant about-faced the Union army. Leaving most of Sherman&rsquo;s Corps to hold Jackson, he began a determined advance against Vicksburg and Pemberton&rsquo;s strung out and confused Rebel army. The Battle of Champion Hill was underway, and the fate of Vicksburg hung in the balance. &#10;   &#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 &ndash; 17&quot; x 22&quot; Map &#10;189 &ndash; Counters &#10;45 &ndash; Cards&#10;1 &ndash; Player Aid&#10;1 &ndash; Series Rulebook&#10;1 &ndash; Game Module Rulebook&#10;5 &ndash; Six-Sided Dice (Red, White, Black, Blue and Gray)&#10;&#10;",
