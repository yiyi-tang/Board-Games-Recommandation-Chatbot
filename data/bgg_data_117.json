    "Description": "&quot;Strike South&quot; is a &quot;Second World War at Sea&quot;-series game based on the Japanese efforts in early World War 2 to seize the rich assets of the Dutch East Indies. There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two operational maps, covering the South China Sea and the East Indies, and these maps overlap with the maps in the &quot;Eastern Fleet&quot; product.&#10;&#10;As with all &quot;Great War at Sea&quot;/&quot;Second World War at Sea&quot; games, the tactical map is a generic field of blue hexagons that ships and aircraft move to when fleets meet on the operational maps.  Combat is simple - roll 1d6 for every 'factor' the ship has, with a result of '6' equaling a hit.  Compare the weapon that hit (primary gun, secondary gun, tertiary gun, torpedo, or bomb) vs the armor of the area hit to determine if penetration occurred.  If it did, mark off a damage box.&#10;&#10;&quot;Strike South&quot; includes 15 scenarios, of which 8 of these are limited &quot;Battle Scenarios&quot;, that just use the tactical map.  The larger 'Operational Scenarios' can take some time to play out - sometimes a whole evening, although Avalanche Press tries to focus them on a 2-hr timeframe - and include such actions as the last mission of the British Battleship Prince of Wales, the Battle of the Java Sea, the Battle of Sunda Strait, and the Japanese invasion of the Philipines.&#10;&#10;Strike South includes: &#10;&#10;     Two 32&quot;x22&quot; strategic maps &#10;     11&quot;x17&quot; tactical map &#10;     420 game pieces &#10;     12-page rulebook &#10;     12-page scenario book &#10;     2 player aid cards &#10;     1 organizational card &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Through the play of cards representing your supporters and the use of 'cumals' (a cumal is worth three cows), you attempt to promote your followers from Farmers to Herdsmen, through Warriors to Chieftains and finally to the ruling King in the region.&#10;&#10;Tara is played in rounds of three cards.  A round is completed when each player has used three cards.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:&#10;A    Place pieces into a region;&#10;B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;&#10;C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;&#10;D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.&#10;&#10;If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.&#10;&#10;By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.&#10;&#10;After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.&#10;&#10;",

When you place tiles to your castle, your baron moves around a path to collect bonuses, and the first to reach 7 coins wins the game.

Depending on what tile you build and where, your baron gets to move a certain number of steps. If you land on an opponent, you pass it for free! If you land on a bonus, you collect it, and if you land on or pass a coin bonus, you take a coin from the coin market. Each coin has an immediate 1-time effect, and the first to reach 7 coins wins the game. An example of a coin effect can be: 'The player with most windows on the castle draws 2 tiles'. This enhances competition and the importance of timing.&#10;&#10;When building, your tile number must be the sum of the 2 tiles it is built on, rewarding careful planning. +-1 adjustments can be paid for. Some tiles can be placed on any number, but often limit how you can continue upwards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

First entry in a new series of games covering the Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars at low to moderate level of complexity.&#10;&#10;At the heart of The Invasion of Russia (1812) are innovative and simple mechanics intended to encapsulate key elements of campaign warfare during the Napoleonic period; sweeping manoeuvres, feints and deceptions, forced marches, the greater flexibility and cohesion of seasoned troops, and the crucial importance of logistics. This is a very playable game with two sheets of large die-cut counters, one map of Russia and bordering states, at a scale of about 33 miles per hex, 15 days per game-turn. Each unit counter roughly represents a division.&#10;&#10;The Invasion of Russia (1812) is very much a wargame, with an emphasis is upon the challenges of leading and co-ordinating armies during the Napoleonic period. Victory will generally go to the player who is best able to formulate and implement a cogent strategy aimed at attaining well defined objectives, whilst allowing a margin of error for enemy action and ill-fortune.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;    A 24&quot;x17&quot; map of Russia and Eastern Europe&#10;    A rules booklet&#10;    2 Charts&#10;    A sheet with 216 large ( 5/8&quot; ) counters&#10;    A set of 36 Random Event Cards (for the Advanced Game)&#10;    Cover-folder&#10;&#10;(from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

The other pieces are not needed in either case.&#10;&#10;The 36 wooden pieces or 25 picture tiles are mixed up and laid out in a circle. The game figure is placed on any of the wooden pieces or picture tiles. The 36 (or 25, respectively) small gold coins, and the large gold coin are placed in the center of the circle.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, he or she moves the game figure forward either one, two, or three places clockwise along the circle. The player then takes the wooden piece that the game figure is standing over and places the piece in front of themselves so that it is visible to all players. The game figure remains in the empty space.&#10;&#10;When a player takes the last piece of a color (ie. yellow) or the last of a shape (ie. triangle), the game is interrupted and scoring takes place. Every player who has a piece of this color or shape in front of them receives a small gold coin for each of these pieces. When playing with the picture tiles, scoring is based on the colors or animals (with only 5 gold coins). If the taken piece is the last one of a color and shape, there is a double scoring: 6 (or 5) small coins for the appropriate color and 6 (or 5) for the appropriate shape (or animal) are distributed.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all 36 (or 25) small coins are distributed. The player with most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The game is an adaptation of &quot;Wheel of History&quot; from New Games in Old Rome. Marketed for children, but has variants for adults as well. It has nice-looking components (wooden pieces of different colors and shapes).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Summary from Columbia Games website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Borodino was fought between the Army of Imperial Russia and Napoleon's Grand Armee on September 7 1812. The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoleon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.&#10;&#10;The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoleon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically. The French player has several possible lines of attack and the Russian player must try to anticipate and counter them all. The tactical interaction of Napoleonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares. This makes for exciting and tense gaming.&#10;&#10;Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Shiloh. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division of the same corps. Game time is 3-4 hours.&quot;&#10;&#10;Note:  This game should not be confused with Borodino 1812 or Borodino 1812 or any other similarly-named games.&#10;&#10;",

Collecting certain elements will level up your Traveler's spells, enabling power plays that can shift the pace of a fight dramatically. Each Traveler uses each element differently, and can greatly affect how you prioritize your drafting and banning.&#10;&#10;Banishing enemy characters, securing artifacts, and defeating rival Travelers will destabilize your opponent's timeline, but also grant them more power. Once their stability is lost, defeat their Traveler one final time to win!&#10;&#10;The game ends when you defeat the enemy Traveler after they have 3+ instability cards.&#10;&#10;",

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is Honolulu west of San Francisco? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.&#10;&#10;After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.&#10;&#10;After 15 cards are placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.&#10;&#10;After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Streets of Stalingrad&quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.&#10;&#10;The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.&#10;&#10;The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.&#10;&#10;The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.&#10;&#10;There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.&#10;&#10;There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.&#10;&#10;The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.&#10;&#10;",

Throw it in a purse to entertain your kids or carry it in your pocket to add some rowdy fun to pub time with the guys.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly builds their ships by laying down 10 cards. Cards add guns, treasure or a bomb to your ships. The players then take turns marauding other players&rsquo; ships or retreating to safety. Marauding is the key to victory, since a successful attack means you score the treasure from both ships, but beware! Their ships may be well-equipped with guns or rigged with a bomb! The player with the most treasure wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Then, the active player will select one of these 6 areas and will use the dice from that area to cross off boxes in the matching track on their player game sheet. Once they are done, the inactive players select 1 die from 2 different areas to cross off 2 boxes in the matching tracks on their game sheets.&#10;&#10;Marking off boxes in the 6 tracks (and the bonus Field Goal, Breakaway Run, and Yards After Catch tracks) will advance your Yardage marker down the field. Whenever you advance your Yardage marker into the End Zone you score a 7-point touchdown. You can also choose to kick a 3-point Field Goal anytime you are within Field Goal kicking range. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins. But be careful, the result on the Defense die may cost you yardage on your runs or passes!&#10;&#10;Football Highlights: The Dice Game is for 1 to 4 players ages 8 and up.

New designer Matsuura Yutaka has created a five-turn OCS mini-game that recreates this period of intense maneuvering. General Wainwright, commander of the North Luzon Force, conducted a brilliant retreat against the advancing Japanese blitzkrieg, and succeeded in getting a large number of troops to Bataan. In Luzon: Race for Bataan, the U.S.-Philippine Army must delay the Japanese advance and gather forces in the Bataan peninsula. As directed by Imperial General Headquarters, the Japanese priority is to capture Manila. However, if the U.S.-Philippine Army can be outmaneuvered, the Japanese could both occupy Manila and deal a devastating blow to the U.S.-Philippine Army. The game pits a small-but-elite Japanese force which must make fast progress against a larger, less-effective opponent.&#10;&#10;Luzon: Race for Bataan has a single 22&quot; x 34&quot; map, fewer than 50 combat units, and is played at a scale of 5-miles per hex and 3.5 days per turn.

A two player game with one side representing the German high command and the other, the Polish high command.

Germany must finish the battle and shift its army back to the western front to forestall an Anglo-French offensive.&#10;&#10;First To Fight is an Europa game. The two maps depict Poland and its neighbors at a scale of 16 miles per hex. The extensive terrain types show the diversity of Eastern Europe: from mountains to marsh, open plains to dense forest. The counters represent the German, Polish, and Soviet forces that fought in the campaign. Ground units are scaled at divisions, brigades, r&eacute;giments, and battalions; air units in groups of 40 to 60 aircraft.

Try to be more effective than your opponents and you win the game.&#10;&#10;There are many ways to build your economy. You may take a quick route resulting in pollution, or you can take it slow and clean. In every turn you choose a card from the display and place it in your territory in front of you. This will activate all the cards in a column and a row in which you placed the new card. So, think twice where you put each card.&#10;&#10;Pollution is a vital part of the game. Using international transport and speeding your production may help you get needed resources faster, but it creates pollution, which may block your cards and even stop you from scoring some of your resources. But using it carefully might lead to victory.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players built their territory of 9 cards (3 &times; 3 grid). At the end they activate their territory once more based on their secret scoring card. Players get victory point based on resources and goods they acquired during the game and they score bonus points from their secret scoring cards. Before the winner is announced they subtract points for each polluted card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Also the isolation of territories increases the fun for the more experienced player of strategy games.&#10;&#10;The game is originally in Dutch but a German version is available. An English version is not available, but rules and card translations are available on the website of the publisher www.thegamemaster.nl (set language to english)&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     De Ontembare Stad: Het Verraad&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You can play solo or cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions, set in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations (MTO) in Italy.&#10;&#10;The core game gives you a full team of Italian Soldiers and a full set of British Hostiles. Each Expansion then adds to these sets.&#10;&#10;This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!&#10;&#10;At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit.

You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;The contents of this set includes 280 cards comprising:&#10;&#10;&#10;    9 Italian Player Soldiers / 3 Team Soldiers / 5 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers&#10;    8 Missions / 8 Objectives / 18 Locations&#10;    15 Weapons / 11 Gear / 1 Unarmed Combat&#10;    25 Skills&#10;    10 Situation / 4 Service Records&#10;    78 Action / 12 Location Markers&#10;    60 UK Hostiles / 8 Events&#10;    6 counter sheets with 516 counters&#10;    d6 and d10 dice&#10;    Mounted display board&#10;    Warfighter Universal Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;As with all Warfighter products, Warfighter: Mediterranean is compatible with all other Warfighter products, especially the Europe, Pacific and North Africa WWII core boxes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you discard cards, draw back up to five, call for reinforcing ships (by playing combinations of 3 cards), and then play as many attack and defense cards as possible. Once you blast away an opponent's outer ship protection, you may attack his Flag Ship, hopefully destroying it, and eliminating it from the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast (Second Edition)&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast: Third Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You can foster each client&rsquo;s healing potential by interpreting the symbolism of their dreams.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player chooses a dream card and simultaneously reveals it. Next, you&rsquo;ll arrange the cards numerically beside the current client. The difference between your card&rsquo;s number and the next limits how many treatment tokens you may score: the bigger the gap, the better. If you&rsquo;re the first to complete all your tokens, it proves your treatments were the most effective&mdash;making you Freud&rsquo;s most formidable contemporary.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Through intrigues and skillful machinations, the members of the Spider Lodge influence the six Guilds of the city, which hold key positions in its community structure. They have developed a subtle method called &quot;Equilibrium&quot; in which they influence the actions of the Guilds for their own purposes without being exposed by doing so. Take the role of an esteemed member of the Spider Lodge and try through careful planning to achieve &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, destroy the plans of your opponents and claim for yourself the title of the High Counselor of Aar.&#10;&#10;In each round of Intrigue City each player changes the influence that he and one of his opponents has on the Guilds of Aar. Influence Tokens of three different values (1, 2 &amp; 3) represent each player&rsquo;s control over a Guild. Perfect balance of influence - not too obvious, nor too weak - is achieved by having Influence Tokens with a total value of six on a Guild; this is called an Equilibrium. At the end of each round each player scores Equilibrium Cards  for every Equilibrium he has managed to maintain up to that point. During the game players vote to increase the power of each Guild, also increasing the point value of that Guild&rsquo;s Equilibrium Cards, affecting each player&rsquo;s final score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website (fireandfury.com):&#10;&#10;Regimental Fire and Fury: &#10;Wargaming the Civil War with Miniatures&#10;&#10;By Rich Hasenauer&#10;&#10;Fire and Fury is one of the most popular historical military miniatures wargames in the hobby. This new regimental edition provides players a more in-depth look at American Civil War combat. The smaller scale allows you to take command of individual regiments and batteries and refight in greater detail many of the war's smaller engagements, as well as critical actions of the conflict's famous battles.&#10;&#10;For the new player it is an easy game to learn and enjoy. The veteran Fire and Fury gamer will find much that is familiar, like the play sequence, maneuver table, and combat system, while discovering a game taken to a new level of sophistication. Refined game mechanics strike a balance between playability and historical accuracy that draw upon twenty years of the Fire and Fury gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Brief Description&#10;&#10;Scope. A set of wargame rules using military miniatures, that allows players to recreate the small engagements and portions of larger battles of the American Civil War, 1861-1864.&#10;&#10;Scale. Tactical. 10-15 minutes per turn. 1&quot; = 25 yards. Units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and gun sections grouped into batteries for artillery. Intended for 15mm figures, other scale figures can be used by increasing or decreasing the basing and ground scales as described in the rules.&#10;&#10;Basing. Each 1&quot; x 3/4&quot; stand with 3 infantry figures, and 1&quot; x 1&quot; with 2 cavalry figures, represents 40 men. Each 1&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; stand with a gun model and 2 or 3 figure crew represents a 2-gun section. Unit size can range from 3 to 20 troop stands per regiment, with the average of 8-12 stands per unit. Batteries are represented by 2 to 3 gun stands.&#10;&#10;Game Turn Sequence. A game turn is divided into an alternating Union player turn and Confederate player turn. Players must follow the Player Turn Sequence. Each player turn consists of three phases. One phase must be completed before moving to the next. Some activities in a phase are performed by the opposing player or jointly by both players.&#10;&#10;Maneuver Phase - In the first phase of a player turn the player must resolve a maneuver check for each unit which he controls on the game table. A maneuver check involves either one or more units under the command of a single leader, or a single unit that is out of command. The maneuver check combines the elements in warfare of morale, command and control into a single die roll procedure using the Maneuver Table. The effects from the table describe the movement and other maneuvers that each unit is allowed or required to perform in this phase.&#10;&#10;Musketry and Cannonade Phase - There are two kinds of combat in the game: fire combat and charge combat. All fire combat is resolved in the second phase of the player turn. Both Union and Confederate units may fire during this phase. The phase consists of two rounds of fire combat. It begins with a round of defensive fire followed by a round of offensive fire. In the Confederate player turn only Union units may defensive fire, and only Confederate units may offensive fire. During the Union player turn the order is reversed with Confederate defensive fire followed by Union offensive fire. All fire combat is resolved using the Musketry &amp; Cannonade Table to determine casualties and other combat effects.&#10;&#10;Charge Phase - In the third and final phase of a player turn a charge combat must be resolved wherever a charging unit made contact with the enemy. The relative position between attacking and defending units will determine which combats need to be divided into less complex combat situations. Both sides then follow a joint die roll procedure to resolve a round of charge combat. The Charge Table is used to determine casualties and other combat effects. Depending on the results of the first round of combat, a second round of breakthrough charge combat may follow after all first round charge combats are resolved. After all charge combat is resolved, the current player turn ends and the next player turn begins.&#10;&#10;Battle Scenarios. The book provides guidelines for designing your own scenarios and six historical scenarios covering different periods and theaters of the war:&#10;&#10;1.The Battle of Ball's Bluff, October 21, 1861.&#10;2.Bloody Hill, The Battle of Wilson's Creek, August 10, 1861.&#10;3.Casey's Redoubt, The Battle of Seven Pines, May 31, 1862. &#10;4.The Battle Comes to Sheridan, The Battle of Stones River, December 31, 1862.&#10;5.Little Round Top, The Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863.&#10;6.The Battle of Olustee, February 20, 1864.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simulation of the battle of Flodden, 1513.&#10;&#10;Re-published in Battles magazine #9.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;The Flowers of The Forest covers the Anglo-Scots battle of Flodden in which an invading Scots army under the charismatic James IV was destroyed in hand-to-hand combat by the Earl of Surrey&rsquo;s force. This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           &#10;           &#10;The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           &#10;           &#10;The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           &#10;           &#10;The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios. It also addresses the great independence (in practice) of Scots nobles over their Sassenach equivalents. The game is not balanced but plays quickly so that each player may have a turn at each side.&#10;&#10;",

If she declines - paying cards if necessary to counter his Charm offensive - the Gentleman returns to the player's hand to brush up on his manners.&#10;&#10;Declining a proposal from a Gentleman with a higher Rank will earn you additional cards, and if you have more Ladies in Society than anyone else at the start of your turn, you get an extra 'go'. This can help you to dominate the matchmaking scene but will doubtless draw the ire of your rivals. It's good to be protective of your Ladies, but don't let them get left on the shelf...&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the game ends and players tally up the Virtue of their married characters, then subtract the Virtue of their 'old maids' (Ladies left unwed in Society).

    "Description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.&#10;&#10;How Is It Played?&#10;First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.&#10;&#10;When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.&#10;&#10;Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.&#10;&#10;You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.&#10;&#10;But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!&#10;&#10;Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!&#10;&#10;Head-to-head play?&#10;If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.&#10;&#10;Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.&#10;&#10;",

Many of the companies in the original 1829 are used in the Northern versions, as is the surveyor which was abandoned when 1830 was published in 1986.&#10;&#10;Large portions of the map from 1829 North overlap map sections on the original 1829 board, and the rules do not cover combining the two games.  The reason for this is that Francis Tresham (the designer of both games and 1830 and Civilization) felt that the combined game would be too large and unwieldy.  However, 18xx fans have always been fond of experimenting with the system and creating new variations with different locations.  A link is provided below to information on how some 18xx fans have combined the two games.&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)&#10;    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kaiju Crush is a light strategy game with limited grid movement, shared objectives, and intransitive combat on a modular board.&#10;&#10;In the game, players choose one of four giant monsters to play and proceed to crush buildings and fight other kaiju for victory points. On each player's turn, they choose to play either their own movement card or the shared movement card to land on and crush a city tile (a.k.a. a building). The player picks up the city tile and drops a territory marker in its place. City tiles score different points and territory markers can yield victory points based on objective cards that show goals like connected or unconnected territory markers, the number of city tile groups a player claims, and shapes created on the city grid.&#10;&#10;Points are also generated by fighting either a monster on an adjacent space or a monster occupying a territory marker. To fight, players draw five territory markers and look at the reverse side. There are five symbols that represent the blows in the fight: firebreath, claw, tail, kick, and spikes. These symbols are part of an intransitive combat system, in which some symbols beat others but are beaten by others in turn. Each monster also has their own unique fighting ability as well as special abilities that change every game. Winners of either type of battle gain a random combat victory token worth 1-3 points. Winners of territory battles also replace the current territory marker with their own, which may help meet objectives as well as thwart opponents.&#10;&#10;When no monster can move, the game is over, and the monster with the most victory points is supreme!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's advertising text: 'Kursk. Many historians believe it was the turning point of World War II. Kursk. Witness to the largest tank battle of the entire war. Kursk. The end of the myth of German invincibility. Kursk. Just one hell of a lot of fun to game with 1&rdquo; square cardboard counters representing platoons of infantry and tanks and batteries of anti-tank guns, mortars, and stuff. And that is what you get with Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk.&#10;&#10;Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk (PCD:K) is the port of Tiny Battles&rsquo; well-known Platoon Commander system to Flying Pig&rsquo;s big box, mounted map, large counter method of game publishing. Each game includes three mounted 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; geomorphic maps, and four sheets of thick (as in 2mm thick, wow these counters are so easy to pick up, thick, why haven&rsquo;t wargames been like this forever, thick), 1&rdquo; square counters. There are Tiger tanks, Panther tanks, Mk IV tanks, T-34/76 tanks, KV-1 tanks, SU-152 assault guns, infantry (rifle, guards, pioneers, submachinegun), mortar batteries, Stukas, IL-2, and more.&#10;&#10;PCD:K uses version 2 of the Platoon Commander rules, which are identical to the V1.5 rules released with the latest Tiny Battle Publishing Platoon Commander game, Poland Strikes, with the exception of enhanced artillery and new air strike routines.&#10;&#10;Each turn is gamed through several phases. At the beginning of each turn, the players determine initiative with a unique dice-off system in which ties award the initiative to whomever lacked it the previous turn and applying the Commander's Focus to the roll might tilt the odds in your favor. Next, players will draw a scenario-designated  number (usually just one) of Action Cards that may be used for anything from artillery strikes, through rally assists, to negating the opponent's just-played card. Then it is time to rally disrupted units with a simple 1d6 roll against a nationality or scenario-designated morale. Action Cards, in addition to the special Aid chit, may be used to improve a unit's chances of preparing for combat.&#10;&#10;And then all hell breaks lose...&#10;&#10;It's the Fire Phase and players alternate firing with individual units or stacks of units against in-range and in-sight enemy units. When firing on the enemy tanks, the target's Armor Factor is subtracted from the firing unit's Armor Piercing Factor, two dice are rolled, and the results checked on the appropriate column on the Fire Results Table, yielding a number of potential hits. The target rolls a die for each potential hit and compares it to his or her morale. Pass the morale check, that hit is negated. These columns and die rolls can be modified by the target's terrain, flanking fire, the Focus marker (represents the commander's presence), and most importantly Action Cards, which can grant column shifts or even allow the same unit to fire again, adding a delicious uncertainty that makes the game thrilling to play. Players continue to alternate attacks until neither wishes to attack.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Movement Phase. Unlike the preceding Fire Phase, one player moves ALL his eligible units before the opposition gets to move. Certain units can move and fire or vice versa (with a penalty), unfired opposing units can opportunity fire on enemies moving within their line of sight. As in many other facets of the game, the insightful play of Action Cards during the movement phase is critical, allowing additional movement or opportunity fire conducted by units that have already fired. No PanzerBush tactics here, you never know when a unit will be able to fire on you. Exciting stuff.&#10;&#10;Finally, we reach the Aid and Focus Phase. Platoon Commander eschews the use of HQs that can be unrealistically targeted. Instead both players have Aid and Focus markers, representing where the commander intends to place emphasis or send additional assets (ammunition, weapons, etc) or first aid. The placement of these markers provides combat and morale bonuses to the units underneath them. Additionally, if the player chooses, the Focus marker can be used to influence the initiative roll.&#10;&#10;And that's a turn of Platoon Commander.&#10;&#10;So, What's Different?&#10;&#10;I hear that a lot. With all the tactical games on the market, what makes Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk different?&#10;&#10;Clutterless counters. PCD:K uses color to determine a weapon's range. For example, an Armor Piercing factor printed on gold indicates that the weapon can fire normally at a target up to four hexes away.&#10;Unique phasing. Players alternate attacking in the Fire Phase, but move all their units at once during the Movement Phase.&#10;Flanking Friendly Close Assault Phase. Units do not enter the hex of the Close Assault target, but rather attack from adjacent hexes. This allows the attacker to not only amass the overwhelming odds needed to take that key position, but also attack from multiple directions, which provide a flanking bonus. Additionally, alternating attacks in the Close Assault phase allow defenders to conduct true spoiling attacks. &#10;Ranged combat results are based not only an the target's armor factor and terrain, which determine the column on which the attack is executed, but also the target unit's morale which determines how many hits affected the target.&#10;Artillery is card driven. Neither player knows the other's artillery capability by glancing at a scenario card. Artillery barrages are determined by Action Cards.&#10;Action Cards. PCD:K is not card driven, but rather card assisted. The Action Cards provide artillery, rally units, provide combat bonuses, and even unexpected Opportunity Fire shots. &#10;Focus and Aid Markers. These markers allow players to influence the battle much as their real life counterparts would. Players may choose to focus on a specific area, providing combat bonuses, or provide additional aid to those disrupted by fire.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a system that grognards and newbies alike can enjoy. The counters are large, easy to read, and beautifully illustrated. There is no jungle of numbers to wade through; the range at which a unit can fire is indicated by the color of the placard (badge?) behind the attack factor. Although gamers need not fiddle with unit facing, simple rules account for flanking fire. And infantry isn&rsquo;t forgotten either. Platoon Commander Deluxe uses a unique system in which infantry assaults from adjacent hexes, allowing commanders to concentrate overwhelming force at a critical point and even conduct flank attacks. And woe be the Tiger platoon caught unsupported in the midst of a city by a horde of Russian rifleman.'&#10;&#10;",

To be hired by that explorer, though, your expedition must meet the demands of that explorer card in the category shown, such as having a technology level of at least five. When you place an explorer, you carry out the special power shown on that card, such as giving other players additional cards, taking an extra turn, or stealing equipment or explorers from others.&#10;&#10;Once a player has laid his final card, the round ends immediately. Players earn money equal to the value of the explorers lying above their boards, then lose two coins for each card still in hand.

    "Description": "The original Champions of Aerim have long since faded from memory. Technology has begun its slow and steady rise within civilization, while many still cling desperately to the magic of old. Astaria itself has grown into a vast, sprawling empire, yet rebellion is carried on whispers from deep within the shadows. The strength of steam could spark a revolution. But for the Eternals, the cycle continues as it always has. For them, there is only... strife.&#10;&#10;Strife: Shadows and Steam is a stand-alone sequel to Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. Using the same core mechanics, Strife: SaS introduces new characters, abilities and a unique twist or two that will be sure to add a fresh take on this exciting game. This sequel is also fully compatible with the original game, so you can face off with champions of Aerim from different ages!&#10;&#10;Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&#10;&#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

When preparation is over, the run begins.&#10;&#10;During each turn of the void run, players will flip over the next card in the 10-card void deck, and all must resolve that card (take damage if it's a creature, draw and resolve a dice roll event card, or gain victory points based on the card revealed).&#10;&#10;Once a void run card is resolved, all players who remain alive in the void must then choose whether to leave the void and bank their stored energy for the next run (they gain one per void run card successfully cleared) or to push their luck and prepare to resolve the next void card.&#10;&#10;Deciding when and how far to push your luck is doubly intense and gripping, because all players are armed with a small hand of unique ability cards each run. These cards have lots of powers, which range from preventing damage and skipping void events, to messing with other players and causing havoc for their opponents (or preventing opponents from messing with them).&#10;&#10;Abilities can be played at almost any time during the run. When multiple players fire abilities that would negate or impact another player's abilities, the abilities are resolved in instant reverse order (like instants in Magic: The Gathering).&#10;&#10;Any player who survives the entire 10-card run gains additional victory points and other perks.&#10;&#10;Players continue the Preparation -&gt; Void Run loop until someone reaches 10 victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;game board&quot; consists of a 4x4 grid formed by the 16 region cards. After setup, one player reveals the top attack card. Afterwards the players determine the transformer effect. Now each player draws dice out of their bag (normally 5) and rolls them. Then, each player takes one action with one or more of their dice, until all players have used all of their dice.&#10;&#10;Dice may be placed on a player&acute;s own player mat;&#10;To use an already built Public Building;&#10;To activate one of their own Player Cards; or&#10;To use an active Player Card&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn the players have to defend themselves against the attack of the Circumdate Caelo Trust.

The phases of a turn are: bid on shares, build track, trade shares (at two-to-one: two basic shares for a grouping share), pay dividends, and turn order. If the game ends, either by the game marker (a little wooden locomotive) reaching the end-of-game space OR if all six basic railways have the been finished. When the game is at its end, the Big Payoff begins, whereby players liquidate all of their holdings. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;This game did away with the crayon aspect of its predecessor. Cubes are used to show expansion links. Some stocks also begin in the hands of &quot;dummy&quot; players. This results in the game opening not quite being so wide open. There is an advanced game variant that provides a variable starting setup if the basic game's opening becomes too scripted.&#10;&#10;The basic rail companies are: the Midland Railway (red), the London &amp; North Western Railway (black), the North Eastern Railway (brown), the Great Central Railway (blue), the Great Northern Railway (green), and the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway (yellow).

Each tile depicts two sandy spaces, two turtles, or sand and a turtle.&#10;&#10;On a turn, first move two of your tokens one space each or one token two spaces. Tokens move orthogonally and can land on other tokens, whether yours or the opponent's, but you can never land on a turtle. After movement, slide the remaining tile into either side of the row where your last-moved token landed, ejecting another tile from the game board. Any tokens on this tile are returned to their respecting starting zone.&#10;&#10;Tokens can be stacked up to three high; when a token moves from the top of a stack, it moves 2-3 spaces depending on the height of the stack and can jump turtles while moving.&#10;&#10;If a token reaches the opponent's starting zone, it remains there, and the first player to cross the board with five of their tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Portal is a 'stripped-down' version of Magic: the Gathering designed to appeal to new players.  While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability &quot;Horsemanship&quot;, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.&#10;&#10;Portal was printed in three editions:&#10;&#10;     Portal&#10;     Portal Second Age&#10;     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)&#10;&#10;&#10;",
