    "Description": "HISTORY: Ivan III the Great came to the throne of Muscovy as its Grand Prince on the death of his father Vasily (Basil) II in 1462. Through his cunning diplomacy and well-timed military actions he was responsible over the next 43 years for expanding the state of Muscovy enormously, conquering, annexing, or marrying into the lands of Rostov, Yaroslavl, Ryazan, Novgorod, Vyatka, Tver, and a substantial piece of Lithuania, while forming sturdy alliances with Pskov, the Crimean Tatars, Kazan, and Denmark, and at the same time having to deal with religious controversies and the periodic treacheries of various boyars and even of his own family. His son Vasily III and grandson Ivan IV (the Terrible) extended his remarkable gains even further. Essentially, Ivan single-handedly created what we now know as the Russian nation.&#10;&#10;During most of his reign, his most powerful rival was Casimir IV, Grand Prince of Lithuania, although, despite much peripheral conflict, Muscovy and Lithuania did not go to all-out war until 1500, some eight years after Casimir&rsquo;s death.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME: In brief, Muscovy is trying to gain control of or subdue as many countries as possible before the big war with Lithuania, while maintaining high levels on the Ivan's Prestige, Russian Orthodox Church, and Victory Point charts. Some of these countries will become full allies, others will just be reduced so as not to cause serious trouble in Ivan&rsquo;s rear later on. Once the war with Lithuania begins, Muscovy will try to take over as much territory from Lithuania as he can. (Military success may possibly make up for any shortfalls in the three charts.) The Lithuanian player is simply trying to throw as many monkey wrenches as he can into Muscovy&rsquo;s plans by keeping up pressure on various fronts, military and geographical (the map) as well as political (the charts).&#10;&#10;There is a 22-turn campaign game, and there are five shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Every player gets a Hat Card, 5 (random) Craft Cards, and 3 Bravo Chips. The Heckle Cards are placed in the middle of the playing area, and the StoryTimer is handed to the player who is going first.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the first player reading aloud one of the 53 included storylines. There are three phases to play:&#10;&#10;Phase I: StoryTelling&#10;The player holding the StoryTimer creates (speaking out loud) the next part of the story (typically a sentence or two). Play moves around the table, with each player creating and speaking a new addition to the story. During this time, if a StoryTeller uses one of the elements on your Craft cards, you place it next to your Hat Card. Bravo Chips can also be tossed to StoryTellers who do a particularly good job.&#10;&#10;Phase II: Discussion&#10;Anyone who played a Craft Card points it out to the others. If no one object, it goes on to that player's Hat Card and will be a point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Phase III: Recitation&#10;The player holding the StoryTimer gives a Recitation of the story so far. Other players can toss Bravo Chips for a Recitation well done. The StoryTimer is passed to the left, everyone draws back up to 5 Craft Cards, and we go back to Phase I.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players vote to assign awards (most creative, most hilarious, most surprising, most dramatic). These go into the recipients' hats.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most points in his or her hat.&#10;&#10;A couple notes about the cards are in order. Craft Cards contain elements of the StoryTellers Craft, which means that players score points by either using or recognizing good storytelling. There are also Heckle Cards which are common to everyone and can be tossed to stop things from getting out of hand.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the introduction to the rules:&#10;&quot;Policeman Paul has a lot of work to do today as quite a number of crooks are hanging around town. Studying the &quot;personal description&quot; given by the dice in the tumbler, you can help Paul track down the crooks in a thrilling chase. Who will be the best assistant policeman and the quickest at catching the right crook?&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a game in Haba's range of tumble-dice games, which include dice inside a sealed tumbler with a clear plastic dome. This game has 3 six-sided dice, two of which are essentially D3s, with 3 different faces repeated once. There is a die with dots (1, 2 or 3 dots), a colour die (yellow for the beach, green for the park and blue for the town) and a crook die (Policeman Paul, a chubby crook, a woman crook [on 2 faces] or a crook with a loot bag[on 2 faces]). Besides the dice and the rules, there's a large wooden piece representing Policeman Paul and a deck of 27 cards, showing all possible combinations with crooks of the three dice.&#10;&#10;The 27 cards are placed face up on the table around the Policeman Paul piece. A player shakes the tumbler. Depending on what the dice in the tumbler show, players try to claim the corresponding cards on the table. If the crook die shows the Policeman Paul face, the other dice are ignored and players try to grab the Policeman Paul piece - the successful player gets to choose any card on the table and place it in front of himself. If the crook die shows a crook, the players try to cover with their hand the card showing the corresponding number (on the die with dots) of that kind of crook in the venue specified (by the colour die). Players can only use one hand and the player who successfully covers the correct card with his hand gets to place the card in front of him. Players who wrongly grab Policeman Paul or cover the wrong card can make no further attempt to claim the right card that turn. Cards in front of players can be captured by other players if the same combination of dice get rolled again.&#10;&#10;The first player to claim five crook cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a game, Talecraft aims to promote creative thinking through story creation. As a story-creation tool, Talecraft aims to help writers generate ideas for stories, and help combat Mental Block.&#10;&#10;Talecraft provides the different Genres and Archetypes as cards. Since the setting is dependent on the genre of the story, Talecraft leaves the creation of the time and place to the imagination of the player. For the plot, Talecraft uses the Key cards, where a player may either be given plots, or keywords that would govern the story. Players may be required to add more characters to his cards. In this event, the player&rsquo;s story would be more character-driven than plot-driven.&#10;&#10;A player of Talecraft has to create a story using the cards he had picked. The limit the picked cards set to a player prompts the use of the player&rsquo;s resourcefulness; and the need to fit all the cards into a story stretches his imagination.&#10;&#10;It is not a requirement to appoint a winner when playing Talecraft. Since the aim of the game is to make stories, and the basis of a good story often depends on the judge's personal taste, Talecraft is often played without declaring winners. Should a winner be required, however, here is how it is done:&#10;&#10;Each player will have a cup before him. After the player tells his story, all the other players will drop coins in the storyteller&rsquo;s cup, depending on its impact on them. If a player thinks the storyteller&rsquo;s story was not well made (like if there are a lot of loose ends, or if the events of the story are too scattered), the player does not drop any coin into the storyteller&rsquo;s cup. If the player thinks the story is acceptable but has little impact on him, he drops a coin in the cup. If the story manages to amuse the player, he drops two coins. And if the story awes him, he drops three coins. At the end of the game, or rounds of game, the players tally the scores. The player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Another way to decide a winner for Talecraft is to appoint a non-player as a judge who would decide who the winner is to be.&#10;&#10;",

When the time is up then they offer between 3 and 5 points to their adversaries. They read those 3 definitions and have to guess which one is correct.&#10;If they get it right it's them who advance on the track otherwise it's the active players.&#10;This continues until one team reaches the end of the track.&#10;&#10;The game consists of the board, 420 cards, 8 standard pawns, 1 pad, 4 pencils, the sand timer and of course the rules.&#10;&#10;",

Implements and rules were included for one game along with &quot;a full set of checker men&quot; (as a Stoll &amp; Edwards catalog put it) for the other.&#10;&#10;In this case, the &quot;A&quot; game is a simple spin-and-move race through the episodes of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), including the Pool of Tears, the Caucus Race, the Mad Tea Party, and the Queen's Croquet Grounds. Occasional hazard spaces actually tend toward rewarding players, but occasionally they can force players to move back a few spaces or lose one or two turns.&#10;&#10;The original Stoll &amp; Edwards edition has a game board printed in three colors (black, orange and green). In their next incarnation as Stoll &amp; Einson, the publisher reissued the game a decade later under their &quot;Playjoy&quot; brand, with board art utilizing a wider variety of colors and some illustrations revised to more strongly resemble Sir John Tenniel's famous book illustrations.&#10;&#10;",

Play alternates between attacking and defending.  The attacker selects a region in the opponent's country that borders either the common border or one of the previously captured regions.  The attacker and the defender each secretly select a set of contiguous numbers from their grid of numbers.  The attacker selects from three to six and the defender selects one to three numbers.  The product of the attackers numbers is divided by the product of the defenders numbers.  If the resulting value is larger than the region number, the attacker colors the  region in.  If the  value is lower,  the defender colors the region in.  Once a region is colored in, it may not change hands again.  Numbers used in attack or defense may not be used again either.&#10;&#10;A player wins when the other capital is captured or when he seals off all paths to his own capital.  If a player does not have three contiguous numbers on his grid, he may no longer attack.  If neither player may attack, then the winner is determined by comparing the sum of the regions that each would need to take including capturing the capital - the lower sum wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a beautiful old spin-and-move racing game from Milton Bradley that was first published in 1873, clearly to latch on to the fame of Jules Verne's novel Around the World in 80 Days, published in the same year. Unlike the voyage of Phineas Fogg, the game's track is strictly by sea.&#10;&#10;Both the game equipment and rules are more complex than usual for a Victorian spin-and-move. The key difference is that winning does not mean who completing the 93-space spiral track the fastest, but doing so in the fewest days. In addition to spaces that move players forward and back, many of them apply time penalties. Each player has a card that tracks the number of days taken - one per pip on the five-space teetotum and one more for each penalty day. With absolutely perfect spins, it is possible to complete the journey in just 76 days, but this is highly unlikely!&#10;&#10;Each player card has one metal arrow on dial that counts up to 50 days, and another on a smaller quarter-circle dial that tracks multiples of 50 to a pessimistic maximum of 450. On the back of each card is a &quot;Record Tablet&quot; with a space for the days taken for each stage from New York to: Equator, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn, Equator, San Francisco, Sandwich Islands, Hong Kong, Anjer, Mauritius, Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Equator and back to New York. The 1873 edition includes a global map showing the voyage track that is formed into a sleeve wrapped around the player cards.&#10;&#10;",

He then deals the answers round, an equal number to each player; after this is done, he shuffles the pack of Heads, and placing the whole pack face downwards on the table, desires one of the players to take the uppermost and read aloud the name of the king, when he was born, died, etc. The president then asks the question from this little book, connected with the card turned up and whoever plays the proper answer, receives one counter from the pool; but if the answer is wrong, one counter must be paid to the pool. The next player then takes a Head and the same rule must be observed till all of them are read. When a player has forfeited all his counters, his remaining cards must be given to the player on his right hand. Should the pool become empty, each player must contribute one counter.&#10;&#10;The game is decided in two ways, either by all but one player having forfeited their counters, or by all the heads having been turned up, in which case the remaining players are to reckon their counters, and he who has the greatest number wins the game. The winner takes the contents of the pool, and claims the office of president in the next game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the patent description:&#10;&quot;A multiple player word forming game is disclosed. The game uses a board, a cup and a plurality of cards. The cards are randomly transferred to and from the players. The players use the cards to form words. In the best mode, a game board defines a flat surface bounded by a peripheral wall upon which the cup freely travels about. A player begins a turn by spinning the cup, which eventually lands upon a card transfer space. The card transfer space dictates whether the player either draws or passes cards. The player transfers cards either from the deck or to a discard pile or to or from another player during a turn. Then the player attempts to spell a word by selecting cards in his hand and laying them face-up in front of him. Opponents may challenge the player's word. Any player who transfers all of his cards during a set becomes empty-handed and may not challenge words. The number of points earned by each player is dependent upon their performance both in forming words and in manipulating the number of cards in their hand. Preferably, a chance card multiplies the number of points a player can get. The set ending player's total score is doubled if the player ended the set with the chance card. Other player's scores are multiplied by zero if they held the chance card when an opponent ended the set.&quot;&#10;&#10;In English, players use a cup shaped spinner that will move around the 5x5 board to determine card movement between the players. Players have to build words from their available cards and score points displayed on the cards.&#10;&#10;",

A player wins by placing four quods that form the four corners of a square.  The square can be any size and any orientation (in other words, the square can be &quot;tilted&quot;).&#10;&#10;In addition, each player has a small number of pieces, called quasars, that are used purely for blocking.&#10;&#10;Quod was invented by G. Keith Stills in 1979, while he was at college, and was popularized by Scientific American in March 1996.&#10;&#10;Many computer implementations exist, such as&#10;http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/2220/quod.html&#10;and&#10;http://wizard.ae.krakow.pl/~jb/Quod/&#10;&#10;",

This means each player&rsquo;s cumulative selection for the special movement category (energy bursts for breakaway and sprint actions) must fit within a maximum budget restriction.&#10;&#10;Note that the current written version of the rules relies upon a prior understanding of the standard game (most importantly regarding rules of movement). It does not provide a stand-alone description.&#10;&#10;Dice are not used, here. Each player controls a deck of 48 cards for all movement, and each card contains information to serve multiple purposes. Players can divide the cards as they wish, selecting some for special movement skills (bidding for breakaway and sprint) while the remainder constitutes a random-draw stack that will be used for basic movement (ordinary counts of zero through 4).&#10;&#10;",
