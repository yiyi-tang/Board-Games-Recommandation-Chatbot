Both games in the system represent, in two-player format, a clash between two or more of the important military powers in that region during the middle third of that century. The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated, or could have participated, in those battles, and the maps show the militarily significant terrain over which the units fought or could have fought.&#10;&#10;Suez '56 simulates the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt at the time of the 1956 Arab-Israeli War. The Anglo-French objectives were to seize the Suez Canal, which the Egyptians had nationalized, and to possibly also overthrow the regime of Gamel Abd El Nasser. Though the invaders gain their military objectives, they unleashed a political disaster on themselves when the United States joined the Soviet Union in condemning the operation.&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #226 - Jan/Feb 2005.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 6-8 hours&#10;Hex: 360 yards / 329 meters&#10;Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters - 101 for Suez &#039;56, 110 for El Arish '67, 30 errata/variant for The East is Red, 39 errata/variant for Dixie)&#10;One 16-page Middle East Battles rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-10 Hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If I'm Going Down... (or IIGD) is the first ever Dying Card Game (or DCG) from Van Ryder Games. A DCG is a card game in which it is certain that the character(s) WILL die. For 1 to 2 players (expandable to 3 to 4 with a 2nd copy), IIGD is set in a world overrun by zombies. Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.&#10;&#10;IIGD puts you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead). You must gather and use weapons and resources to take as many of the abominations as you can with you.&#10;&#10;Zombies enter the playing area from several &quot;Entry&quot; points depending on the scenario. You can take actions during your turn such as Attack, Use an Item, or Search for Resources. Each turn the Zombies will be moved closer and closer and eventually the resources will run out...&#10;&#10;Random events or &quot;Occurrences&quot; that come into play and change the rules keep the game fresh and different every time. The game may be played in a sort of &quot;Kill em All&quot; mode where you simply try to achieve the best score or you can play one of several Story Arcs that add entertaining story lines to the game where how well you do determines what happens in the story after you die.&#10;&#10;The unique mechanisms of the Fate Deck &ndash; which determines whether you find a resource when searching and whether you &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; during an attack &ndash; and the Tracker cards &ndash; which are used to keep track of health, ammo, and inventory &ndash; make this a game unlike any you have seen before.&#10;&#10;One other thing that makes this game unique in the Zombie genre is that each Zombie is illustrated with AMAZING detail and has a character all its own. You may just become more invested in the story of the Zombies than you are in the characters you play!&#10;&#10;IIGD allows for some level of creative control for players who have interest in making their own layouts and scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

After he went to the oracle at Delphi and prayed to the god Apollo for guidance, Hercules was instructed to serve King Eurystheus and perform twelve difficult labours to atone for his actions. In this game, players will take on the roles of Hercules and his companions to complete these twelve labours (known as tasks). However, things are not as easy as they appear - mysterious perils await you, and some of you might betray Hercules!&#10;&#10;The Labours of Hercules is a cooperative game for 4-7 players. Each round, different tasks will appear on the table. To complete a task, Hercules needs to collaborate with his companions to gather the necessary items.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, new tasks will arise to challenge Hercules and his companions. If Hercules fails to complete the tasks, he will lose courage (represented by bravery tokens), which may lead some his companions to betray him and further increase his challenge. Hercules and his companions win if they complete all the tasks. But if Hercules loses all of his bravery tokens, Hercules and his companions lose and villains who betrayed him win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players effectively make a large pattern of groups of noses and score points at the end for owning groups. There are 10 noses, all taken from art, shown paired up in every combination on large tiles (excepting one pairing because there are only 54 tiles in the game). The tiles are shuffled face-down and distributed evenly (excess can go in the box). Players then turn up and sort their noses out.&#10;&#10;They take it in turns to add a nose to the pattern according to the rules, and when a player makes or increases a group of one type of nose, they place one of their five colored markers on it. (If you happen to increase two groups, you place 2 markers.)&#10;&#10;But as soon as another player increases that group, their marker replaces the first, which goes back to the other player. In this way, the pattern gets bigger and players fight to control the noses. But because of the random distribution, you will have some fewer noses than others, so the placement becomes very tactical as you try to close off groups and secure your scoring.&#10;&#10;The pattern must sit within a 10x10 grid, and all the tiles are open, so it pays to deliberately extend the grid in one direction, giving or taking away opportunities. When no more tiles can be placed, you score one point for each nose you own.&#10;&#10;A surprisingly tricky game given the range of noses, Nasenspiel entertains with a delightful combination of sacrifice and reward and a very unusual theme.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeon Dwellers is a fantasy adventure card game that requires strategy, cooperation, and cunning. This game is recommended for 2-4 players. Each player will take on the role of an adventurer seeking gold. Along the way, adventurers will gain treasure, magic items, abilities, and level increases by defeating monsters within the dungeon. The winner will be the player who collects the most gold at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To play, each player selects a Character (Rogue, Priest, Mage, and Fighter). All Characters have their own special ability, weapons, armor and item cards. Players will build a 30-card deck, also called the Energy Deck, with these cards.  The deck will be used to power abilities, do damage to monster and will also be used to gain additional treasure, in the form of gold cards, or items and abilities to put into active play.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns using their abilities and weapons to cause damage and collect experience points from monsters.  Players will use their energy deck throughout the game, but if they spend too much energy, they might not have enough to survive the final boss. Can your party work together and survive the dungeon or feel the agony of defeat. In the end there can be only one winner and that is the player with the most gold.&#10;&#10;",

Baby Luck gives poker chips to another parent, the Shy Baby offers a cocktail to the most thirsty passenger, the Captain Baby passes one of your cocktails on to another parent, and the Police Baby can rat you out to your spouse if you had too many cocktails. All that chaos grants plenty of bluffing opportunities to snatch the jackpot for yourself. Make sure you'll win the jackpot before you get caught drunk behind a slot machine or you'll be in big trouble!&#10;&#10;Every turn in Baby Cruise, you take a card from the draw pile and show it to everybody. You must give the card to another player. Most cards show a baby, a cocktail, and a fruit symbol. Every baby has their own special rules, and they can mess up your plans (or the plans of the other players). As soon as you have received a set of three matching fruit symbols, you win the round, but you can also lose a round if you get caught drunk with too many cocktails in your hands!&#10;&#10;Some cards show a slot machine and a cocktail. These cards also have to be given to another player and it will give them an additional winning condition, but due to the cocktail they also increase the risk of getting caught drunk.&#10;&#10;If you play several rounds the winner of a round will receive golden milk bottles and the loser (if there is one) will lose a token. The parent who owns the most golden milk bottles when they run out wins the jackpot (and the game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game of land development and litigation.  Each player is assigned an area of the board, containing three land sections and building lots of different colours (red, yellow, orange or blue).  The object of the game is to be the first to build all of your nine buildings.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you gamble for income.  The income die is rolled; if it comes up on its red dot face, you don't get any money.  Otherwise, you get the amount indicated and may roll again --but if you roll the red dot, you lose any income for the turn!  Income is doubled once you've completed all three buildings of one of your land sections, tripled once you've completed two sections.&#10;&#10;Next, you draw an Opportunity card and resolve it.  You may buy a Town Meeting card; these cards are either Legal Action or Defence cards (this is kept secret until used).  Finally, you may improve a property (from its undeveloped state), or build a resort on it (once improved) --if you have the money.  The properties have varying degrees of risk associated with them (the Opportunity cards) and consequently varying building costs.&#10;&#10;When you complete a building, the other players may play Legal Action cards (up to five), each of which places a red marble in the gavel device.  You automatically get a green marble, and may add up to four more by using your Defence cards.  The gavel is then shaken and then held up so marbles roll into the handle; a window at the handle's end reveals who won.  If the opponents win, the builder does not get his building (and has lost the money) and the opponents get money from the bank for their trouble.&#10;&#10;",

Reveal  two &quot;bonus vault&quot; cards that show special ways to score.&#10;&#10;Each player then simultaneously and secretly writes a &quot;heist&quot; word on their player board using only the letters revealed, with as  many copies of those letters as they like. Once everyone has  finished, each player drops clues to their word by placing their personal clue tokens on as many public letters as they wish; if you use a letter multiple times in your word, you must mark the letter that many times.&#10;&#10;Next, after looking at those clues, each player writes a &quot;halt&quot; word on their player board that they think corresponds to an opponent's word.&#10;&#10;All players then reveal their words one by one. If two or more players have the same word, none of them score for that word; if an opponent has &quot;halted&quot; your word, then they score for that word instead of you! A word scores 1 point for each clue token you placed, +1 or +2 points for you using the letters placed in those slots, and bonus points if you met one or both &quot;bonus vault&quot; challenges.&#10;&#10;After writing all the used &quot;heist&quot; and &quot;halt&quot; words on a public board, shuffle the letter cards, then play another round. You cannot repeat a previously used word. After a third round conducted in the same manner, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is for the French to hold out long enough for the fortress to be relieved, or even gain a decisive victory by breaking Viet Minh morale.&#10;&#10;While a solitaire game, Dien Bien Phu can also be played by two or more players, each taking charge of different aspects of the French defense.

The Romans, meanwhile, built up their strength and eventually counterattacked, leading to a Roman victory.&#10;&#10;The game shows the difference between the two military systems, the Carthaginians start out with better leaders, but the Romans have a greater population to build armies from. The game map represents countries of the Western Mediterranean area in which the war actually took place.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents one year. During each turn, there is in sequence a Diplomacy Segment, a Carthaginian turn and a Roman turn. Basic and Advanced Rules allow customization of gameplay. Strategic movement is performed on the map. When armies engage each other, they are transferred to a Battleboard, which allows for army field positioning and tactical combat.  Amphibious Assaults, Recruiting and Promotion on the March, Siege Assault, Naval Combat and Interception, and Neutrals are all part of the basic rules. Tactical Superiority, Roman Battlefield relief, Supply and Attrition, Land Units in naval combat, Limited Intelligence, Blockade, and special rules for Syracuse are Advanced rules.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #141.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 year&#10;Map: Point-to-Point&#10;Units: 1,500 to 10,000 men, 25-50 warships&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page Hannibal: The Second Punic War rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-5 Hours&#10;&#10;Players will have to provide one 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

In order to take his place and serve the Shogun, the Daimyos of each clan have started the choosing process, and yes, you are said Daimyos. If you want to become the next Great Daimyo, you only need to manage one thing: Be the last survivor.&#10;&#10;During your turn in Shinobi Assasins, you must attack the three rivals on your right, giving each of them an attack card face down.

Upon receiving the face-down attack, the assaulted player must mark the kind of attack he&rsquo;s been told to be receiving by placing a black cube on top of the appropriate weapon icon on the back of the card. If a player has already received two identical attacks from other ninjas, be they true or not, you cannot repeat the same attack a third time.&#10;&#10;When you attack, you can say whatever you want and gesticulate frantically or subtly wink to another player, anything you deem necessary to confuse them as to which attack you&rsquo;re really assigning. Remember, deceit will be your most powerful weapon. Once you&rsquo;ve assigned three of your ninjas to attack your rivals, the following player will do the same.&#10;&#10;Once all the players have assigned their attacks, each of you will have before you three face-down attack cards, courtesy of the loving clans to your left. Each card will have a cube marking the weapon the attacking ninja is supposedly using. The time has come to use intuition, dodge and denounce.&#10;&#10;",

But when the player who already has the wolf announces a wrong number, he or she has to dump one goat to the wolf.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either one player has collected seven heads (and thus wins) or the wolf has six (and thus all players lose).&#10;&#10;French description:&#10;Contenu: 6 cachettes de couleur, 30 chevreaux, 1 loup, 1 d&eacute; multicolore (6 couleurs), 1 d&eacute; multicolore (3 couleurs, pour la variante simplifi&eacute;e), 1 r&egrave;gle du jeu.&#10;&#10;Dur&eacute;e de la partie : env.15 minutes&#10;&#10;But du jeu : sauver les chevreaux cach&eacute;s avant qu'ils ne tombent dans la gueule du loup.&#10;Un formidable jeu de m&eacute;moire comprennant une variante pour les joueurs plus jeunes.

It was one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Diadochi and was waged to determine the sovereignty of Coele Syria.&#10;&#10;Raphia was technically designed as a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game.  However, only a small subset of the SCS rules are needed for play. If you are familiar with usual wargame movement (what an MP is, how units count movement, etc), stacking, step loss, and retreat conventions, there is no need to review the SCS rulebook itself (not included, but will be referenced in the links section).&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their units and conducting ranged combat and melee until the victory conditions are reached.&#10;&#10;A player wins Raphia by being the first to move one of their Phalanx units into the enemy home tent.  If all Phalanxes are destroyed before either player wins, the result is a draw.&#10;&#10;Raphia is one of the games included in Multi-Man Publishing's (MMP) Special Ops magazine Issue #1 (Summer 2011).&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 11 x 17&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheets (140 1/2&quot; counters though only 130 are used for the game)&#10;One 4-page rule booklet&#10;&#10;",

The map depicts the Plain of Vigrid, lying between the Rainbow Bridge and the city of the gods, Asgard, where the battle takes place, and the playing pieces represent warriors, Valkyries, Frost Giants, Fire Giants, and such celebrated individuals as Odin, Thor, Loki, and the Midgard Serpent. Each player maneuvers his forces across the map in an effort to fulfill his victory conditions. To win, the player commanding the invading Jotun forces must destroy Asgard, thus bringing about Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods. The Aesir player must repel the Jotun invasion to win, thus postponing Asgard's fall.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Ares Magazine #8 May 1981&#10;&#10;",

A card is drawn which instructs the players to write down a list of things like: cartoon animals, round fruit, pizza toppings, Jim Carry Movies etc. Players then compare their lists with their partners. The team with the most matches advances their pawn on the game board, and the first team to reach Brain Central wins.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;Would you write the same things down when you are asked to make a list of pizza toppings? Things found in a fish tank? TV game shows? &#10; You'll find out when you play Like Minds. &#10; Players sit across from their game partner. The Like Mind's brain is put in reach of everyone. The category is read out loud for all players to hear ...but only ONE player from each team knows how many matches are needed to win the round. &#10; Everyone starts writing answers to the category. As soon as you think you and your partner have the number of matches needed, you grab the brain. Now compare your list with your partner's. &#10; Here's an example: The category is &quot;things teenagers do in their spare time.&quot; You know you and your partner only need three matches. You write down whatever comes to mind, hoping that it comes to your partner's mind too. &quot;Listen to music&quot;, &quot;watch TV&quot;, &quot;play sports&quot;, &quot;use the internet&quot;. &#10; Did you match at least three? If so, you win the round and get to move ahead on the game board. The more matches you and your teammate make, the faster you'll get to Brain Central and the win! &#10; Includes game board, 35 game cards with 420 categories, 4 folders, dice, dice cup, brain, movers, pads, and instructions&#10;&#10;",

A fast-paced, action-packed flicking game for 2-4 players, ages 6-99. A popular and classic HABA game with over 100,000 copies sold in Europe, in a brand new design!&#10;&#10;Sample Game 1:&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;Take turns based on the order of the starting numbers. The player with the lowest starting&#10;number starts and rolls both dice.&#10;What do the dice show?&#10;&bull; Two matching colors&#10; Throw the dice again.&#10;&bull; Two different colors&#10; Take the flicking string and try to flick the race car matching the color on one of the die to&#10;another race car of the other color.&#10;Important: It mustn't come into contact with any another vehicles!&#10;Did you hit the right vehicle, and not touch another one in the process?&#10;&#10;&bull; Yes:&#10; Brilliant! Take the gray trophy and put it on top of your own trophy, then advance one space&#10; towards the target.&#10; Whenever you have successfully flicked, you can choose between two options: &#10;1. Take a risk and carry on: Roll both dice again and continue as described above.&#10;2. Score points and end your turn; put your trophy in the place of the gray trophy and&#10; place the gray trophy back next to the points bar.&#10;&#10;&bull; No:&#10; That's too bad! No points. If the gray trophy is displaying points that you already won, then&#10;you lose these points and the gray trophy is placed back next to the points bar.&#10;The player with the next starting number then takes their turn. Before rolling the dice, the&#10;player must fi rst check to see whether the distance between the sideline banners and the&#10;racing cars is at least the length of the short side of the drift block. If this is not the case,&#10;then the player may move the race cars accordingly.&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;The game ends when a player managers to reach the last space or beyond on the points bar&#10;with their trophy, and by doing so they win the &quot;Rumble Rage&quot;.&#10;Tips for experienced Rumble Racers:&#10;&bull; Double points: If you roll two of the same color and the gray trophy is already showing one&#10; or more points, then your go will score double points. Drag the gray trophy forward the&#10; exact same number of spaces that separate it from your trophy, then roll again.&#10;&bull; Drifting: If you use the drift block during your fl ick and it works, i.e. the fi rst vehicle bounces&#10; off the drift block before it hits the second vehicle, then you get an extra point and are&#10; allowed to move the gray trophy one space forward.&#10;&bull; Side banner crash: If you touch another vehicle with an outer band, then you do not receive&#10; any points and your turn ends immediately.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #256 (May/Jun 2009).&#10;&#10;Marlborough&rsquo;s Battles: Ramillies and Malplaquet is a wargame of intermediate complexity, designed by Richard H. Berg, covering two of the Duke&rsquo;s great victories in the War of the Spanish Succession: Ramillies, a massive cavalry clash, and Malplaquet, a hue infantry battle. The period in which Marlborough fought was a transition between the musket-and-pike era and the more fluid, if still massed, tactics that emerged with Frederick the Great. The key transitional mechanic was the invention of the socket bayonet, which allowed gun-armed infantry to use their weapon for shock as well as fire combat. The battles fought in the War of the Spanish Succession were the first major engagements in which that innovation was used, and the commanders hadn&rsquo;t yet learned to appreciate its value. Warfare in that era was therefore mostly still formalized, rigid and stolid.&#10;&#10;The map scale is 225 yards per hex. Each double-length infantry unit is composed of, on an average, four battalions and contains about 2,000 to 3,000 tightly packed men. The square infantry counters (for use in Malplaquet) each represent about half that number. Cavalry units each contain about five or six squadrons, about 600 mounted men. Artillery units each represent 12 to 18 guns. There is no per-turn time scale, as there are no distinct game turns. The game simply starts and then keeps going until one player wins. To accomplish that the system uses a &ldquo;continuation activation&rdquo; mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Manufactured in the USA!&#10;&#10;Daimyo Senso is a 1-8 player game where each player takes the role of a 16th century Japanese daimyo in conquest to become the next Shogun. Players take turns during 4 seasons per year for 4 years, using predetermined commands during each season. Those commands are Move, Deploy, or Attack. Once per year, each daimyo may use one special skill, which amplifies the power of one of their commands. At the end of each year, players tally up their total Castles, Cities, and Fortresses and are awarded Honor based on that total.&#10;&#10;The game is over after 4 years, and the player with the most Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In single player, the board is set up with significantly more troops, and the player must battle through all of them to completely conquer 5 Regions within 4 years. This race against the clock also acts to help players understand the Actions and General Cards.&#10;&#10;Edit: There are now additional multiplayer rules for playing the game out until only one player is left. This is an optional way to play, and makes the game much longer, but is still as strategic and even more desperately gratifying when a long-term plan comes together through alliance, deceit, and careful planning. Another optional rule sets the board up with all daimyo present even in a less-than-8 player game.&#10;&#10;Each faction in the game is asymmetrical, and each has its own 4 special skills, called General Cards. The factions include:&#10;Oda - Beginning in south central Honshu, the Oda clan has powerful General Cards that allow him to wage war heavily and assign his armies to the most crucial battlefronts.&#10;Uesugi - The Uesugi clan's attacks are bolstered by powerful generals, and his tactical movements and deployments insure that his armies are where they need to be.&#10;Takeda - While the mighty Takeda war machine has deceptively light attack powers, their troop movements and deployments make them extremely able to defend their hard-won gains.&#10;Hojo - The Hojo employ shinobi, which allows them to completely fool their enemies. While an enemy may think the Hojo are weak on one front, their armies can immediately arrive on the opposite end of their kingdom, shocking enemies into submission.&#10;Miyoshi - The Miyoshi use deception and surprise tactics to hit their enemies where they're weakest. Their powerful navy insures their ability to suddenly appear on any coast at any time.&#10;Mori - The Mori clan uses cunning to thwart their opponents. Their swift advance through unoccupied territories and their ability to fight on multiple fronts at once make them a headache for any enemy to stop.&#10;Date - The Date clan can assault enemy castles with heroic actions, and their ferocity makes neighboring armies wither. Beware the city of Sendai, as the Date will fiercely defend it.&#10;Shimazu - From the southern tip of Kyushu, the Shimazu wage war with their enemies to the North and East. The Shimazu are supported by the people, who rush to join their cause.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boots uses an interactive game turn in which both players command an overall force made up of several sub-commands. During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, may conduct attacks with the units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.&#10;&#10;In this game, each turn represents one month, and each hexagon on the map represents 10 miles across. US Army units, as well as those of the Mexican Federales forces, are battalions, regiments and brigades. Pancho Villa's units each represent correspondingly sized groups of combatants, with about 80 to 120 individuals per strength point.&#10;&#10;Low complexity, 280 counters.&#10;&#10;Published in S&amp;T 242 - May 2007&#10;&#10;",

The Kingdom of Raul fears for the fate and safety of Emperor Hal, who has disappeared without a trace on a hunting trip in the Bornland. While the heir apparent, Brin of Gareth, searches for his father, discord is sown in the capital city by the influential noble Answin in a bid for the throne. The orcs in the Middle Kingdom plot to make haste and take advantage of this prime opportunity! Thousands pour forth, warlike in their midnight furs, from Orkland and scour the country with fire and death. Desperately, Prince Brin gathers his remaining followers to face the hordes of the Aikar Brazoragh, the chief chosen by the Ork gods, on the battlefield. While the third Orc invasion rages in Aventuria, the cards to power and prestige will be reshuffled in the glamorous Gareth capital city. Here the adventure begins!&#10;&#10;In Orkensturm, the players take on the roles of those who have stayed behind in the Imperial City of Gareth. Will you choose to support Emperor Answin, the Usurper or the Rightful Heir to the throne, Brin of Gareth? Will Prince Brin succeed in routing the orcs and return home victorious from the battlefield? Or will he perish in battle, Answin remaining the only hope of the Middle Kingdom as a strong ruler? Which of them triumphs is uncertain, because the orc invasion has many possible outcomes. The players can exert their influence to support one of the factions &mdash; with direct effects on the end of the story.&#10;&#10;Orkensturm is a board game for 3-8 players, age 14 and above, with more than 200 cards, eight different colored tiles sets and a large game board with illustrations from the World of the Black Eye by artist Nadine Sch&auml;kel.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game, similar to Whist, is mostly played in Minnesota and South Dakota and was brought there by settlers from Norway.  It is extremely similar to a Scandinavian game, often listed in English language card game books under the name Norwegian Whist.&#10;&#10;There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Using a standard 52 card pack and no trumps.&#10;&#10;High / Low Bids&#10;Each hand is played either &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;. If it is played &quot;high&quot;, the partnership that takes at least 7 of the 13 tricks scores points. If it is played &quot;low&quot;, a partnership must take 6 or fewer tricks to avoid losing points.&#10;&#10;With High bid, when all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick they won in excess of 6. While with low bid, the side which won more tricks loses 1 point for each trick they have in excess of 6.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;The partnership which first reaches 13 points wins the game. This takes several deals.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;South Dakota Whist&#10;    This version has different scoring than Minnesota Whist. If players win fewer than 7 tricks while bidding high, they lose 1 point for each trick below 7. The other team does not score. If everyone bid low, the team that takes 7 or more tricks loses one point for each trick in excess of 6. The game is played to 11 points rather than 13.&#10;&#10;",

It became very popular with players around the world.&#10;&#10;In 2011, Steve&rsquo;s son Josh decided to re-release Megiddo with an updated design and new innovative rule change. Kl&uuml;ndt | Hosmer re-designed the look of the game for a new generation of players. A redesigned board, instruction booklet and packaging brought new energy to this timeless game, named after an ancient Hebrew city where numerous historical battles were waged.&#10;&#10;Megiddo will be available for purchase on Amazon.com and will soon be available as an app for iPhone and Android smart phones.&#10;&#10;We love design.

The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. &#10;Each turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. &#10;The British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.&#10;&#10;Designed by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS: &#10;&#10;    One rulebook &#10;    Two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps&#10;    400 die&middot;cut counters&#10;    One 10&middot;sided&#10;&#10;&#10;PLAYERS: 2&middot;4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.&#10;&#10;PLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;SCAN is a family game for 2 to 8 players, Ages 9 and up.  It contains two identical decks of cards printed with distinctive markings.  To start SCAN, a card in the holder is turned up and players try to be first to locate identical markings on the other set of cards which are spread out on the table.  SCAN is tense and exciting, requiring concentration and quick reactions to be a winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is one of those Parker Brothers card games of the late 60s/early 70s. Ages 9 to adult. The object is to &quot;Collect the greatest number of tan cards by correctly matching designs.&quot; The game consists of 23 tan cards, 23 blue cards, a little red tray, a cover card, three &quot;bluffo&quot; cards, and the instructions.&#10;&#10;It is essentially a matching game. A tan card with four complicated patterns on it is revealed, and after deciding which of the four designs you're matching, you have to find the corresponding blue card before your opponent(s) do. If you find it, you get to keep the tan card. The person with the most tan cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;This game is played by two people.  One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.&#10;&#10;User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.&#10;&#10;The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.&#10;&#10;Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&rsquo;s key cities.&#10;&#10;The player who eliminates all of the opponent&rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.&#10;&#10;[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961. It was designed by three Life magazine staff members. This Parker Brothers edition was published subsequently, and is thus more accurately described as the second edition. Refer to the brief clip from Life magazine in the graphics.&#10;&#10;",
