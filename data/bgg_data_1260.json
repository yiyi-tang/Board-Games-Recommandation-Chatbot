    "Description": "Myth: Dawn of Heroes is a cooperative tabletop game for 2 to 5 players. Each player takes on the role of a hero and must work together to overcome the Darkness. Using a deck of cards unique to each hero, players explore the realm, battle evil monsters, manage critical tasks, and avoid dangerous traps in order to complete quests and acquire powerful new items and abilities.&#10;&#10;Players' avatars are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.&#10;&#10;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Card suits are referred to as the voices, which encompass five categories (evolution, hedonism, reason, science, and shadow). These categories help distinguish associated card text.&#10;&#10;A session of Shadow Oracle consists of two segments, the game segment and the esoteric segment. The game segment is necessary for performing the esoteric segment. However, the esoteric segment is not necessary for a full game experience (the game can be played strictly on its own).&#10;&#10;The game involves building three columns of cards before a game-ending trigger occurs. If the game segment is completed successfully, a follow-up procedure narrows down the cards used in the esoteric segment. The final step involves reading and interpreting the card text. The card text draws on the wisdom of non-hallowed disciplines to provide insight for your decision-making conundrum.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But the threat of a Sasquatch attack looms in the trees...&#10;&#10;A survival game for two to four players.

The cards are resources that you can use to fend off a Sasquatch attack.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw a card. Then you have the option to: draw a second card, trade one of the cards in your hand with one of the cards in the discard pile, or end your turn. However, if during your turn you drew a Sasquatch card or two, now you have to deal with it! Hopefully you have the resources you need in hand in order to either flee from or kill the Sasquatch(es).&#10;&#10;If you kill a Sasquatch (by discarding javelin cards), you keep the Sasquatch card near you as your score and you get to take any item from the discard pile. If you flee from the Sasquatch (by dropping rations, sounding your alarm, or using torch cards) then the Sasquatch card(s) get  shuffled back into the draw pile.&#10;&#10;If you cannot flee from or kill the Sasquatch, then you have been killed and you are out of the game.

Then the Aethermon appeared - creatures from the AetherRealm, a world already lost to The Darkness.&#10;&#10;The Aethermon would make their final stand in defense of humanity. The spirit of the Aethermon remained unbroken, but ultimately their numbers were too few.&#10;&#10;Sparked by the valor of the Aethermon, it was a child who rose up first. Standing beside her new allies this child became the first AetherRen.&#10;&#10;United the AetherRen and the Aethermon forced The Darkness back into the night as it vowed to one day return.&#10;&#10;For generations Aethermon and AetherRen would train, preparing for the day The Darkness would return. But over time The Darkness was forgotten, and the training of Aethermon became sport.&#10;&#10;In Aethermon, 2-8 players take the role of young AetherRen competing to claim the Junior Aethermon Championship.&#10;&#10;Each player bonds with an Aethermon with their own elemental affinity (Moonlit, Sunstruck, Sky, Earth, Fire, Water, Nature and Thunder) granting them unique abilities and element specific combat moves.&#10;&#10;Players explore the world of Aethermon by playing Energy Cards (movement cards) to move around the board. Landing on special locations will trigger story driven events via decksploration mechanics. Landing on mundane squares will trigger battles or encounters.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by Battle Card mechanics. Success in battle will earn the player XG (experience-gold) a unified currency that can be exchanged for items, increases in stats or new Battle Cards (moves).&#10;&#10;As players complete quests and continue on their journey to become the Junior Aethermon Champion they will accrue fans - the player with the most fans at the end of Chapter 1 is the winner of Chapter 1.&#10;&#10;In Chapter 2 players must put aside old rivalries to face a greater threat. Victory can only be achieved by working together, recruiting new allies and ultimately pushing back The Darkness one more time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One round is always played as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rooting (all pigs at the same time!)&#10;     Claiming the pearls&#10;     Checking the claim and awarding the pearl card&#10;     Preparing for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;The end of the game:&#10;The game ends when there are not enough pearl cards left to make the row back up to three. Each player now counts up the points for all the pearl cards they have collected. The player with the most points is the winner. If more than one player scores the highest total, they are joint winners.&#10;&#10;",

Build teamwork and get 3 treasures quickly, starting with the enemy team.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ready&gt;&#10;1. Spread the board and place the treasure tiles in your pocket and mix well.&#10;2. Team up in pairs and pick up a pen.&#10;&#10;    Two-player play: One player plays the program and the other plays the programmer role.&#10;    4 player: 2vs2 team member structure, one player in the team takes on the role of the program and the other is the programmer.&#10;&#10;&#10;&lt;Game play&gt;&#10;1. The player in charge of the program holds the pen in the starting position (pear) and closes his eyes.&#10;The programmer takes the treasure out of his pocket and checks his location.&#10;2. The programmer gives instructions, and the program follows the instructions and draws a path with a pen. You can command up to 3 times, and you can only shout direction and Go, Stop.&#10;3. Put a clockwise direction in front of Go to tell the computer the direction.&#10;ex) Direction (&#226;&#152;&#133; Hour) + Go + Stop&#10;4. If the computer is hit by an island, whale, or shark while running, the programmer stops the command and clears the path.&#10;&#10;     Correcting errors due to errors is called debugging.&#10;&#10;&#10;5. When you find a clue, you switch roles.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ends&gt;&#10;1. The game ends when one team gets 3 clues, and the team that gets 3 first wins.&#10;&#10;",

Let's help 'Dogbug' to help you understand the language.&#10;&#10;&#10;    How do computers represent information?&#10;&#10;&#10;How can a computer know a person's language?&#10;Computers use computer language to express data such as numbers and letters, or images such as photos and pictures.&#10;1 on power on, 0 on power off, 1 for high dial tone, 0 for low dial tone. Like this, the computer can solve everything with two numbers, 0 and 1.&#10;&#10;&lt;Purpose of the game&gt;&#10;1. The sum of the numbers written on the popcorn must be greater than the other players.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ready&gt;&#10;1. Save the information (popcorn) to your computer (pocket).&#10;(Put the popcorn tiles in the pocket and shake to mix well.)&#10;2. The cards are flipped over with the 0s visible and placed in ascending order from right to left.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game play&gt;&#10;1. The first player must take one less than the number of players from their pockets to fry them in the center of the table.&#10;ex) If 4 players play, only 3 popcorn will be fried.&#10;2. If it's fried in popcorn, flip the card over and make the number written on the popcorn first. Once you have made the number you see, you can shout &quot;POP&quot;, then take the popcorn and place it in front of the card and wait a while.&#10;3. If all the popcorn (information) is gone, make sure the popcorn you brought together and the binary card match. If it is right at this time, stack it next to it. If it is wrong, return the tile you brought, and return it from the number of tiles you have acquired.&#10;4. When a new round begins, the player to the left in a clockwise direction starts the round with popcorn.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ends&gt;&#10;1. The game ends when there are no more popcorns to bounce, and a lot of people win by adding the number written to the total popcorn earned.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Vurdes Aerial Combat Institute has emerged as the premier pilot training facility in the galaxy. In order to gain admission, you've passed written tests and aced your interviews, but one final hurdle lies in your path: Adder. Can you best your rivals in this game designed to test your wits and reflexes?&#10;&#10;In this real-time game, 2-4 players chase each other by quickly placing cards on the table in order to move their ship and land it on the opponent's one.&#10;&#10;Real time games exist in an unique realm with board games. This one will remind you a bit of Snake, except there are no apples to eat in order to grow longer. What you are trying to do is cover the front or the back of the opponents&rsquo; snake, moving your back-most card to the front time and again until you win or you lose. The target is determined by a coin flip, and if you land on the coin or collide into the wrong part of a snake, you lose. This is sure to be a chaotic sort of fun that comes with very few cards and only a single coin as a component (well, apart from the table&hellip;)&#10;&#10;&#10;This is a reimplementation of 2018 9-card game Adder: Realtime Chase System, with more cards (18) that gets the game to 4 players and some new rules.&#10;&#10;Released in the February 2021 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Demockrasy is a two to eight player game in which you play the role of a powerbroker behind the scenes of American politics, putting together Politicians with Supporters whose votes they wield. Players compete to gain Power over the course of the game by voting on legislation their supporters approve or oppose; at the end of the game, the player with the most Power is the winner.&#10;&#10;Demockrasy is played over four rounds. Each round has a Drafting phase, when you choose Politicians and Supporters, and a Legislation phase, when you sponsor and vote on Legislation.&#10;&#10;During the Drafting phase, players pass several hands of cards around the table, each hand containing Politicians and Supporters. Players pick one of the cards from their hand, play it face-up in front of them, and pass the hand to the next player (passing left or right, depending on which round it is). There are three types of cards: Politicians, which may carry one to five supporters; Supporters, which give their associated politician one, two, or three votes; and Wild cards, which give the player a one-time opportunity to affect a legislative outcome or attack an opposing politician.  Once all players have played five cards, the Legislation phase begins.&#10;&#10;During the Legislation phase, each player must sponsor one Bill from their hand of Legislation cards (each player receives four Legislation cards at the beginning of the game).  The player with the top-ranked politician sponsors the first Bill. Once the Bill has been revealed, all players must cast a vote to OPPOSE or APPROVE the bill on behalf of all of their supporters and politicians.  Each player votes the total number of votes provided by their supporters. A simple majority wins; in a tie, the Bill fails.&#10;&#10;Supporters may (a) APPROVE a Bill, (b) OPPOSE a Bill, or (c) neither. If a Politician betrays a Supporter--for example, by voting to APPROVE a Bill that's opposed by his or her supporters--then that Supporter will abandon its Politician and break one of that Politician's hearts.  Each politician has 1 to 5 hearts; when the last heart breaks, the Politician retires and the associated supporters are discarded. Players also receive a broken heart--which they can assign to a politician of their choice--when they are on the losing side of a vote.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to gain power: (1) if you sponsor a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (2) if you APPROVE a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (3) you get 1 Power for each Legislation result that aligns to your Supporters' interests.&#10;&#10;After each round, clean up the spent Legislation cards and deal new Demockrasy cards (Politicians, Supporters, and Wild cards) to build up your political staff again! After four rounds, count up the power gained by each player; the most powerful player is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Japanese title could be translated to mean &quot;sprinkle of fruits and nuts&quot;, which is what you hear falling from trees in autumn.&#10;&#10;You each take on the role of a different tree species and use three different actions &mdash; grow trees, move flying squirrels (to spread the seeds), and move the clouds (to sprinkle water) &mdash; to gain victory points in the photosynthesis phase, which takes place several times during the game. The victory points you gain depend not only on the number and size of the trees, but also on the weather in the area where the trees grow.&#10;&#10;You can also plant trees in each area to gain the &quot;evolutionary power&quot; of that area. By using such power effectively, you can achieve more, such as increasing growth efficiency and generating more victory

    "Description": "From time to time, we all seek refuge in fond memories from our past; reminiscing about warm, cozy places where we once felt safe, blissful moments when everything seemed possible, significant others that made us feel important, made us feel loved... All these nostalgic reflections trigger a bittersweet, fuzzy emotion that gives a different perspective to our never-ending pursuit of happiness..!&#10;&#10;The Pursuit of Happiness: Nostalgia expansion introduces the concept of reminiscences; fond childhood memories, unfulfilled desires, dreams and aspirations of the past that players long to revive and pursue... The Nostalgia deck features double-sided cards that, once their requirements are met, unlock unique card types and game-play options to the players. Dealt from the very beginning of the game, these cards will drive players' game choices as they genuinely promote planning ahead. Is it ever really too late to chase your deepest dreams and desires? The expansion also enriches existing card types (Projects, Items, Activities, Jobs, Partners, Life Goals and Child Traits) in order to guarantee a true &ldquo;blast from the past&rdquo; experience!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The rules emphasise the tactical concerns of command friction and the fog of war through randomised initiative, tabletop mishap rolls and the impetuous decisions of unsupervised unit commanders.&#10;&#10;An all-in-one volume, this book contains the rules for stand-alone pitched battles as well as campaigns.&#10;&#10;Twenty-four example army lists are provided; however, army building is designed to be flexible. A toolkit of base profiles and unit traits allow players to build customised armies to suit their own vision of their fantasy faction.&#10;&#10;Scale agnostic, with multi-based figures and no individual figure removal, the game can be played using any fantasy figures, or historical armies from the ancient to the early modern period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If the die is 3579, make an odd number using two cards of different colors.&#10;5. If the dice is 2468, two cards of different colors are used to make an even number.&#10;6. The player with the first result gets 1 chip. If several people produce results at the same time, the one who gets the most takes the chips. &#10;(You can return 1 chip, discard as many cards as you like, and draw them from the pile.)&#10;7. The player with the chip replenishes 2 cards from the pile and then rolls the dice.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ends&gt;&#10;1. When all the chips are gone, the game is over, and the player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",
