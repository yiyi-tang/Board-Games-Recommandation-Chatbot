You are also given 50 million and the youngest player starts. You place your chosen playing piece on the board (you can start anywhere) and move the number you spin with the arrow in the centre of the board.  Each time you land on a coloured square you collect two more brand cards of that colour, or one if the board instructs you. Once you have three or more of a coloured brand you can announce a launch of your company. The person to your right shuffles the risky business cards, turning the cards over one at a time, so you can judge how much you will risk without getting a BUST! card. You then multiply the money by the number of brand cards you launched with. No takeover or newsflash cards are used.&#10;&#10;Executive Rules&#10;&#10;Add in the newsflash cards for a chance, which could be good or bad (named brands will change in value), and you have a game with a greater element of risk. These rules differ as you now have the chance when you land on the takeover spots on the board to pick up a takeover disc. The next time one of your competitors launches a company you can attempt a takeover. Adding the total of your brand cards, plus any additional 'on the up' brands, plus a spin of the central spinner. If you beat the opponent you win all their cards but be careful if you lose they launch their company with more brands and therefore can earn more money.&#10;&#10;",

The first person to play all influence tokens ends the game.  For each location, the player who has control of that location (determined by having more influence tokens than each other player), earns the victory points associated with that location (represented by stars in the top-right corner).  During play, if a player has presence on a card, they can use the actions on the cards by paying their cost.  These are effects like: kicking other players out of a location, taking more mints, and placing influence tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Prepare for invasion! Robotech RPG Tactics is a tactical miniatures game set in the Robotech universe. While the 1/285th scale game pieces can be used as a companion to the Robotech RPG, the game system is designed to be played as a tabletop miniatures game. Players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario-driven, objective-based game play. Take command of the fighting forces of the United Earth Defense Force (UEDF) valiantly defending Earth from alien annihilation &ndash; or lead the massive clone armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from two game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.&#10;&#10;Robotech RPG Tactics uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.&#10;&#10;The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.&#10;&#10;",

The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.&#10;&#10;9&quot; x 12&quot; x 2&quot; bookcase style game box; &#10;16-page (8?&quot; x 11&quot;) Rules booklet; &#10;two 22&quot; x 34&quot; unmounted game maps; &#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; unmounted game map; &#10;960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; &#10;five card-stock Player Aids; and &#10;a 10-sided die.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to steal treasures from each other or the vault by using one of their five number cards. These cards are numbered four through eight. When played they define the odds of success during your attempt to steal a treasure. The defending player sets the combination of the lock to his or her vault by placing a card face down that is from 1 to the number the attacking player has played. Using the right cards with the right treasure effects could ensure your victory. Pick the Lock combines a nice blend of strategy, wit, and luck.

The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.&#10;&#10;The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less handy and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.&#10;&#10;If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game box:&#10;You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:&#10;Krimsutep's Pyramid&#10;Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful. Legends speak of a curse that will be put on anybody who dares to enter the pyramid and tries to reveal its secrets. Not only does the structure of the pyramid pose a problem to eager archaelogists, but also the pharao himself does not wish to be disturbed. &#10;Who will be the first to find the legendary treasures of Krimsutep and get them to safety?&#10;&#10;",

You may have to arm wrestle someone, perform some bar or magic tricks and do unimaginable feats in varied and interesting ways. You could take a booze cruise or a serious bar crawl. You might just end up in the gutter, fall asleep with your clothes on or land in jail - or you may just have to drink lots of beer!&quot;&#10;&#10;Brief Notes:&#10;&#10;Non-drinking friends with a sense of humor can still enjoy this game by substituting a beverage of choice for beer.

But, before qualifying top of your class, you have to prepare your ultimate magic spell. You need three rare treasures from the Kingdom of Calandria: a tear from the Water Nymph, a tooth from the Fire Dragon and an emerald from the Rock Giant. But these mythical creatures won&rsquo;t give up their treasure without a fight! As a student of magic, you will need to show what you&rsquo;ve learned at Isidore. You will need to trade ingredients, compose spells to control the elements of Rock, Water and Fire, and ultimately win the duels!&#10;&#10;In Isidore, you can collect, buy or trade ingredients throughout the Kingdom of Calandria. You need these ingredients to make your Rock, Water and Fire spells. The top spell card of the stack shows which ingredients you need to make the spell. If you&rsquo;re at Isidore and you have all the ingredients needed for a Rock, Water or Fire spell, you can take a spell card.&#10;&#10;With these spells you can challenge the magical creatures to a duel. The magical creatures are powerful and always have three different duel cards (Rock, Water and Fire) to counter your attack. The player to the left of the attacking student stands in to play on behalf of the magical creature and takes the three dark duel cards.&#10;&#10;As in the &lsquo;Rock-Paper-Scissors&rsquo; game, the student and the magical creature choose one of their spell cards (duel cards), which they place on the table &ndash; at exactly the same time - after reciting the magical spell I-SI-DORE (as in  one, two, three!).&#10;&#10;&bull;    Fire beats Rock (fire melts rock).&#10;&bull;    Rock beats Water (rock absorbs water).&#10;&bull;    Water beats Fire (water puts out fire).&#10;&bull;    If the student and the magical creature play the same spell card, the elements cancel one another out and no one wins the round.&#10;&#10;The first student to collect three treasures can return to school, where they will be awarded a diploma from the Isidore Academy of Magical Arts. This student also wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Deep in the Yucatan jungle, humanity has mutated, degenerated, and segregated into five clans: Jaguar, Snake, Monkey, Gar, and Bat. These clans now battle it out for dominance in the region, cooperating when it suits them and actively working against each other when the opportunity arises.&#10;&#10;In 3012, players start the game with small decks of Scout cards, which provide gold to make purchases. Two piles of cards &ndash; an Ally deck and a Weapon deck &ndash; provide static cards to buy, with three cards from each deck always available to purchase each round. Cards that are not bought remain there for other players to buy. Two non-static Action decks &ndash; one with cheap cards, the other expensive &ndash; are also available, and at the start of your turn, you reveal one card from each of these two Action decks. You get the benefits of the Action cards you reveal, whether you buy them or not, and they're removed from play if you don't buy them.&#10;&#10;When you have amassed enough combat skill through Allies, Weapons, and Action cards, you can attempt to prove your worth by facing a beast in four decks of Encounter cards, ranging from easy to very difficult.&#10;&#10;Unlike most deck-building games, there are many points of interaction in 3012, so players are never out of the action! And you always get to refill your hand to its maximum size at the start of your turn, so you are never penalized for interacting during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the Heroes reaches Level 5. The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

A player's turn ends when she can play no more cards, possibly because she has emptied her hand! Two special cards are available with five copies of each; one forces opponents to take cards from the top of a stack and place them in their personal deck, and the other allows a player to play one or more cards at the top of the stack instead of the bottom.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on a turn, a player can return any number of cards from her hand to the bottom of her deck, then draw that many cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all cards in her deck and her hand wins!&#10;&#10;Two variants are included in the rules. First, players play four rounds, and after each round all players score negative points for the number of cards left in their decks and hands, while the player who went out scores three positive points. Second, instead of ignoring the card colors (blue and yellow), you choose whether you must alternate card colors in the stacks or have only a single color of cards in each stack.&#10;&#10;",

Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.

Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count &quot;relieves&quot; it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.&#10;&#10;",
