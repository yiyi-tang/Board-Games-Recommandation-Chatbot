Outnumbered by as much as 4 to 1, tired, sick and in pitiful shape, Henry V&rsquo;s rag-tag army raised the three basic precepts of English tactics of the era to their greatest height:  the defensive power of the longbow, a good defensive position, and the effectiveness of a creative and powerful overall command.  The French?  They rolled sixes on life&rsquo;s CRT all day. That, and having dozens of dukes and counts insist each one was supposed to be in command and at the head of every charge, plus a full morning&rsquo;s carousing, didn&rsquo;t help.&#10;&#10;",

In a time before the unleashing of Black Powder the third epoch in Valon's history is if anything more disjointed and scarred than the subsequent Age.  Morgana the Empress of the Crystal Elf Empire sits upon the Peacock Throne with her younger son Mordred at her knee, she has ruled a thousand years and in her resides the best chance to halt the decay.&#10;&#10;Maelstrome is a fantasy mass combat system based in part on the famous Slaughterloo game and it features many of the same races and creatures that players will already be familiar with, though they are much changed.  Alongside the Crystal Elves, progenitors of the Ferach, are the Krautan Dwarves members of a League encompassing hundreds of small baronies and thiefdoms.  The Krautans are next in strength to the Crystal Empire and more powerful than the Cities of Man that have appeared across the central continent.   Other organized states try to hang onto the vestiges of a disappearing civilization but it has not been easy for the Undead led by the sinister Necromancers and the Dragon Children or Dracci have rampaged across Valon embroiled in their own huge war that decimates all who fall in its path.&#10;&#10;From the frozen north the shambling Undead have crumbled many societies and created free booters and mercenaries who sell their swords to the highest bidders, among them the Gnome Legion and the Dogmen of Stasia.  It is in Alevia a former province of the Crystal Empire that the mighty Elf regiments make their stand against the Undead and the Dracci.  It is from the vast sea in the south beyond Ibe-Herra that the Dragons came bringing carnage to the Goblin Principalities behind their wooden walls and forming an alliance of convenience with the fawning Lizardmen.  Savage Orc tribes migrate across all these battle torn lands bringing more pain, though as always their enemies loose flights of barbed arrows upon their approach.&#10;&#10;Choose your side carefully in the Maelstrome for though you may admire the remorseless Necromancers or the fury of the Dracci the other races have much to offer.  March with the Imperial Elf Regiments or the Regiments of the Wood Elves not forgetting the armies of Man or the Orc Tribes.  All can hire warriors from a common pool of fighters, entire units of Ogres, Mountain Orcs even Gnomes who kill with hundred tiny blades.  Do not forget of course that your army must have a powerful Mage to wield Wylde Magick in a nimbus of power to pour on your foes each race sports different lethal incantations.  Also you can use a Beast Handler to control huge savage monsters that are the doom of a multitude of soldiers, War Trolls and Corpse Monsters assembled from piles of the recently dead.&#10;&#10;Once this army of yours is assembled and stands ready uniforms bright or armour rusted and well used you must select a Warlord and special leaders to drive your units forward.   In the Maelstrome all must fight for their own ends and alliances seldom last out a season.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Balkan Gambit is a military simulation exploring the alternative-historical premise that the Allied powers have chosen to invade southern Europe via Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia in the latter half of World War II. Nothing like this actually happened, though the Allies went to great lengths to convince the Axis powers that such plans were intended in order to mislead them &#10;as to their true intentions. Nonetheless, some Allied strategists and leaders, including Winston Churchill, believed that an invasion of Europe via the Balkans was a legitimate and war-winning activity. Hence, the game is partially a reflection of the concepts and anxieties of both sides.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals about 20 miles (about 30 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents 2-5 days, depending on the scenario chosen and the weather currently in effect. Every ground unit represents a division, division-equivalent, or brigade of about 5,000 to 20,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles.[...]&#10;&#10;This game has 3 scenarios: &#10;&ndash; Operation BOARDMAN: In summer 1943, the British 8th Army is sent to liberate Greece and Crete. This was a deception to cover Operations HUSKY and AVALANCHE, the historical invasions of Sicily and Salerno.[...]&#10;&ndash; Operation ZEPPELIN: In summer 1944, the notional British 12th Army attacks Greece and Albania while the US 7th Army attacks in Dalmatia, in concert with Soviet amphibious operations against the coast of Rumania and Bulgaria. This plan was part of Operation BODYGUARD, the overall deception plan to disguise Operations OVERLORD and ANVIL (the invasions of northern and southern France).[...]&#10;&ndash; Operation GELIGNITE: Actual plans were drawn up to send the British 8th Army across the Adriatic in late 1944 or early 1945 to cut off the final retreat of German Army Group F and forestall any further Soviet advances towards northern Italy. The plan was shelved due to shortages of troops and landing craft.[...]&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters&#10;&#10;(source: rulebook and user's description)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2-5 days (depending on scenario)&#10;Hex: 20 miles / 30 kilometers&#10;Units: Brigade to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Maillot Jaune (Yellow Jersey) is a hard to find hand-made cycling simulation by the Swiss Patrick Inauen that developed with support from his brother Adrian. Its main purpose is to recreate the Tour de France in its entirety over 14 stage sessions, with each player in charge of a team of 8 riders with individual abilities.&#10;&#10;But what you get, in essence, is a highly flexible modular stage construction kit that allows you to create a wide range of possible races for 6 teams of 8 riders each, using 136 plain-colored terrain tiles in 5 colors. And although its scope is for an entire Tour, it is equally feasible to play only a single stage, recreate other tours and existing one-day classics, or embark on a completely made-up race. Saying that, a lot of the dynamics only come into play when team managers aren't only trying to snatch the stage victory from their competitors, but need to keep an eye on the overall rankings for each individual rider as well, as the end goal is to carry the Yellow Jersey to Paris. More so, and just like in the real Tour, the Sprint and Mountain Tricots are also up for grabs, so during each race it is important to get your key riders in point-scoring positions at the right time.&#10;&#10;This dice-driven racing simulation includes rules for terrain handling, breakaways, tempo raising, slipstreaming, pack-splitting, sprints, fatigue, doping-use, overtaking, falls, team-cooperation and other events, but squeezes all this in a simple system that does not bogs down in details or oodles of bookkeeping.&#10;&#10;By stripping the inner workings of a cycling race down to core mechanics that are based around only 4 different types of terrain tile (flat, uphill, downhill, and - to settle communal arrivals - sprints), the game instead concentrates on the different abilities of each rider to use certain types of terrain to his advantage. These abilities, again, are stripped down to their core. Team sheets show 8 unique riders, each with 4 to 8 special action points in specific terrain colours, that get covered when used. Remarkably, this is enough creates a race dynamic that is genuinely similar to the real deal. Servants will be used to get the specialists in position, or bridge gaps to escaped groups or soloists. The stronger riders will use their abilities to snatch points on their favourite type of terrain, and the team champions will be protected by their team members for most of the race, but ultimately need to rely on their superior movement bonuses to battle it out amongst each other. Often, the mountain stages are key arenas that shape the face of the remaining Tour, when riders no longer can rely on group efforts, and have to face the long uphill climb on individual strength alone. Each stage, team leaders will need to balance the need for interteam co-operation against their individual team's chances to gain an advantage. Sounds familiar?&#10;&#10;During the race, the starting pack will slowly split up in individual packs, smaller groups (2-7 riders) and soloists, all standing on their own terrain tiles in small stacks of numbered plastic pieces in the 6 team colors (for larger packs replacement markers are used). In a standard turn, the top cyclist on each tile-stack will throw the D20, and move 1 forwards on an odd roll, and 2 tiles on an even, taking the entire underlying stack along through slipstreaming. That cyclist will then have spent his energy and move to the bottom of the stack, handing over the front position to the next one in line. From the head of the race down, each tile with riders will be dealt with in turn, and that process repeats itself until all riders have completed the stage, or are disqualified for arriving too late, with a bigger time-gap to the leader than allowed.&#10;&#10;Each standard (group) move can be modified by one special move if managers so desire, and if they have the rider(s) that can pull it off on that type of terrain. This special move can either be a breakaway attempt, a general raising of the tempo, a deliberately go-slow decision by the speed-setting rider, or a tactical manoeuvre that can cause a pack to split. Each time a rider uses a speciality point, it is marked off from his entry on the team sheet. When the last ability point has been covered up, that rider is too tired to pull off any further special moves. A rider that has spent all his bonus points will start the next stage fatigued, whereas a rider that has spared himself will enter the next stage with a bonus point, just like the new holder of the Yellow Jersey. When the race leader changes terrain type, a random event is triggered that can befall any rider in the race.&#10;&#10;When more than 1 rider arrives at a sprint banner, the top of a mountain, or the finish line, a sprint is triggered to settle the differences. Riders who can draw on team support, or are natural sprinters can use this to start the sprint in advantageous positions.&#10;&#10;This is a great game for fans of the cycling genre, but might be a tad repetitive for others, especially when a lot of team managers join the race and when the starting pack splits up in many different groups. It then takes quite a few die rolls before the 50 to 90 tile route has been conquered by all. As a sport simulation, it works best when a full field of riders is present, and when an entire tour is played out over multiple sessions. If you play individual stages only, the race dynamics are far less colourful since the team managers only need to focus on getting one rider through the finish line, rather than juggle positions, general fitness, and overall rankings of their entire team of riders.&#10;&#10;Included with the set are the assembly instructions for the 14 stages, and team sheets for each team manager, detailing the individual abilities of 8 unique (real-life) riders from the 1995 tour. It isn't clear if the brothers intended to supply updated packs for subsequent tours and races, but enthusiasts have.&#10;&#10;PUBLICATION HISTORY:&#10;&#10;     1995 Maillot Jaune Inauen Spiele - handmade limited edition - out of print&#10;     1996 Le Tour Inauen Spiele - handmade re-issue - out of print&#10;&#10;&#10;Maillot Jaune was Patrick's debut game, and was launched at the Schweizer Spielmesse in 1995, where it sold all of 13 stickered white cardboard boxes.

The publisher was a specialty import company that dealt mainly in Dutch and French dishes and pewter, Royal Leerdam, Delft, Quimper, etc.  No designer is listed.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of cards representing nations or geographic areas and the object is to complete a &quot;hand&quot; of nations that dominates the world political scene to the extent of being able to enforce a &quot;Pax&quot; similar to the ancient Pax Romana.  Specially stamped poker chips are used in bidding for cards.  Besides the rules and a score pad, the game came with a green felt playing surface with a map of the world and other significant items in white.  This surface is known in the rules as &quot;the traditional green table of diplomacy&quot;.  The game came in two types of boxes, one a padded leatherette style and the other a red paper covered cardboard with trays to hold the cards and chips.  The smaller red box has a pocket inside the lid to hold the rules and score pad.&#10;&#10;Four players is the optimum number, though rules are given for a three player game.  The four players represent the United States, Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and either France or Germany, as picked by the dealer.  Play then proceeds until one player has built up a hand through either draws, auction, or trading large enough to declare his peculiar pax based on his political leanings.&#10;&#10;The four types of Paxes are:&#10;Pax Americana&#10;Pax Muscovita&#10;Pax Atlantica (the English Pax)&#10;Pax Europeana (French or German Pax)&#10;&#10;The game betrays its Cold War background by some of the interesting art and factoids on the cards, which are about three times the size of playing cards and are quite colorful with period artwork.  The rules are a scant two pages, but are easily picked up by any traditional card players who are familiar with bridge.  Certain cards are usable only with certain Paxes and vary in value.  The publisher boasted that &quot;Pax is sold in all the free countries of the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The great allied advantages was the aerial supremacy and the great mobility of their units, had been almost annulled for closed combats far from the short and in difficult land.&#10;The weather also did not help, with rain being a constant aspect of the campaign. Despite of this, the allies had kept the pressure and, with great difficulty, they had expanded the head-of-beach. The vital port of Cherbourg was conquered on 29/06/44, but the important city of Caen, entrance of the French plain was still in enemy hands. The Germans, recognizing its importance, had positioned their best troops there. In end of July, the commander of 1&ordm; American Army, General Omar N. Bradley, conceived the &ldquo;Operation Snake&rdquo;, aiming to break the front of Normandy. However, to be a success, the German tanks would have that to be kept where they were - in the English sector. It felt on the English to keep them there, through a strong attack. General Montgomery, the commander ally, the British infantry that was depleted after weeks of constant combat. It had suffered the majority of the 40,000 decreases registered in 2&ordm; British Army until July middle. It needed to attack, but he would have that to make it with its armored divisions. However, the land of Normandy was total inadequate to maneuver such mass of tank, not to be in the opened land more in the east of the head-of-beach, between Caen and Vimont. There, such action promised better chances. In function of this, the biggest operation of tank of the front occidental person was planned: the &ldquo;Goodwood Operation&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The R. Bliss Manufacturing Company of Pawtucket, Rhode Island produced this &quot;bowling game&quot; at the turn of the century at just about the time that real TEN PIN BOWLING was taking hold in the United States. This game features heavy cardboard &quot;pins&quot; like Rough Rider, Indian, Cowboy Dude, and Cow Girl. Each pin had a number value marked on it. Knocking them over scored you the points listed on the individual pin. You had one shot to score. The pins were randomly set up by your opponent so the numbers on those pins were not in the same place on every turn. highest score after 10 &quot;frames&quot; won the game.&#10;&#10;",

The 'pond' is filled with water before play and a plastic/polystyrene circular raft 5&quot; wide is placed on the surface. The raft is divided into two different colored sections along its axis of symmetry. Each player starts with six (three pairs of) men of varying shape and weight (and value: 5 or 10 points) which must be placed on the raft without causing it to overbalance.&#10;&#10;Players use a spinner to determine which particular weighted man must be placed on which side of the floating circular raft. When one player causes the raft to overbalance, their opponents receive points based on the number and type of their own men who were on the raft at that time.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach fifty points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

A small area of the board is sectioned off (the Pits) behind a gate which serves as the timing mechanism for each person's turn.  A small car (the 'Demon') that relies on a ball bearing for mobility is placed behind the gate which is released by an opponent when all the targets are in position.&#10;&#10;The instructions describe several variations of the game but all basically involve bumping into as many of the target cars with the Demon as possible and returning to the Pits before the timing gate closes.&#10;&#10;",

The other players are given some tokens and, in turn, they ask for a letter: if it is included in the word, the player with the deck of cards places that letter in its correct position on top of the corresponding &quot;?&quot; card; if the letter is not in the word, the player who asked for it must pay 1 token. Whenever a player guesses the word correctly he receives 2 tokens plus as many tokens as &quot;?&quot; cards are still in the word; but if the guessed word is wrong, the player must pay 2 tokens. The player who thought the word receives as many tokens as the difference between the top scorer and the least scorer.&#10;&#10;Following the philosophy of the publisher the rules are in Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Basque, Galician, Occitan and Italian.&#10;&#10;About the publisher:&#10;The publisher, Linguam&oacute;n &ndash; House of Languages, is a body set up by the Government of Catalonia with the aim of promoting the world's languages as a:&#10;&#10;     vehicle for communication, civilization and dialog &#10;     source of personal development, human creativity and heritage of mankind &#10;     right of individuals and of linguistic communities&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns answering questions to earn Fact Cards and Coins that they can use towards creating a winning hand. A die is also included for players who want to randomize question selection. The game is accompanied by a brochure containing an overview on wine, the wine regions, maps, and the rules to the game.&#10;&#10;",

Kids and adults can match wits against opponents while trying to rid themselves of all the cards in their hands. But in this new card game, opponents can openly discuss how to stop each other (within limits). Trying to stop someone from going out normally occurs when a player only has 2 or 3 cards left in his or her hand. The game scenario is in constant change. One minute a player is on offense, trying to win himself. The next minute he&rsquo;s on defense as he works individually or as a team with other players to stop someone from going out.&#10;&#10;",
