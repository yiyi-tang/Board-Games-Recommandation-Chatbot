    "Description": "There are 18 Planet cards, 15 Multiplier cards and 24 Value cards. Players start the game with six Value cards (values one to six) which they use to bid on the other cards. Each turn, three cards are auctioned. Each player can bid a number of face-down Value cards. It is allowed to make two or three seperate bids. After everyone has bid, the bids are turned face-up, and the three highest bidders receive a card, with the highest bidder choosing first. The winner can keep the card, or, if it is a negative one, give it to an opponent.&#10;&#10;The Planets and Multipliers may be placed alone, but they may also be added to a single card that is already in play to create a scoring Multiplier-Planet pair. Planets have a value from -3 to 3, Multipliers are x0, x1 or x2, with a pair scoring the Value of the planet times the value of the Multiplier.&#10;&#10;After the cards have been auctioned off, all bids are passed to the left, so each player gains those Value cards bid by their right-hand opponent.&#10;&#10;The auctions continue until all but three cards have been auctioned. Now, each player's final score is calculated. The pairs are separated by Planet colour (red, green or yellow). For each colour, the player scores a number of points equal to the number of pairs of that colour times the total score of the pairs of that colour. The scores for the separate colours are added. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

More points are gained if these are also in the same circle.&#10; How the game is played:  &#10; This player will throw the dice 5 times in order to place all the dice on the board.&#10;1.The player throws one die of each color along with the special die.&#10;2.The player checks the special die in order to see what possibilities are open to him for changing the outcome of his throw and improving the position. The value of the numbers of the dice does not affect the result.&#10;&#10;Explanation of the symbols of the special die:&#10;The side which has two dice drawn on it permits the player to change the number on 1 or 2 of the the 3 dice thrown to match the number showing one of the other die.&#10;&#10;The side which has one die drawn on it permits the player to change the number of one of the dice thrown to match the number on one of the other two dice thrown.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 2 half circles with arrow heads allows the user to interchange the position of two dice already placed by him on the board with a view to ending up with a group of dice with the same numbers and, even better, of the same color as well.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 3 small squares with a divided arrow coming from middle one allows the player to change the number on a die which has already been placed on the board or which the player is about to place on the board, to any other number.&#10;&#10;The Flying Turtle is the super bonus. It allows the player to do all the moves which are permitted by the other symbols on the special die.  Further more, when placed in the center of the board it increases the players points considerably.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Once the player's throw has been adjusted to take into account the special die, the player places his dice in the zone or zones of his choice.

Momo finds out that spooky 'grey men'  are tempting people to bring them their time to save it in a time savings bank.  In fact they are stealing their time.  The more time they save, the colder, sadder, more hurried and poor their existence becomes.&#10;&#10;Finally, with the help of a wonder flower and Master Hora's advice, Momo and Kassiopeia the tortoise, try to beat the grey men and give the people back their time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia must find the way to Master Hora and meet each other at the gate to the never-alley. But how?  Momo has a dream.  She sees a picture that shows the way.  Kassiopeia also has a dream.  It is as if she goes along a dream street and after a long time meets Momo at the gate to the never-alley.&#10;&#10;First, the players split into two groups.&#10;One group takes the yellow Momo figure, all the cards with the yellow edges, and one half of the board.&#10;The other group takes the brown Kassiopeia figure, all the cards with brown edges, and the other half of the board.&#10;IMPORTANT:&#10;The two groups don't play against each other but with one another.  Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.&#10;&#10;The start of the game&#10;&#10;The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.&#10;&#10;Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated. At first, only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.&#10;&#10;Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.  But not on one of the three approaches to the never-alley.  This card is the start square.  Momo and Kassiopeia are placed here on their respective boards.&#10;&#10;For the first game, the path should not be more than ten cards long.  See the illustration.&#10;&#10;The storytelling begins&#10;&#10;In turn, each group tells the other a story, involving the dream pictures on the chosen path.  For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.&#10;The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.&#10;&#10;After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.&#10;&#10;The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city&#10;&#10;At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.&#10;Before either Momo or Kassiopeia is placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world, once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.&#10;&#10;Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case, no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.&#10;&#10;When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.  If Master Hora has to give up his flower to the grey men no more can be done.  Momo and Kassiopeia, together, have lost the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "extrapolated from user review:&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player to evolve along the 6 stages of evolution into man. You start as a lungfish. Over the course of a turn, you roll a die to determine if you get to mutate, and then move to run away from predators.&#10;&#10;Mutation is easier if you are in a warm climate. And if you are lucky enough to get a mutation card, you will either evolve, or pick up some mutation which can affect your movement or mutation abilities.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you flip up a card which lets you move and introduce certain type of new predators, evolve predators, and move continents.&#10;&#10;Yes, the continents drift around the board, offering you chances to break a land bridge to strand your opponents on a plate along with a few hungry dinosaurs. Or drift yourself southward to bask and mutate in the sun.&#10;&#10;The only other twist is that predators can only eat during certain player evolutionary stages. So trying not to mutate can be a very good idea at certain stages of the game. Being eaten costs you an evolutionary stage-so picking on the leader can help keep the game even.&#10;&#10;",

One of the compartments contains a strange little laughing witch that cackles when you spin the lazy Susan. The speaker lines up with holes in the bottom of the unit to help mask where the sound is coming from. The center of the lazy Susan has a giant plastic witch in the middle to complete the effect.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game involves rolling dice to move, then occasionally spinning the witches. When you spin the witches, you must then try to locate the laughing witch by tracking the sound.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, plastic chips which show one of four serial killers are placed face down on the cities. Players choose their detective and place it anywhere on the map. There are also four cards with images of the four killers; the top one of these is flipped open.&#10;&#10;The active player rolls two dice which show chess pieces. If the two dice show different symbols, the player can move his/her detective the corresponding moves (i.e., any distance diagonal for a bishop). If the two rolls are the same, though, a new killer card is flipped open. If a player lands on a chip, the chip is flipped over - if it shows the same killer as the card, the player can either score points or flip over other chips with the same killer. If s/he makes a mistake, though, all points from that turn are lost. If the killer doesn't match the card, it is just returned and the players try to remember its location.&#10;&#10;When two detectives meet, they duel each other (higher die roll wins); the winner looking at a chip and placing the loser anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;When all 16 killer chips have been collected (&quot;all cases solved&quot;), the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.&#10;&#10;WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?&#10;&#10;1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  &#10;2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)&#10;3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. &#10;Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different . See rules for proper 3 person set up.&#10;&#10;The third and fourth dice of each player may only be moved, when the first and second dice have reached the finish.&#10;&#10;",

To move, you roll dice - 3 for bikes, 2 for cars, 1 dice + 2 for trucks. You can ram someone by moving on top of them, higher die wins, loser goes back a space, both cars suffer hit points equal to the opposite roll. If the mover wins, they can keep going.&#10;&#10;If you move, you can also play an action card. These can fire missiles / guns / etc. at other cars, allow you to roll more movement dice, ignore terrain effects, etc. Unless the defender has a defense card, the attack card will specify a range (in range if vehicles are less spaces away than eg result of 2 dice) and the number of dice to roll to determine hit points. Trucks start with a lot of hit points to counter their low movement, bikes start with not many. Lose all your hit points and you can start again at half hit points, or attempt to hijack another car.&#10;&#10;The track is about 100 spaces long, with some bridges / crossovers and 5 different terrain types. For example you need to roll multiples of 5 to move each snow space, 4 for oil spaces. There are obstacle spaces which allow you to pull an instantly applied obstacle card. These are a mix of mostly good and occasional bad events.&#10;&#10;You can also pass and simply pick up an action card. Last car standing or first one past the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.&#10;&#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.&#10;&#10;",

This game was developed as a promotional item for the soft drink manufacturer Fanta. Includes five miniature plastic balloons which go up and down on stands to show their current altitude. Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route. Very nice item.&#10;&#10;",

Play then proceeds clockwise.&#10;&bull; A player&rsquo;s turn must always be taken in this order (during which steps 1 &ndash; 4 may repeat several times):&#10;1. Turn over a card. The cards show what dice must be rolled in step 3.&#10;2. Put down a chip. Then the player decides &mdash; based on the card and the intended dice roll &mdash; which chip he would prefer to put down. You can only put down one chip per card (one 10-point chip, one 50-point chip or one 100-point chip). Place it in the middle of the table next to the exposed card.&#10;3. Bet and roll the dice. Now the player must predict the total roll of the respective dice on the card when compared with the numbers currently showing on the dice.&#10;4. Evaluate the roll. The player&rsquo;s bet will be right or wrong. Right bets mean two possibilities for this player:&#10;&bull; He/she may take another turn, going through steps 1 &ndash; 4 again.&#10;&bull; Or he/she may end his/her turn. He/she takes all the upturned cards from the middle of the table, puts them in a stack in front of him/her and puts the chips from the middle of the table on the stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one player has chips left. This player gets one final turn. If he/she bets wrong, the chips are left in the middle of the table; nobody can use them in the scoring.

In this case chips not yet used in betting do not score, either.&#10;&#10;Scoring and winning&#10;Each player scores his/her stacks separately, by multiplying the number of cards in the stack by the total value of the chips in the stack.

Thus I have five points.&#10;If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The heftier the meal, the more you advance.  Some of the meal cards have a ghost on their back; if you win one of those, you move back instead of forward.  You also have a silver platter; you can use that to send the ghost to another cat --but he'll then have the silver platter for later, and you won't...&#10;&#10;One final note: when multiple players bet on the same meal, their betting tokens remain on the card for the next betting round --this mechanic forces the implicated players to choose something else, and can signal an opportunity for the lone player to be in a position to bet on that meal...&#10;&#10;Simple and fast playing.&#10;&#10;",

Although military affairs play an important part in Ancient Empires, the game is designed so that this aspect does not dominate game play.  Movement and combat are abstracted to a strategic level, and players will find that timing is just as important as brute strength to avoid counterproductive warfare.  Players must pay equal attention to trade, diplomacy and internal affairs in order to remain strong enough to discourage aggression. Victory Points are awarded for the size of an empire, and the level of development it achieves relative to its peers.  Destroyed players retain their Victory Points and may re-enter the game to carve out a new empire.&#10;&#10;",

And this barking, vicious alarm system is called Bodo Boxo!&#10;&#10;The game contains 110 cards, consisting of 80 treasure cards, 20 safe cards and 10 plus/minus cards.&#10;&#10;From the 20 safe cards, 15 cards show on the back the picture &quot;Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded&quot; and 5 cards show the picture &quot;Boxo Awake Pants Torn.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 10 plus/minus cards are not played. They are used only to keep plus and minus scores separated.&#10;&#10;Each player gets all  treasure cards of a color. The player then shuffles his treasure cards and puts them in a facedown stack on the table.   Now each player uses the  4 safe cards: 3 with the picture &quot;Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded&quot; and 1 with the picture &quot;Boxo Awake Pants Torn.&quot; to put his treasures in the safes. Players turn over the top 4 treasure cards from their stacks and put them in the middle of the table, side by side so that all players can see their values. Each player covers his 4 face-up treasure cards with a safe card, with the safe picture face up, but with the values of the treasure cards still visible. One of the safe cards is &quot;hot,&quot; because it shows Bodo Boxo with a scrap of pants on the back. Each player decides which of his 4 treasure cards will get the &quot;hot&quot; safe card. The players cannot tell which of their opponents? treasure cards is &quot;hot,&quot; since all safe cards look the same from the front. The first player then tries to break in to a safe. If the card from the safe shows BOXO ASLEEP then the  BREAK-IN SUCCEEDED and the player takes the stolen treasure card and puts it facedown under his plus card. If the card shows that BOXO is AWAKE  then the Boxo bites the player tearing his pants so the player gets caught and the value of the card from that safe is deducted from his score.  The alarm has startled Lord Schlotterderry. He immediately attends to the remaining safes. The robbed player immediately puts all his treasure cards that are still in safes under his plus card! Now, the next player going clockwise takes a turn. If a player is not able to plunder because he is the only one with unopened safes, he must forfeit his turn.  Play continues with each player taking his turn.&#10;&#10;Each player then  replenishes his safes for another round. The game continues until 4 rounds of safe cracking are finished when each player adds up the values of his collected treasure cards. The plus points are added and the minus points are subtracted. Whoever has the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Play 4 rounds are played. In each round, the safes are first filled with treasures, which one can plunder as long as he dares.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a clever little card game by Thorsten Gimmler and published by Piatnik.&#10;&#10;There are five cards with one of the roman numerals I to V on them. There are also cards in seven colors numbered 1 to 11 in each color (for a total of 77 such cards). The numbered colored cards also have zero, one or two roman numerals in their corner indices.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt four cards and the five roman numeral cards are placed face up in the center. In turn, players play one of their cards and then draw another one from the deck. When a card is played, the player must turn over one of the roman numeral cards corresponding to a roman numeral on the card just played - if there is no roman numeral, no card needs to be turned, if there are 2 roman numerals, the player can choose which one to turn. If the card has already been turned in a previous round, the player does not need to do anything further.&#10;&#10;When only one out of the five roman numeral cards is left face up, the round ends and the cards that have been played are compared. The face up roman numeral card determines who has won the round - if it is the I, then the highest card wins; if the II, the second highest card wins; and so on. In cases of cards of the same number, the last played card of that number cancels the others already played. The player who played the winning card gets to keep all the cards played in that round. The game continues till there are no more cards left in the deck and a final round is played. The player who ends the game with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: &quot;Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing)&quot;.&#10;&#10;A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:&#10;in the 1st round - 6 cards&#10;in the 2nd round - 5 cards&#10;in the 3rd round - 4 cards&#10;in the 4th round - 3 cards&#10;in the 5th round - 4 cards&#10;in the 6th round - 5 cards&#10;in the 7th round - 6 cards&#10;&#10;After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.&#10;&#10;Rules of play:&#10;&#10;Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:&#10;1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color&#10;2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.&#10;&#10;If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.&#10;If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Secret trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Openly declared trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Or you may land on a wage or salary space, which always brings profit.&#10;&#10;What you buy you can also sell, depending which space you are on. When you are on a stock space, for example, you can only buy or sell shares. When you are on one of the two savings spaces, you can only buy or sell savings cards, etc.&#10;&#10;3rd action&#10;You must draw a Banking card and either play it now or keep it in your hand. You can also draw and play a precious metal card to replace the card already lying in the middle of the game board.&#10;&#10;Precious metal cards are an optional draw. A Banking card must be drawn along with the precious metal card so the price of the precious metals and shares of stock change again and again.&#10;&#10;",

Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.&#10;H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either &quot;push&quot; all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the &quot;happiness&quot; square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.&#10;Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.&#10;Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As your life progresses (from 1-100, in a 'snakes/ladders' environment) you will need to have certain insurance to avoid major personal disasters. The one with the most of money after becoming 100 years old, wins.&#10;&#10;Interesting mechanic is that you can buy all kinds of insurance that prevent disaster or bring you money. You cannot buy all of the insurances available though and you have to choose which insurance policies you buy at the beginning of the game. During the game calamities happen which cost money unless you have taken out the correct insurance.&#10;&#10;This is a promotion game, but it also has an educative purpose as you teaches what insurances are intended for.&#10;&#10;Published in celebration of the merger of two companies, namely &quot;De Nederlanden van 1845&quot; and &quot;Nationale Levensverzekering-Bank&quot;, into &quot;Nationale Nederlanden&quot;. The company later also published Verzekeringsspel, a re-implementation, in remembrance of the 125-year anniversary of the company's.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Verzekeringsspel&#10;&#10;&#10;Be aware: only Dutch versions exist.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Abstract Soccer Game played on a grid of squares. Each player has eleven wooden tokens - nine basic ones, one libero (sweeper) and one goalkeeper. Each piece has a small dent on top so the ball can be placed on it. &#10;In a turn, the active player can pass the ball as many times as s/he wishes, in a straight unblocked line (diagonal, too), and move one piece. Regular pieces move any distance diagonally, while the libero can move orthogonally as well (same as the goalie, who is restricted to the box, though). A piece that reaches a field adjacent to an opponent piece with the ball can grab the ball. Goals can be scored if a piece that is not offside can play the ball into the goal in a straight line.&#10;&#10;One half time is played until a player has scored three goals. After two half times, the player with most goals is the winner (in case of a tie, an extension is played).&#10;&#10;",
