The intro and the rules were exactly the same, only graphics were different.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of Bestia resemble popular Battleships in it's basic, being a paper and pencil guessing game played on sets of the same diagrams but that's where the similarities end.&#10;&#10;In Bestia one of the player assumes the role of the Beast - the master of a group of mosters lurking in the depths of a dark dungeon.&#10;&#10;The other player (or players) lead a small band of adventurers who seek to destroy the monsters and escape the dungeons with their treasures.&#10;&#10;Before the actual game all players secretly deploy they units (the mosters and treasure hoards/adventurers). Players in turns try to find and destroy monsters/adventurers, throwing spells and using weapons.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the last surviving ninja, or the first to accrue enough points.&#10;&#10;The game includes four printable sheets with cut-out game tiles, ninja figures, and dice cards - in Japanese Kanji of course. Two of the tile cards contain all the rules for setup and gameplay. Each game is designed to be played in 5-10 minutes. The only things not included are six random coins (or tokens of some sort), three six-sided dice, and your imagination. OK, that's a lie. Your imagination is included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A printed cloth, three unique dice, six normal d6 and some tiddly-wink style counters with the rules enable you to play five dice-games popular amongst sailors and other travelling folk.&#10;Extra components are for Crown &amp; Anchor.&#10;&#10;The playing cloth denotes 6 symbols (Heart, Spade, Diamond, Club and of course, a Crown and an Anchor). These 6 symbols are displayed on the faces of the unique dice included.&#10;One person is elected as the banker. Players use their counters to 'place bets' on the symbols on the cloth. The banker then rolls the 3 dice and pays out pro-rata where players have correctly bet on the symbols rolled.&#10;If one symbol has been guessed pay evens for each token;&#10;two symbols pay twice;&#10;three symbols matched, and the baker pays triple.&#10;The rules state that the banker should rotate as the odds are in their favour(?)&#10;&#10;Rules also given for four other dice games:&#10;&#10;Drop Dead: Use 5 dice and a scorecard. A game for any number of players.&#10;Each player in turn throws the five dice. The score is noted but a 2 or a 5 score zero points and the offending die is removed. The player throws again with the number of dice that didn't score 2 or 5. This score is added to his first throw. This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw. His final tally is recorded and the 5 dice are given to the next player to construct his score. The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.&#10;&#10;Yankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.&#10;Each player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.&#10;The player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.&#10;&#10;5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.&#10;The object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:&#10;Any 5 scores 50 points&#10;Any 1 scores 100 points&#10;Three 2's score 200&#10;Straight 1 to 6 scores 1500&#10;6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points&#10;Three 5's score 500 points&#10;Three 6's score 600 points&#10;Three 1's score 1000 points&#10;3 pairs score 500 points&#10;&#10;To play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.&#10;When a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.&#10;&#10;Rotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.&#10;The possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.&#10;There are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score. The person with the highest total after 11 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

To set up, fill the riverbed with water, place a sailboat on one end, and give each player their tikis, a straw, and a random card which shows either 6 or 8 gems. Place all gems in the bag and draw a random group of 6. The tikis have symbols on their bottoms meaning either take a gem from the display, take a gem from another player, or give a gem away. Players place one of their tikis on each of the islands.&#10;&#10;On your turn, roll the die until you roll a symbol for an island on which you have a tiki (or water; pick an island). Then, sail the boat to that island by blowing through the straw into the sail. You are trying to stop exactly at the pier. Meanwhile, the other players are taking turns rolling the die; if they roll the same island, your turn ends immediately! If you reach your destination, take your tiki and follow its instructions. If you took a gem from the display, replace it randomly from the bag. If you collected all the gems on your card, reveal it and place the gems there; they may no longer be stolen from you! Then, draw a second card. If that was your 5th tiki, replace all the tiki onto the islands at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all gems on 2 cards wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

From LPD's website: &quot;Antietam represented the best opportunity for the Army of the Potomac to win the war at one blow. Major General George B. McClellan's command style was an important part of why this did not occur. Once again, BACW's command and initiative system has to pick up the slack, allowing the Federal player some control of the battle while showing just how the Little Mac's dysfunctional command style prevented complete victory. The Confederate player faces Lee's greatest challenge - winning against 2:1 odds. Includes South Mountain, the precursor to Antietam, and Harper's Ferry, a classic race against time for divergent objectives.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Five cavalry Divisions (2 Federal, 3 Rebel) and the Kansas State Militia maneuver over the heart of modern Kansas City.

    "Description": "The players divide themselves into two teams.  The two decks of cards (black and white) are placed between the two teams. Team A selects a player to begin.  During the turn, the player rolls a die and takes a Black card and a White card randomly.  Then the player reads both cards and shows them to the opposite team. Then he acts (he can speak, but not say the key word) to his team until they guess the word written in the card in the time established by the die.  Team A tries to guess the word while team B measures the time and checks that the player or team A don&acute;t break the rules.  When the time&acute;s up the team scores 1 point for each word written on the card or 2 points if they guessed all 4 words in the card.  Then is team B's time to act and guess. The team with more points after 20 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
