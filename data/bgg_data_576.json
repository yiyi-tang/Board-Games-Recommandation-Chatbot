    "Description": "Trial by Fire is a two player wargame based loosely on the Napoleonic era. The rules are simple and not intimidating for casual gamers, but there are also advanced gameplay options for seasoned wargamers. The beauty of Trial by Fire is that it doesn't get as detailed or complicated as most wargames, but still maintains the realism of battlefield decision-making. The game, still in the prototype/playtest phase of development, includes a board constructed of sheet metal and plywood; magnetic hexmap pieces; infantry, cavalry, artillery, and general markers; two card decks which determine movement and attacks; redoubts and bridges; and dice which resolve combat. The basic game is played with a random card deck, but advanced rules allow players to &quot;issue orders&quot; by choosing several cards at a time from their deck. Each space on the modular board is a separate magnetic hex, which allows for an almost infinite number of possible battlefields.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FIGHTING THE TALIBAN: Pakistan's Operation Sherdil, Aug. 2008&#10;&#10;The threat was and remains real.The Taliban and al-Qaeada are slowing taking over this country with nuclear weapons. Not a good thing. Operation Sherdil (Lion Heart) began in August 2008 and was initially aimed at preventing the imminent fall of Khar, headquarters of Bajaur District, to the Taliban. The military operation was intended to reclaim all of Bajaur from the Taliban and al Qaeda, which amounted to around 3000 terrorists. On August 3rd, a 200-strong force from the paramilitary Frontier Corps were surrounded by 300-400 Taliban fighters, heavy fighting erupted as they tried to break out. After a three-day battle, the Pakistani troops routed back to Khar, and the Taliban seemed victorious. They quickly followed the Pakistani force and began to threaten Khar. Operation Sherdil was later expanded to recapturing all of Bajaur district from the Taliban. This proved to be a tall order and led to a protracted series of battles over two months. Pakistan's resolve came into question (as it still does). By late October, many of the objectives had been reached but not all. Loysam was not retaken until Oct. 25th. Over 2700 terrorists had been killed, yet, Bajaur Agency remained unsettled when the army left. It remains so to this day.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;Each turn is six days, with half mile hexes. Units are battalion and company for Pakistani forces, and platoon size for al-&#10;Qaeda and Taliban. The game is a true conventional military force taking on the terrorist groups in Bajaur Agency from August through October, 2008. The terrorists were well armed and had fortified many of the small towns outside of the city of Khar. They had been slowly taking over the area. Sherdil was prompted when a small force of paramilitary found themselves surrounded and under siege at Loysam from 300 Taliban. This Pakistani force managed to breakout and fled to Khar, which was under Taliban pressure. It was at this time the Pakistani military unleashed its forces in what many claim ended in a draw. Some 8000 soldiers, 20 Cobra gunships and F16 jets pounded the enemy, which numbered 3000. Pakistan's resolve came into question with this early offensive.&#10;In the game, the Pakistani army does not have unlimited resources to conduct a long offensive as each attack will cost. How well the Pakistani player orchestrates his attack will dictate who the winner is. The Taliban can literally appear and disappear in certain types of terrain making any attack questionable. Their unique movement and evasion will cause any Pakistani player frustration.&#10;&#10;",

Two players take turns rolling the dice to try and free their pegs for movement, then try to capture the opponents pegs before they can ambush your starting pieces.&#10;&#10;The board consists of three lines of holes for the pegs, the middle one being one hole longer than the two sides. The two side lines are filled with each player's pegs. The number of pegs vary according to local tradition, typically 16 in Denmark and 12 in Norway.&#10;The game uses a pair of special four sided dice marked A, II, III and IV. You need to roll an A to free one of your pieces, the other rolls are used to move the pegs once freed. A peg may never overtake your other pegs, but must keep their place in the line.&#10;Once freed the pieces move down the middle aisle and if they manage to avoid being captured they move into the opponent's starting line, capturing the unfree pegs.&#10;&#10;The origins of the game are unknown but it is believed to be inspired by certain middle-eastern and north african games, brought back by either vikings or crusaders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There is a game board with the numbers 1 to 100 in ten rows. A transparent mask is placed on top of the board. The mask contains five holes and therefore leaves five numbers open. &#10;A player now rolls a number of dice (4-7, depending on the location of the mask) and tries to calculate the open numbers by addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. If he or she manages to get to the right result, he or she places a chip on that number. The goal of the game is to get four or more chips in a row (each row of four counting two points, each additional chip in that row another point).&#10;&#10;On http://perlhuhn.de/ziffernsheriff.html, Reinhold Wittig has published an alternative game to be played with the same game materials, called Ziffernsheriffs (in German only, so far).&#10;&#10;",
