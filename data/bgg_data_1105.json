They convinced King Syphax of the Masaesulian Numidians to rise in revolt. The rebellion featured three major battles: at Tispasa, 213, Syphax led his new model Numidian army to victory over a punitive expedition dispatched from Carthage, then, at Siga, 212, Hasdrubal Barca retirned from Spain and joined with the young Masinissa to rout Syphax' growing army. Finally at Tingis, 212, Masinissa cornered the retreating Syphax in the far west and defeated his hastily raised levies.

You may play it after finishing any of the other three large campaigns, and take your favorite heroes on a last, one-way mission to mysterious Homelands. Their ship will slip into the mists separating Avalon from our reality, and spend many weeks traversing the border between the worlds. Finally, it will emerge back in Homelands, many years after the plague, where answers to some ultimate questions lie buried under the rubble of desolated cities.&#10;&#10;What happened here after most humans departed for Avalon?  &#10;&#10;     Is it safe to return?  &#10;     What caused the plague?  &#10;     How did Arthur learn about the island of Fore-dwellers?  &#10;     What secrets did he leave behind? &#10;&#10;&#10;Red Death is an expert-level expansion campaign for Tainted Grail. It contains 32 dangerous Location cards that allow you to visit a part of a kingdom ravaged by plague, where unspeakable horrors still lurk among the ruins. These horrors won&rsquo;t be your only problem! The ancient undersea empire of Fomoria already surveys the lands abandoned by humans, while brutish Picts of the north, who somehow built resistance to the disease, raid the ruins looking for treasure, magic &ndash; and something more sinister. Then, there are solitary survivors who outlasted the plague. They&rsquo;re often mad and dangerous, but their knowledge may help heroes survive.&#10;&#10;Pick your allies and enemies, solve difficult riddles, navigate ruins of the old world and face some of the hardest Encounters created for Tainted Grail. And if you survive, learn things that will put the main storyline of three campaigns in a new light.&#10;&#10;This add-on campaign will contain approximately 15-30 hours of gameplay grouped into an 8-chapter story. Just like our base campaigns it offers multiple endings and branching paths, so you can try to solve it in a different way multiple times!&#10;&#10;Extended Character Advancement&#10;Naturally, a large amount of additional gameplay meant we had to extend the Character progression. That&rsquo;s why the box also includes new and exciting Advanced Abilities that can help you upgrade your Attributes even further!&#10;&#10;Not to mention that many artifacts or items found in Homelands are much more powerful than anything found on Avalon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A French expeditionary force intervened, counterattacked, and along with various African allies, routed the Islamists in a short and sharp campaign.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game where one player commands the French Coalition and the other player the Islamists. Each side's forces include several contingents of allied forces. Both sides' objective is to gain control of Mali.&#10;&#10;The central game mechanism is Command Control Points (C2P). C2P are a quantification of each side's ability to coordinate operations and conduct intelligence. Players expend C2P to recruit units, activate contingents, and perform logistics. The game has two scenarios: one deals with the entire campaign; the other with the French intervention.&#10;&#10;Each hex is about 50 kilometers across. Each turn represents anywhere from one week of intense combat to a month or two of refitting and regrouping. Ground units represent companies, battalions and groups of irregulars (anywhere from 100 to 500 fighters). Airstrikes represent the effect of sorties (from 4 to 16 aircraft). Netwar markers provide cybernetic operations, terrorism, ISR and drone strikes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game has several scenarios. Two scenarios cover a US invasion of Iran in the aftermath of the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-81. A third scenario covers an Oil War situation, where the US leads a NATO effort to seize Persian Gulf oilfields in response to an oil embargo.&#10;&#10;The game system models ground, air and amphibious operations. For the Allies, the central game system is Air Transport Points (ATP). These represent strategic airlift capability. The assumption is that the scenarios cover the opening stage of an intervention, before the US can mobilize full-scale sealift. Therefore, airlift will become the primary means for moving units into the theater and provide logistic support.&#10;&#10;The opposing Opposition Forces (OPFOR) have a better logistical situation since they can rely on local supply. But many of their military units are erratic in performance. This is modeled by untried units and other game functions.&#10; Each hex on the map represents 60 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to ten days of refitting. Ground units represent regiments, brigades, divisions and groups of irregulars. Special operations forces (SOF) represents unconventional warfare activities. Aircraft units represent anything from one to four squadrons, depending on the quality of air force and operational tempo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle Hymn: Volume Two is the long-anticipated sequel game release to Volume One and includes two complete games: Shiloh and Bentonville. Battle Hymn is the new brigade-level system based upon the latest research into Civil War combat. This new entry introduces a new solitaire system to the series and an extension map for Gettysburg (Volume One) for a complete alternative history of the entire battle. Designed by Charles S. Roberts Award-winning designer Eric Lee Smith.&#10;&#10;Shiloh: The First Great Battle depicts the two-day battle of Shiloh. The Confederate army surprises the Union forces of General Grant and a fierce battle blazes for two days, with first the Confederate on the offensive and then the Union turning to the attack on the second day. Shiloh shocked to the nation. Left dead or injured were more men than in all of America&rsquo;s previous wars combined. The game includes four scenarios.&#10;&#10;Bentonville: The Last Great Battle simulates the final major battle of the war. Sherman is marching through North Carolina when a surprise attack by the much-weakened Army of Tennessee catches one wing of the US army exposed. The first day ends in a bloody stalemate, and continues on for two more days. Can the Confederates escape? This game has both two-player and solitaire scenarios, and introduces an innovative new solitaire system to the game series.&#10;&#10;Bonus One&mdash;Gettysburg &rsquo;62: No Lost Orders depicts an alternative history&mdash;the Confederates do not lose their orders for the 1862 invasion, Antietam never happens, and Jeb Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry begins the battle of Gettysburg with a major engagement south of the Round Tops. The battle grows as a Union corps arrives to face off with Heth&rsquo;s Division.&#10;&#10;Bonus Two&mdash;the Gettysburg extension map attaches to Gettysburg: The Tide Turns making for a complete alternative history of the entire battle. Plus, a new scenario explores the alternative that Pickett&rsquo;s Charge never happens; instead the Confederates drive south around the Round Tops on their way to Baltimore.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Russian board game was released in 1961 by the Moscow publishing house &quot;Detsky Mir&quot; (&quot;Child World&quot; in Russian) with a circulation of 50,000 copies. The outer box shows a satellite resembling the Russian Sputnik 3 in orbit around Earth.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of the Earth centrally located. A pin protrudes out of the Earth. On the pin sits a flat cardboard disk that has various sized holes punched through it. The disk represents outer space around Earth and is spun to play the game, producing a 3 dimensional playing board.&#10;&#10;The game includes a springboard (rocket base) and 2 balls (satellites).&#10;&#10;As the rotating disk spins players &quot;launch satellites&quot; one by one. They receive small chips if their &quot;satellite&quot; comes to rest in the punched out holes.&#10;&#10;Players receive 3 chips, if their satellite comes to rest in the smallest holes. 2 chips if they can land in a middle sized hole and 1 chip if a player lands their satellite in the largest holes. The winner is the player with the largest number of chips  after a nominated time or first to a set number (i.e. 10).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It also includes more pieces than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;A hexagonal board with 91 connected dots.&#10;20 trittons (10 of each type).&#10;Carrying case.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;The game begins with an empty board.&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated colour (Orange or Blue) and takes all the trittons that have their colour in the middle.&#10;&#10;The Orange player starts the game by entering one of his trittons somewhere on the board. The three dots of the tritton must be placed over 3 free aligned dots on the board.&#10;&#10;From now on, and starting with the Blue player, players in turn must do these 2 things in order:&#10;&#10;     Legally enter one of his trittons on the board.&#10;     (Optional) Move an opponent&rsquo;s tritton (if any) any number of steps along the line it is laying on.&#10;     It is forbidden to enter a tritton on the board so that a line of 3 or more dots of the same colour is created. Lines of 3 or more dots can only be created as a result of a tritton movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;As a rule of the thumb, you place trittons that have your colour in the middle, and move those that have your colour on the sides.&#10;&#10;END OF GAME&#10;&#10;The game ends in one of the following cases:&#10;&#10;One player wins by making a line of three (or more) dots of his colour but not making a line of at least three dots of the opponent&rsquo;s colour at the same time.&#10;&#10;One player loses by making a line of three dots of the opponent&rsquo;s colour.&#10;&#10;One of the players loses by not being able to make a legal action.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a tie at any moment if both players agree.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Build and run your own haunted house in this worker placement/tile placing hybrid game.&#10;&#10;Get together with up to three of your friends and compete to see who can build the best and scariest haunted house and frighten the most guests without accidentally scaring them to death. There's plenty of player interaction as you can connect your houses up to theirs, swap guests from their queues to yours, raise and lower the fear level of various guests with effects cards - all to keep players on their toes and ruin the most well laid of plans.&#10;&#10;Your workers can head into town to research new house tiles, recruit more workers, promote their house and attract guests, or collect the necessary resources to build their house.&#10;&#10;The workers also double as scarers! They can head into the house to help scare guests in the correct directions or they can work the queue at the front-of-house to prime guests for a more frightening experience. But be careful! Many guests have special attributes that can throw a wrench in things like &quot;Screamer&quot; - this guest will raise the fear level of every adjacent guest when they become scared! Use these different abilities to play guests off one another or interrupt other player's plans.&#10;&#10;The only way to get cash is by admitting people to your house, they pay the second they come in whether they have a good time or not. As a guest enters, you'll slot them into a standee base with a rotating dial to track their fear level.&#10;&#10;If guests have a good time, you can invite them to come back. If guests die, they take up precious storage bays and prevent you from storing the necessary resources to build up your house. If you kill too many guests, it means a change of management and a huge loss of points.&#10;&#10;The gameplay goes on a night-by-night basis for 7 days leading up to halloween, resetting and paying workers at the end of each night. As the game wraps up after all the guests leave on Halloween night, Euro-style rules kick in and players reveal secret values each of their successfully scared guests contribute to their total score.&#10;&#10;Spook House is a complex game with multiple strategies to win, currently clocking in around 3 hours for a full playthrough with four players. But it's still very early in development.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Traditional symmetrical two-player game known from Sami areas of Norway since at least the nineteenth century, but may be significantly older. It might ulimately share roots with backgammon and/or pachisi. Each player has an even number of pawns (12 and 14 are known), the board has three rows each with one space more than the number of pawns (13 or 15). A larger king piece starts out neutral, but when captured becomes part of the capturing player&rsquo;s army. It can be captured back and forth, but will never return to being neutral. It uses two or three four-sided dice (cubes with two opposing sides elongated into pyramids so the die can&rsquo;t rest on them), marked I, II, III and X.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to trap your opponent so that they have no legal moves (or, conversely, to avoid being trapped as long as possible).  Your pieces need to keep moving and the board quickly fills with blocks, forcing you towards the endgame.&#10;&#10;Each player has a power based on a mythological character, creature or artifact.  They have one prize and two rescuers.  Each turn they must move their prize (leaving a block behind) then one of the rescuers (which then builds on or excavates from a neighbouring space).  Since pieces can't move up more than one level and spaces become blocked off, one player will eventually run out of legal moves and lose -- usually when their prize is trapped by a combination of pieces and terrain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take the roles of Dracula&rsquo;s minions vying to create the most delicious tomato juice before the banquet at the end of the game&rsquo;s five rounds.&#10;&#10;System: &ldquo;Shift - Work - Plotting&rdquo; At the beginning of each round players use the tiles representing the minions&rsquo; powers to plot which actions they will take and at what level of power they will take them.&#10;&#10;Win condition: There are two scoring rounds and points are earned for the ripeness (number) and brand (color) showing on your tomato dice, card effects, and progress along the game track.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#128;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#136;5&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#153;&#169;&#233;&#164;&#144;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;5&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#231;&#174;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;2&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#231;&#134;&#159;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

You use the box to create a double-sided stage of sorts, with teams facing one another and a wall on the stage between the teams.&#10;&#10;In a round, someone rolls the die, then one player on each team starts trying to recreate the word or phrase using the artist model figure and any number of blocks. Once one person is finished, they count from 10 to 0, then the other player must stop. They then rotate the stage to show their creation to their other teammates, who try to guess what the person was trying to represent.&#10;&#10;",

During the journey players maybe penalised for landing where a cosmic phenomena occurs or at a space station.

A fuel tank is needed to land and take off. Players can land on the dark side of the moon but will miss a turn.&#10;&#10;The return journey to earth has some detours to navigate around and upon earth re-entry (Number 74) if a player has no more fuel tanks then they must wait for another player to pass and tow them to earth.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player to return to earth first after landing on the moon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A general knowledge tug-of-war!&#10;&#10;2 teams race to name a thing in the category, starting with either letter on a newly-flipped card! The winner flips the card one &lsquo;step&rsquo; closer to their side and covers the previous card, so the next visible card is closer to whoever was first. It&rsquo;s like a tug-of-war: flip the card at your end and win again to get a point!&#10;&#10;There are various styles of categories.&#10;&#10;Simple categories (Animals, places, food...) result in games only a few minutes long (and suitable for playing with children in an educational environment).&#10;&#10;Specialist categories (novels/films, brands, celebrities, games...) allow one player to show off their specialist knowledge against multiple opponents.&#10;&#10;Meta categories (number of syllables, number of letters, rhymes...) require quick thinking and almost entirely eschew general knowledge entirely.&#10;&#10;This was the winner of the 2017/2018 Wibbell++ design competition and is the 8th 'core game' for the Wibbell++ deck. Rules will be freely available online on 1st August 2019.&#10;&#10;",

In which forests and swamps are the most exciting walking trails? In this game you will have the opportunity not only to find out about a number of interesting places in Latvia, but also to travel in your own way. You can use boats, trains, and even airplanes to travel, if you have enough tickets for it; if you don't, you'll have to stick to your feet. But watch out for other travelers. They are likely to put obstacles in place to be the first to travel Latvia!&#10;&mdash;description from publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;The game area is a map of Latvia, its territory is divided into 4 historical counties with a total of 60 viewing objects connected to different roads - pedestrians, railways, rivers and air. Each viewing object have its own information card with a description of it and a small bonus that the player receives after visiting it. To win, you have to visit 4 objects, one by one in each county, and complete the end-of-game task that the players roll out at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;On his own move, a player can move on the card for up to 3 steps. Pedestrian roads are free, others need tickets. They can be obtained by stopping on a blank, unnumbered field. In the same way, you can get opportunity cards that can be played before you go, helping yourself or interfering with other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#10;         SET UP&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Each player takes one shield. Fold the wings of the shield and stand it in front of you.&#10;After putting all the tiles in the pocket, mix them well and split them equally among the players.(22 pieces each for 4 people)&#10;When playing with 3 players, each player takes 29 tiles and leave the remaining 1 tile in the pocket. The tiles taken from the pocket are taken inside the shield. Cover the tiles well and turn them all over so other players can't see them. &#10;If the game is played by 2 players, place all 5 colored &ldquo;1&rdquo; tiles in the center of the table and put all remaining tiles in the pocket and mix well. Each person takes 30 tiles from the pocket. Leave the remaining tiles in the pocket and do not use them. Then, hide all the tiles in the shield so that other players can&rsquo;t see them and turn them all over.&#10;If you put the tiles of the same color together, it will be helpful for you to play the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;         STARTING SETTING&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;- 4 Players : 22 Tiles&#10;- 3 Players : 29 Tiles&#10;- 4 Players : 30 Tiles&#10;&#10;&#10;        GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Every tile you own is your negative score. The goal of Sixteen is to put down all the tiles you own first, or leave the fewest number of tiles. Tiles can be placed one color per turn, and must be placed in a higher number (in ascending order) than the number of tiles placed at the very end. You can also create an opportunity to remove remaining tiles by using 16END and 16RESTART tiles and special tiles such as scissors and trash cans. Make strategies by predicting other player&rsquo;s remaining tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;         SPECIAL TILES&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;- 16 RESTART(5 : 1 per color) : You can restart the row by resetting the row of that color to the number '1'. Place a tile and pass the turn to the next player.&#10;- 16 END(5 : 1 per color) : You can finish the row of that color. 16END tiles can be removed with scissors or trash bin tiles, but you cannot place 16RESTART tiles.&#10;- Scissor tile(2) : You can remove one of the last tiles in a row. After removing it, you can place the tile one more time. You can only place the tile on the row that you used scissor tiles, or you can use scissor tiles only. Place the removed tiles and used scissor tiles separately next to the table.&#10;- Trash Bin Tiles(1) : You can discard as many tiles as you like, except for tile '1' in a row. You can place the tile one more time after discarding it. You can only place the tile once more on the line where you used the trash can tile, or you can use the trash can tile only. Put the discarded tiles and the used trash can tiles separately next to the table.&#10;&#10;&#10;         PLAYING THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;If there is a tile with the number '1', place it all in the center of the table. The game is played clockwise starting with the player with the red number '1' tile. In the case of 2 players, a random player will be selected to start the game.&#10;When it's your turn, you can place down a tile once. Only tiles of one color can be placed down at a time. Each color of tiles with a number greater than the number of tiles placed at the end (in ascending order) can be placed. You cannot place a tile with a number smaller than the number of tiles placed at the end.&#10;If the ascending order conditions are satisfied, tiles can be laid down in two ways.&#10;(Default) : Place a larger number of tiles than the one placed at the end&#10;(Group) : Lay down a group of consecutive tiles&#10;&#10;&#10;         END OF THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;There are two ways to end a game. If either of them applies, the game ends immediately.&#10;First, if a player has laid down all of their tiles, the game ends immediately and that player wins.&#10;Second, if all players yell &lsquo;PASS&rsquo; in one round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;[How to calculate points]&#10;All the player remove theirs shield and add the number of tiles they have left.&#10;For any remaining 16 END and 16RESTART tiles, add 16 points. For scissors and trash bin tiles add 20 points each.&#10;Consecutive tiles must be in ascending order. If there is no break in the middle, the number of tiles can be placed down at once without a limit. 16END and 16RESTART can also be put down in groups. However, you can't lay down two 16 tiles at once. (Yes. You cannot put down 16END after 16RESTART in one turn)&#10;&#10;After putting down the 16END and 16RESTART tiles, hand over the turn to the next player. After using scissors and trash can tiles, you can place down tiles of the corresponding color one more time, and this action is optional and not required. Scissors and trash can must be used until the game ends. If you don't use them and keep them till the end of the game, you get -20 points.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Pass&rdquo; if there are no tiles that can be put down in your turn. When your turn comes back, if there's a tile you can put down, put the tile down again and hand over the turn to the next player. The game continues until all players yell PASS or one player has put down all of the tiles they had.&#10;&#10;If  the calculation is over, the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, compare the number of tiles and the one with fewer tiles wins.&#10;Ex) When 2 people are tied for the 1st place (19 points), the number of their tiles is compared. The 1PLAYER has 3 tiles, and the 2PLAYER has 2 tiles. Therefore, the 2PLAYER who has 1 less tile wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;         Contact Publisher&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)&#10;e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Super Burger Game is a game in which players have to make a Burger filled with cards. Everyone takes turns, and the one who puts the bun on top of the stack, takes the finished Burger itself.&#10;&#10;When each player has a Burger, the game ends. All cooks count the stuffing in their dishes, and the player with the most cards wins! That is, putting a bun on top of the deck as early as possible is not always the right strategy. However, it is possible to miss the point...&#10;&#10;Among the edible cards you can get a fly-throw it to your opponent, and the pest will eat one card from the Burger every turn. To get rid of flies, you can use boxes or hot peppers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
