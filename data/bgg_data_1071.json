    "Description": "Storisende intricately merges the two most prominent goals in the realm of abstract strategy games, elimination and territory. It does so with uniform material and a simple unified behaviour. This unique characteristic wasn't intended and not wholly foreseen, but it emerged during play.&#10;&#10;Players alternately move pieces. A piece can be a single man or a mono-colored stack and moves as far as it is high in a straight line in one of the six main directions. Pieces may merge or split and they capture opponent's pieces by replacement, regardless of size, removing the opponent's piece.&#10;&#10;The actions of both players inherently lead to a division of the board in a number of territories, separated by a contiguous Wall. Play takes place down in the territories as well as up on the Wall. The fight on the Wall is existential: it's all about eliminating the opponent. But whoever dominates it has the means to claim territories of take them from the opponent afterwards.&#10;&#10;Moving is not compulsory and the game ends when both players pass on successive turns. The winner is then the player with the most territory, counted as cells of the board. Draws are possible but not frequent.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However if the chakras are aligned in time, the good emotions will flow sweeping away the bad ones. So, do yoga poses! align the chakras!

It is a family game that can be played until 6 players (o even more) from the age of 4 but it can be played alone too.&#10;&#10;It is a cooperative game where the players must help the princess too feel better. To achieve this the players will have to do yoga poses (called asanas) and express their feelings. It is a beautiful game with watercolour pictures and mandalas, that nothing has to do with religion and metaphysical believes.&#10;&#10;The game has four key aspects:&#10;&#10;Fun: First and foremost, Asanakids is a game, so fun and light-hearted time with friends and familly is the main purpose.&#10;&#10;Fitness: Doing the yoga poses the players will excercise the body. Don't worry, the poses are thought for begginers. Also see the companion trying to stay in balance on one feet in 'tree pose' can be very fun too, doesn't it?&#10;&#10;Memory: A part of the game mechanic requieres to remember the tokens position, so the players stimulate the memory and concentration.&#10;&#10;Emotional Inteligence: Another important par of the game is learning to recognise the emotions and express them.

This Scale is also referred to as 1/72nd or 20mm, and these figures are the most commonly available (and cheapest) on the market today.  As such, it should be easy for the tactically inclined gamer to find armies of whatever time or country he or she may be drawn to.&#10;&#10;These rules favor simplicity over &ldquo;realism&rdquo; and provide a fast moving and exciting style of play. They give you the feel of a historical battle ... without the death and tragedy of the real thing.&#10;&#10;With this game, you can test your knowledge and understanding of strategy and tactics, while you enjoy the company of like-minded friends.  You can reenact actual historic battles or create your own unique scenarios.  The game is quite open-ended and has a lot of possibility for surprise, intrigue, fun and (hopefully) victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Like Yahtzee, the scorecard is divided into upper and lower sections. The upper must be completed before anything in the lower can be done.&#10;&#10;The upper section sets your Base Salary. You choose which number you are going for (1's through 6's) and roll all five dice. Count the ones that match what you are going for. You can continue rolling the 5 dice and adding more of your chosen number (1-6), thereby increasing your salary. One of the dice has &quot;IRS&quot; in the 1 position. If it ever comes up your turn is over and you only get half of the income you've accrued for that number.&#10;&#10;The lower section lets you add extra income via Stock Options, Profit Sharing, Capital Gains, and a Tax Refund. Those rolls are also negatively effected if IRS come up.&#10;&#10;Once you add your Base Salary and extra income you get your Total Income. You then have to roll for an Audit. Depending on your roll you will subtract money leaving you with your Take Home Pay. Highest Take Home Pay wins.&#10;&#10;You record your scores on a pad of 1040 Forms.&#10;&#10;Comes in a 2pc dice cup that doubles as case.

    "Description": "ZnajZnak. Feliszmered? is an educational game designed for two players, who acquire knowledge automatically while playing. ZnajZnak allows even 32 persons to play with the use of one set of cards. While playing the ZnajZnak game, players learn to recognise symbolic characters, dates, figures, places and objects of the Polish history.&#10;&#10;The game is composed of 132 cards. Each of them presents 12 different symbols concerning the contemporary history of Poland and Hungary. If you take a closer look at any two cards, you'll find out that they contain a common character. 132 cards, 133 symbols and always only one common character. The aim of a player is to notice the character on two other cards on the table and to tell its name as fast as possible. If the player succeeds to do that, he/she passes his/her card to another player. If he/she does not know the name of the character, he/she turns the card, reads the definition of the symbol, puts a new card on the table, and the game goes on. The winner is the person who first gets rid of all the cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The fates of Poland and Hungary have been linked together for centuries. Examples may be found not only in the distant past, but also still so close to us, in the 20th century. Poles and Hungarians could also count on each other&rsquo;s friendship and support in the face of threats from the greatest totalitarian regimes of all times &ndash; German Nazism and communism.&#10;The stories of both nations are filled with symbols, so when preparing the game, we had to make a selection, limiting the timeframe mainly to the 20th century. This is how a set of 133 symbols shown on the cards of the game was created. We hope that it will give both nations a chance to take a closer look at each other&rsquo;s stories. After all, the Polish-Hungarian celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the 1956 events, organized in 2016, were held under the slogan &quot;Poles and Hungarians, we all remember together&quot;.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sweet Jenny  is  a  gambling  game  played  in  the  world  of  Th&eacute;ah,  the  setting  of  the  7th  Sea  role&shy;playing  game,  and  is  inspired  by  classic  card  games.  As  a  game  itself,  Sweet  Jenny  is  a  mix  of  poker,  blackjack  and  three&shy;card  monte using it's own unique deck.  It  combines  strategy,  bluffing,  mind&shy;games  and  blind  luck  to  create  a  chaotic  and  fun  diversion  for  sailors,  dock&shy;hands  and  slumming  nobles  alike.&#10;&#10;Each round, each  player antes up and is dealt a  single  card  facedown. The  dealer also lays  out  a  number  of  facedown cards into  the  middle  of  the  play  area.   Over three phases, players secretly spy their own or middle cards, swap out cards, or discard their cards, in the attempt to manipulate the splay of cards. To win the round, a player must end up with the highest hand without going over 17.&#10;&#10;The winner of the hand wins the antes. The holder of the most ante coins when another player has none left wins the game. The game gets more complex with unique role cards that give players more powers to manipulate cards and the board.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "New 2018 expansion for Mythic Battles Pantheon&#10;&#10;With Dionysus, we didn't want to create a combat-oriented unit, but rather a control oriented unit that represented opulence and chaos.&#10;&#10;Let's start by looking at the power &quot;Orgiastic Procession&quot; which aims to simulate the arrival of Dionysus, accompanied by one of his procession. This power gives the player several troops who, themselves, have many activation cards. The goal is to support the notion of opulence, which is emphasized by the number of &quot;art of war&quot; cards that brings Dionysus, as well as a high number of life points.&#10;&#10;The satyr children also help Dionysus controlling the map because they all possess the block talent. However, we don&rsquo;t imagine that it is by physical might they manage to block off their enemies; it is because the units in their areas are too busy drinking their wine and feasting.&#10;&#10;The power of the satyr children makes it clear that Dionysus is not here to kill the opponents by fighting, but on the contrary, for them to lose themselves in the chaotic bliss of merriment. This power greatly disrupts an opponent's position and, in effect, offers significant control on the map to Dionysus.&#10;&#10;If the satyr children can neither attack nor collect gems, we imagine it is because they are busy serving wine to all the units in their area. This is represented by their block talent, as we have seen above, but also by the Bolster talent of the troops and the intoxicating power of Dionysus. This power, meanwhile, can generate chaos in the opponent's cards by forcing him to discard cards from his deck.&#10;&#10;Clearly, Dionysus can be a technical unit to play, due to his low mobility which requires careful placement on the map. Despite this, he is ubiquitous on the field and has the capability to disrupt the opponent's strategy. This, combined with the fact that he can send satyr children to bring him Omphalos (simulated by the talent gem collector), allows one to achieve victory by attaining Omphalos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "STORY&#10;While players are travelling around planet Earth, they need to collect enough stellar navigation knowledge (Ticket points called &lsquo;Tix&rsquo;) to face a trip to the Moon (Luna). Tix can be earned by travelling to different continents, using different vehicles and by observing the Moon, the planets (expansion) and the constellations of stars. In the endgame the Tix are essential to overcome the obstacles to the Moon. The first player reaching the Moon with sufficient Tix covering those difficulties during the trip wins the game. When playing solo, a time restriction is added to win the game depending on the difficulty level.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW MECHANICS&#10;The game board shows in the top left corner that each round, called a month, consists of three phases:&#10;&#10;     Ecliptic phase: when the new first player shifts the Sun on the star map, lays out new observation cards in the observation area and initiates the first choice of the planning phase.&#10;     Planning phase: each player in counter clockwise order, starting with the first player, chooses a vacant lunar phase (1 of the 4 weeks in a month) to plan an action by placing his meeple accordingly.&#10;     Activation phase: Beginning with the first week (new moon), the planned actions are being executed. In a game with more than 4 players the direct observation takes precedent of travelling, then saving an observation card, ending with observing a saved observation card.&#10;&#10;&#10;The star map shows the Sun with new background stars, forming a zodiac constellation, each month of the year. A day light card will cover the constellations present during the day. This dynamic alters the visibility in horizontal fashion, according what astronomers call Right Ascension (RA). The sunset and sunrise drawn on the daylight card forms the observer&rsquo;s western and eastern horizon.&#10;A map of planet Earth shows the continents you can travel to and can result in a visibility change as an observer according to the latitude change after each movement. The latitude correlates with the highest passing of the stars overhead; called zenith. The visibility in vertical fashion is expressed in what astronomers call Declination (DEC).  Blocks underneath an armillary sphere will indicate your northern and southern horizon.&#10;The observation area contains a freshly laid out combination of observation cards that can be scored when visible according to the time of the year and the place the player is on Earth. The lunar phases are scored according to the right week of the month that they appear in.&#10;The end game unfolds once a player reaches the launch pad for a voyage to the Moon. Once launched the player must tackle certain difficulties (Diff) by keeping the Diff values under their acquired knowledge and observation points (Tix). Special abilities, hidden agendas and lunar phase abilities can mitigate the values to be absorbed by your knowledge as a navigator.&#10;The game invokes an elegant choice between efficient observation, puzzling travel routes, playing out opportunities with abilities and some courage to risk a rocket launch as soon as possible.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S UNIQUE?&#10;LunaTix: Star Trackers offers a highly educational chance to get in touch with a real star map and to learn its link with our location on Earth. The knowledge of our planet&rsquo;s position and movement around the Sun, forming our seasons in time and climate regions in latitude, will provide you with a deeper insight on how people came to divide time and space as we know it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imperial Germany laid down her last dreadnought in January 1915, and never completed her. But planning continued for new classes of battleships, battle cruisers, armored cruisers and scout cruisers. All understood that they could not possibly be built during the course of the ongoing First World War, but would be laid down afterwards.&#10;&#10;Reflecting the lessons first of the battles of the Falklands, Coronel and Helgoland Bight, and eventually those of Jutland, the new German designs continued to emphasize protection. At the urging of sea officers, the new ships also now carried armament equal to that of the British, and would make much higher speeds as well.&#10;&#10;Across the North Sea, the British Admiralty had no clear idea of what the Germans might be planning to build, but could state with certainty that they and other potential enemies would continue to improve their warships. New British dreadnoughts would carry ever-more-powerful armaments, including a new, secret 18-inch gun.&#10;&#10;Jutland 1919 is a supplement for our Great War at Sea: Jutland game, studying these drawing-board battleships that would never actually be launched. It includes background essays, forty new scenarios, and 80 new silky-smooth die-cut playing pieces (60 double-sized &quot;long&quot; ship pieces and 20 square ones). It is not playable by itself; you&rsquo;ll need our Jutland game and High Seas Fleet book to play the scenarios. You can, of course, just read the essays and fondle the pieces without owning either. We won&rsquo;t tell.&#10;&#10;New pieces include three classes of German battleships designed but never built: a fast battleship with eight 15-inch guns, a battleship with ten 15-inch guns in five turrets, with three of them in a unique triple-stacked arrangement. And an even larger ship with 16.5-inch guns. There are two new classes of battle cruiser, one with 15-inch guns, one with 16.5-inch guns. And two variations on the fast armored cruiser proposed after the Battle of Jutland, one with ten 8.2-inch guns, and one with twenty (20) 5.9-inch guns. Plus there are additional scout cruisers and destroyers.&#10;&#10;The British for their part receive their improved but slower Queen Elizabeth class, with ten 15-inch guns, and the massive ships proposed to carry eight 18-inch guns apiece, based on the Hood design but slower with battleship-scale protection. Plus their own fast armored cruiser.&#10;&#10;These are powerful new ships, and now you can lead them into battle.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Our Second Great War alternative history story arc posits a world in which Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s attempts to forge a compromise peace in late 1916 succeeded. Millions of lives were saved and vast destruction averted, while the great empires of Eastern Europe &ndash; Germany, Austria, Russia and Turkey &ndash; survived for another generation. But not all accepted this new world order, and in August 1940 war returned to Europe.&#10;&#10;The Cruel Sea is a truly massive expansion set for Second Great War at Sea. It features the ships, airships, helicopters and airplanes of Imperial Germany, Republican France and Imperial Russia.&#10;&#10;There are 740 brand-new die-cut (and silky-smooth) pieces: 380 double-sized &quot;long&quot; pieces and 360 square ones.&#10;&#10;The Cruel Sea is intended as the foundation of the Second Great War at Sea; other supplements, like Sword of the Sea, will draw on this set for playing pieces (which lets us put even more new toys in those sets rather than repeating the same pieces).&#10;&#10;There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles waged during the first eight months of this war that never happened, in our popular story-arc format. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bismarck and Arctic Convoy to enjoy all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Our Second Great War background book describes the alternative history behind these scenarios.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The players must advance their pawn on a track, and the first player to reach the end wins the game. In the first phase, the players must answer riddles to advance on the track. In the second phase, players try to guess the position of the Black Moon card from a set of face down cards, and they advance based on how well they do. In the third phase, the players draw cards from a different set and advance based on the value of the cards they draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Central Asia circa 160 CE.&#10;&#10;The Silk Roads were built for trade between Europe and China. The most trade grew where the longest roads crossed each other. The swiftest traders traveled by horse through plains and mountains to dominate the roads and collect the most wealth.&#10;&#10;Work together to build roads, but wealth is only collected on a long road by the player who put down the most sections. Silk Roads is an abstract tile placement game on an 8 x 8 game board. Players take turns to place sections of road (tiles) while following the topological restrictions imposed by the tiles already placed. The game is over when there are no more empty squares on the board or all players have passed. Each player then gains the wealth from the roads they dominate. The winner is the player who has gained the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;Dominate the expanding trade network of Silk Roads, while keeping a close eye on other players&rsquo; routes.&#10;&#10;SILK ROADS IS ONLY AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD MULTI GAME SYSTEM FROM PLAYFORD GAMES.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Unrecorded Siege is a single or co-operative strategy game set in the 15th Century, at the corner of the famous Hundred years war. Each player takes on the role of a General, controlling different types of units to win glory and the battle.&#10;&#10;While playing in a 3*4 tiles battleground, players are acting as either French (Attacker) or English (Defender) generals, who will execute their military tactics with unique sets of armies, in assigning tactical formations for winning tactical positions, resources, siege weapons, and finally, the battle.&#10;&#10;The game is conducted in 4 rounds with several phases in each round. In these phases, players will obtain their unique heroes, armies, and strategic cards. They will assign these heroes, along with the units in different locations for making an advantage in winning or cheating their opponent. After everything is set, players will alternatingly activate armies&rsquo; skills in making an influence in the battle. Through eliminating, suppressing, flicking, and deforming opponent&rsquo;s formation, players will conclude the battle result by simply counting who has more units surviving and conquering these areas. After claiming resources (woods, rocks or alchemies mass) as a new landlord, players are granted the right to build tactical siege weapons (e.g. catapults, siege ram or watchtowers) on their lands for advanced tactical moves in the next round.&#10;&#10;After fighting for 4 rounds, a final battle result will be out &ndash; either French conquering the English land, or the English successfully safeguarding their place.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Over four years, 1951-1954, players take on the role of a community member in a typical American town. Your goal - ensure that in an age of ratting out, selling out and conspiracy that you emerge the least tainted, the least disgraced and the least shamed. The only effective way to do this, of course, is to ensure that the attention of the authorities remain firmly fixed on everyone else.&#10;&#10;Game play is based on the card drafting mechanic and is straightforward. On your turn you select a card from a hand of cards and choose which player in your judgment would be the most damaged by that card. And then you play that card on that player and watch them rack up levels of social shame that would make anyone's grandmother blush. Of course, every other player is lining up to do the same to you, but hey, that's just business in a time of betrayal, me-first and &quot;do it to Julia.&quot; Global Crisis cards are resolved each season that can dramatically change the &quot;facts on the ground,&quot; as they absolutely did during this historical period.&#10;&#10;While being historically-informed, this game isn't slavishly historical. The global crises, &quot;ordering institutions&quot; and other obstacles are all directly historical or are composites (like the characters).&#10;&#10;Red Menace is a straightforward social game. Once you get the procedure down, the game play itself should take between 30 and 40 minutes. Don't dwell on what you're going to do - almost everything in the game brings social shame to your opponents, after all!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It plays best with 3-9 players, but there is a 2 player variant included in the rules.&#10;&#10;Each player gets three &quot;Words of Power&quot; cards that show a selection of runes. You need to collect these runes (on Rune cards) in order to complete the Word. Upon completing the Word, you get the indicated number of Power Tokens. Throughout the game, you use your Power Tokens to bid on the Rune cards.&#10;&#10;The game centers around a unique silent bidding process that allows you to either get the Rune cards you need or gain more Power tokens. During a bidding phase, players will secretly take tokens into their hand then everyone reveals their bids all at once. The game end is triggered when someone has either completed all of their Words of Power, or have gained 500+ points in Power Tokens. After one last turn, Power Tokens are counted up, and the player with the most Power wins.&#10;&#10;Nine unique player screens are used to hide your tokens. Each one features art work and a short bio of a Norse god or goddess (the different gods are cosmetic only; gameplay is not changed.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Across the Bifrost bridge, the gods of Asgard await Ragnarok, the final battle, their inescapable fate. But what do the gods do in their downtime? Why, play Teflarok of course! It is the game of the gods after all. Now you get the chance to play as one of the gods. Collecting and casting magical runes that determine the fate of all mortals, best your friends in a game of strategy, vying for the most power.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Drawing Game is a new, fast-paced group boardgame. Your goal is to frantically draw your way to the bottom the Wordsmith&rsquo;s wordlist faster than the other team to win each round, best of multiple rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Split into two teams (more possible, but two is best) and one &lsquo;Wordsmith&rsquo; and position each team in a different room in the house (living room and kitchen, say). The teams can be almost any size, so long as you can see the piece of paper being drawn on. The Wordsmith sits at an equal distance to the two teams (on the stairs, for example) with the Wordlist. At the beginning of the game, one member of each team comes to the Wordsmith, and 3, 2, 1... the Wordsmith whispers the first word on the list to the two team members.&#10;&#10;The two team members sprint back to their teams&rsquo; as fast as they can, word in mind, pencil in hand, they start manically drawing the word on a piece of paper and whoever is first to guess the word correctly then, themselves, sprints to the Wordsmith to whisper the just-guessed word to them, hear the next word on the list, and sprint back themselves.&#10;&#10;It is a speed drawing battle, and sprinting battle between the two teams to see which can get through the Wordsmith&rsquo;s list of 20 words fastest. When one team wins, the Wordsmith shouts the winning team name. The game then continues for as many rounds as you wish to play - warning, it&rsquo;s highly addictive so be careful.&#10;&#10;The Wordsmith&rsquo;s job is far from mundane and simple word whispering. They are a key element in the overall absurdity of the game. They are the only player that knows (kind of) what&rsquo;s going on at any one time. The teams will be so engrossed in what they&rsquo;re drawing and guessing at speed that it is the job of the Wordsmith to keep the teams in the know on who is in the lead, by how many, how many more words there are to the end of the round. They are also the main judge of cheating, they must keep a keen ear on proceedings for any whispering of words to teammates. If two teams come running out of their respective rooms at the same time, it is the Wordsmith who decides who really was in front. Some useful phrases to have in the back of your mind, imagine we have Team Fantastics and Team Golden Oldies:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Fantastics and the Golden Oldies are neck and neck!&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Oooh, I&rsquo;m sorry to say Golden Oldies you&rsquo;re three behind the Fantastics at this moment.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Golden Oldies have made a comeback and have just overtaken Fantastics!&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Oh dear, what&rsquo;s going on with Fantastics, you&rsquo;ve been stuck on this one for a while now.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s only three to go to the end of the game, come on Team Fantastic, you can claw this back!&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Last word now, seconds to go in this round.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The rules have been written with 1/1200 scale models in mind, their inspiration being the models designed by Outpost Wargaming Services and others.&#10;&#10;The rules mainly use six sided dice (d6), with ten sided dice (d10) used in some circumstances. Unless specifically stated otherwise all die rolls use a d6. Sometimes a d3 roll is called for. In this case roll a d6 and halve the score, rounding up (so a 1 or 2 gives  a result of 1, a 3 or 4 gives a result of 2, a 5 or 6 gives a result of 3).&#10;&#10;You will need (in addition to models and a playing area) a handful of dice, a ruler measuring in inches, pens and paper. Ship damage states are denoted by markers. Suggestions for more visually attractive markers are given later in the rules. Also included at the end of the rules are sailing templates for caravels and other sailing ships.&#10;&#10;-description from Wargame Vault&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Congkak (also known as Sungka and Chongka among others), is a multi-lap sowing game likely derived from Mancala in the 15th century.&#10;&#10;Most Congkak or Sungka boards have seven pits on each of two sides, with a storehouse on each end of the board for each player.  However, some boards have more or less pits.  Each side of the board belongs to one player.  Boards are usually made of wood and carved into different designs.  The seeds are cowrie shells, though other items can be used.&#10;&#10;The game is played similar to Mancala with some notable differences.  The goal of the game is to obtain the most seeds. The game starts off with seven seeds in each pit. Players get seeds by placing seeds into their storehouse.  Players take the first turn simultaneously.  During a player's turn, a player picks up pieces on their side of the board and drops a seed in each pit clockwise, placing a seed in their storehouse, but skipping the opponent's storehouse.  If a player drops the final seed in a pit with seeds, the player picks up the seeds in the pit and continues their turn, distributing the picked up seeds in another lap.  If a player drops the final seed in an empty pit on their side of the board, they capture all the seeds in the corresponding pit on the opponent's side of the board (as well as the seed they placed in an empty pit).  A player's turn ends when a seed lands in an empty pit regardless of which side it lands.  Play proceeds until all the seeds on one side of the board are empty.  If there are still seeds on a side of the board, the player who owns the side gets all those sides.&#10;&#10;Games can also be played in rounds.  At the end of a round, each player fills up each pit on their side with the seeds they had in their storehouse; each pit gets seven seeds as in setup.  Leftover seeds remain in their storehouse.  If there are not enough seeds to fill a pit, the pit gets burned and removed from play.  Players cannot put seeds into the burned pit.  The series of rounds can be finished when a player can no longer sufficiently fill one pit with seven seeds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to The Game of Oppression: Poe&rsquo;s Law (GoO) a darkly, sardonic game focusing on inclusive gaming through humor. Similar to Cards Against Humanity in comedy style, in GoO you play a troll on the internet trying to prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed snowflake of them all. You are a troll though so your complaints aren&rsquo;t about real issues but things you&rsquo;ve made up in your mind. Your friends, evil trolls that they are, are also trying to prove they&rsquo;re actually the most oppressed and stop you from gaining the win. Most importantly though the Game of Oppression: Poe&rsquo;s Law is about inclusive gaming. Almost everyone will find an image of themselves somewhere in the deck.&#10;&#10;The goal of GoO is to gain the most Oppression Points (OP) and/or to be crowned King of the Snowflakes. Game play is simple turn-based competitive point grab. There are three to five rounds per game depending on the number of players. Each game is approximately 30-90 minutes in length.  During your turn you&rsquo;re allowed to play up to three Cards of Complaint (CoC) worth between 3-5 OP. Additionally, you may play up to one Special card per round. All CoCBlocks are worth -3 OP and one may be played per Card of Complain. Every CoCBlock though can be countered with a DoubleDown worth a single point. Any item on the table not in the SafeSpace may be stolen through judicious use of the special Yoink card. After each round all players draw up to the hand limit of five so you&rsquo;re never low on ways to prove how &ldquo;abused&rdquo; you are by the world.&#10;&#10;Storytelling is an important element of the inclusive comedy of GoO. After playing a Card of Complaint you explain your story that goes along with the card. The story is built upon via blocking and then finished via DoublingDown. Each CoC can contain one tiny snippet of story for the group to discuss and share. While you do not have to include storytelling to play the game one of the main goals of the Game of Oppression is to share with your fellow trolls. Prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed troll ever to gain the crown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
