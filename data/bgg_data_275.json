    "Description": "This game is played on a large board like a soccer field, approx 100x80cm. The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.&#10;&#10;A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.&#10;&#10;",

The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up. An average game lasts about 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": " &gt;&gt;&gt; ICE COLD ICE HOCKEY IS NOW LIVE ON BOARDGAMEARENA.COM!!!&#10;&#10;Ice Cold Ice Hockey is a thinking-man's card game that has been designed to simulate all the excitement of professional ice hockey. An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.&#10;&#10;Note that this is NOT just a &ldquo;draw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.&rdquo; Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You&rsquo;ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)&#10;&#10;I call the above a &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you&rsquo;ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;ICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you&rsquo;ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You&rsquo;ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent&rsquo;s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves &ndash; they&rsquo;re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a new game inspired by the bestselling novel of the same name and licensed by the film company that is making the movie based on the Da Vinci code book. The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.&#10;&#10;There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to go to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.&#10;&#10;Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.&#10;&#10;Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.&#10;&#10;This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.&#10;&#10;Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Usually Sudoku is a solitaire game, but now with SuDoku: Das Brettspiel, you can play it with up to four players.&#10;&#10;A SuDoku consists of 9 fields with 9 squares each. In each field and in each row, both vertically and horizontally, only the numbers from 1 to 9 may appear once. Different numbers are given before the game. Now it is up to the players to find out where which of the numbers from 1 to 9 are to be entered. It is important to achieve your goal by excluding.&#10;&#10;Since the playing field is empty at the beginning, 9 numbers are initially distributed over the 9 fields. There can only be one number in each row, each column and each square. On your turn, you place a number card in an empty space, paying attention to the laying rules. Then, receive as many points as there are numbers in the square and on the vertical and horizontal line. With each number played it becomes more difficult to accommodate your own, but you also get more points the further the game has progressed. At the end of your turn you draw a new tile. The game ends when no player can add another number without breaking the rules. The player with the most points wins. Children can play on the back of the game board on 6x6 fields. You don't use numbers for this, but animal tiles. The point rule applies as with the big ones.&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise, the card placed in this turn is discarded and the failed player must draw one card from the stack.&#10;Then the turn moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;Once a player has no cards remaining, that will be the last round.

The dinosaurs don&rsquo;t share spaces, so players can get the dinosaurs really moving by playing the same item card twice and jumping over other dinosaurs!

As all hope seems lost, a group of heroes stand together to fight back the Oni and their endless hordes.&#10;&#10;Onimaru (Japanese for &ldquo;demon circle&rdquo;) is a fully cooperative game where you and your allies take up arms to defend a village against otherworldly invaders. You will win the game if you are able to destroy the three villainous Oni. However, if you fail to do so within the predetermined number of days (rounds), the Gate will remain open forever, and all of Japan will succumb to the shadow!&#10;&#10;Each round begins with a preparation phase, where new enemies will appear from the Gate, and the Heroes may develop their skills.  After that, each player will roll a set of dice and work together as a team to decide how to allocate, reroll, and sequence those dice. These dice can be used to attack your enemies directly, or combined in specific sets to execute powerful techniques. Finally, the Oni will roll its own dice to damage the Heroes, summon forth new Hordelings, and command those Hordelings in play to attack their targets.&#10;&#10;Out of the box, you can choose to play the Heroes as recommended...or, through use of GameTrayz technology, you can customize and store your own unique Heroes!  Each Hero can be built with any 2 of the 16 included Techniques (and their accompanying cards), any 3 of the included 24 Skills, and any of the 8 included Talents. Out of the box, over 1.9 million different combinations are possible!&#10;&#10;The enemies also feature similar modularity. In each game, you will choose one of the three Oni to face of each Circle (difficulty tier). Each Oni is not only its own board, but also adds its own unique Attack cards and Hordeling cards to their respective deck. When an Oni is defeated, those Attack and Hordeling cards remain in those decks, as it passes its abilities and dark allies along to empower the next Oni!&#10;&#10;",

All players can play their Drawer Cards, adding a twist to the outcome. Will you help yourself or hinder your opponents? The choice is yours!&#10;Once Finished, Reveal the Dice and Calculate Stretch Value: The moment of truth has arrived. Lift the box and reveal the dice result. Add the result to your Stretch Value, taking into account any modifiers caused by the Drawer Cards in play.

Gain 1 Stretch Value, score a point, and bask in the glory of sitting on that victorious dick!&#10;Sit Failure: If the total result is lower than the Dickficulty, your Sit is deemed unsuccessful.

    "Description": "You command an army of Dragons engaged in battle with your opponent's Dragon army. Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.&#10;&#10;Wyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.&#10;&#10;To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...&#10;&#10;&#10;     You draw a card from your action deck.&#10;     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.&#10;     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.&#10;     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.&#10;     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.&#10;     A second action phase now ensues.&#10;     You must discard down to seven cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;See also Dragon Hunt&#10;&#10;",

Special Disney features include Disney Movers, a Disney Book of Magic card holder and a special Sorcerer's Hat gameplay for younger players.&#10;&#10;The world's most popular trivia game and best-loved family films come together in this magical Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition&reg; Disney Edition. The questions cover films all the way from Steamboat Willie, Mary Poppins and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to Pirates of the Caribbean and The Incredibles, and each question card is beautifully illustrated with a screen shot from a Disney film.&#10;&#10;This edition only comes with 200 cards, 100 for adults and 100 for children. The Disney Book of Magic is designed to hold two stacks of 25 cards each, hiding the image on the card so the next movie to come up is not know ahead of time. For younger players, the Sorcerer's Hat is moved to another wedge space, and if they get an answer wrong while on that space, they are allowed a second question to be asked from the same category.&#10;&#10;",

Move around the board as you win challenges, throwing dice to decide the difficulty of the action.&#10;&#10;TWISTED EYES&#10;&#10;A party game in which players have to draw while wearing glasses that distort what they see.&#10;&#10;The game is played in teams. The goal is to be the first team to reach the finish space on the board. The board shows a track consisting of green, yellow and blue spaces. The active team rolls a colour die and moves their pawn to the next space of the corresponding colours. A member of that team inserts the glasses of the same colour (different amounts of distortion) and rolls the die again to select which of the three words from the card he/she has to draw. He/she then tries to draw, wearing the glasses, so that his/her teammates manage to guess the word within the amount of time specified by the timer. If the team is successful, they roll the die again and move their pawn to the next space of that colour. If the time runs out before they have guessed correctly, the team's pawn stays where it is.&#10;&#10;The team who reaches the finish space first wins the game&#10;&#10;GOOGLY EYES is the hilarious family game that challenges your vision and leaves you googling for more! Put on the zany, vision-altering google eye glasses and start to draw while your team tries to guess what you're drawing. Is that an igloo or a turtle? A birthday cake or a fortress? Players take turns drawing and guessing, so everyone gets a chance to wear the glasses. The glasses come with three sets of lenses that range from mild changes to mind-blowing fun, so no one can see (or draw) straight--your vision will bounce off of the lenses. Googly Eyes is a fun twist on classic drawing games that lets players of different ages and skill levels compete on equal terms, since the goggles make it fun and challenging for everyone. Unlike any other drawing game you don't need to be an artist, and the rules are simple. Just roll the die and move--the space you land on tells you which color lenses to use (easy, medium, or hard). Then pick a card, set the timer, and start drawing. If your team guesses correctly you get to roll and move again; if not, then you stay where you are on the board. The first team to reach Finish wins.&#10;&#10;",

Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&#10;&#10;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow &amp; Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc.

    "Description": "There are three accepted variants of Baccarat: Baccarat Chemin de Fer, Baccarat Banque and Punto Banco. Typically played in Casinos, several standard decks of 52 cards are shuffled together and dealt from a communal card shoe.&#10;&#10;All three variants operate on the same principle; 2 cards are dealt in alternating order to a hand designated as the Player, and a hand designated as the Banker. Typically the Player hand is played by the person who bet the most on the Player's hand to win. Depending on the variant being played, certain circumstances allow either participant to draw an extra card then the cards are totaled (2s through 9s are worth their face value while 10s and face cards are worth ten points and aces are worth one point). If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.&#10;&#10;Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.&#10;&#10;Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker loses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.&#10;&#10;Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game with a nicely realized island group, which offers protection for either four nations or four pirate bands (depending on the edition) and indigenous people. Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).&#10;&#10;The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).&#10;&#10;Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.&#10;&#10;In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1986 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

Nowadays, megacities locked in endless competition have to avoid the pitfalls of their own egocentrism...&#10;&#10;Each player controls a city, represented by her hand of cards. Each card has an Egocentrism value and higher-valued cards also have special abilities.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to finish the game with the lowest Egocentrism score. One game can be composed of one or several rounds. Rounds play quickly.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 60 cards, form a deck, and initiate a discard pile. Distribute 5 cards to each player to compose her hand.&#10;&#10;A card put into the discard pile is simply discarded when it came straight from the deck, but is played when it came from the hand of a player. A played card can trigger its special ability while a discarded card cannot.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you must complete one of the following&#10;actions:&#10;&#10;- Draw and either discard OR keep the card so it replaces one from your hand. The replaced card would then be played.&#10;- Take the first card from the discard pile so it replaces one card from your hand. The replaced card is then played.&#10;- Reveal a pair of equal-valued cards and play one.&#10;- Say &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; so the round will end just before your next turn&#10;starts.&#10;&#10;The round also ends immediately if a player has no more cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The game is therefore a race for the lowest score. The tricky part is that each player has the power to abruptly trigger the end of the round as a regular action on her turn. She must however be careful because other players might have lower scores than hers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mr. Game! is a family-friendly party board game where one player has the power to create permanent rules during the game.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: Players use a simple roll-and-move system to navigate the board - roll two four-sided dice, choose one of the options, and move. If you land on a space with an ! on it, you draw a card from the game's singular tall stack of chaotic cards. The ultimate goal of the game is to land on the goal, but the goal can change places during the middle of the game if a special GOAL SWITCH Action card is drawn.&#10;&#10;CARDS: There are three kinds of cards in Mr. Game! - Actions, Powerups, and Badges. If you draw an Action, you must play it immediately and discard it. If you draw a Powerup, you must play it immediately, but it stays in play and affects your character's natural abilities (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively). If you draw a Badge, you may play it whenever you want, and you are allowed to keep it concealed.&#10;&#10;TILES: Many cards will bring Tiles into play. These small chipboard squares are essentially movable spaces that can be placed anywhere on the board. They change the layout of the board as soon as the enter play, adding spaces, removing spaces, or transfiguring spaces to have ridiculous, game-altering effects! They can be as simple as another ! space, or they can be as crazy as a Portal that transports you across the board!&#10;&#10;MR. GAME: Before the game begins, someone must volunteer to be Mr. Game. (They can change their title, but the default is Mr. Game) Players must direct all questions to Mr. Game. This character is in charge of adding permanent rules to the game if the need arises. The game is purposely designed so that the core rules allow you to play but leave out specific details. Mr. Game's job is to fill in these details as the game goes on. The more creative Mr. Game is, the more fun everyone has! Other players at the table are encouraged to suggest ideas, but Mr. Game has the final say. If you don't like how they are &quot;Mr. Game-ing&quot;, or they break one of the core tenets of being Mr. Game, just impeach them!&#10;&#10;Mr. Game! is designed to be simple to learn. If you just read this entire description, you already know how to play! Oh, and if you have a question... well, ask Mr. Game!&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to New Earth...'&#10;&#10;Just one continent remains home to civilisation after a cataclysmic event. Much of the human race has perished &ndash; from billions to a few million. The world as we knew it has gone. Those that survived are split into various &lsquo;factions&rsquo; (or proto-nations). Each player assumes the role of a &lsquo;government&rsquo; leader charged with building his/her &lsquo;country&rsquo; by developing existing resources and assets; whilst expending production in the form of consumption and government cash on infrastructure.&#10;&#10;As much as each nation will want to trade with each other, there remains the probability that political and economical control of land and resources (zones) become ever more critical. Progress is measured in terms of social development levels and the emergence of new cities. The higher the Development Level the higher the value of each zone and thus victory points, but watch out for the 'catastrophes'.&#10;&#10;New Earth is a strategy game for 2-4 players with elegant game mechanics combining worker placement with innovative hand management and modular tile design that provides endless game scenarios. Game length is 12 turns and lasts around 60-90 minutes, though players can agree on an extended time-frame. For ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;",

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.&#10;&#10;Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).&#10;&#10;It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:&#10;1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.&#10;2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.&#10;3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.&#10;4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.&#10;5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.&#10;6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.&#10;7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.&#10;&#10;Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Time heals all wounds, they say, but the sudden death of a loved one sometimes shakes those who are left behind so much that their faith wavers. To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;UNDO: Drowned Hopes is a beginners case for the UNDO Series and gets distributed for free through Pegasus Spiele on various events. It was also part of that games package Stadt Land Spielt! Mini Games 2019.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the board&rsquo;s edge determines the color each player uses.&#10;&#10;A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.&#10;&#10;The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.&#10;&#10;The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.&#10;&#10;Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 1 &#10;On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.&#10;&#10;Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 2&#10;As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.&#10;&#10;Debts and bankruptcy&#10;If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.&#10;&#10;A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.&#10;&#10;Negotiations &#10;All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents&rsquo; movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.&#10;&#10;Ending the game&#10;The game is over when only one player remains.

    "Description": "Welcome to world of Storm the Castle!, a 1-4 player semi-cooperative game in which you take the exciting role of one of the four marauding Dark Forces armies in a race to breach Castle StormHaven's walls, overrun the defenders, and claim victory by reaching the castle's keep first.&#10;&#10;Breaching Castle StormHaven's thick walls is no easy feat. It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.&#10;&#10;The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!&#10;&#10;Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.&#10;&#10;Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.&#10;&#10;Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.&#10;&#10;Dark Force Army Overview&#10;&#10;Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.&#10;&#10;The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.&#10;Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!&#10;&#10;The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.&#10;&#10;Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. &#10;Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.&#10;&#10;The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&rsquo;s defenses. &#10;Cons: Though your units are many, they don&rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.&#10;&#10;The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.&#10;&#10;Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.&#10;Cons: Squishy units means you&rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &ldquo;can I trust you&rdquo; looks. Lack of strong melee units.&#10;&#10;",

Peasants from nearby villages collect amber, which is bought by merchants from distant lands. The barons know that the one who profits the most from the amber trade will become the most powerful ruler of the new lands.&#10;&#10;In Amber, players take the role of the barons, and their goal is to build trade routes that connect their castles to the villages where the amber is collected, and to the other barons' castles where it is traded. To this end, players build roads through the wilderness &ndash; placing one tile each turn in the shared playing area &ndash; which will allow their buyers to reach the sources of the amber. Since all buyers can use the roads, however, it's important to have suitable connections with the road networks built by others. The baron whose castle is connected with the greatest number of villages and castles will become the richest and most respected Lord of the new land.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Emperor's New Clothes is a game inspired by the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale.&#10;&#10;In Emperor's New Clothes, players pretend to take on roles, and pretend that each role card indicates the types of resources (and sets of resources) required to score points. Blank dice are rolled (three rolls per turn) to pretend to acquire resources, and cards may be played by the active player and opponents to affect dice rolls, card plays, etc.&#10;&#10;After each player has had a chance to roll, the roles are revealed and resources are turned in for points.&#10;&#10;",
