Players take turns spinning the spinner and moving a mermaid or the Sea Witch. Mermaids move 1 or 2 spaces at a time and can take the bridge short cuts. The Sea Witch moves only 1 space at a time and always goes the long way around. If the Sea Witch lands on a mermaid, the mermaid must go back to start. But mermaids can collect wand tokens which move the Sea Witch back one space. Players decide together when to use the wands and which mermaids to move to keep the mermaids going.

    "Description": "Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.&#10;&#10;There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.&#10;The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.&#10;&#10;A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.&#10;&#10;When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card. Being set in Ankh-Morpork, many other random hazards face players, but we don't want to spoil the surprise and tell you everything! Where's the fun in that?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Many Russian tales speak of the character of Baba Yaga, the ogress witch who lives in a house with chicken legs. Fortunately for them, children always find unexpected allies and manage to escape her. Will you prove as fortunate?&#10;&#10;In Baba Yaga, you need to escape the claws of the hideous Baba Yaga. To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!&#10;&#10;Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Altaria is an island drifting in space that can be accessed through portals from different dimensions. Three enormous altars situated on the island give power over all dimensions to those who take control of them.&#10;&#10;In Altaria: Clash of Dimensions, each player uses three of ten characters to try to capture all of the altars placed in the center of the game board or the portal that belongs to her opponent. The game consists of seven rounds, and each round is divided into three stages. In each stage, a player gets action points (APs) that are used for the skills of one character. With the help of these APs a player can relocate the character, attack the enemy, or place a unique token of power on the board. Each token can change the course of events in the game.&#10;&#10;The modular board has removable components that provide players with a number of starting combinations and make it possible to play a unique game from the very start.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature used in Altaria is the passing of the tokens of power. After a few stages of the game, they disappear from the board which makes the game more dynamic and constantly changes the situation on the board. Try to make the most of the skills of your characters, outwit your opponent, and be a better tactician.&#10;&#10;",

It is however a completely different game.&#10;&#10;The game comprises 8 iceberg tiles and a similar number of small wooden cylinders (in two types depending on whether you want an easy or more challenging game) on which the icebergs tiles are balanced.  The icebergs are arranged on the table in a circle.&#10;&#10;A fish counter is placed one of the icebergs and the players take it in turns to move a penguin (the same type of penguin as in Penguin Pile-Up) the number of icebergs (1-5) indicated by the roll of a D6 (the sixth face of the dice shows a picture of a penguin meaning you do not move that turn). Players move the penguin from iceberg to iceberg, one at a time, attempting to place it so that it does not fall off.  If at any stage the penguin/iceberg topples off its stand then it is reset and that player's turn ends immediately.&#10;&#10;Every time a circuit of the eight icebergs is completed the player moving the penguin at that time claims the counter and another draw from the stock of 16.  Play continues in a similar manner until all are claimed.&#10;&#10;The number of fish (they vary from 1 to 5) on the players' counters are totaled with the winner being the player who has secured the greatest catch.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Colorama is a children's game for 1-6 players, Ages 3 - 8.&#10;&#10;This game is a child's introduction to colors and shapes. There are three variations for different ages. All variations involve placing 40 (*) plastic tiles of different colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and different shapes (circle, square, triangle, hexagon, trapezoid) in their proper positions on the gameboard. Some variants involve using two specialized dice (1 color die, 1 shape die).&#10;&#10;The game has quality components and is designed to encourage children to compare and arrange, and to practice manual dexterity and logical thinking.&#10;&#10;(*) Note that older editions had plastic tiles in 5 colors and 5 shapes. The fifth color was Orange, thus there were 5*5*2=50 tiles. It may be possible that even other distributions exist.&#10;&#10;",

Or, skip the Agenda and just try to beg/borrow/steal or; gasp, buy all the donuts!&#10;&#10;Components are thin; the cards and chits are no more than double paper thin, and the money is paper. The Artwork is Grade A Simpson, and liberally applied all over! The game is 1990 so the artwork is less refined First Season Simpsons. The playing pieces are ok, cardboard stand-ups with plastic bases.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mid-East Peace is one of those great games where luck really doesn't play a part, once initial country selection is made.&#10;&#10;The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;",

Because if the prediction displeases His Majesty, your own future may not look too bright...&#10;&#10;In Oraklos, players predict the future by throwing many-colored dice onto the table. By gazing at the resulting pattern, they simultaneously try to find elements of the prediction Alexander wants to hear. The fastest sweet talking soothsayer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Apart from the standard game, Oraklos contains 2 variants. Oraklos Junior, an easy variant, is suited for children from 6 years onwards and children will often beat the adults! Antipodes is a more difficult game, suitable for players from 10 years onwards. All variants take about 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;The playing material consists of 70 wish cards, 54 dice, 3 audience tokens, a measuring cord and rules in English, Dutch and German.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with $20,000 and a hand of 4 cards, each with a word (&quot;Lethargy&quot;) and four other numbered words (&quot;1. potency, 2. mutability, 3. felicity, 4. vigor&quot;).  In the middle of the board are 4 numbered spaces, 1-4.  At some spaces on the board you are allowed to play antonyms, others synonyms.  You may play up to 4 cards with the proper type to an unfilled number space equal to the number of the appropriate word.  For example on the above card, 4. vigor is an antonym for lethargy and could be played in the #4 spot on the board if empty and you are on a &quot;play antonym&quot; space.  If on your turn you fill the 4th space you &quot;publish a book&quot; and clear all the spaces.  If a player plays all 4 cards from his hand in a turn he also &quot;publishes a book&quot;.  A player may also &quot;publish&quot; a book by passing the start space (&quot;Go&quot;).   If any player feels that a card has been played incorrectly he may challenge the play.  He states what he thinks the correct play is and &quot;bets&quot; $1000.  The playing player may then call or raise in increments of $1000, back and forth until called.  The person who is correct gets the money, and if the challenger is correct the challenged card is returned to the player's hand.  At the end of a player's turn he fills his hand back to 4 cards.  Other spaces on the board require a player to pay money, allow him to collect money, or require all players to pass cards from their hands to other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Le Jeu Du Nain Jaune (Game of the Yellow Dwarf) is an attractive and unique traditional French card game that strikes a satisfying balance between luck of the draw and genuine strategy. Quality sets comprise wooden trays inlaid with the special scoring cards (King Hearts, Queen Spades, Jack Clubs, ten diamonds and the greatest scoring seven of diamonds), plus a conventional 52 card pack and betting tokens (poker chips). Cheaper sets are invariably plastic and can be found in most French supermarkets for a few Euros/dollars.  The objective is to dispose of the cards in your hand, playing them in simple numerical sequence from 1 (Ace) to King, picking up bonuses along the way. The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice. This is where the strategy comes in. Remembering which cards have been played allows you to frustrate your opponents by starting a sequence favoring the cards remaining in your hand. The simplicity of the basic game appeals to younger gamers, whereas the hardened gambler and his/her gaming friends can enjoy the hunt for the 7 of diamonds tray full of Euros. A good way to learn this game is by downloading shareware versions available on the Internet.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Pope Joan&#10;&#10;",

For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.&#10;&#10;Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane&trade;).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

Properties have been changed to a 'gay' theme as well - e.g. Fire Island and Castro Street.  Instead of buying houses and hotels, you can buy bars and bathhouses.  The money denominations include $3.00 bills.&#10;&#10;One departure from the original Monopoly is the inclusion of Family Pride cards.  When landing on the appropriate space, the description of a famous gay man is read aloud, and the player who can correctly identify the person can move ahead to any space on the board.  Also different is the addition of Camp Cards.  When these are drawn, you must perform the indicated action (ie. 'say: 'faaabulous!' six different ways and receive $3).  Finally, there are &quot;hanky code&quot; cards, where the player must identify what each color of the code meant, and what it meant when worn in each (left and right) rear pants pocket.&#10;&#10;Rumor has it that there were only a very limited number of copies of this game, as it was produced by The Parker Sisters, a division of Fire Island games, and were sued for copyright infringement by Parker Brothers (the company is no longer in business).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Maxi Yatzy (or the &quot;Swedish Variation&quot; according to some) is Yahtzee with an extra die, more ways to score points and a feature where you can save extra rolls for later.&#10;&#10;The game is played like the classic dice game Yahtzee except you have 6 dice instead of 5. Each turn the player rolls up to three times trying to get as good a combination as possible and entering the score onto the scoreboard. Unlike regular Yahtzee the player can choose to forfeit one or two of the rolls in a turn and instead take re roll-markers that can be used in later turns.&#10;&#10;When all players have taken their 20 turns of dice rolling the score is tallied up and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Free at Last is a game for 2-6 players.  Players take on the role of civil rights organizations (SNCC, CORE, etc) as they fight for equal rights and the end of segregation in the Deep South, circa 1960-1964.  It is not about Washington, DC, but the efforts of the people on the spot, whether that is Claiborne Parish, Louisiana or Mobile, Alabama.&#10;&#10;Free at Last is a card-driven game in which each card has a number (used to activate special individuals) and an event, but uniquely, the color of the number also matters and affects the type of project (voting rights, accommodations, school desegregation) that can be attempted. Multiple-length versions can be played: 3 turns (ending with the Freedom Rides), 6 turns (ending with the March on Washington), or a 9 turn game covering this entire period in American history. Players take turns playing cards from their hand.  These cards let the players take actions to accomplish Projects--examples include working to desegregate schools in New Orleans; Fayette County voter registration; as well as the various Freedom Rides across the south.  They also can be used for a specific event on the card, granting special powers to the players--but also potentially creating future disadvantageous consequences or making cooperation between the players' groups more difficult.&#10;&#10;While the game will eventually mean one organization/player 'wins', players must work together; if projects fail and are suppressed by the segregationists, then the Civil Rights Movement falls apart.  Thus, Free at Last is cooperative AND competitive.&#10;&#10;Note: This game bears the same name and designer as Free at Last, but the designs each stand on their own, with this game being for 2-6 players while the previous game was for only two players.&#10;&#10;",

As coaches, each is deciding what plays to run in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Plays commences with the selection of a play card by the defensive player. He/she installs a cover over this card such that the offensive player can only see the players on the line of scrimmage. A &quot;shift&quot; card must also be selected that gives the option of shifting the defensive line to either side for the play.&#10;&#10;The offensive player receives the play card and cover and must draw the offensive play on top of the clear holder. This could be a combination of runs, handoffs and passes.&#10;&#10;With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.&#10;&#10;Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dice Summoners is a two player duel using cards and dice. It's aimed at players who want a light competitive card game with high replayability. The game has an engaging strategy using dice based action selection and an extensive variety of cards. Immerse yourself in it's mythological theme as players deplete their enemy&rsquo;s health to win the battle.&#10;&#10;Summoners begin the battle with basic creature and spell cards. Creatures will gift the summoner with worshipers in the form of blue and red dice. The more creatures you summon, the more dice you will gain. Summoners build their army using the occult symbols on the dice. These symbols gain and activate spells, creatures, auras and curses from a common pool of cards.&#10;&#10;Spells are powerful actions like summoning mythical creatures and casting fireballs. Creatures can be used against an enemy to attack and defend. Auras can strengthen a summoner&rsquo;s army while curses hinder an enemy. Deplete your enemy&rsquo;s health to eliminate them and win the battle.&#10;&#10;Each turn is split into 2 stages: gain and combat. In the gain stage, the player gathers the dice earned by their creatures. They then roll these dice. In the combat stage, players can use the actions available to them on their cards in any order. These actions are cast, ability, and defend. When using these actions they must match the dice symbols or types of creatures on the card. They may end their turn at any moment during the combat stage. Play then continues to the next player. The game ends when one player's hp goes to 0 or below. That player is eliminated. The remaining player wins and is declared the greatest summoner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player is a Summoner, bringing great characters from out of History in order to fight for the Holy Grail. But something has gone wrong with your Summoner powers, and you end up with a mix of parts from different heroes. You must combine them as best as possible and send them into battle.&#10;&#10;Each player puts together their fighter from body parts of legendary people. Each historical figure has been separated into three parts. Starting with a hand of 7 cards, each tries to form a historical figure by combining the right arm (red card), torso (green), and left arm (purple) cards. Each body part card also contains a third of the person's name and their achievement, like &quot;SOC / RA / TES&quot; and &quot;One of the founders of / Western philosophy and the first / Moral philosopher&quot;. Each card also has icons indicating its 'military power' and intellectual power'. There are also weapon cards (blue). The weapon might go on the right arm of the character.&#10;&#10;Before each round, a Holy Grail Piece card is drawn to indicate the victory condition of the current battle, such as 'higher intellectual power' and 'lower military power. In this way, the strongest one is not necessarily the winner.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns to draw and exchange cards between themselves until one player Summons up and announces their chimeric historical figure to enter the tournament, displaying their chosen limbs and torso. That player also announces their opponent. The battle begins when the chosen opponent has also summoned their hero. When the battle is over, the winner announces another player as their opponent and the loser discards their chimera.&#10;&#10;After each player has fought that round, the final winner claims the Grail card as their prize. Turning it over reveals the lower torso which is placed on their champion, to enter the Hall of Fame. The game edns when a player makes the required number of Hall of Fame heroes according to the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is intended as a party game as much as a serious combat game. It is as much about making a chimera with a name and achievement that fits your sense of humour as about winning the actual tournaments. The game was an instant sell-out hit at the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2018.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;In this game, the players are up-and-coming summoners skilled in summoning great historical figures. Once every ten years, the summoners gather at the battle tournament to win the holy grail.&#10;You have carefully prepared yourselves for the battle, but the Holy Grail has suddenly run out of control. Your summoning circles have all fallen to pieces, and you can only summon parts of unidentified historical figures. Still, the battle has already begun.&#10;&#10;Can you combine the parts of historical figures in your hand to create the most powerful one and win through the battle?&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#176;&#134;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#231;&#167;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;10&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#186;&#150;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#154;&#180;&#232;&#181;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;",

(Thus, at least one token is removed from the board each turn.) A player cannot remove the final token handled by the previous player.&#10;&#10;If a player reveals the fifth space of a color, that player is eliminated from the game. In a two-player game, the remaining player wins.

You get a hand of cards and each card corresponds to one of the acts. You start with one card face down in front of you. There is also a face-up pool of cards plus a draw pile.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn up your face down card and play it beside the corresponding act. You then take on card from the pool and one from the deck. Finally, you place a card face down (which will be played on your next turn).&#10;&#10;When one act gets three cards beside it, play stops for the 'Hit Parade'. Starting from top to bottom, each act moves up a number of spaces equal to the cards played beside it (this can push acts it passes down the column). The cards played are put into the pool and play continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck runs out. You get points for the cards left in your hand - if you have cards for the act at the top of the column you get five points each, for each card for the second act you get four points, etc. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41. This game was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.&#10;&#10;Operation Felix is a &quot;what if...&quot; game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;hex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side &#10;time = one day per game turn &#10;strength = platoon/company/battalion sized units&#10;&#10;",
