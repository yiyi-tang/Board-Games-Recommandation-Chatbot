If you outsmart your opponents, you win Kwis &lsquo;t!&#10;&#10;Kwis &lsquo;t! is Dutch for Quiz it. If you pronounce it fast, it sounds like &lsquo;I knew it&rsquo; (In Dutch). The game has easy game rules and contains lots of verbal and non-verbal interaction.&#10;&#10;Kwis &lsquo;t! has more than 1.150 original questions in all different kinds of categories. Every set of five questions consists of two open questions, two multiple choice questions (with A, B and C) and one 50/50 question. If you don&rsquo;t know the answer, you can still make an educated guess. You guessed wrong? You can still bluff that you gave the correct answer.&#10;&#10;",

To win, you must build a castle that's harder to overcome that the opponent's.

    "Description": "OPERATION DOWNFALL: the planned but never executed Allied invasion of Japan was abandoned following the US atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Operation Olympic was to launch on November 1, 1945 with the objective to capture the southern third of the Japanese home island of Kyushu. After a rapid establishment of airbases and logistical hubs, this would then support the follow-up Operation Coronet that would strike near Tokyo planned for March 1946. The Japanese had long established their desire for a decisive battle to inflict an unacceptable level of casualties on the invading US troops, fueled by a fanatic devotion to their Emperor and country. The US invasion would provide that opportunity in a battle that promised ferocity to match or even exceed the epic and bloody German/Soviet struggle for Berlin. Operation Olympic/Ketsu-Go seeks to portray this situation in a playable simulation of the event. General Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s X-Day is about to start: it&rsquo;s November 1, 1945&hellip;&#10;&#10;Unit size: battalion/regiment.&#10;Hexes are 3 km across.&#10;Game Scale: 3 days/turn. &#10;Length: 20 turns (1 NOV 45-30 DEC 45).&#10;&#10;Game system is a derivative of The Gamers&rsquo; Standard Combat Series. Unit symbols derived from Avalon Hill's The Longest Day are used on the half-inch, plastic counters.&#10;&#10;There are three scenarios. The &ldquo;historical&rdquo; plan has &ldquo;historical&rdquo; forces for both US invaders and Japanese defenders. &ldquo;An Olympic Miscalculation&rdquo; adds the Japanese 36th Area Army to present a real challenge to the US plan. &ldquo;Free for All&rdquo; gives players wide latitude to try their own plans.&#10;&#10;Rules cover weather, random events, artillery barrages, overruns, invasions, engineers, military police, assault guns, amtracs, evacuations, US replacement costs, air units, base capture and use, beachheads and ports, Rangers, US combined arms, chemical weapons, Japanese civil resistance, fortifications, banzai combat, infiltration tactics, infiltration teams, coastal fortifications, Special Attack Forces (&ldquo;kamikazes&rdquo;), US Little David mortar, and special terrain such as tunnels.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is a race between different animals (interesting selection of &quot;runners&quot;: frog, snake, turtle and snail). The winner is the first to reach the end of the track: the Crocodile Rock!&#10;The peculiarity of the game is that each player on her turn throw three six-sided dice: two are regular ones numbered from 1 to 6 but the third one displays only &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; as a result.&#10;The players need to accordingly add or subtract the two numbers to  determine how far they advance. A very good exercise for kids to learn basic math operations!&#10;Some spaces on the board features a fixed number: in this case you only roll the +/- die and move forward or backward of that number of spaces. Other ones show only odd or even number: roll 1 die and advance only if you obtain an odd or even result, respectively.&#10;The track also features a closed loop with a single specific space allowing access to the final section. There's also a few shortcuts, nicely depicted as jumping on a crocodile back or on logs.&#10;&#10;",

The game requires players to use suction cup darts to knock down two rockets that are balanced on a vertical stand that is decorated with a Bulls eye and space scenes.&#10;&#10;Each player has two shots to score points either by hitting the Bulls eye target or knocking the rockets off the stand. Highest score wins.&#10;A variation of the game requires players to knock down the left rocket first and hit specific space scenes on the stand before finally knocking the right rocket down to win. Players load the suction cup dart into a shooter that resembles a small wooden bat with a central hole. The shooter has a rubber band stretched over the dart end to fire the dart at the targets.&#10;&#10;American Games (A. Malloy) lists the game as being published in 1939.&#10;&#10;",

There are only two months left until the elections and events occur every day leaving no time for rest. On your road to success you will deal with social, economic and internal events and of course you will be part of scandals. By successfully resolving an event you will obtain rating points however by being part of a scandal you will lose them. You will be able to exchange rating points to the control of ministries and that will determine who will rule &Scaron;eimas.&#10;&#10;In &Scaron;eimas as well as in Seimas (Lithuanian Parlament) the elections is the time for challenges.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box (translated)&#10;&#10;Each player has 10 party member cards. Each party member has positive or negative competence points in each of the four fields (economic, internal affairs, social and scandals). The five event cards are picked, which represent an event happening each day of the working week. Events might be positive (economic, internal affairs or social) or negative (scandal). One event is opened and players bid party member to win (resolve) the event or not to be part of a scandal. Winning the event gains you rating points, which can be combined to obtain the control of ministries. By participating in a scandal players lose rating points, which can lead to losing the control of ministries. After the week ends (fifth event is resolved), played party members are returned to the player and the new week is started. The game is finished after two in-game months (8 weeks or 40 events) or when one player controls at least 7 (out of 14) ministries. The winner is the player who controls ministries which required most rating points to obtain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Politin&#196;&#151;s satyros &#197;&#190;aidimas. 2016 m Lietuvos Seimo rinkim&#197;&#179; parodija.&#10;&#10;J&#197;&#171;s vadovaujate partijai ir de&scaron;im&#196;&#141;iai jos rinktini&#197;&#179; nari&#197;&#179;.

You will choose the actions for each of your armies that will in turn, change the shape of the land and the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game of Resilience is played with 2 to 4 players, each attempting to be the first to build a level 4 stronghold and become the winner of the game. The levels of a stronghold are as follows: 1-Keep 2-Wall 3-Moat 4-Victory&#10;&#10;The Game Board: The game is played on square land tiles that are laid down between the player's war camps. The land tiles are one of three types, Desert, Plains or Forest, each having a different land value associated with them. The more land value a player controls, the higher they can build their stronghold to win the game.&#10;&#10;Some of the land tiles have mountains that limit where a player's commander can move to and may be rotated by the players to alter the game board, benefiting or hindering a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;Game-Play: Each player has 3 commanders that they use to move around the game board and interact with the land tiles. On each player's turn, they may use each commander once to claim land tiles, use special abilities or battle opponent commanders.&#10;&#10;Battle: Each commander has an army that is made up of 1 to 3 army cards. Army cards may be; Infantry, Archer, Cavalry or a Diplomat. In a Rock-Paper-Scissor fashion each player reveals cards, one at a time, from the commander army to battle: Infantry beats Cavalry, Cavalry beats Archer, Archer beats Infantry. The diplomat serves as the wild-card; when used in battle, both players are forced to roll a 6-sided die to determine the victor of that particular fight.&#10;&#10;Trading: Players may trade away land tiles they control to other willing players, and in return, they re-collect army cards that have been discarded or resurrect fallen commanders.&#10;&#10;Fun fact: No player can truly be eliminated. Even if a player looses all of their commanders and land tiles, they can always accept trade from other players, bringing them back into the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Cooperative hybrid; Defensive Combat, Area Control, Worker Placement, Territory Building, Push Your Luck, Strategic Survival Game.&#10;&#10;Outbreak is a cooperative board game for 1 to 8 players. You play as a survivor group in a post-apocalyptic world where you are trying to protect the Survivor City from the zombie hordes, before they reach the Main Base and kill the helpless inside. Players control a skilled survivor or team of survivors (in solo play), that must work together to fight back the hordes of zombies.&#10;&#10;Players start by constructing the survivor city around the Main Base. This safe area is now surrounded by zombie hordes whose goal is to reach the main base and eat all the survivors inside, overrunning settlements along the way. When a settlement is overrun, players can no longer request its support, so each turn players must attempt to destroy zombie hordes and prepare for the next wave of attacks. This is a very challenging game where cooperation is the key to surviving the zombie apocalypse!&#10;&#10;No two games will ever be the same. The game features over 100 different zombies, over 20 survivor settlements and over 150 action cards, which combine for a fresh challenge every time you play.&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;Fully cooperative immersive game play&#10;Solo or up to eight players!    &#10;Unique drop in/out game feature&#10;Build your very own city    &#10;Learn skills&#10;Resource gathering &amp; management  &#10;Very challenging game play&#10;Construct: weapons, vehicles, buildings and much more    &#10;Overwhelming numbers of unique zombies&#10;10 playable characters!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player slides one of their discs into a trough. That's it! Before or after inserting a disc, a player can hold the device by any of the four corners and turn it to look at either side. When a player grabs a different corner and holds the device by it, discs inside might slide in their troughs to new positions. Have you created a four-in-a-row of your discs (on one or a combination of both sides of the playing area) after taking your turn? If so, you win!&#10;&#10;Games of Quadrio can be quick as it's hard to keep an eye on all eight possible orientations of the device. Thus, the publisher recommends playing multiple rounds, such as seeing who can first win three games out of five.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Enter the business world as the president of a new company competing for consumers' money. Build your supply chain and your brand to become the leader in supply chain agility, but watch out: your competitors will do everything they can to stop you!&#10;&#10;Emergent is a game about supply chain network strategy with game theory elements. The goal of Emergent is to build a network of Distribution Centers (DCs) to make the most money by satisfying customer demand by selling products from your DCs to nearby cities. The game ends after round 4, and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each Round, all players use a strategic planning board to purchase distribution centers, stock them with inventory and invest in marketing. This is done secretly until all players are ready. At this point, each strategy is revealed and players execute the strategy by placing their distribution centers, marketing chips, and inventory onto the main board. The demand is then revealed for each city on the board.&#10;&#10;Players are able to fulfill demand to each city based on their whether they are the market leader, closest shipper, or the only available inventory. Players then receive revenue and pay costs and the round ends.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing for 4 rounds. The player with the most money by the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Emergent simulates strategic supply chain decisions that lead companies to real success in the marketplace. It punishes timid play and over-zealous strategies, leading people to react carefully to the strategies of competing companies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Districts: Barcelona is a game for up to 4 players about the different interests and tensions that transforms a city over time and how they are related. The City works as an ecosystem and its citizens try to adapt and transform it to match their needs. Sometimes, such changes come as a by product of some direct actions, some other times it comes from direct developments that come through the administration or private investments.&#10;&#10;We assess that it&rsquo;s not possible to witness such changes and transformations as a neutral witness: everyone is biased by its own experiences and perspective. Due to that, we have developed the different factions as how they perceive themselves. That is, portraying each of them per their own self-defined virtues and what they consider works best for most of the citizens, when not for everyone. Of course, as after all this is a game, for the sake of game balance we have adjusted certain values and actions to provide a better playability.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 4 players (but rules are provided for 3 and 2 players) and the city map is divided in districts. Each district has an array of values that describe its economic and population statistics. These values are a common pool for all the players, this means that your actions deplete some values to increase others, but doing so you might enable a 2nd player to play its actions in that district.&#10;&#10;The game has no luck component whatsoever, players' actions have a basic effect no matter where they play them, and an additional effect if certain values are matched. Each faction consumes certain resources and generate others, and not a single faction is autonomous: each of them requires at least one resource they can not generate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

While the box is not dated, Hargrave's History dates the deck to 1760.&#10;&#10;L'Histoire Romaine has a deck of 48 cards, numbered with Roman numerals, plus a card with rules of the game. The cards are printed on thick stock from wood blocks, with square corners and blank backs. At the top of each card is the name of an historical character and a circled portrait. Below the portrait, and taking up most of the card, is a biography of the individual. The box shows E. Jouy as the author of the biographies.&#10;&#10;The game seems to have been educational in nature, with the player drawing a card announcing its name, and the other player(s) having to come up with one or more relevant facts from the biography. Correct answers win the card, with the winner being the player who collects the most cards.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, players must earn money by making crops and livestock products, then selling them. Additionally, players need to demonstrate great leadership in the village parliament in order to make processing buildings that create more valuable products to sell. Also, the parliament will decide who receives subsidies, so you need to keep this in mind. Furthermore, you will be forced to make a very difficult choice between how much you will focus on parliament and focus on the village.&#10;&#10;This is a heavyweight game that asks you to consider various elements such as product trends, field and building positions, and voting in parliament, but each element is well intertwined, making it an enjoyable game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is named after Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, and seems to have been published to cash in on the glory of then Commodore Dewey's victory over the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay.&#10;&#10;The names run in value from Admiral Albert S. Barker (10 points) to Admiral Dewey (100 points). The game contains 77 plain square letter tiles, one for each of the letters in the names on the list of admirals.&#10;&#10;Players initially draw a hand of 10 tiles, and attempt to form, in whole or in part, names from the list. On each turn, a player draws a tile from the face-down stack, and if possible adds it to one of his names in progress. Instead of drawing from the stack, a player may steal a face-up tile from another player needed for one of his own names, provided that his own partial name is closer to completion than his opponent's. Letters may not be stolen from completed names. Completing a name grants an additional tile draw.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile runs out, players may continue to steal, and the game ends when no further plays are possible. The winner is the player who completes the highest point-value worth of names.&#10;&#10;",

Still, the D.III dominated the skies and was the main killer during &ldquo;Bloody April.&rdquo; The Austrians built the D.III under license and actually managed to improve on the original. There were still some in combat at the Armistice.&#10;&#10;Albatros D.III (Frommherz)&#10;Hermann Frommherz went from 2-seater pilot to the famous Jasta 2, where his first fighter was the &ldquo;Blau Maus.&rdquo; He survived World War I with 32 victories.&#10;&#10;Albatros D.III (Gruber)&#10;Kurt Gruber&rsquo;s first victory came with the Austro&ndash;Hungarian ace Godwin Brumowski manning the guns in his Albatros 2&ndash;seater, and they fought together again in this D.III in Flik 41J.&#10;&#10;Albatros D.III (Von Richthofen)&#10;Manfred von Richthofen, to flaunt his prowess in front of the enemy, painted this airplane completely bright red, partly obscuring its markings. For this reason, he became universally known as the &ldquo;Red Baron.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

It soon equipped all of the French fighter squadrons, served as a top British fighter for a year, and was even copied by the Germans! The &ldquo;sesquiplane&rdquo; design (a &ldquo;half&rdquo; lower wing) gave excellent climb and visibility, but was a weakness in stressful maneuvers. A favorite of aces, the Nieuport 17 was produced in France, Italy, and Russia and used by all Allied armies until late 1917.&#10;&#10;Nieuport 17 (Baracca)&#10;Francesco Baracca was Italy&rsquo;s top ace of World War I, with 34 kills, several of them in this Nieuport 17. His &ldquo;prancing horse&rdquo; symbol was later adopted by Ferrari.&#10;&#10;Nieuport 17 (Charles Nungesser)&#10;The flamboyant pilot, preferred Nieuports, even after his squadron switched to SPADs. He survived World War I as France&rsquo;s #3 scoring ace.&#10;&#10;Nieuport 17 (Thaw/Lufbery)&#10;American volunteers and French officers fought side&ndash;by&ndash;side in the &ldquo;Escadrille Lafayette.&rdquo; Cards for two of them, Raoul Lufbery and Bill Thaw, are featured in this model.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game produced in the 1950s, comparable to but significantly different from the game with the same name Dong Wu Qi that's more widely known today. The name just means &quot;Animal Chess&quot; or &quot;Animals Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;It's a chess-style game played on a 9x13 board, with each player having 16 different animal pieces. The animals are grouped into four different categories with four different movement rules (domestic animals, wild animals, insects and birds): within each group, weaker animals may not capture stronger animals. Each player's Lion piece, the most powerful of the wild animals, is confined to the mountain area at the end of the board, and the object of the game is to capture the opponent's Lion.&#10;&#10;This game is described in Cazaux and Knowlton &quot;A World of Chess&quot; (2017) as having been discovered in an online auction in China.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shattered Nations is a strategic game where you pit an army of your own design against an opponent&rsquo;s army. Choose your actions and moves carefully, even one misstep can change the tide of battle and turn victory into defeat.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy all of your opponents commanders before they destroy yours.&#10;&#10;Players will build an &ldquo;Army&rdquo; based off an agreed upon point army point value, deploy their army onto the battlefield, and attempt to destroy their enemy&rsquo;s commanders.&#10;&#10;The battlefield is a simple yet devastating beast. Broken down into three separate zones, each zone provides a specific function to a player.&#10;&#10;Command Line &ndash; The command line is the key to victory. This is where the army commanders start the game. Only commanders and heroes can be here.&#10;&#10;Deployment Line &ndash; The Deployment line is how you get new troops onto the battlefield. You play cards from your hand into this location.&#10;&#10;Front Line &ndash; The Front Line is where the action happens. Units must be on the front-line to attack the enemy.&#10;&#10;To move your soldiers around and attack you will need to issue commands via action cards. Each turn players will only be able to perform three actions. There are 5 types of actions they can take. Each round players will pre-select their actions. This is critical because it locks you into those actions for that round. Not choosing wisely may result in you not being able to use all the actions allotted to you.&#10;&#10;Attack Action: used for a unit in the Front-Line to attack the most forward unit in the opposing Command Line. Attacking with a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit. (see combat section more details on attacking and killing units).&#10;&#10;Deploy Action: used to move a unit from your hand to the deployment zone of an active Command Line. Deploying a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.&#10;&#10;Advance Action: used to advance any unit forward in the same command line. Advancing a unit &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.&#10;&#10;Event Action: used to play an event card from your hand.&#10;&#10;Ability Action: used to activate a unit&rsquo;s ability. Using a unit&rsquo;s ability &ldquo;exhausts&rdquo; the unit.&#10;&#10;Combining these actions and clever use of the battlefield will assure you a victory. Be careful though, it is of paramount importance to interpret your opponent&rsquo;s battlefield and predict what actions they will be using.&#10;&#10;Assemble your army, deploy your troops, destroy your enemies commanders!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The young farmers in Tic Tac Moo have their hands full driving the farm animals onto the meadow. On top of that, the animals are very status-conscious as to who is allowed to enter the grassland next to them, and if too many animals of one kind stand together, it can easily happen that some will go astray. Under these circumstances, how are you supposed to gather enough of them?&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has a set of 24 animal tokens that are shuffled at the start of the game. The game board is an 8x8 grid with the corners cut off; the outer rows on all sides are neutral space, while the inner section has four 3x3 fields, two each in the color of one of the players. To start the game, players place two of their animal tokens face up on their farmhand spaces and a third animal token in their barn. They then take turns placing four starting animal tokens on the board, one in each of their colored fields.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must place both tokens held by farmhands onto empty spaces in the grid &mdash; whether in their color, the opponent's color, or neutral territory &mdash; and they must place them adjacent to tokens showing the same animal as the one in their barn. If their barn has a pig token, for example, then they must place both tokens next to pig tokens already on the board, whether orthogonally or diagonally. If while doing so they create a line of three or more of the same animal tokens, they remove all of these animal tokens from the board and keep them except for the token that they just placed.&#10;&#10;If a player manages to fill one of their colored 3x3 grids with two pairs of each of the four animals (and a third animal of some type), then they immediately win. Alternatively, a player can win immediately by capturing at least twelve animals.&#10;&#10;",
