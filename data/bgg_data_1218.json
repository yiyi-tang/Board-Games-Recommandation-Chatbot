    "Description": "Hey, thanks for picking up a shift or two! It's been busy; guests have been coming at all hours of the day and night to warm their frozen feet and fill up on fries, burgers, and our famous fruit pies. As you can see there are no tables, just the row of barstools there. Guests are everyone's responsibility. We don't split tips here - the person who's served a guest the most food will get everything. Pay attention to what they like, and they'll tip well. Well, I think that's it... go talk to Gus in the back and he'll get you an apron and paper hat. Welcome aboard!&#10;&#10;In The Lucky Penny Diner players are the waitstaff in a 24-hour diner, serving orders to guests, and trying to collect the most in tips. Cards are drafted into players' hands, then served to guests by laying the cards in an overlapping fashion beside them, representing how full they are getting.&#10;&#10;What you serve, when, and to whom factor into how well you are rewarded. Do you serve dessert to a guest that your opponent is waiting on so that they can't serve them any more apps or entrees? Do you give it to the guy at the end to turn his two courses into three? Or do you serve it to the girl with the sweet tooth who will tip more for it?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Putting the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; back into your fantasy games&#10;&#10;Welcome to Undying Lands a completely revised version of FLD. The constant evolution of the rules is thanks to the feedback I have received. Before I briefly cover the new features of the rules I would like to firstly focus on why these rules came about. The purpose and intent of this game is to provide players with a much more realistic fantasy game in contrast to the artificially  contrived contemporary games that pay little attention to deployment, command control, light troops, orders, linear tactics and ignore the problems of movement, drill  and  reserves,  they  have  unrealistic  armies  with  ultra  powerful beast that trance anything that moves, with 20 year old game mechanics repackaged every 5 years and sold at a phenomanal price that spotty teenagers are all to pleased to pay. Crap game, slick marketing. The list goes ever on.&#10;&#10;We take the works of Tolkien and Moorcock to be actual historical accounts. In our careful reading we found that fantasy battle is an extension of the mechanics of historical battle. In Undying Lands you get all the tactical subtleties of historical wargaming plus an array of  fantastic beasts, sorcery, special attributes and their associated benefits and problems. Whether your intent is fair or foul, regardless of your Balrog  bodyguard, the &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; rank and file is the tactically most  important  soldier  on  your  battlefield  and  that  his  physical constraints is on par with his historical counterpart.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s  new  in Undying Lands? Basing is much more integrated and flexible, The command control system has been streamlined and clarified, troop and weapon characteristics have been amalgamated into a single versatile and variable factor. The result is a streamlined, integrated and smooth game that plays faster.&#10;&#10;First, we define the combat and manoeuvre characteristics of your troops, then deal with command, control and orders starting from the top  down.  Next we generate the battle  field,  then  the  sections  on the game turn, movement, combat, missile fire, results and victory conditions.  Finally,  there's  a  section on 'how to  win and common battlefield, tactical and organisational errors. HAVE FUN.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are the CEO of a drinking water company in a big country. The &quot;I-Sports Festival&quot; has been announced within this country, and a new stadium-building project has been established. You and other CEOs have signed a contract to contribute financially to the building the stadium and to put your company logos on it.&#10;&#10;The CEOs have started a campaign to sell their products at a fair price in the developing market and to raise the profile of the company through a variety of corporate activities, aiming to become one of the most well-known companies in the country after the completion of the stadium.&#10;&#10;BEVERAGE combines a worker-placement mechanism and a bidding system, with the game being partially inspired by Age of Steam and 18xx. The players are CEOs of various beverage companies. A new sports stadium is being built, and each CEO wants to get the stadium built and land the sponsorship rights. The progress of construction is the game clock.&#10;&#10;Players decide on the price of their drinking water, which must be produced and shipped, taking into account market trends and other factors. Products will be judged by the market and bought based on their price! Each player then receives the revenue generated.&#10;&#10;Starting with the first player who sold products, the company will use the funds earned to operate their company, including corporate activities to help to raise awareness of their company. However, the amount of tax to be paid by raising the level of awareness will gradually increase, and of course, it will be necessary to place the worker in charge of the chosen activity in the respective area in order to take the action.&#10;&#10;In addition, the players who issued stock during the course of corporate activity gain additional capital and the merits of additional recognition at the time when dividends are paid. However, if dividends are not paid, the player will have a disadvantage that can greatly reduce the reputation.&#10;&#10;Upon completion of the stadium, the companies' name recognition will be increased according to the amount of money invested in the stadium. The CEO of the most well-known company thanks to all these activities wins.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#232;&#146;&#184;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#152;XX&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#169;&#229;&#163;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#142;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#142;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;+&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

Virtually every army list is taken from a specific battle or campaign and is given at least a paragraph of background information &ndash; so, unlike other books of army lists, it is much more a compilation of historical research adapted to a specific set of rules. The contents page lists:&#10;&#10;Marlburian period (5 Armies)&#10;Great Northern War (2 Armies)&#10;Seven Years War (6 Armies)&#10;American War of Independence (3 Armies)&#10;French Revolutionary Wars (4 Armies)&#10;Napoleonic Wars (26 Armies)&#10;Indian Campaign 1840-1850 (2 Armies)&#10;Mexican American Wars (2 Armies)&#10;Crimean (3 Armies)&#10;Mid-19th Century (3 Armies including Garibaldi &ndash; Italian War of Independence)&#10;ACW and Mexican Wars (9 Armies)&#10;Late 19th Century (7 Armies including USA and Indian Wars)&#10;British Colonial 1879-1890 (6 Armies including Zulu, Afghan &amp; Mahdist)&#10;&#10;The last two pages, 65 and 66, contain rule amendments and corrections.&#10;&#10;",

In some cases the mother will have to be admitted in a Ward right away and have a surgery to give birth right away.&#10;&#10;In order to identify each baby's gender or to determine if the pregnant ladies need to go into labor, you will need to perform an Ultrasound, in the same fashion that you perform this in the Ultrasound section of the new Examinations Board, by using the special see-through red plastic chip to locate one or more gender symbols on the back of the top Maternity Diagnosis card. For each symbol you locate, you must place the corresponding tile(s) on the mother's card. If instead of finding gender symbols during the ultrasound, you locate a scalpel symbol, this means that the mother-to-be needs to give birth immediately to ensure the health of her baby. You will need to Hospitalize the mother to a Ward bed and take her to an Operating Room soon! In the Operating Room you will need to bring a Doctor and a Nurse to deliver the baby!&#10;&#10;In the Dental Clinic, you will get to admit Patients from the Outpatient Clinic who need to have their teeth checked up and cleaned. In order to perform a teeth cleanup, you will take the cubes and throw them like dice close by to the Dental Clinic board. Each cube(tooth) has one side that is colored black. Using your tweezers, you will need to place each tooth on the available slots of the Mouth tile but making sure that the black side of each tooth is facing down.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Hex Code, players take the role of computer hackers competing to break into each others' computer the quickest. Each turn players hack their way into their target's firewall by placing shapes dependent on the roll of dice. Once the firewall grid has started to fill, players can start guessing their target's password. If the player's six-letter guess contains any characters in the correct position, the target must say so; however, if a player's guess shares similarities to their target's security layer or firewall code, they trigger a trap. The target can immediately connect a node on their microchip, eventually allowing them to discern individual letters in their target's password. Overload firewalls, rewire microchips, and catch people in security traps to guess your target's password and prove you're the fastest hacker around!&#10;&#10;Hex Code is a free-to-play printable game designed during the COVID-19 crisis, and will remain available here and through the publisher's website forever, with continued support.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "January 1919. Poland returned to the map of Europe only two months earlier. Now the Republic desperately needs reforms which can be carried out only by Sejm. Even though the country doesn't even have its borders set up, the Chief of State calls for democratic election which will allow to choose the Representatives of the whole society. It's time for the first election campaign of the Second Polish Republic!&#10;&#10;&quot;Wybory 1919&quot; is a dynamic boardgame in which the players are the leaders of four main political forces in the interwar Poland. They try to lead their parties to victory in the upcoming elections. By playing action cards, they compete for support in four main social groups: peasantry, city dwellers, workers and the minorities. They can increase their own popularity and place a supporter meeple in their color in one of the groups, decrease others' support, manipulate the regional elections' order or even cancel elections in some constituencies by calling in the military actions in the region. Each player gets an identical deck of 9 action cards at the start of the game, but draws up to the limit of three cards at random in their turn - reshuffling the discard pile if the draw pile runs out. Players need to strategize based on their current hand and pay attention to the cards that their opponents have already used.&#10;&#10;Whoever gets the majority in each of the three groups favoured in the current round's constituency, wins the seat for their representative in that round of elections. The party that gets more representatives than any of the others after the last round is resolved, wins the game and assists in writing the Second Polish Republic's history!&#10;&#10;The game was commissioned by the Social Communication Bureau at Chancellery of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland for the 100th anniversary of the first elections in Second Polish Republic. It's meant as an educational tool in teaching history and promotional item for the Sejm. As such, it hasn't been available in retail. The instructions booklet contains more detailed historical background on the elections of 1919-1920 in Poland. The action cards provide some basic information on the leaders of each political side as well as flavor texts in the form of newspaper quotes from that time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Asking for a Friend: The party game that might get weird&quot; is a party game where all players are both asking and answering a question each round. The official goal is to collect the most points over ten rounds of play. The real goal is to finally have an excuse to ask your friend's the questions you've never asked before.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, a question card is drawn that has a blank. (e.g. &quot;How often do you _____?&quot;). Each player writes a prompt on a piece of paper that fills in the blank to make a complete question (e.g. &quot;wake up before your alarm&quot;, &quot;cry&quot;, or &quot;fart and blame it on someone else&quot;). All the prompts get shuffled, and each player draws a prompt. Each player answers the prompt they drew (which is sometimes the one they wrote). After everyone has answered, a voting card is revealed and the players vote for the winning answer based on the criteria on the voting card. (One round the voting might be based on which answer is &quot;Most likely to disappoint your parents&quot; and the next round might be based on who gave the &quot;Most wholesome answer&quot;). The winning answer gets the voting card, which is worth a point. However, great answers are made in response to great questions. The author of the prompt that spurred the winning answer will receive a reward card. Then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;If you don't want to answer a question, you can take a penalty card, but you might have to answer more questions later. Reward cards can do anything from telling someone else to get you a drink to letting you pick who answers which questions. Use your reward cards wisely, but don't forget to use them.&#10;&#10;The game is concluded after 10 Question Cards/rounds have been completed (or really, however many you want to play!) The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The cards are minimalist and each deck has it's own color (white, black, and orange). There is nothing inherently dirty about this game, but you can make it very adult/mature if you'd like. You also could play with kids and grandparents at a family reunion and ask family friendly questions. The maturity level of the game depends on the prompts that are written.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Camelot is in chaos, since King Arthur's throne is now up for the taking. Use your wits and arsenal to defeat your foes.&#10;&#10;To begin the riot, you attack the defender with a card(s) from your hand. Other players can always join the attack by playing any matching valued cards. The defender can flee, pass, or attempt to be victorious by defeating all the cards. If your friend is about to triumph, you can play another card at the last minute. Will it be enough to push him over the edge?&#10;&#10;Using an arsenal card or a jester card can greatly effect the course of each round. Successfully defeat cards to earn more arsenal cards. Throughout the game, you can also earn crowns and scepters to help you in your quest to become the new ruler of Camelot. Three crowns wins you the game! Do you have the strength to be victorious? Join the riot and we shall see!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your mission is to collect soil samples and upload the analysed data. You have a three-day deadline and need to contend with the harsh Martian environment, solar flares and marsquakes.&#10;&#10;The game is card-driven by a single deck of cards with the status of your rover updated on a game playmat. During the game you will be regularly draw a card from the explore deck and a single element on the card will determine an outcome or provide event relevant information. Each game has a soil data upload target. During your exploration of the Martian terrain you will have to balance energy use for exploration, drilling for soil samples, uploading data and navigating away from rockslides.&#10;&#10;Your mission is limited to three days and when you decide to end the day you can repair and recharge your rover. There are, however, opportunities for energy recharging during the day and a push-your-luck mechanism when considering whether to explore further or stop for the day.&#10;&#10;The game ends on day 3 and winning is determined on whether you have met your soil data upload target and made it back to base. If your rover ever has 0% energy across drill, gyroscope and battery power, your rover is powerless on Mars and your mission has failed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It uses a rules-engine heavily inspired by The Library of Napoleonic Battles rules system by the illustrious Kevin Zucker and OSG. Several scenarios allow for a quicker French response to Prussian maneuvers the day before creating a salvageable situation for the French. Each hex is approximately 1KM and units are divisions which can break down into their subordinate brigades. Maintaining a chain of command allows players to freely act with their units, while units outside of command range must rely on initiative. Special rules are included for French Chassepot and Mitrailleuse and the obliterating power of Prussian Krupp artillery.&#10;&#10;This is our first wargame outside of the 2140 series and is the first of several efforts to see games our heroic CEO designed a few years ago that have sat languishing among other ideas, priorities and projects. This will include a 22x34&rdquo; map, 560 half inch counters, several player aids along with a rule-book and 2d6.&#10;&#10;",

Players then place new game pieces on the board. They may choose to do this in one of two ways: they may place a single game piece anywhere on the board. Or they may make a &ldquo;trail&rdquo; by following any straight-line path from one of their already-placed game pieces (as a Bacterium, after all, you want to spread yourself as far as you can.) The Player then &quot;reproduces&quot; by placing his pieces in each empty spot in between along the three-space trail, reflecting the rapid growth of the bacteria. Every Petri dish game space he has thereby infected then becomes a potential source for further infections.&#10;&#10;In addition to moving, game pieces can be captured by surrounding a Bacterium and starving it of resources so it dies and is replaced by the Player's Bacteria.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are Penicillin Spores that are floating around in the lab which will land randomly, killing the Bacteria in some Petri dishes and replacing them. Every so often, Players roll dice to determine where the Penicillin has landed. If there are any Bacteria game pieces in these marked spaces, they are removed and replaced with an Opponent&rsquo;s game piece.&#10;&#10;Play continues until neither Player is able to make a legal move.

Paintbrush, like all great strategy games, uses simple mechanics to create complex situations, all made possible by Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. AI-powered game pieces act as both brush and canvas, and players take turns rearranging the dynamic pieces to spread their color onto as many blank canvasses as they can. Simple mechanics mean the game can be picked up easily, but the strategic depth allows for repeated play and the possibility of mastery.&#10;&#10;Paintbrush is a game for 2 to 6 players, played with 6 or more Blinks. A typical game of Paintbrush can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, with larger player counts and more Blinks often leading to longer games. Each player selects a unique Paintbrush color, and take turns moving individual Blinks around the board to spread their color onto blank canvasses. A canvas which has been painted entirely with one color becomes a Paintbrush itself. Once all the Blinks have been converted to Paintbrushes, the game is over, and whichever player has the most Paintbrushes wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It's an intense game of strategy and prediction, as each player secretly inputs orders into the AI-powered Blinks game pieces, then watches as skirmishes play out in real time. It's the kind of unique analog/digital hybrid experience that's only possible on Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. The game started as a post on the Move38 developer forum in early February, and has since been iterated on and perfected with the help of the Move38 team.&#10;&#10;In Raid, 2 to 4 players compete to conquer an island made of Blinks. The game requires at least 6 Blinks, and takes 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of the island and number of players. Each round, players close their eyes, then take turns opening their eyes and making an attack on the island with their longboat. Once all players have attack, all eyes are opened and the game calculates the outcome of the round. Armies spread from the coast into the center of the island, competing for a dwindling set of unoccupied territories. When all coastal territories have been attacked and no more longships can land, the game calculates which player conquered the largest territory, making them the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of France was the first great tank battle, and perhaps the first major battle, of World War II. Of course, it was not called that at the time. People called it &lsquo;Hitler&rsquo;s War&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Phony War&rsquo;. Perhaps it was Hitler&rsquo;s war, but it was far from phony. It was, in fact, the complete opposite and the Wehrmacht was out to prove it. France was to be the proving grounds that Germany&rsquo;s Panzer tank divisions were to become feared on.&#10;&#10;No one suspected a strategic pincer attack from the Ardennes forest, but rather through the Maginot Line. Nearly everyone believed that the Maginot Line would be the ultimate wall of defense against Germany. Heinz Guderian was the exception. His ground breaking idea of mechanized warfare created World War II. Here is where he would show the world the strength of a concentrated attack force and how an entire nation could be brought to its knees by a swift, decisive strike.&#10;&#10;In Battle of France 1940 you play the role of either Guiderian or Charles De Gaulle. You make the decisions; Will you attack Dunkerk and cut off the British? Can you defend Paris against the ever growing German armies? Will your men continue to fight despite massive casualties and declining morale? How will you deal with supply shortages?&#10;&#10;Combat cards simulate fog of war and new challenges to face your troops every round. Unique rules mimic the Blitzkrieg system of warfare and special combat features include divisional singularity, tank superiority, air support and retreat rules. Also featuring special territories showcasing the historic elements of the Ardennes Forest and the Maginot Line.&#10;&#10;Battle of France 1940 is filled with factors beyond your control. However, the heart of the game is in how you position your forces so that the industry, morale and equipment of your opponent is destroyed, captured or commandeered.&#10;&#10;Can you shape the fate of the world in a few short hours?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The floating tribes of Typatia have lived under the tyrannical rule of The Empress for far too long. She has starved the people, abused the dinosaurs, and grown fat off the riches of the land.&#10;&#10;As a Chief of Typatia, it is your duty to throw off the yoke of oppression and claim your tribe's rightful place as the leaders of Typatia.&#10;&#10;Will you do this through economic prowess, scientific advancement, political negotiation, or pure military might? The choice is yours as you spread your influence across the floating lands.&#10;&#10;Defiant is a 4X bag-building game set in a land of floating islands and battling dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Each turn you will use the cubes you drew (at the end of the previous turn) to activate actions. Each action requires 2 cubes and will increase in power if you are willing to spend your rare bronze, silver, or even gold cube to complete the action. Be sure to plan ahead or your previously placed cubes could end up wasted.&#10;&#10;Air battles occur when 2 sets of flyers encounter each other. Transported raptors &amp; rexes add nothing to these battles. Only the number &amp; strength of each army's flyers matter. If the attacking flyers win, they may then drop their land units onto the island below.&#10;&#10;These dropped units will then instigate a land battle if defenders are present. These battles are more tricky, with secret modifier cards influencing each side's strength.&#10;&#10;A player may be strong in the air, but weak on land, unable to take over defended islands. Or a player may be strong on land, but weak in the air, unable to transport their raptors and rexes to new islands.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has completed enough objectives. These include:&#10;&bull;Completing 1 of the 4 upgrade tracks.&#10;&bull;Winning an air battle.&#10;&bull;Winning a land battle.&#10;&bull;Defeating the Empress.&#10;&bull;Completing the special objective which is drawn at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Players then count up the points from their objectives, controlled hexes, and gold/silver/bronze cubes.&#10;&#10;Defiant comes from our love of bag-building and 4X games. We aimed to build a 4X game that could be played quicker than a normal 4X game, yet still have the same scope and feel. The bag building element helps in this endeavor, as players can be planning their turns from 1 turn to the next (since they've already drawn the next turn's cubes).&#10;&#10;Note: Hardcore 4X gamers can choose to play to a higher objective thresh-hold for an even more sprawling and vast game of Defiant.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

That downside is why you don&rsquo;t want to be the one stuck with the baby in this game! The last player left in the game and not eliminated by the King Cake Baby card wins! Your turn consists of two steps: playing as many Action cards as you want and then drawing a card from the Draw pile to end your turn. After your turn ends, the next person can go by playing Action cards first and then drawing a card to end their turn. Playing Action Cards in the game such as Fortune Teller, Bead Throw Attack, and the Crawfish Block help you avoid the Baby in the Draw pile at all costs! That&rsquo;s it! Last person standing wins the game! The key is to avoid those Baby Game Over cards! Who&rsquo;s got the baby? Hopefully, not you!&#10;&#10;Includes: 54 cards, box, and instructions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The horrors of trench warfare rage across Europe in 1916. Machine guns are cutting brave soldiers to ribbons when they go &quot;over the top&quot; and are confronted with mazes of wire. Tanks are appearing more frequently on the battlefield, as well as biplanes which seem to evolve every day. The major source of havoc, however, is artillery, which rains hell from above on a regular basis. Not to mention the poison gas.&#10;&#10;1916: The Card Game is a tense filler for two players, and includes all of the above. The rules are simple, but the choices aren't. Players represent the opposing commanders of a small stretch of trench line. They draw and play cards from a common deck, but some can only be used by one side. Some cards can be played alone or in combination, and what to play and what to hold in hand can be critical decisions. Some cards have multiple uses. Biplanes, for example, can be used for recon, assault support, or aerial intercept. Victory can be total, major, minor or, rarely, the result can be a stalemate.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Among them are a number of &quot;norse god&quot; cards that feature the new &quot;passive&quot; keyword and add their own unique rules and twists to the battlefield whenever they're in play.&#10;&#10;In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&#10;&#10;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&#10;&#10;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Before you looms the dimly lit entrance of the most feared dungeon in the land. It is called the GAMOT. Within the Gamot lie dangers untold, for no hero has yet returned from its deep depths. The journey here has not been an easy one. You dismount from your trusty steed and ready your sword and shield. If you conquer the Gamot, you will earn the greatest glory in the land and with it a place among the King&rsquo;s personal guard. A worthy position for a hero such as yourself!&#10;&#10;As you approach the entrance to the Gamot, you can smell the foul stench of death and are overcome with an unexplained dread. While you steel your nerves against this dark air, you hear the sound of hoof beats behind you. Your horse has fled in fear&hellip; You are truly alone now. You step into the entrance of the Gamot, filled with determination. As you do so, however, the floor gives way and you find yourself suddenly tumbling down an incline. You hit the ground below with a hard thud. After taking a moment to regain your bearings, you search in the darkness for your sword and shield. They are nowhere to be found! Rising to your feet, you see that you have fallen into a long corridor lined with doors. A haunting laugh echoes in the dungeon. The only thing that stands between you and whatever horrors await you in the dungeon is your will to live and your desire to prove yourself the greatest hero in the land&hellip;&#10;&#10;Will you survive the Gamot?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Gamot is a solitaire dungeon crawling card game, designed to be quick and playable on-the-go. You take the role of an adventuring hero as you attempt to navigate the perils of the dungeon. You will search for weapons and items in which to defend yourself, while fighting fearsome monsters and drinking potions to keep your health up! No two games are ever the same!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Arm yourself with swords, bows and warhammers, or locate powerful weapons such as the Golden Trident!&#10;     Use special items like the Magic Ring to rearrange the shape of the dungeon!&#10;     Choose wisely when to face a threat head on and when to run!&#10;     Face monsters such as werewolves, black knights, great worms and the dreaded and deadly lich!&#10;     Search the halls of the dungeons for potions to help you recover from your wounds suffered at the hands of these brutal beasts!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Gamot is the perfect game for on-the-go players! Gamot requires little space to play, plays as quickly as you can make decisions and can be carried in your pocket. Designed to be played while waiting in lines, travelling on buses or trains, or on your break at work, Gamot also works for filling in time while you wait for your turn at the gaming table. With only a deck of 54 standard playing cards (and some small counters that you can easily replace with your memory or a scrap of paper and a pencil), and developed to appeal to both your mind and your wallet, Gamot provides a great and inexpensive dungeon crawling experience that won't break the bank!&#10;&#10;Gamot is easily learned, but tough to master. Gamot is also family-friendly, and requires only basic math skills to get started.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Autumn Grove Manor is a co-op game for 2-6 players. A team of ghost hunters, armed with only Lord Latimer's Journal, must collect 6 gems which can be combined to create a 'weapon' to defeat Palmershu, the Demon God, who has claimed the manor as his own. You'll have to exorcise the ghosts, while avoiding holes in the ground and searching the manor for items and gems, but beware, Palmershu may appear at the end of any round, and he's not pleased that you're trying to exorcise him.&#10;&#10;The game is set up by shuffling the room cards, placing them upside down on the board so each room can't be seen and placing all the players at the front door and all the ghosts and the Palmershu marker are placed in the cloth bag.&#10;During Part 1 A player has 8 action points each turn, which can be used for moving, exorcising ghosts, using items, giving an item to an ally, or opening chests or doors. Once a player opens either a chest or a door, they've alerted the ghosts to their presence and their turn immediately ends and they turn over a card from the ghost deck.&#10;During the end of turn players must add more ghosts onto the board using a pair of D20 dice pulling ghosts (or Palmershu) randomly from the bag.&#10;The aim of Part 1 is to search the house for 6 gems, spread across the house in the different rooms.&#10;&#10;In Part 2 the board is flipped and Palmershu starts his final attack as the team attempt to destroy him. &#10;All the items you've collected in part 1 are carried over and can be played any round before anyone rolls to attack. The number of gems you collected will decreases the number of cards revealed for where Palmershu will appear.&#10;&#10;Part 2 is split into 5 sections:&#10;Palmershu's Arrival&#10;From the Palmershu Deck reveal the correct number of card (the more gems you found in Part 1, the less places he may attack from)&#10;Character Actions&#10;The Characters can then use items and move up to 3 spaces in any order.&#10;Palmershu Appears&#10;The top card of Palmershu's attack deck is revealed which reveals which card and which power is used.&#10;Characters Attack&#10;The Characters who are in range of Palmershu or ghosts then attack them.&#10;Palmershu Attacks&#10;Finally the ghosts and Palmershu will attack the Characters.&#10;&#10;To win the game the team must defeat Palmershu. However if all the ghosts are removed from the bag then the team must flee the house and the game is lost, or if any player loses all their hearts then the game is lost.&#10;There are 4 levels of difficulty, which vary the number of ghosts on the board to begin and the number that appear each turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios are inspired by (however loosely players want), and must reference, a phrase created by 5 cards: 2 Link Cards and 3 Story Cards. These cards change between rounds.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player takes on the role of judge and all other players take on the role of storytellers. The judge determines whether they want to hear the best or worst possible scenario and indicate by flipping the &quot;What If&hellip;&quot; card to its positive or negative side. They draw the top two cards of the Link deck and play them face up. They then play a Story card from their own hand to begin the scenario. Storytellers play Story cards from their hands to supply options for 2 of the words in the phrase. These 2 words are different for each storyteller, meaning they&rsquo;ll base their scenarios off slightly different phrases.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, roles shift. The player to the left of the previous judge becomes the new judge. Each turn consists of three phases: judge&rsquo;s setup, storyteller&rsquo;s scenarios, and judge&rsquo;s choice. Play continues until every player has had a chance to be judge twice &mdash; or keep going as long as you want!

Players are dealt two separate hands, a &ldquo;Scoring Hand&rdquo; that determines if they win or lose, and a &ldquo;Playing Hand,&rdquo; whose cards have abilities that they can use to help improve their Scoring Hands.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players are dealt five-card Scoring Hands, and are competing to have the best hand at the end of each round. But there&rsquo;s one problem: While they start the game knowing what their cards are, that can change. Players are also dealt Playing Hands. During the game they will use abilities on these Playing Hand cards to learn about and change their and others&rsquo; Scoring Hands, to try to give themselves the best Scoring Hand possible.&#10;&#10;Scoring Hands are ranked similarly (but not exactly) like poker, because each card has one of six suits and number value (from 1 to 7). The number values are important for scoring. Each card also has an ability based on its suit. When you use an ability, state which card(s) its ability is targeting. All abilities (except for bullets) affect Scoring Hand cards.&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player takes a turn playing one card from their Playing Hand. The round ends when no one has any cards left to play. On your turn, must play a card, unless you&rsquo;ve played a bullet card between your last turn and this one. In that case, you may still play a Playing Hand card, but it is optional. Whoever has the highest Scoring Hand at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players then do this again two more times, leaving them with one card in hand.&#10;&#10;Your score for the round is the sum of the value of the card in your hand and the value of the cards you played.

Miners, knights, and sell-swords have all fallen at the claws of these foul creatures. With the Kingdom of Yule already on the verge of bankruptcy, the King cannot afford to lose control of these mines. No amount of death can stop his desire to retain his power.Lucky for you, your reputation as a Bounty Hunter has earned you a chance to prove your worth. Capturing criminals has been easy, surely your unique skill set will transfer to killing beasts. The King is willing to empty the last of the kingdom's coffers for the heads of these creatures. Will you fall amongst the treasure and corpses of the cavern or slay your enemies to claim your due glory?&quot;&#10;&#10;Dungeon Bounty is a fast paced hand management game designed to be played with a single standard deck of playing cards. On each turn, players flip two cards from the deck (dungeon). If the cards are a 1-10 of clubs (weapons), diamonds (gemstones), or spades (spells), the player chooses one to add to their play area. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are the bounties, the creatures you are hunting, and when they pop up as one of the two drawn cards from the dungeon, you need to defeat them using your attack power from weapons and spells. The more bounties you collect, the higher your score.&#10;&#10;If you are unable to defeat a monster, they do damage to you, reducing your strength, which is represented by the 1-10 of hearts. If you are at 1 strength and are damaged by an enemy, you lose. If you manage to stay alive, the game ends after two trips through the dungeon. After you've depleted the deck the first time, you shuffle the discard pile and play through the deck a second time. Compare your score to the scoring guide and see your destiny.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
