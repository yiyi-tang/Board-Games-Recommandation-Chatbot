I&rsquo;ll say it again. Meeple Microbes (squeeee!)&#10;&#10;In this nasty little 2-5 player game, your boss, Dr. Lillian Johannae has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of microbiology. She has discovered a new breed of extremely unstable, highly volatile microorganisms, BIOTIX&trade; (patent pending and pronounced &lsquo;biotics&rsquo;) that can uneasily coexist within a small system. Now she needs supporting data. But science can be a brutally competitive field.  What began as an innocent pursuit of discovery has quickly devolved into self-centered posturing and ruthless backstabbing among her lab personnel, all vying to have their name attached to the research paper, thereby rocketing them you into scientific superstardom.&#10;&#10;Your mission, carefully grow the largest culture of BIOTIX you can in your petri dish &ndash; and sabotage the work of others by pushing their microbe populations above their limit, causing them to explode and bio-react in all sorts of fun ways.  Game play is simple: on your turn, draw two BIOTIX from the specimen bag and place them, one at a time, either into your own dish for points or into an opponent&rsquo;s dish to try and force a bio-reaction to destroy their work.&#10;&#10;Each of the five BIOTIX species has a different trigger number and a unique bio-reaction when they &lsquo;go off&rsquo;. It may force you to trash the microbes, force microbes from your dish into the petri dishes of others, steal microbes or wipe out a species across the whole table. The BIOTIX are in a constant state of flux throughout the game, as is your score, because at the end of the day you gain points for the BIOTIX remaining in your dish, with the most volatile BIOTIX being worth the most points.&#10;&#10;The best score over 3 days of research determines the winner! Then try the advanced game, with Aggressive BIOTIX, a cancer-like organism that mimics the properties of the BIOTIX they replace in your dish &ndash; except they are worth negative points instead of their usual values.&#10;&#10;",

There are no lives or rounds. It is based on a pass/fail system. Either all cards are in the correct order and you win or one (or more) cards are wrong and you lose.&#10;There is also a team mode where you will compete against another team trying to get more cards correct than them.&#10;&#10;ito Rainbow comes with colorful gems and a timer to help assist with these new game modes. The deck still consists of cards numbered 1-100, but the card size is smaller than original ito. There are also different category cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In May 1942, the Japanese sought to capture Port Moresby on the south coast of New Guinea and interrupt communications between the United States and Australia. Such a move, they hoped, would bring the Americans to battle.&#10;&#10;The United States Navy needed no special inducement to fight its nation's enemies. Two American aircraft carriers met one small and two large Japanese carriers in the world's first battle between these powerful new warships. For the first time in naval history, a major battle was decided with no warship of either fleet even sighting an enemy ship directly. Aircraft were the new measure of naval power.&#10;&#10;Coral Sea is the new introductory boxed game for the Second World War at Sea series. It covers this key battle and is intended as a gateway for players new to the world's most popular series of naval boardgames. The Japanese player must establish new bases in New Guinea and at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands; the American player must stop them. Forces are very closely balanced, and victory will rest with the player who can best make use of his or her resources.&#10;&#10;The 22x17-inch operational map covers the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia as well as surrounding waters. Players maneuver their task forces on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.&#10;&#10;The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "INTRODUCTION&#10;&#10;Shibumi is the essence of beauty, or elegance in its minimal form. A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).&#10;&#10;Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then it&rsquo;s free.&#10;&#10;EDITIONS&#10;&#10;Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:&#10;&#10;- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.&#10;&#10;- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.&#10;&#10;- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resin balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.&#10;&#10;The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:&#10;&#10;- Light: around 15 grams each.&#10;- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.&#10;- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball &quot;clack&quot; they make when struck together.&#10;- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.&#10;&#10;They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.&#10;&#10;HISTORY&#10;&#10;Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.&#10;&#10;Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.&#10;&#10;GAMES&#10;&#10;This is the official geeklist of Shibumi games:&#10;&#10;Official Shibumi games list&#10;&#10;Please feel free to create your own game for this system!&#10;&#10;The names of these games all start with &lsquo;SP&rsquo; because they're Square Pyramidal games:&#10;&#10;",

Hideous invaders like Anthrax, Pertussis, Cholera, and the Black Death are running rampant inside the country&rsquo;s borders, attempting to murder innocents. The only hope for these helpless villagers is that the Apothecary Healers, their god-like saviors, will save them. Led by ancient warriors Penicillin, Cipro, and Tetracycline, the Apothecary Healers rush into battle, destroying wave after wave of attacker just in the knick of time. Yet it&rsquo;s not that simple: the Apothecary Healers have different specialties, and must be deployed in a sophisticated manner. And worse: the invaders learn quickly how to resist and evade the Apothecary powers, and some become even stronger when they are struck down.&#10;&#10;Healing Blade: Defenders of Soma&nbsp;immerses you in a fantasy realm that represents the real world struggle against infectious disease and bacterial resistance. It&rsquo;s a two player card game wherein one player attacks with bacteria, and the other defends with antibiotics. The game requires no prior knowledge of medicine, yet accurately reflects the current state of actual antibiotic use against the most common and most feared bacterial infections. Designed in a collaboration between hardcore gamers and practicing physicians, Defenders of Soma offers a complex strategic gameplay experience, while also increasing familiarity with today&rsquo;s medical quandries in the face of waning antibiotic effectiveness.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Toscana is an exciting game set in the competitive world of wine. You are the proud owner of a winery in Tuscany. You run its daily business: you hire workers, hold winetastings, make wine and trade it at the local Wine Stock Market. Indeed you will need a keen nose for business to cash big and become the favorite of the high-class wine circles. Toscana is a light, well-aged strategy game and tastes best when enjoyed among friends.&quot;&#10;&#10;Toscana is a game with short and clear rules, but with considerable depth of play and minimal random elements - so it suits gamers and non-gamers alike. It is a unique combination of stock market and area control, and the game introduces some good and trusted mechanics in a new blend.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Every round each player has 3 available actions: Hiring, Winemaking, and Trading. Players perform actions in turn, and the order in which they perform them has consequences.&#10;In the Hiring-action, the player hires a winemaker or a winemaster who can make wine, and he can hire the Lobbyist or Mr. Ros&eacute; who can influence the market place. In the winemaking-action the player makes wine and in the Trading-action he buys or sells it at the Wine Stock Market. The player with the most money in the end wins.&#10;Simple rules, simple structure, but loaded with tricky choices and difficult decisions.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;- 1 gameboard&#10;- (8 map pieces to optionally create a random map)&#10;- 4 lobbying tiles&#10;- 5 price markers&#10;&#10;Boxes (cubes) of:&#10;- 15 red wine, white wine, champagne, ros&eacute;&#10;- 20 water&#10;&#10;In each 5 player colors:&#10;- 1 winery board&#10;- 4 action coins&#10;- 5 workers&#10;- 3 winemasters&#10;- 7 winetasting tiles&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overwhelmed by the stress of the hooligan hootenanny that's overrunning the bustling town of Bandit Bluff, the resident deputy has up and left his post! Sheriff Croc Holliday is shuffling and hustling to find his next deputy. Looking to fill the vacancy, Croc has decided to put a pool of new recruits to work helping clean up some of Bandit Bluff's most wanted outlaws and will choose the most dedicated to be the new deputy! A little lying, some stealthy scheming, and the sense to know a good time to tell the truth might just help give a leg up over the rest of the herd. Who will out-law the other applicants to become the new deputy?&#10;&#10;OutLawed! is a social game of bluffing, truth-telling, and out-thinking your opponents. Each player has an identical set of eleven outlaw cards imagined as animals escaped from the zoo somewhere in the wild, wild west. Over a series of rounds, players take turns playing a card face down and making a claim about which character card they played. Players are free to tell the truth about the character played or to make a bold-faced lie! After players have played cards and made their claims, all the characters are revealed and each player assesses whether or not they have met their outlaw's &quot;apprehend if&quot; condition. Players who were successful add their outlaws to their jail pile while all other players place the card back in their hand. Lionel Manesworth, for example, can be captured only if you tell the truth. The Vixen Twins get nabbed when others are convinced to play the same card during the round. Lawman Croc Holliday will catch anybody who isn't on the up and up.&#10;&#10;Once a player fills up their jail, everyone compares their total reward value of apprehended cards to see who has earned the most rewards and gets to fill the vacant position as deputy of Bandit Bluff.&#10;&#10;",

The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game.

    "Description": "A valuable diamond &ndash; the Blue Lion &ndash; is on display at the Louvre and two thieves, Ars&egrave;ne Lupin and Lady X, both want to steal it.&#10;&#10;The Blue Lion is played using six tiles. Each tile shows an icon on both the front and back: Lupin, Lady X, the Blue Lion diamond, or a police inspector. Each combination of two icons occurs once. One player plays as Lupin, the other as Lady X. During set-up, these tiles are arranged in a row. In turn, the players take one tile and add it to the front or the back of the line, without looking at the back of the tile. After this set-up, the players try to score points by creating special combinations of tiles. Each turn, a player can perform one of three actions to change the line:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Switch two adjacent tiles.&#10;    Move a tile that is on one end of the line to the other end of the line.&#10;    Flip a tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;If this action results in a scoring combination of three tiles, the player scores points. The combinations are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sandwiching a tile showing the opponent by two tiles showing police inspectors: 1 point.&#10;    Sandwiching a tile showing the Blue Lion by two tiles showing the player's character: 2 points.&#10;    Creating a row of three tiles showing the Blue Lion: 3 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;After a combination has been formed, the middle tile of the combination is removed. The opposing player then adds it to one end of the line, although he cannot score points by doing so.&#10;&#10;The first player to score seven points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Your primary objective will be for your regime to survive from 1953 through the year 2030. Your secondary objective will be to maximize adherence to the Juche ideology by progressively achieving national self-reliance and global influence. Juche points are earned by advancing your nation&rsquo;s military strength, industrial production, nuclear weapons development, and assertively responding to events while minimizing lingering foreign debt.  Victory over your imperialist oppressors will require you to carefully manage scarce resources, strategically evaluate risk, and develop a keen awareness of the interaction between the world situation and your decisions.

Despite ominous setbacks in Spain, Napoleonic France before 1812 was at the height of its expansion. The continental system was holding, if imperfectly. Monarchs friendly to the Empire (several, members of Napoleon&rsquo;s immediate family), ruled in every capital of the continent. Only Britain remained unbowed. By the end of 1813 the story had changed dramatically&hellip;&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Eagles is a highly playable, action-packed card game set during the wars of 19th Century Europe. Two battles are featured: Borodino, the sanguinary clash before the gates of Moscow featured in Tolstoy&rsquo;s famous novel War and Peace, and Leipzig, the great &ldquo;Battle of Nations&rdquo; which marked the beginning of the end of the French Empire.&#10;&#10;Two smaller battles are included (Shevardino and Lieberwolkwitz), as well as two campaign games that cover multiple days of battle: September 5th-7th, 1812 at Borodino and October 14th-18th, 1813 at Leipzig. The game includes rules for cavalry charges, artillery bombardment, army morale and army commanders. Emphasis is placed on the role of reserves and the judicious  commitment of infantry and cavalry.

    "Description": "At the Abstract Academy, competition is fierce. You and your fellow art students vie for top marks with professors while trying to put your own spin on each assignment. The twist? Art school really broke the bank, so you must share a canvas with your rival classmates!&#10;&#10;Abstract Academy is played over three rounds by either two or four players, with the players completing a new canvas each round. At the start of the game, you lay out 2-3 scoring cards for each round, so you all know what you're trying to achieve to score. Additionally, at the start of each round, each player receives an inspiration card that shows a pattern they're trying to create on the canvas.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, players take turns playing canvas cards into a shared 4x4 play area, and in the four-player game, they play in a shared 5x5 area. Canvas cards are divided into quadrants, and each quadrant is colored yellow, red, or blue. The canvas grows organically as you all play cards, and the edges aren't fixed until you have four (or five) cards in a row or column. The edge of the canvas closest to you is your home row, and once the canvas is locked in size, no one else can play in your home row (unless all other spaces are filled).&#10;&#10;Once the canvas is filled, the two rows closest to you form your scoring zone. If the color patterns in your zone complete a scoring card better than the patterns in anyone else's zone, then you claim the scoring card. Additionally, if you've created the right pattern in your scoring zone, you can score your inspiration card. Whoever has the most points after three rounds is the star pupil of Abstract Academy and wins!&#10;&#10;Admin note: The logo of Flatout Games is shown on the English-language edition of Abstract Academy, but Flatout Games is not involved with the publication of this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quantum physics tells us &lsquo;the ability of quantum particles to occupy two states seemingly at once could be explained by both states co-existing in different universes&rsquo;. So when you wave goodbye to your ship in your universe, someone else waves goodbye to their ship in a different parallel universe. But what would happen if these neighboring universes, separated by the thinnest, gossamer barrier should somehow be breached and my ship sails into your world and searches for gold in competition to your ship? Play the game and find out...&#10;&#10;Ni&ntilde;a &amp; Pinta is a game of exploration of the New World where the great nations of Spain, England, France and Portugal send ships out to map the unknown and to bring home wealth to the Old World. This is a game where those ships will cross the divide and where no love is lost between Captains no matter which world it is! Explore, settle, fight if need be, and help your nation develop its Culture, Science, Religion and War-craft, to be the best in all worlds!&#10;&#10;No dice rolling in this Ragnar game, but plenty of tension as players can launch offensives with their Captains after first using them to flip land tiles thereby exploring each New World. Settlers are placed in explored lands to generate gold revenue. When combinations of terrain are occupied, towns and cities can be built. Meanwhile gold is used in the Old World to buy items to benefit further New World development or to accumulate the victory points generated by Culture, Science, Religion and War which themselves are meshed with what is taking place in the three New Worlds.&#10;&#10;This is a tightly knit puzzle that will have players pondering a multiplicity of decisions from start to finish. As much of the play is simultaneous and &quot;single-action&quot;, there is little downtime. The game has a good sense of growth worthy of its fascinating theme.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41&#10;&#10;is the first volume in a planned series of tactical level wargames in which players lead historical units into battle during Operation Barbarossa (June through October 1941). A Clash of Titans &ndash; the German Army and the Soviet Army fighting one another in a life and death struggle with infantry, artillery and armored units.&#10;&#10;Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41 is intentionally not intended to be a simulation, but rather it abstracts certain aspects in favor of playability and manageable game length to convey the feeling of comprehensive tactical combat situations.&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics and rules: &#10;&#10;The Assault Game System is designed to be completely modular and to accommodate a wide range of preferences for those playing it. There are different scenarios that the players can choose from, and within these scenarios, the Order of Battle can vary through the use of Formation Cards. In each scenario, rather than being given a set Order of Battle, the players will randomly select Formation Cards (infantry, artillery, or armor/vehicle) based on the side they are playing.&#10;&#10;The Formation Cards give the player a certain number and type of units available for the scenario. This ensures both variation and regular surprises, since the make-up of your forces will change from game to game. Your High Command has assigned you certain units to achieve a particular goal; you will have to adjust your individual tactics based on the available units and the objectives you have been given!&#10;&#10;Units in the Assault Game System are activated by Command points. Players receive a certain number of Command points, which are listed on the Formation cards. Before Command Phase, players secretly decide (behind a small screen or divider) which units to activate in the current turn. The Command point allowance lets the player activate approximately 75% of all available units. Thus, players must set priorities for the turn. Not only does this speed up the game play, since all units are not used in each turn, but it also makes for some exciting moments in the fight.&#10;&#10;In the Assault Game System, we have tried to minimize the counter stacking issue. With many game systems in the hobby, you can find towers of counters and markers on certain hexes of the game board. The overview is then quickly lost. In the Assault Game System, there is a clear limit of one unit counter per hex, with the exception being when units in are being transported. In addition, there is usually only one command and/or status marker.&#10;&#10;Regarding Command and Unit State Markers, we have devised a simple double-marker system: each marker is double-sided and after the end of the round, in the Organization Phase, the markers are simply flipped or removed depending on their color. This helps to speed up play.&#10;&#10;In general, Assault has attempted to emphasize game flow. The fact that Command Points are assigned to activate units in the Planning Phase accelerates the game. Since the units to be activated are already established before the Action Phase, there is less for the player to think about and fewer opportunities for AP to set in.&#10;&#10;The Dynamic Campaign System: &quot;Crossing the Narew&quot; &#10;&#10;&quot;It  is  the  end  of  June  1941,  when  the  German  Wehrmacht  begins  the  largest  land  operation  of  World  War II,  Operation  Barbarossa.  More  than  four  million  German  soldiers  are  in  their  starting  positions  on  the eastern  borders  of  the  German  Reich.  The  strategic  objective  is  the  capital  Moscow.  To  be  successful, the  operation  must  combine  strength  with  speed.  Key  to  this  will  be  seizing  control  the  bridges  that  lie between  the  German  Wehrmacht  and  its  ultimate  prize.&#10;&#10;In  this  campaign,  players  take  on  the  role  of  a  company  commander  in  order  to  achieve  victory  for  their own  faction.  Each  serving  in  the  ranks  of  one  of  the  two  divisions  that  took  part  historically,  the  German 7th  Infantry  Division  and  the  Soviet  13th  Rifle  Division. The  campaign  consists  of  four  connected  battles  and  covers  the  period  24-25  June  1941.  This  campaign is  in  line  with  historical  operations  for  crossing  the  Narew  River.  This  crossing  was    important  and  had  to be  achieved  quickly  in  order  to  close  the  town  of  Bialystok  and  the  connected  basin.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another aspect that sets Assault Red Horizons &rsquo;41 apart from the competition is our Dynamic Campaign Systemwhich will be included in the base game. We have designed a system whereby multiple scenarios can be linked with a variable starting set up for each subsequent scenario dependent upon how many of the victory conditions each side achieves. The players conduct operations, each commanding a company of troops from regiments that actually served on the Eastern Front. The campaign includes 8 different plots for a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

Alle malen gleichzeitig:&#10;Jeder sucht sich geheim einen Begriff auf seiner Karte aus und bringt ihn auf seinem abwischbaren Malboard zum Ausdruck.&#10;&#10;2. Sind alle fertig?&#10;Dann wird eine Vertausch-Karte aufgedeckt. Sie zeigt welche Teile eines jeden Kunstwerks vertauscht werden.&#10;&#10;3. Picassimo!&#10;Wer erkennt jetzt noch, was die Mitspieler gemalt haben?!&#10;&#10;&#10;     besonders abwechslungsreich: mit 900 Begriffen&#10;     von einfach bis verzwickt: 3 Schwierigkeitsstufen&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Fury at Midway&quot; has been originally published in Japanese by Bonsai Game as &ldquo;Midway: Turning the Tide in the Pacific&rdquo;. Changes in this Revolution Games version include making it a two map game, one for each player, which makes for an increased degree of hidden information regarding air strikes, damage, and combat air patrol. Four additional event cards were added to better cover the range of historical events of the battle. Anti-aircraft fire was reduced and rules for hitting the wrong carrier force were introduced. The map areas were expanded a hex row and the counter art was redone as well as many other small changes.&#10;&#10;The game system is primarily one of air operations. When to strike and with what planes is the primary question of the game. This is balanced by how you defend your own fleet and the island of Midway for the Americans or the invasion fleet for the Japanese. The Japanese have to either take Midway or win the carrier battle to win the game and having two objectives really challenges the Japanese player to make a good plan while the American situation is simpler but his forces are not as well trained and errors in navigation, strike coordination, escort, etc can take a toll. Surface forces are not shown in the game except in their effects in AAA, bombardment, or the slight chance of an abstract night surface battle. This is a simple yet pretty accurate version of Midway that was a lot of fun during testing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unlike most games, in Trench the 8x8 grid board is diamond-shaped; each player sets up his army on opposing sides of the &quot;trench&quot;, which divides the board into two. As hostilities between the armies commanded by the players grow, each attempts to seize control over the trench in order to take full advantage of its strategic potential, hoping thus to breach the opponent's defenses and capture the most valuable and important pieces.&#10;&#10;From the Soldiers to the General, each piece being subject to specific maneuvers, all will have to cooperate in order to be able to occupy the trench, invade the enemy's territory, and vanquish the foe.

These elections will name the nine representatives who will sit at the high council. Each party must carefully divide its soldiers, merchants and priests, to obtain the majority of votes during the elections. These elections follow each another in each of the areas of the city. The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes. Tyrus is thus a game of careful application of power, force and influence in order to affect the best outcome possible for your political party. Throughout the game you must try to carefully conserve your troops, because you never know when they will be needed.

    "Description": "&quot;En Garde is a semi-historical game/simulation representing many of the situations of an Errol Flynn movie set in the Seventeenth or Eighteenth Centuries. The game was originally devised as a fencing system, with background added to provide scenarios for the duels. After a time, it became apparent that the background was more fun than the duels, and En Garde, in its present form, was born.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In En Garde, a player finds himself born into and educated in a world where social climbing is a way of life, and status is a goal to be pursued even over money. It is a world inhabited by Cyrano, Roxanne, Scaranouche, Errol Flynn, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rhonda Fleming, Francois Villon, Constance, and, of course, D'Artagnan. There are people to be used, friends in high places to be cultivated, enemies to be humiliated, the Cardinal's Guard to be trounced, lackies to be abused, the hand of a fair damsel to be won, and the ear of the King to be gained. Come with us now, to those vibrant, bawdy days of Yore.&quot;&#10;&#10;A pencil and paper game in the style of an RPG, and with much of the detail expected in an RPG of the time, but with the &quot;adventure&quot; structure built into charts and tables so that no referee was required. Playable by any number of players.&#10;&#10;GDW published a second edition in 1977, which incorporated the errata sheet into the rules along with some non-substantive changes. In 1988, SFC Press (UK) printed a third edition which was reformatted and illustrated, but is essentially the same as the second edition.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.engarde.co.uk/index.html&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dice don't have legs, but in Dice Run they'll scamper as quickly as they can to get ahead of their fellow cubic cross-country runners. If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.&#10;&#10;Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.&#10;&#10;A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.&#10;&#10;After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players will take command of starships and work together to complete missions while defending the system from enemy fleets.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with their own starship with unique capabilities and basic crew. As you earn credits from completing missions, you'll be able to upgrade your ship and hire advanced Heroic crew members. Your crew are your dice and players will roll them, then assign them to their ship's stations in order to perform actions during combat or to complete missions.&#10;&#10;Ship to ship combat in Armada involves managing your crew and ship stations. As your ship takes damages, your stations become disabled and require repair actions by engineers. Your crew is also susceptible to injury and you'll take medic actions to revive them. Ships can be customized to your individual playstyle, whether you prefer to deal direct damage, or support teammates by disabling enemy shields and stations.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of the following phases:&#10;1) Planning: Players travel to nearby planets. Players may also repair and upgrade their ships or hire new crew members during this time.&#10;2) Encounter: Players combat enemy fleets or resolve missions (together or alone).&#10;3) Resolution: Event cards and hazard effects are resolved. Enemy reinforcements will also appear at this time.&#10;&#10;Once players have collected enough Data tokens, a final encounter is revealed. If they can defeat this final encounter, the players will win the game. What challenge faces our Captains? And who is behind all the terror?&#10;&#10;DSD6: Armada takes the gameplay of Deep Space D-6 and enhances it with ship upgrades, dice mitigation, missions, and co-operative gameplay- all while retaining the game's signature minimalist style.&#10;&#10;DSD6: Armada is not an expansion and does not require the original Deep Space D-6.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(3) With 3 words listed in 3 different colors, modelers can only mold according to the color of their dough. To start, each modeler places their ball of dough onto their plastic mat, which outlines start positions for their hands. Each modeler simultaneously tries to represent their word. The first team to shout out the correct word winsxed amount of dough from their opponent's model using a plastic extracting tool. The winning team can also reclaim a previously extracted amount. A team can lose for calling out a color coded word that another team member is modeling.  Once a team loses all of their dough, the game ends, and the team with the most dough wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs. If you have played tabletop miniature games before, Bushido falls into the &lsquo;skirmish game&rsquo; category: all miniatures represent individuals and your force consists of a small group of unique characters rather than a big faceless army. A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet. A typical game of Bushido takes between one and two hours to play - more if you are new to the game, less if you are a seasoned veteran.&#10;&#10;",

The game figures move along the lines and land on unoccupied intersections. After your move, you may place markers in an adjacent triangle &ndash; exactly as many markers as the number of steps you made and always only in one triangle.&#10;&#10;So far, this seems pretty easy to manage. But after that, you may exchange opposing markers for your own. This changes the majorities within the areas very quickly, and therefore you won't be able to determine the winner until shortly before the game's conclusion.&#10;&#10;In the end, only the majority of markers per area counts. Until then, players fight for each triangle, and ownership changes constantly.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, by building a network of influence in the royal court and by developing our character, we gain the ability to influence the actions in a given scenario - we take part in warfare, expansion of the kingdom, election of a new lords, fight against plague or flood, etc. In each turn of the game we draw 6 cards which mean what will happen in that turn. We receive a certain pool of resources, determine which action will be active and (in solo mode) what the consequences will be (that is, the actions of the automata). The game consists of 2 rounds, in each of which we deal 6 cards, at the end of the each 3 turns we also deal goal card conditions which determine the rewards and penalties for each achievement.&#10;&#10;The player wins if he meets certain scenario objectives-there are always several ways to win (e.g., scoring a certain amount of points or fulfilling a given objective like occupying the entire map or winning a certain number of battles). The player can also lose the game before all the turns are over if the conditions for losing specified in the scenario are met (e.g. the enemy occupies the entire map or attacks an undefended castle).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

GDW released a 2nd edition with minor changes in 1988, with a scenario book &quot;To the Sound of the Guns&quot; the same year.

He decided to hide them in his pyramid to prevent then from being stolen.  Unfortunately he is no longer sure where he has buried what.  With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;After chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players won&rsquo;t know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.&#10;&#10;Mixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:&#10;&#10;Sandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.&#10;&#10;Gift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.&#10;&#10;Risk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.&#10;&#10;Mirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.&#10;&#10;Desert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.  If he succeeds then he can take one of your search cards.  If he fails then you can take one of his.&#10;&#10;End Game: The Pharaoh is happy because all the treasure has been found.  As soon as this (Pile 3 only) card is turned over the game ends and the players total up the points that are shown on their search cards.&#10;&#10;After each player has found a treasure the board is rotated through 90 degrees in a chosen direction.&#10;&#10;Once all the search cards from the second pile are used up then pile &quot;3&quot; is used.  In this final round all the treasures on the search cards are worth 4 points and anyone who has not yet been particularly successful can, with brains and luck, overtake all the others.&#10;&#10;When a player finds a treasure chip that is not the one that he was looking for he is out of the game.  The remaining players continue.  Play continues until all the players are eliminated or the End Game Card is turned over.&#10;&#10;All the players total up the points that they have showing on the search cards they have collected.  The player with the greatest number of points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take on the role of four Valkyries who, tired of waiting for the last battle, the battle of the end times, have decided to take the lead and, supported by Freya, rush into battle to try to prevent Ragnar&ouml;k itself. Face mighty wyrms, cunning dark elves, draugr risen from the depths of Hel, tough frost giants and fearsome fire demons. Defeat them and maybe you will win the favour of the gods and they will aid you in your quest. For Asgard!&#10;&#10;Valkyries is presented as a game book. Each chapter introduces new rules and a Battleground to play them on. Throughout the first three chapters you will learn the rules progressively, moving around the Battlefield, eliminating as many enemies as you can, playing your cards as wisely as you can. Compete with your sister warriors to see who should lead the team. Once you've mastered the basics, you can play Full Mode on any isolated Battlefield, venture into the Vanaheim campaign, chronicled in the last chapter, or create your own scenarios and campaigns.&#10;&#10;The modularity of the game makes it accessible for casual players or a challenge for the most demanding players, as well as making it highly replayable. Quick games, long campaigns, rule combinations... Everything is available to players in a simple and easy to configure way.

Shuffle the 27 path tiles and 10 dragon tiles together.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a tile. If it's a dragon tile, she places it on the first empty space on the dragon path; if a path tile, she places it at the end of a path already on the board. (The first path tile is placed in the upper-left square of the game board, while the treasure is below the lower-right square.) If the path is placed on a key, the players claim the key. If the path crosses the candies, the players can place one dragon tile on the candies, delaying the dragon on its way to the treasure.&#10;&#10;Once the players have collected three keys, they can then lay a tile on the treasure chest &mdash; and if they reach the treasure before the dragon does, they win!&#10;&#10;",

The player can take the leftmost card for free; if they want a different card, they must place a wood cube on each card they skip. (If you take a card with cubes on it, add them to your supply for possible use later.)&#10;&#10;&#10;    If you pick up a wood card, add it to your hand.&#10;    If you pick up a garbage card, immediately discard a garbage removal card or else place the garbage in your scored dam pile.&#10;    If you pick up garbage removal, add it to your hand; you can use it to remove garbage drawn later, or you can use it in a dam.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you build a dam, you lay down wood cards of all different types, with each wood card having a value of 1-3.

Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player&rsquo;s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their &ldquo;favorite color&rdquo; and are rewarded points for flowers.&#10;&#10;Each player calculates their score as follows:&#10;3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. &#10;2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion.&#10;1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color.&#10;&#10;From The Box: Each player must use the rhythm of nature to plant seeds and grow flowers in order to collect the most beautiful bouquet.

Use these structures and resources to build up your small village into a powerful economic force.&#10;&#10;Count of Nine is played with 9 double-sided cards containing up to 2 resources and up to 2 structures on each side of the card.  There is no board, no dice, no cubes, no meeples, just the 9 cards, so it makes a great travel game.&#10;&#10;The goal is to score the most victory points in a match, which is made up of 2 separate games.&#10;&#10;In each game, first select one of the 5 &quot;high structures&quot; that will be your goal of the game.  The 5 high structures are: Castle, Cathedral, Monument, Harbour, and Town Square.&#10;&#10;Then, play through the deck of the remaining cards (called a round) and use resources on adjacent cards, and resources provided by already built structures to build additional structures.  Play multiple rounds to get everything you need to build your selected high structure.  Continue playing to accumulate additional victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory points are awarded several ways:&#10;- Victory points marked on some of the structure cards&#10;- 1 victory point for each different structure built&#10;- 2 victory points for each pair of identical structures built&#10;- 5 victory points is a second &quot;high structure&quot; is built&#10;&#10;Final score for each game is total victory points minus the number of rounds played.  Final score for the match is the total of both games.&#10;&#10;&#10;Count of Nine was created for the 2018-19 Card Nanogame Print and Play Contest.&#10;&#10;Released in the August 2019 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.&#10;&#10;&#10;Structure art from the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493&#10;&#10;",

Murat&rsquo;s early gains were soon forfeit against the two advancing Austrian corps, but these two corps become separated by the Apennine Mountains. Like Napoleon&rsquo;s Waterloo campaign, Murat hoped to defeat each corps in turn before they could reunite. One player commands the Neapolitan army under King Joachim Murat; the other player commands the Austrian army under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Freidrich Baron Bianchi.&#10;&#10;Waterloo 20, 3rd Edition from Joseph Miranda is a game based on the Waterloo campaign of 15-18 June 1815. One player commands the French army, taking the role of the returning Emperor Napoleon. The other player assumes both the roles of Wellington for the Anglo-Dutch forces, and Bl&uuml;cher for the Prussian forces, respectively.&#10;&#10;Two months after returning to France, Napoleon had an army of 280,000 men and was mobilizing half as many again for the next two months, but he was set upon by Allied coalition armies of nearly 1,000,000 soldiers who were preparing to move against France. The British (110,000 men) and Prussians (120,000 men) were closest, in Belgium, and Napoleon struck first before their numbers could be combined against him. With speed and surprise, he invaded Belgium with fully 125,000 men in a bid to defeat each of these armies in turn before they could unite.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Traces of Hubris is a two-player game that simulates the German Case Blue (Fall Blau) summer offensive in southern Russia during the second half of 1942. The goal was to &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; the Volga at Stalingrad and to capture the Caucasus oil fields.&#10;&#10;The Axis player must eliminate the Soviet forces and break their defense lines in order to reach his objectives. The Soviet player must do everything to defend the homeland, and hold until he gets a chance to strike back. The game uses the same core mechanics as Traces of War.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;     Game Turn: 2 weeks / 1 month&#10;     Hex: 22.5 kilometers&#10;     Units: Divisions and Corps&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-low&#10;Players: 1 or 2 Players&#10;Playing Time: 3-6 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one opaque cup for game play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Munchkin Axe Cop is a simple, lightweight multiplayer &quot;take that&quot; style card game. Cards represent character abilities, items, monsters to fight, and cards to make monsters harder to defeat (for monsters other players are fighting) or easier to defeat (for you). Every time you defeat a monster, you go up a level. The first player to level 10 wins.&#10;&#10;This is a core set for Steve Jackson's Munchkin game, based on the hit webcomic by Ethan Nicolle (age 29) and his brother Malachai (age 6). It can be combined with other games in the series.&#10;&#10;The game doesn't have any new mechanics and should be easy to learn for anyone who's played one of the other Munchkin games. Hirelings are included and are called allies. There are four classes: Cop, Man, Soldier, and Warrior (which is identical to the class of the same name in fantasy Munchkin). This set also has powers; there are seven of them with two cards each, for a total of 14 cards. The mechanics of powers are exactly the same as in the other Munchkin sets that have them.&#10;&#10;Several Santa monsters are included, as well as two new monster categories, Alien and Robot, which currently aren't recognized in any of the other Munchkin games.&#10;&#10;It's not necessary to know anything about the Axe Cop webcomic in order to enjoy this set.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the year 325 and it's a pretty chill time to be a Christian.&#10;&#10;Not only has it been a hot minute since they were forced to renounce their faith on pain of death, but the emperor Constantine has really leaned into it, hoping it will unite the often fractured Roman Empire. So, the big guy isn&rsquo;t super-thrilled when bishops immediately get into nit-picky, esoteric arguments that John Quintus Romanus doesn&rsquo;t give two flips about. He demands that the bishops gather together in the city of Nicaea to come to an accord. He doesn&rsquo;t really care what these nerds decide, so long as they decide something.&#10;&#10;This gathering is given irreverent treatment by Amabel Holland in this game for four, five, or six players. Like Constantine, it treats the theological positions argued at the first ecumenical council as fungible. Whether a position ends up accepted orthodoxy or damnable heresy has nothing to do with theology and everything to do with politics - with personal ambition, petty rivalries, and social dynamics. This is a sort of shared incentives game, in which each player commits to one of two sides in various theological disputes; guess which one the majority will go with and you&rsquo;ll score points. Score the most points, and you&rsquo;ll win the game.&#10;&#10;Unless the player with the fewest points has accumulated the most political influence. That player is powerful enough to splinter the church, provoking a schism and stealing the win. To prevent this, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that someone that powerful isn&rsquo;t left out in the cold during the final settlement.&#10;&#10;At once a slick tableau-building game and a study in emergent alliances, Nicaea gives a rude but affectionate raspberry to what was perhaps the most pivotal event in the history of the early church.&#10;&#10;",
