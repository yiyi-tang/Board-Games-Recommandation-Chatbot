    "Description": "Quarterback King is a board game which unites the sport of football and the game of chess into a fun, strategic game for two players. The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.&#10;&#10;Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.&#10;&#10;Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.&#10;&#10;Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.&#10;&#10;Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.&#10;&#10;This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by the old Getter Robo anime series, Getto Rocket is a 2-player combination DIY board game  that plays very simmilar to Chess with a slight Stratego element to it. The rules and board are printed out from a PDF (the board and 10 pieces may be purchased from the game creator.) The board is a 5 wide by 6 tall illustrated grid of squares depicting the land the two sides are battling over. Each side has 5 colourfull rocket pieces each. 3 Rockets which can move 1 space forward back or sideways, 1 Pin which can move 1 space diagonal, and 1 Bomb which is stationary. These are arranged in 1-2 rows at opposite sides of the board. Each player chooses a &quot;home base&quot; and the objective is to either eliminate all of your opponent's pieces, or take and hold the enemy home base for 3 consecutive turns. Any piece can eliminate any other piece by attacking first. Both are removed if the Bomb is attacked.&#10;The game also comes with 4 different Modifier Cards, 2 of which are randomly dealt each player at the start of the game. At any you may play one of your cards to the board so that it covers any two spaces that you either occupy or are currently free. Each card effects pieces differently. Such as allowing the Rocket to move diagonally while on those two spaces.&#10;Additionally about 1 in 10 games are packed with a special Shifter piece that is randomly swapped for one of the other pieces. The Shifter can move in any direction, can occupy the same space as another friendly unit, and can transport those friendly units with it.&#10;&#10;",

The player must proceed with the explosions until there is no more hexagon with 3 pawns or more, or until there are no more pawns from the opponent (he has won in this case!).&#10;&#10;&#10;     The player must start with one of the hexagons having the most pawns on it (it is possible that there are 4 pawns on the same hexagon).&#10;     After each explosion, if there are still possible explosions and pawns from the opponent, go back to step 1!&#10;&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;The game ends when a player has no pawns left on the board.

    "Description": "The game contains 12 sets of four tiles showing items belonging to a particular profession. The cards are color-coded, so there is a blue, a red, a yellow and a green tile for each profession. &#10;One color is picked out and the 12 tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player picks one of these. &#10;Then players take turns flipping open a tile from the draw stack. If the tile belongs together with that player's first tile, he/she can keep it. Otherwise it is openly discarded. The next player can take it if he/she needs it, then draw a new tile as usual. When a player thinks he/she has 4 matching tiles, the tiles are placed on top of a large plastic cube. A mirror shows the backside of the tiles - if these form a picture of the profession, the player keeps the set. &#10;When all sets have been distributed, the player with most sets is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is themed for the a German children's TV show called &quot;Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten&quot;&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

Claim - The players attempt to claim older pets that the pet shops are giving away by bidding. Pet shops give away older pets to the first customer that wants them. However if more than one customer wants to claim the same pet, they will decide to keep the pet to avoid a confrontation. However, if one of the claimants can provide a more conducive shelter for the pet, he will be given the pet during a confrontation. This phase will recur until all the pets in the shops are given away or the players all decide to stop claiming pets.&#10;4. Birth - The players' pets give birth to new born pets.&#10;&#10;Play continues through the 4 phases in each round recurrently until the deck runs out.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players tally the number of pets they have as well as check who has the most shelters for each type of the pet.

The players with the most pets for each pet type gains a bonus (gains more pets of that type). After applying the penalties and bonuses, the player with the most pets win.&#10;&#10;",

During the course of the rounds, players buy and sell stocks, which impacts the price.  Just remember that every stock you sell decreases the stock value... but every company's first stock you buy increases the value. If one particular stock in sector/industry raises high enough in value, market bubble follows with raising other stocks as well... but beware of market crashes!&#10;&#10;Therefore - for being successful in &quot;Smart Investor&quot; you have to know when to buy, when to sell and when to do nothing more but wait.

The hero and shaman are short range pieces easily as powerful as the rook on a 10x10. These two inclusive compound pieces may step one and/or jump 2 squares, either or both, in either order, changing direction between step and leap if desired, with the hero moving orthogonally and the shaman diagonally. The final piece in the game is a war elephant, the equivalent of an unchained padwar from Jetan, a piece that may move 1 or 2 squares diagonally, changing direction if desired between the first and second steps. The combination of strong and weak pieces, of different ranges and abilities, allows a strategically and tactically rich game with piece balance and variety. The opposed pairs of hero vs rook and shaman vs war elephant provide an intricate series of checks and balances between the pieces.&#10;&#10;",

That's right, the flattening of the World Trade Center nine years ago was part of a broader Islamofacist terror plot designed to circumvent local planning laws and lower the notoriously expensive NYC ground rent at the same time. Why? So that the entirety of downtown Manhattan can be turned into the world's biggest mosque - a project they refer to as The Giant Mosqtapus.

The French eventually gather around 190,000 men, against 350,000. It is a succession of ferocious and quite independent battles. The Allied plan, although inelegant, proved to be successful as the odds allowed them to attack everywhere and keep the advantage. Even though using the interior lines, Napoleon was rarely in a position to take a serious strategic advantage while winning almost every of these battles because a 1:2 odd can not lead to a decisive victory against determined enemies.&#10;&#10;However, you are now in charge of the army, and things can turn very different...&#10;&#10;&quot;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&quot; is a series of simulation games using a standard rules system and a set of exclusive rules specific to each battle. These particular rules include an historical commentary and the victory conditions for each scenario. &#10;The aim of this system is to refight at the regimental scale the numerous battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. It uses a map on which the players move counters representing the combat units involved in these battles.&#10;&#10;",

Carrom gradually lost popularity, but is still played in Hikone, Shiga. In Hikone, carrom is called karomu (&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#160;?) and many homes have their own carrom boards and use derivative rules.

Nevertheless, the manipulations of Hanse &quot;The Fox&quot; Davion and the bitter rivalry of two Kurita Military District Commanders engulfed Galtor in one of the largest battles in recent memory.&#10;&#10;Davion planned to lure several Kurita regiments onto Galtor with rumors of a newly discovered Star League cache and then ambush the Kurita forces with his own secret reinforcements. Everything went according to plan until five regiments landed and Davion engineers discovered a real Star League installation. Soon Davion units were fighting for their very existence.&#10;&#10;This BattleForce 1 scenario set includes a detailed history of the three-month campaign, orders of battle for the units involved and eight scenarios that recreate the pivotal battles.&#10;&#10;",

In April 3039, forces of Houses Davion and Steiner moved to slay an apparently weakened Dragon only to find the fury of teeth and claws.&#10;&#10;The first in a new series, the Historicals: War of 3039 campaign sourcebook details the action involving every line unit in this pivotal war.

Yet when a real Star League cache is found, all bets are off and Davion forces are fighting for their lives, while attempting to secure the ancient ruins that could hold ancient treasures!&#10;&#10;Historical Turning Points: Galtor extracts the sourcebook details from the classic Galtor Campaign scenario book and represents it in the phenomenally successful Jihad Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when centuries of Succession Wars have honed an animosity to a razor's edge between the Great Houses of Davion and Kurita! This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Galtor, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion.

Meratoo is the hapless spider who must cross the web of Attercop. Meratoo, must gently feel his way across the web before being caught. Hidden, Attercop stalks - probing, deceiving, sneaking for her prey.&#10;&#10;It's devious, it's cunning, it's sneaking good fun !&#10;&#10;How the game is played, from game designer :-&#10;&#10;Attercop is a game for two players. One player is Attercop, a spider with a reputation for cunning, and a lady with an appetite. The other is Meratoo, a little spider nervously trying to cross her web. The aim of the game is for Meratoo to make his way from one side of the web to the other, whilst Attercop tries to catch him.&#10;&#10;The web consists of 44 connected points, each covered by a &quot;blank&quot; tile.  Meratoo travels from blank tile to blank tile, gently feeling his way accross the Web trying to avoid running into Attercop. Meanwhile, Attercop has a number of tiles to represent her legs, which tease the web and try to bluff the Meratoo player into her grasp, by being able the change the position of the tiles on the web. Here's the catch: the Attercop tiles remain face-down on the web, undistinguishable from the blank tiles, and they can be moved along with the rest of the web tiles. This is how Attercop probes her way around the web.&#10;&#10;For Attercop the game is all about bluffing and enticing Meratoo into her grasp. For Meratoo it is all about staying alert, testing the web and calling Attercop's bluff. The game is fun to play, generates lots of laughs , is a light-hearted and quick game, and is great for both kids and adults.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Combat Commander: Battle Pack #4 - New Guinea is the fourth themed collection of scenarios for use with the Combat Commander series of games. The theme of this fourth Battle Pack shifts to the actions in New Guinea from January 1942 through July 1944, following the major campaign phases with characteristic actions. CC -New Guinea features fourteen new scenarios printed on cardstock as well as six new maps.&#10; Rules relevant to the characteristic fighting in the coastal jungle versus the highlands are included as needed for each scenario, without the need of an additional rule booklet. A number of unusual, creative special scenario rules cover the unique situations represented, including Air Supply, Barge Landing, Canebreak and Coastal Jungle, Emplaced M3 Tanks, Joint Allied Operations including the Papuan Infantry Battalion, Patrol Dogs, Swamp Holes and Swamp Forest.&#10;&#10;The new maps depict specific locations in New Guinea: the beachhead at the base of Mt Vulcan across from Rabaul, the village of Oivi, a high-mountain ridge overlooking Eora Creek, a strongpoint on the Soputa-Sanananda Road, the edge of the airstrip at Wau, and one of the crossings of the Driniumor River near the Afua Trail.&#10;&#10;&#10;The scenarios included in CC&ndash;New Guinea are:&#10;&#10;*      M1 &ndash; &ldquo;Rabaul Rousers&rdquo; set at the base of Mt Vulcan on Simpson Bay across from the town of Rabaul, with a Japanese barge landing against Australian defenses at night, 23 January 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M2 &ndash; &ldquo;The Gloomy Forest&rdquo; set at the village of Oivi, with Australians and Papuans of Maroubra Force facing the rapidly moving Yokohama Advance Party, 26 July 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M3 &ndash; &ldquo;Rebuked at Rabi&rdquo;, set at Milne Bay, with an SNLF attack against Australian units, 3 September 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M4 &ndash; &ldquo;Templeton&rsquo;s Crossing&rdquo; set at a heavily-contested crossing of Eora Creek high in the Stanleys, 17 October 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M5 &ndash; &ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Bluff&rdquo; set along one of the high ridges above the treacherous Eora Creek, with intermingled combatants, 28 October 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M6 &ndash; &ldquo;Breakout&rdquo; set at Gorari after the fall of Kokoda to the Australians, with a desperate banzai action, 11 November 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M7 &ndash; &ldquo;The Butcher&rsquo;s Bill&rdquo; set on the Soputa-Sanananda Road, with US forces entering the conflict in horrific swamp forest, 10 December 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M8 &ndash; &ldquo;Closing Outer Camp&rdquo; set at Buna station, with Australian units using M3 tanks to eradicate the defenders, 18 December 1942;&#10;&#10;*      M9 &ndash; &ldquo;Wau Me Worry&rdquo; set at the Wau air strip (with active landing operations during the action), with Australian defenders facing a desperate attack, 31 January 1943;&#10;&#10;*      M10 &ndash; &ldquo;Bulolo River Bridge&rdquo; set outside the outpost at Wau, with patrols of both sides (including Japanese Patrol Dogs) attempting to use the same bridge at cross-purposes, 30 January 1943;&#10;&#10;*      M11 &ndash; &ldquo;Shattered Bobdubi&rdquo; set during the advance upon Salamua, with Australian units driving upon a Japanese base camp set in the kunai-covered heights of the interior, 30 June 1943;&#10;&#10;*      M12 &ndash; &ldquo;Scarlet Beach&rdquo; set at the mouth of the Song River near Finschhafen, with a Japanese barge landing at night against combined Australian and US defenders, 17 October 1943;&#10;&#10;*      M13 &ndash; &ldquo;Bad Dreams&rdquo; set on the Driniumor River, featuring the heroic stand of an unknown US BAR operator facing a hastily prepared Japanese night charge, 10 July 1944; and&#10;&#10;*      M14 &ndash; &ldquo;Encirclement of Troop C&rdquo; set on the Driniumor River, featuring a Troop of US Cavalry trying to stave off being surrounded by Japanese units that had surprised them by walking casually into their positions, 21 July 1944.&#10;&#10;NOTE: CC&ndash;New Guinea is not a complete game and requires ownership of Combat Commander: Pacific to play.&#10;&#10;Designed by John Foley&#10;&#10;Developed by Kai Jensen&#10;&#10;Additional scenario designs in this fourth Pack are courtesy of John Butterfield, Bryan Collars, Mark Herman, Andrew Maly and Volko Ruhnke.&#10;&#10;",

Gunnery uses a fire effect table with no to hit rolls. Torpedo attacks also use a simple system. The game effects represent those significant hits which cripple a ship&rsquo;s ability to fight effectively. The ground scale of 1 cm to 500 yards (4 cm to the nautical mile) and time scale of 1 turn to 15 minutes enable realistic movement and gun ranges, combined with the problems of locating and identifying the enemy.&#10;&#10;The system incorporates national skill ratings for commanders and crew, effects of weather and night, radar, hidden movement and spotting, carrier and air operations.&#10;&#10;The rules come complete with 700+ ships and aircraft covering the era from 1890 through to 1945.&#10;&#10;(Publishers Description)&#10;&#10;",

But the task is not easy because Jack Sparrow can use it&acute;s special barnacle only a few times and even so he cannot see everything!&#10;&#10;It is a beautiful game, has lots of chits, a special barnacle with red lenses, a mask and a decent board with a panel in between.&#10;&#10;The player Davy Jones must hide dragons, giant squids, pirate ships, two empty islands, one island with an ark and one island with keys. Jack Sparrow must move his ship, one square at a time, trying to find out the ark and the keys. Each time Jack reaches a monster, the skull marker move one space and he can take a look at the other board with the barnacle. If he reaches a pirate ship he can fight or flee. If he chooses to run, the skull marker move one space. If he chooses to fight he must throw a special dice. If the value is higher than the pirate, he defeats it, if it is lower or equal, he looses a coin. &#10;Jack wins the game if he finds the ark and the keys. Davy Jones wins the game if Jack runs out of coins or if the skull marker reaches ten.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players represent wealthy families in one of the most thriving European cities of the 16th century: Antverpia (=Antwerp in Belgium). They gain wealth by shipping sugar, cloth and beer overseas, construct new buildings, and help building the 6 most important churches of the city by granting donations to them. But it is not the wealthiest family who will win the game, instead it will be the family who has donated most wisely to the churches. &#10;This expansion of the game Hamburgum offers not only a different map with a new allocation of buildings, but also different rules for the donations and visiting the church space on the rondel. Other than in original Hamburgum, church districts do not exist, all donations have to be taken in a certain order, a church tax is implemented on the rondel, and ships give more victory points. The board uses historical views taken from original maps of the 16th century and is printed from both sides: Antverpia on the one side, and a new map of Hamburgum on the other.  &#10;New and beautifully illustrated church donations will come with the expansion, printed on thick cardboard. Other than that, the game material from Hamburgum should be used (real bricks, metal bells, coins etc.).&#10;&#10;",

You may even come across polar bears, boars or the mysterious and deadly Smoke Monster.&#10;As well as being uniquely structured to encompass the events of 6 seasons of LOST, this game is very heavy on theme and detail.&#10;The sheer depth of the game, and the large number of Encounter cards, ensures that even after several plays there will still be more surprises left for you.&#10;So step aboard Flight 815 and be prepared to begin the ultimate LOST experience...&#10;&#10;A summary of play&#10;You will start the game rolling a die and moving around the outer track of the Island Game Board, visiting locations such as the Barracks, the Cockpit section, the Black Rock and the Hatch. When rolling the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; symbol you do not move and should instead draw one of your Flash-backwards card (later in the game Flash-forwards and Flash-sideways cards are used). Your &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; cards usually instruct you to increase or decrease your Skill points or gain Fate points.&#10;&#10;When you visit certain locations, and have encounters, the marker on the story track will be steadily advanced. When the story track reaches certain points, changes will be made to the game; for example the Encounter Deck being used may change to another one, or certain Friends counters may become de-activated.&#10;The story track will also instruct you and the other players to move to one of the separate game boards or a different game track on the main board.&#10;&#10;As you progress through the various stages of the game, the Encounter decks will continually change so that you meet people and find items from the different seasons of the LOST saga. Also your chosen character&rsquo;s skill points will gradually improve making future challenges easier, and you will gain all important Fate points.&#10;&#10;You will receive Mystery Counters as rewards. Each of the various mysteries depicted (for example Jacob, the Numbers) is made up of a set of 5 cards. If you can collect a complete set, they can be traded in for additional Fate points.&#10;&#10;Eventually the action will move to the centre track on the game board where one of the players will be chosen to succeed Jacob. The end game will then commence. Along with the other players you must defeat the Man in Black and play the Desmond card at the Light Source space in order to save the island and win the game. Whichever player has the most Fate points at this point is declared the winner, but should your fail and allow the Man in Black to survive, all players lose the game.&#10;&#10;LOST &lsquo;The End&rsquo; is a Print and Play board game from MM Games, for 2 to 4 players, due for release in November 2010.&#10;It takes on average between 2 to 3 hours to complete a game.&#10;&#10;This game is non-profit making and is a fan-made project intended for the entertainment of fans of the the TV series LOST. No copyright infringement is intended.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A discard game for 2 players, using two standard decks, usually with identical backs but this is not strictly necessary.&#10;&#10;Prepare two packs (to be played alternately in rounds) by discarding all Aces, separating into red and black piles and then swapping one red and black nine over, which becomes the [b]Comet[/b] in each pack.&#10;&#10;Shuffle one pack and deal 18 to each player, discarding the remaining 12. Play can now begin.&#10;&#10;The starting player places a card of his choosing in the middle. This can be one or more of the same value. The other player must now put a card or cards of one greater value (i.e. 6s on 5s, Js on 10s, all cards must be the same rank); if they are unable to do so there is a 'stop'. As Kings are high (no Aces), a King will also force a stop. At which point the player who played last starts the run again with any card(s) of their choice.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to get rid of your cards, and scoring is&#10;accumulative, with the winner in each round scoring the total number of pips in his opponent's hand (court cards score 10).&#10;&#10;Playing the comet&#10;&#10;The comet is a wild card and can be played with a group or on its own. It always forces a stop.&#10;&#10;If a player wins the round and his opponent still holds the comet, the winning player scores double (the comet will therefore count as 18 points).&#10;&#10;If a player wins by playing the comet, he scores double also. If however a player wins the round by playing the comet as a 9, his score is quadrupled.&#10;&#10;[Rules taken from &quot;The complete Book of Card Games&quot; published by Hamlyn]&#10;&#10;",

Will the crab pots be chock full of crab or will they be empty?&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, fishing for crab isn't just about setting and retrieving crab pots.
