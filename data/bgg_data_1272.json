Alice behaves poorly! She enters somebody's house and eats their cookies without permission, and goes into another house and drinks without permission too! She ruins a tea party, disturbs the Queen's cricket match, and so on!&#10;&#10;Finally, Alice promised to leave, but only if she was given lots of souvenirs to take home.&#10;&#10;In the game, the players use white sheep to collect souvenirs for Alice. The game is a semi-co-operative game, with players working together to get Alice out, but also competing to provide the most popular souvenirs.&#10;&#10;As Alice moves around, different souvenir tokens appear on the game board. Players place their sheep tiles adjacent to the tokens they want to collect. The highest value sheep will take the token, using a 'butting' mechanism, like  Hols der Geier, with equal values cancelling out. Players also have black sheep, which can trump the white sheep of equal value.&#10;&#10;The best souvenirs score the most points, but Alice is fickle and her tastes change as she progresses along the path. The souvenirs are ranked, but the order of their rank changes during the game.&#10;&#10;When she finally reaches the gate, the game ends. Once the final score is determined, players turn up the ending cards, and discover what kind of end the Land Of Sheep has.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each turn progresses through 4 phases: the Seasonal Phase, Construction Phase, Action Phase, and End Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Seasonal Phase, players take different actions depending on the season marked on the Season Board. In Spring, players gain a free card. In Summer, players can build for free. In Fall, players gain free resource points. And in Winter, players reduce the resource points or hurt the buildings of unprotected players.&#10;&#10;In the Construction Phase, buildings that are partially built will progress on their own. Players may also spend a resource point to help one building along. In the Action Phase, players will play Action Cards. Some cards can only be played in certain seasons or when players have completed certain buildings. If no player has reached a victory condition in the End Phase, players continue with the next season.&#10;&#10;Choose your cards wisely as you decide your path to victory!&#10;&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Implo is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The recommended board sizes are between 6&times;6 and 10&times;10 points. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones and markers of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A group is a piece along with all other pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between identical adjacent pieces. Thus, all pieces in a group are the same type (stone or marker) and color (black or white).&#10;&#10;The size of a group is the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;Likewise, a territory is an empty point along with all other points one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent empty points.&#10;&#10;A patch is a territory including at most four points.&#10;&#10;The owner of a patch is the player with the biggest group of stones adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of both colors are the same size, the owner of the patch is the opponent of the player who placed the last stone on the board.&#10;&#10;To resolve a patch is to place a marker of its owner's color on each of its points and to remove the biggest group of stones which is adjacent to the patch and owned by the same player as the patch. If several such groups are tied for biggest, the player who is resolving the patch removes, among those, one of their choosing. If there are no groups of stones adjacent to the patch, no group is removed. Note the player resolving the patch need not be the owner of the patch.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform these actions in order:&#10;&#10;1. Place a stone of your color on an empty point of the board.&#10;&#10;2. Resolve any single patch on the board.&#10;&#10;3. Repeat the previous step until no patches remain. Note the order of resolving matters, and resolving a patch may create new patches.&#10;&#10;If, at the end of a player's turn, there are no empty points on the board, the game ends. The winner is the player with more groups of markers of the largest size of which there is an unequal number of black and white groups of markers. If there is a tie, whoever has more stones on the board wins. If this is also tied (only possible on even-sized boards), whoever made the last move loses.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A smooth talking scoundrel and gambler, Lando Calrissian likes to keep his allegiance close to his chest. But when the chips are down and the galaxy is at stake, he sides with the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance. From captain of the Millennium Falcon to Administrator of Cloud City, no leadership role Calrissian has taken on is as important as Rebel general and he brings all this experience to the battles of Star Wars: Legion.&#10;&#10;This expansion contains everything you need to add Lando Calrissian as a commander of your Rebel armies, beginning with a beautifully sculpted, unpainted hard plastic miniature that reflects Calrissian&rsquo;s unique sense of style. Not only will you find three different options for his signature cape, you&rsquo;ll also be able to choose between two facial expressions and whether or not Calrissian appears reaching for his X-8 Night Sniper Pistol in its holster or has it at the ready.&#10;&#10;While the miniature gives Calrissian a unique presence on the battlefield, other components, like his unit card and three signature command cards, represent his history as a gambler and his tendency to take high stakes risks. Finally, Lando Calrissian isn&rsquo;t one to enter a fight unprepared, and this expansion also includes six upgrade cards that give him access to the gear and training he needs to take on any challenge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Agent Kallus is one of the ISB's most effective agents, using his cunning and combat prowess to snuff out the spark of rebellion at its source.&#10;&#10;This expansion invites you to put this ruthless agent in command of your Imperial army, beginning with a highly customizable, unpainted hard plastic Agent Kallus miniature that reflects his status as a ruthless Imperial agent. In addition to choosing between two facial expressions for your miniature, you'll also be able to assemble your Agent Kallus with the trademark Imperial Security Bureau helmet or with no helmet at all. Finally, Agent Kallus is deadly up close and with a blaster and you can choose whether he appears with his signature J-19 Bo-Rifle in its blaster or staff forms.&#10;&#10;While these features project Kallus' status as a relentless ISB agent, his unit card clearly outlines all of his abilities and his three signature command cards reflect his capacity to shape your strategy. Despite all of his skills, Kallus is still susceptible to sympathizing with his enemies, a weakness that is reflected in Flaw card included with this expansion. Finally, Agent Kallus carefully calculates what he'll need for each battle and seven upgrade cards invite you to choose the gear and training that best fits your battle plan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We were very glad to see him. We were to form a box round Mokpalin, we being in the S.W. corner.&rdquo; &ndash;Officer of the 8th Burma Rifles about the battle for the Sittang Bridge.&#10;&#10;The situation for the Allies in Burma was increasingly desperate following the Japanese invasion that began in December 1941. After nearly a month of fighting the British Dominion forces were in full retreat, hoping to meet with reinforcements being rushed to the theater and to regroup behind the Sittang River. Key to this goal was the successful withdrawal of the Indian 17th Division. That division had been engaged in a running fight with the Japanese 33rd (214th and 215th Regiments) and 55th (143rd Regiment) Divisions from the outset of the invasion. Both sides converged on the only major bridge over the Sittang river north of Rangoon, a railway span near the town of Sittang.  An Allied success here could potentially thwart the Japanese offensive and save Rangoon. Another victory for the Japanese could lead to the capture of that major port and even more conquests by the sons from the land of the Rising Sun.&#10;&#10;Each copy of An Unpleasant and Devastating Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&#10;One sheet of 70 double-sided, unmounted counters&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Infantry units are battalions, all other units are companies. A hex is approximately 800 yards across. Each turn represents six hours of time. Players will need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die to play the game. A custom card set that replaces the standard deck of playing cards is also available.&#10;&#10;An Unpleasant and Devastating Fight is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Ilya Kudriashov.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players control the Norman, Saxon, Viking, and Scots/Welsh Factions and use Events, Commands and Special Abilities to place and move leaders and pieces on the map to control areas, gain support, and win victory.&#10;&#10;Edward the Confessor returned from exile in Normandy after decades of Viking rule in 1042 to become king of England. Magnus the Good of Norway also claimed the throne, and threatened war, but was dissuaded by the childless Edward, who promised to make him his heir. Edward gave the same promise to Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark, William of Normandy, and Harold Godwinson. When he died in 1066 four powerful warlords claimed to be his rightful heir. It would not end well.&#10;&#10;Cards are drawn from the deck one at time, with one card in play and the following card face up on top of the deck. Each Event card shows the order in which Eligible Factions may choose to resolve the Event or one of their own Commands, sometimes with one of their Special Abilities. Resolving an Event or Command makes the Faction Ineligible for the next card. Crown Events interrupt play as a King is crowned, Victory is determined, Revenue is collected, and Support is expanded.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Get stuck with dice at the end, however, and your game will derail quickly!&quot;&#10;&#10;You have a dice 'bone pile' that you play from adding to the dealer's lead pair, treating the dice pair as a domino. Each person in turn tries to connect a pair or pass, when everyone passes the round is over and remaining dice score against you. Once someone gets to 10 points the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;-description from the book, Random Fun Generator&#10;&#10;",
