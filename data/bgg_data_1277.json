    "Description": "SaintCards is a ground-breaking &quot;true fact&quot; card management system that helps players get to know facts about the lives of Catholic Saints.  In a fun and interactive match-making, turn-based game, players vie to collect as many Treasures as possible before the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the dealer dealing a fixed number of cards to each player. The number of cards varies depending on the number of players. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form the draw pile with the top card turned face up next to it to start the play pile.&#10;&#10;In turn, each player aims to match at least one attribute of a card in his or her hand with an attribute of the top card in play. Players gain treasures (also called jewels) which are collected from the Storehouse of Treasure, with each additional matching attribute earning a player an additional treasure. Treasures take the physical form of game pieces of varying size and color, each corresponding to a different value and so function as the point scoring system for the game. On a single turn, a player may play a second card only if at least 3 matches between it and the card previously played can be identified.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, or if a player is unable to find any matches, that player may draw a card from the draw pile instead.&#10;&#10;Play moves to the next player in turn once a player says pass.&#10;&#10;The game ends after one player has played his or her final card and the dealer has had a final chance to play. The player who has gathered the most treasure is the winner. That player then collects all the other players' treasures and lays them at the feet of Jesus, i.e. next to the Jesus Card. SaintCards Expansions add more saints and fun twists and turns to the gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Scrolls of Maega is a board game of tactical confrontation &amp; strategic movement set in a dark fantasy universe. It's an asymmetric tactical RPG for 3 to 6 players, with a modular board. Players have limited actions to prepare &amp; cast spells, manage their hand &amp; resources, and survive the maze.&#10;&#10;LORE - SETTING:&#10;Players are power-hungry sorcerers in search of a long lost divine scroll of power. They will need to foil their opponents and the dangers of the maze to find the key, retrieve the artefact and race back to the exit; knowing that anyone left behind could be waiting on their way back.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;Players will attempt to retrieve the Scroll at the end of the dungeon and make their way back out with it. However, they must first find the Relic (key) among the hidden items randomized on the Treasure tiles.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Players start by choosing their game mode: Battle Royale or Team battle (or Cooperative, coming in an expansion). The game is played in 4 phases of 3 turns each, for a maximum of 12 turns.&#10;&#10;At first, players set the tiles to create the board, using a recommended or custom layout. Treasure tiles (items to collect) and Wall tiles (restricting movement/targeting) are safe to walk on, but most tiles bare Runes that will damage the players health &amp; mana.&#10;&#10;They then select their characters, using the starting deck provided or customizing their strategy (for experienced players). Each begins with the same number: a free spell, 7 spells in-hand, 1 trap card in hand, and 1 trap card in their personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;Players then order their 4 Divination cards, each offering them cumulative bonuses during one of the game's 4 phases. And once the turn-order is decided (by drawing numbered tokens), the first player can enter the maze. The game begins.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Players aim to find the Relic among the hidden items, going to each Treasure tile and getting stronger in the process. With the Relic in their possession (secretly or not), they can take the Scroll from the shrine. But any item can be stolen from other players, so escaping with it will be challenging.&#10;&#10;Players have 4 actions available per turn (moving up to 2-3 tiles, preparing a spell, casting any number of prepared spells, using an item, healing health or mana, etc.)&#10;&#10;Mostly, players use their actions to prepare spells in advance (one action by level, up to 3); or to cast one or more spells they had prepared, so players will always need to anticipate their future needs. Spells are used to attack, move yourself or others, heal, or disable opponents. Only a disabled opponent can be looted.&#10;&#10;Trap cards (Tenacity cards) can be used for free in reaction to a spell targeting them. Once used, it is removed from the game. Each player has two Tenacity cards (one in hand and one in the discard pile at the start of the game).&#10;&#10;Except for your free spell, all used spells are then discarded. However, a tenacity track goes up with every health or mana lost or spent, allowing you to retrieve cards in your personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;If a player falls to 0 HP with mana remaining, it's not over just yet. Next turn, they'll be disabled and will need to exchange their mana for health. But more rarely, if a player falls to 0 HP &amp; Mana, they'll die for good; winning is now out of reach, but as a vengeful spirit with limited actions, the player still has a role to play (either haunting its murderer or helping its team).&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player gets back to the starting portal with the Scroll in hand. So, select your character, build your strategy around their unique playstyle, and rush to the scroll or wait to steal it. In the end, only one Maegan will get the Scroll.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OVERVIEW: This is an election theme board game, but make no mistake about it. This isn't a political game. It is a territorial game where opponents fight for majority of votes on the states, and win General Elections. There is a luck component that is easily tamed with plenty of strategies. Strategies get pretty sophisticated as players develop their skills overtime. In a way it resembles a weird mix of poker and chess without following any of their rules. In other words, it is not a twisted version of either. The goal of the game is to win majority in the states, thereby winning Super PACs to fund your campaigns, and ultimately win 3 General Elections.&#10;&#10;AUDIENCE: Simple enough for casual players and advanced for professional gamers.&#10;&#10;UNIQUE: This game is played continuously. After every game, you can save the setup with its unique challenges for the next time you play. Simply snap a picture of the board. Probably, this is the only &quot;competitive&quot; game where really it is almost impossible to eliminate an opponent from the game (no player elimination).&#10;&#10;IMPORTANT..! &#10;Manufacturer strongly recommends you limit a game to 3 General Elections wins rather than 5 as stated in the rules, for a better game experience.&#10;&#10;",

Players race to be the first to match another player's personality to the one described on the card. However, if they say the wrong color, or are too slow, another player can steal their point.

    "Description": "What ARE the Scenarios?&#10;&#10;The Scenario Packs are 4 distinct and specific Events-based adventures of epic difficulty and challenge for the players.  Not for the faint of heart.  The Events can not really be used in a Standard game as they are very specific.  Standard cards from your Delve or Expansion Packs are used to build the Dungeon decks and then the 10 Event and 1 Character from ONE Scenario are mixed with those cards to form the 80 card deck.&#10;&#10;Fell the Colossus is a brutal challenge to destroy one of the rare Dreadlander Colossus constructs as it rumbles its way across the land.  Billowing a cloud of smoke, it strides towards its intended target to deploy the army it holds within, to wreck havoc with its own powerful weapons, or even it's bare metal hands!  To get in you must climb the legs, run up along the arms, or fight through the horde in its chest when it opens to ascend to the castle and defeat its pilot: a Doom Caster!&#10;&#10;Hell Gate uncovers an evil cult within your own lands that seek to unleash a true horror from beyond!  Will it be Abaddon, or another demon prince?  There's no time to waste as you unmask their hidden members, seek out their lair and eventually break into their inner sanctum to put a stop to their evil plans!  It's going to be an epic challenge as Dread Lord Vorlaat has come down from his tower at the Black Wall.&#10;&#10;The Cursed tells of a land haunted by a horror, where the very members of someone's household may have become an infected terror that plagues the people.  Locking themselves in, they pray for salvation, as the night brings unholy terror.  The Vampiress features in this scenario, and she won't go easily as you face her Brood, discover her identity, and unravel her final resting place where she hangs between worlds.&#10;&#10;Legendary Hoard is more of what you might expect from a typical adventure; find the map, get to the location, enter it's foul trap-laden tunnels, and find the treasure... however, this one is guarded by an Ancient Ruby Dragon!  Nothing will be easy about this battle as the dragon introduces the new Attribute &quot;Titan&quot; outlined on the new Rule card card included in the box!&#10;&#10;",

The Tirpitz became an obsession for the British. After the sinking of the Bismarck, the Tirpitz, as Germany&rsquo;s most powerful warship, was destined to spend much of the war in port.&#10;&#10;After the daring St Nazaire raid by the British, it was deemed unfeasible to use Tirpitz against the Atlantic convoys of the Allies. Instead, she was used sparingly, as a deterrent against Allied invasion in Norway and to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. In September 1943, along with the battleship Scharnhorst, she bombarded Allied positions on Spitzbergen. This was the only occasion the mighty battleship fired her main battery in anger.&#10;&#10;The relentless attacks of the British, would prove to be the end of the mighty vessel. They launched many raids on her; from mini-submarines and two full scale air raids. She was eventually&#226;&#128;&#175; sunk&#226;&#128;&#175;in 1944 by Lancaster bombers armed with 12,000 lb Tallboy bombs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the start of their turn, players can ask other players for any ingredient card they may need, depending on what want to build. If the other player has one or more of that ingredient, they must hand one over. If not, the player whose turn it is draws 2 cards from the deck instead. They can then use the cards they have in their hand to create as many items off the Burger Builder menu as possible.&#10;&#10;Each ingredient card can be used in a variety of meals, allowing players to be strategic in what they build and when. You could play something small, like onion rings or potato cakes, or save up your cards to build something big, like an epic burger!&#10;&#10;A variety of power cards let you play more strategically in your race to accumulate the most points. Swap out cards from your hand, force other players to throw away their ingredient cards or even steal finished menu items. But be careful, your opponents are out to do the same to you in return. Power cards can be used at any time on your turn.&#10;&#10;If a player uses up all the cards in their hand they get to draw another 7 cards from the deck. However, this ends their turn and they cannot play any more cards.&#10;&#10;Play ends in one of two ways. In sprint mode, play ends when the first player reaches 30 points. In marathon mode, play continues until the entire deck has been used up and players can no longer create any food combos. The winning player is the one who has played the most ingredient cards.&#10;&#10;And that's all there is to it!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Board game based on the hit 2018 anime SSSS.GRIDMAN. Players play as Yuta Hibiki and the Gridman Alliance fighting against the kaiju created by Akane Shinjo in this cooperative dice game.&#10;&#10;Players select a character from the show (Yuta, Utsumi, Rikka, Samurai Caliber, Max, Borr, or Vit) to move around the city and fight the kaiju that appear. However, you can't fend off against stronger kaiju alone. Ask a friend to join you in combat for a huge power boost. Work together to take down the final boss, Alexis Kerib!&#10;&#10;Event cards in the game feature scenes from the source material, such as the dinner with Alexis and the meeting with the kaiju girl, and whenever Akane happens to move to the same space Yuto is on, his HP will immediately suffer. Guaranteed laughs for fans of the show.&#10;&#10;Supports up to 4 players, including a solo mode where you control 4 characters.&#10;&#10;&#10;2018&#229;&#185;&#180;&#231;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#230;&#160;&#185;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#142;SSSS.GRIDMAN&#227;&#128;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#153;&#187;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#159;&#191;&#232;&#163;&#149;&#229;&#164;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#231;&#141;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;TV&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#153;&#187;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#232;&#163;&#149;&#229;&#164;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#231;&#141;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#231;&#141;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;1&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#135;&#180;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#13

    "Description": "A competitive Scrabble-esque word game for two players or teams. Players take turns being the &quot;forming&quot; and &quot;defending&quot; side over four rounds. Each round the forming player randomly draws letter tiles one at a time and places them on the grid starting from the center. Each new letter played must either form a complete word, or marked with one of ten pawns as an incomplete word. Each incomplete word must have a possible word declared for the unused letters. After every five letters played the defending player has a blocking tile available to prevent progress of the forming team. Each forming phase ends when the forming player either plays a complete word that uses a corner space, or gets three strikes. Strikes are accumulated for being unable to play a tile, declaring a word that would not fit in the area, or playing an illegal or false word. After each phase, players score points for each letter used in complete words only, and possibly double their score if they end on a corner that corresponds to the round being played.&#10;&#10;",

As you know the basic game is the core of the system which deals with the armies of the Waterloo campaign. To use these scenarios, it is recommended that Warfare in the Age of Napoleon be used. The scenarios will be more adaptable to other battalion level rule systems, too. This supplement will encompass more areas of the Napoleonic period and include new unit types, special rules, and army lists. It will be formatted in a similar fashion as the AOM rulebook scenarios.&#10;&#10;The Napoleonic era spans a stretch of time of continuous warfare from 1789 to 1825 (if including the wars of liberation in South America). The scenarios will be battles or parts of battles of selected years of the period.&#10;&#10;Let's take a scenario/battle from the 1806 campaign of the French invasion of Prussia: Battle of Saalfeld, where a fast-moving French force runs into a Prussian/Saxon rearguard. The scenario will have a short description of the battle, a color map with deployment, and an order of battle. Included with be army lists specific to the battle and any special rules needed for the scenario. In addition, the army list will often include additional troop types not needed in the scenario so one has the means to do other battles of that campaign.&#10;&#10;Many of the battles will be familiar to readers and gamers. The ordes of battle will be as accurate as possible, but note that some 'artistic license' is used in some situations. Many sources are available to the reader and the author does not attempt to be an authority on each battle. A bibliography of sources will be included.&#10;&#10;With the addition of this supplement, it is hoped you can enjoy this period and its many fascinating campaigns and battle from the Age of Napoleon. Special thanks to Maurizio Bragaglia and David Webster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Description from Dale Wood, 2010&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murder of Crows is a somewhat cooperative, somewhat competitive murder mystery card game combined with tag.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players gather in a circle and draw one card each, assigning them a role for the round. The player who draws the Crow card has to &quot;kill&quot; the other players.&#10;&#10;Each player separates from the other players and goes into hiding, somewhat like hide and seek. However, some players will reveal themselves at times. For example, a character with the Shield needs to pass it on, and so, they will search for others to pass it to. The Hunter wants to be able to observe others in order to find out who potentially could be the Crow. The Crow needs to hunt (seek) the others. Typically the Seer and the Villagers try to hide but also be receptive to finding the Shield. And so, each turn is an interplay between hiding, finding out more information, and finding ways to end the round in their favor.&#10;&#10;The Crow &quot;kills&quot; another player by simply whispering into their ear / near them, &quot;You're dead.&quot; Alternatively, they can say, &quot;You're dead; you're my Zombie&quot; to the one chosen Zombie character per round. The Hunter &quot;kills&quot; another player by loudly saying, &quot;Bam! You're dead!&quot; then revealing that they are the Hunter. No other player has the capacity to kill, aside from if someone reveals to the the Crow when they are tagged &quot;dead&quot; that they have the Shield.&#10;&#10;The other players have to identify the Crow and defend themselves with a &quot;Shield.&quot; Some of the other players also have special abilities to partner with other players, defend themselves, or kill other players as well. The Shield must be passed from player to player every minute and is only way other players can protect themselves from being murdered.&#10;&#10;Rounds can last from roughly 3 - 20 minutes. When a round is over, the cards are reshuffled, the Shield is reset, and a new round begins with the dealing of the cards. Participants can play as many rounds as they wish. No formal score keeping is necessary. The game is adaptable and comes with extra cards for the option of building out custom rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bases, Armies and Decks &ndash; Fantasy (also known as &ldquo;BAD Fantasy&rdquo;) is a table-top wargame which takes place in a fantasy setting. The game incorporates elements of base building, army roster creation and deck building.&#10;&#10;Pregame&#10;Prior to the initiation of a game players must make several strategic decisions. First, the player must choose an allegiance. There are four factions within BAD Fantasy each with their own unique playstyle or specialization: The Order (healing, defense), Infernal Legion (damage, offense), Mortis Cults (undeath, auras) or The Warband (effigies and luck). The player must then choose a Lord to lead their army. Lords are powerful heroes with unique abilities. Depending on the scenario or board size players are given a resource pool to recruit additional units. They must also create a deck of 30 cards which is supplemented by a Mastery system of an additional 10 cards.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Players roll for first placement. They highest roll goes first placing 5 units or &ldquo;cubes&rdquo; (cubes are terrain pieces). They players then alternate back and forth until all the starter cubes and armies are fielded. A second roll then occurs to determine who makes the first move.&#10;&#10;Turns&#10;Turns are structured in the following manner for each player:&#10;1.    Card Phase 1&#10;a.    Rotation of existing cards (cards may have vary durations&hellip;the corners of the cards determine the turn length that the effects will remain active)&#10;b.    Playing of cards from the hand&#10;2.    Board Phase&#10;a.    Movement/Building&#10;b.    Melee Resolution&#10;3.    Card Phase 2&#10;a.    Playing of cards from the hand&#10;b.    Drawing or holding to end the turn.&#10;&#10;The Goal of the Game&#10;A win condition is typically generated by killing the opposing Lord however there are other scenarios available.&#10;&#10;",

If you hired the Mercenary using an Orb, it is yours for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The Minotaur is a mercenary expansion for Dwellings of Eldervale that comes in its own tuckbox - separate from any version of Dwellings of Eldervale. Included in the tuck box is the 50mm Minotaur miniature, standee, and corresponding game card.&#10;&#10;The Minotaur&#10;Charging into battle for your side, the Minotaur is a tough fighter. The Charge ability allows the Minotaur to Rush into adjacent Realms like Monsters. This ability is optional and is triggered whenever any opponent places in a Realm adjacent to the Minotaur. The Minotaur rolls 3 dice in battle.&#10;&#10;The Minotaur has always been a separate item - never been included in any version of Dwellings of Eldervale (including Kickstarter versions).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Any enemy die that's hit suffers subtractive damage equal to the value shown on the firing die, and then has the option to move to any adjacent space. If a die fires with a value of 1, everything it hits is reduced to 0. After a die fires it is reduced by half, rounding down.&#10;&#10;A die is removed from the battlefield when it is reduced to 0, and its commander replaces it with one of their three initially unused dice. Players are eliminated when their fourth die is reduced to 0, until just one triumphant commander remains!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players will try to win up to 6 &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; each round.  But the twist is that each time both players play Odd numbered cards, the Flip Card swaps to the opposite side - meaning the loser of the trick could win the points.  And with just 15 cards, ties are resolved using Rock-Paper-Scissors - all recorded on a tug-o-war style board.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, the winning player adds their points to their total. Rounds continue until one player reaches 5 points, and are crowned the Schoolyard Champion.&#10;&#10;Schoolyard Tricks contains a surprising level of strategy and decision-making for a quick, addictive, and highly portable, 15-card microgame.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

When there are no moves left, the player with the higher score is the winner.&#10;&#10;The general idea behind the scoring is simple: You get 1 point per empty cell that is orthogonally adjacent to more of your pieces than your opponent's pieces. Two measures are taken to exclude all draws in as fair a manner as possible:&#10;&#10;1: You get an extra point every time you make a placement that closes off an odd number of tied cells. (A cell is closed off when it is adjacent to no cell that can be occupied on a future turn.) This is equivalent to dividing tied cells between you in a &quot;one for me, one for you, one for me&quot;-fashion as they are closed off.&#10;&#10;2: You get an extra point if your opponent has made more placements than you at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sabermetrics is a 2-player baseball game, utilizing dice-rolls and mathematics to simulate pitching and hitting, with built in events for stealing bases, picking runners off, and double- and triple-plays. Baseball is a numbers game - and so is Sabermetrics! Battle it out with your opponent over 9 innings in this race for the pennant. Still hungry for more? Why not make it a double-header!&#10;&#10;In Sabermetrics, player 1 starts on the mound, pitching three six-sided dice (two white, one green).  Multiply the two white dice together, and then determine if you want to add the green value (for a fastball), or subtract the green value (for a change-up).  That's your pitch number!&#10;&#10;Player 2 next rolls the three dice, and uses standard PMDAS (parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) to mathematically match the pitch number.  If they can match exactly, that's a single!  Calculate exactly twice the pitch number, and that's a double.  Exactly three times - a triple.  Within 1 - well, that's a ball (good-eye).  Within 2 - that's a strike.  Not even within 2?!  That's an out!  Not even half is a double-play, and not even a third is a triple play (assuming you have baserunners).  Three outs ends the top of the first, and players switch roles (as well as rolls), to start the bottom of the inning.  Roll three-of-a-kind as a pitcher, pick a runner off.  Roll three-of-a-kind as a hitter, steal a base.&#10;&#10;After nine innings, the player with the most runs wins -- still tied?  Head to extra innings!  Ever winning by 10 or more at the bottom of an inning?  That's a slaughter rule, take the win, hit the showers early.&#10;&#10;There are cubes to track the score, the pitch count, the innings, and the outs.  This game can also be tracked with a standard baseball scorecard sheet as well -- but it's much more fun to use meeple baserunners!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

These cards will affect your Mentality value plus or minus. There are immediate cards like Impact cards (eg. The Swamp of Sorrow, Salmon of Doubt), which will alter the gameplay a bit by the card effect, and Fracture cards (eg. Bipolar Disorder, Panic Disorder), which will drive a punch into your Mentality.&#10;&#10;This is a turn based game. One turn has 3 phases. Phase 1 is your card's &quot;beginning of your turn&quot; phase. Cards have effects, so some of the cards will apply their effect here. Phase 2 is Defragmentation Phase. The player has got 2 Fragments, and a Fragment can be redeemed into Actions, like DRAW a card or PLAY a card from the hand.

During a turn, the active player moves to spaces on the board to set up concerts, collect fans and place them on their concerts. The more fans at your concert, the more love you gain when you perform there. Players draft musicians with different abilities depending on which instrument they play. Musician's abilities must be used sparingly, as they fatigue after they perform. Players can use ganja to revive their band members.&#10;&#10;Bob Marley is represented in the game and he gives options when you interact with him. Players may also strategically place Marley at one of their own concerts to prompt other players to attend. Two types of cards are gained that either give bonuses that may shift strategy, or give goals to achieve extra unity points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The end goal is to perform at the One Love concert where you cash in your love for unity. The game ends when all the unity tokens are collected. Then all players tally unity tokens and additional unity point bonuses to see who is the victor.

    "Description": "Streets of Steel is a 1-4 player co-operative sidescroller, where players brawl their way through baddies in a 1980's-esque, pixelated, post-apocalyptic, degenerate cityscape. Fight filthy Punks, hot-headed Firebugs, and elusive Killgaroos (yup, ninja kangaroos) in order to take down the big boss, Super Mutie.&#10;&#10;This is a fast paced and funny game with interesting new boardgame mechanics and lots of reverence for 16-bit, arcade fighting.&#10;&#10;The game is for 1-4 players, and plays in under an hour. Players will join together to beat down waves of baddies by rolling lots of dice, risking lots of resources, busting crates, using items and defeating the big boss. After each full round of Hero and Baddie activations, the game board sidescrolls&hellip; everything on the first tile dies as it is removed, and then a new tile pops in and spawns another wave of baddies. Players choose their own difficulty by starting the game with a limited number of quarters. Make it to the Boss, or die trying, as you try to clean up the STREETS OF STEEL!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bargo is a Go-like territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board). Each player must have access to a sufficient number of hexagonal pieces of their own color.&#10;&#10;Each piece has one of its six edge segments covered with a wall. The outer edges of the board are also covered with walls.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTwo adjacent cells, and any pieces on them, are linked if their shared edge segment does not contain a wall.&#10;&#10;A group is a piece along with all other like-colored pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked pieces of its color.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty cell linked to at least one piece in that group.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a territory is an empty cell along with all other empty cells one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked empty cells. You own a territory if all pieces linked to cells in that territory are of your color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must pass or place a piece of your color on an empty cell without causing any edge segment on the board to contain more than one wall, not even momentarily during the move.&#10;&#10;After a placement, remove all enemy pieces in groups without liberties. After all removals, the following conditions must be met:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Your newly placed piece must be part of a group with at least one liberty.&#10;     The cell on the other side of the wall of your newly placed piece must not contain an enemy piece.&#10;     The current board position, ignoring walls, must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns.&#10;&#10;&#10;Otherwise, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. A player's score is the number of pieces of their color on the board, plus the number of cells in their territories, plus a komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and buttonThe komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesLike its companion game Keil, Bargo aims to preserve crosscuts and ko from Go by reducing the natural connectivity of the hexagonal grid.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

To avoid ties, the value of komi must be of the form n + 0.5, where n is a whole number.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi and which side will receive it, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value and recipient side for all games. A half-point komi for Black is suggested as a default value.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsSquare: Played on the intersections of a square grid. In the definition of group, &quot;adjacent&quot; means only &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;. To avoid mirror play, either use an odd-sized board or always give a komi to Black.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Chocolate Factory is a euro game of literal factory building and moving (using a pushable conveyer belt component) chocolates you must complete the largest number of chocolates required by retailers for the best value. The game also features wooden chocolate pieces and a movable conveyer belt making the physicality blended with euro mechanics a unique experience.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;Players are each given a starting player board which will have two Factory parts which apply to a physical conveyer belt. The conveyer belt part of the player board contains long slot with an empty region in which to push square tiles along. The tiles will house the chocolate pieces players will manipulate throughout the game.&#10;&#10;During the game players will initially draft new factory parts (to add to their player board) and specialists (one time use cards with special powers).&#10;&#10;Then each player will &ldquo;push&rdquo; three times cocoa into their machines. During each &ldquo;push&rdquo; players will be able to use fuel and their factory parts to manipulate their Chocolate pieces. Careful consideration will be required for the spatial element of the game as Chocolate pieces can only be manipulated during a push by the Factory part that is adjacent to their tile.&#10;&#10;Players score points by creating chocolates for public and personal objectives. The player with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",
