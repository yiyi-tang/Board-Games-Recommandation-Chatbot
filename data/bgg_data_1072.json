To triumph the team must balance: using actions to attack the hoards (which earns them gold), with investing in building defensive towers (which takes several actions, but provides additional attacks each round).&#10;&#10;Defenders of Dragonfell is an Action Point based game. Heroes can either, move, shoot or build to make their way across the map and start killing off the attacking wave of monsters. Killing monsters earns the hero gold, which they use to buy one of the unique tower types. Each tower works differently and by placing them strategically, powerful combinations can be created to save Dragonfell.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1833 is a card game where the objective is to establish the most valuable railroad network by creating routes between various North American cities of the 19th Century.  Players take turns drawing cards and building their railroad connections.  Players' resources are limited by number of cards he may hold in his hand, but may be increased by building increasing levels of routes.  Route levels (size) are determined by the type of locomotive used for that route.  Stockpiling resources (cards) is tricky and dangerous because getting rid of unwanted cards is not trivial.  Players may also collect corporation cards which increase the value of the player's routes connected to that corporation's home city.  Holding corporation cards count against a player's hand limit; representing the built-in cost of that corporation card. Private company cards (representing privately held railroads) may be used to connect otherwise unconnected cities, but at a cost to the value of the route for which they are used.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "That's So Wrong: Caveman Edition is the first in what is hoped to be a long series of strategic party games that you can learn quickly, but spend years mastering. The game system offers so much substance that you can play them forever and ever until you die and pass them on to your children. Traditional standalone games usually make you pick one: they're either easy to pick up, but don't have enough gameplay to keep experienced players engaged; or they're loaded with depth, but tough to get into.  That's So Wrong: Caveman edition was designed to keep experienced gamers entertained, while maintaining simplicity so new players can jump right in.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by building their tribe from a random set of 4 caveman. Once all players have done this, players can send their caveman out to the &quot;wild&quot; to fetch items which in turn help make your tribe stronger. Conflicts happen when your caveman and another player's choose the same item, cave woman, event, caves to live in, or dinosaurs to hunt. If this happens conflicts begin and are resolved by looking at the text of the card. Follow the simple instructions to determine the winner. Winners take the prized possessions back to their tribe.&#10;&#10;Certain cavemen and items are better at accomplishing different tasks. Some cavemen are good at hunting, some are good at finding love with the cave-ladies, and others are less practical. Some are even perfect for winning conflicts.&#10;&#10;Cavemen who successfully accomplish their mission by being uncontested or winning a conflict become exhausted and they (and their spoils of discovery) are unable to be sent back out again until the following turn. Managing who is exhausted and how many cards are in your hand (which can be expanded with the discovery of a new home/cave) is important to claim victory. As your tribe grows rich with items, powerful dinosaur hunts, cave-woman, and pets you'll be able to win more conflicts and cause more mayhem for other players.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players add up the value of the cards they've collected and a winner may emerge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It's all about judging the probability that the next player will be able to fulfill a challenge you lay down for them, based on the suits and colours that appear on their cards. On your turn, you play TWO cards. The first has to meet the criteria of a challenge set for you by the previous player. The second sets the challenge for the next player. You'll want to force them to use their most powerful cards early in the game, but make sure you hang on to your own powerful cards and use them at the right time. Hold onto game-changing cards for too long and you could inadvertently blow everything! This outstanding game will confound your expectations and keep you on your toes!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dawn of Technology contains two modules for Trickerion: the Contraptions, and the Signature Tricks.&#10;&#10;Thanks to Magoria's recent technological achievements, Magicians can now enhance their Workshops with up to four Contraptions, unique to their magic school. Contraptions can be assembled as a Workshop Action, for the cost of 1 Coin per Contraption already in place. They can be used any time during a player's turn by turning them to their inactive side, and receiving a bonus based on the player's Magic school - in the above example, the Mechanical Contraption, the Generator, supplies the city with electricity, netting its owner a steady income of Coins.&#10;&#10;Each Contraption has a more powerful effect than the one below it. At the end of a round, each Contraption with enough Shards next to it can be reactivated and used again next turn - this follows the similar principle as the Magician Powers module (which is playable with Contraptions). The highest-level Contraptions are so breathtaking that simply reactivating them will earn you some Fame!&#10;&#10;The Contraptions module includes 16 Contraptions with 4 unique illustrations, printed on 3mm blackcore cardboard, and 4 board extensions.&#10;&#10;When you learn a Trick from your own school, you may choose to learn your Signature Trick instead (if you meet its Fame threshold). Each Signature Trick &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; a Trick from the original set: for example, Professor Bernard can learn his Legendary Shark Tank signature trick instead of the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Water Tank Escape. If a Signature Trick is learned, the standard version is removed from the deck. And if an opponent already learned its standard version, your Signature Trick no longer has a Fame Threshold!&#10;&#10;Signature Tricks have the same component requirements as their standard version, but they also require Contraptions to function: the higher their Fame threshold, the more Contraptions you have to use when you prepare them. However, in return, not only do these Tricks have better numbers (higher Yield, more Trick Markers, etc.), but they also have a special power: for example, The Legendary Shark Tank&rsquo;s Trick markers can be aligned freely in the Theater, meaning that you&rsquo;ll always be able to create Links with it.&#10;&#10;This expansion is contained in the Collector's edition and will also be available by itself, at least from the publisher's website.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

These are just a few of the skirmishes you can fight with 1676 - a tabletop miniatures game set in New England during the Native American uprising that became known as King Philip&rsquo;s War.&#10;&#10;The types of conflicts that occurred in King Philip&rsquo;s War were usually small skirmishes that can be represented on a tabletop with these rules. You can play a native war party or a force from the Army of the United Colonies. If you want to add &quot;fell creatures,&quot; magic, &amp; (gasp!) European powers, there is a supplement available with these additions (Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen).&#10;&#10;The core rules are provided in only 5 pages. They are simple &amp; straightforward. Simple die rolls - using 6- &amp; 8-sided dice - are used to resolve combat &amp; other actions. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly.&#10;&#10;You can use one of the pre-made &quot;armies&quot; provided in a second PDF (Part Two), or can create your own balanced forces using a simple point build system. Part Two includes unit cards, sample army lists, &amp; all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need. Alternatively, premade Unit cards, Command cards, &amp; (Mis)Fortune cards are now available from The Game Crafter.&#10;&#10;Both books are illustrated with photographs of figures from Brigade Games' King Philip's War line. With these figures (supplemented by those from other manufacturers), you can now easily field beautiful forces in miniature to represent the combatants.&#10;&#10;So heed the call to arms! Your colony or tribe is depending on you!&#10;&#10;",

There are two PDF downloads included with your purchase: a 36 page rulebook, and a 45 page book of army lists and rosters. You can use one of the six premade armies, or create your own force with a comprehensive point system. The game has a historical &quot;feel&quot; through the use of Assets specific to different types of characters &amp; units. Optional &quot;otherworldly&quot; rules are included to take advantage of some of the outstanding figures available for this period. Color photographs of figures from Conquest Miniatures, Eureka Miniatures, AW Miniatures, &amp; Warlord Games, as well as structures by Acheson Creations (all used with permission) illustrate both documents.&#10;&#10;Part One contains the game rules (summarized in a 4-page Quick Reference), Assets to personalize your troops (Abilities &amp; Characteristics, Weapons, Artillery, Special Unit Members, Equipment, Vehicles, Animals, &amp; Structures), Liabilities, Otherworldly Assets (including Divine Interventions), Templates, Markers &amp; Tokens, &amp; optional Event Cards.&#10;&#10;Part Two contains brief historical information, Army Lists, and Unit Cards for the Indians, French, British, Canadians, &amp; American Colonials. There is also information on Bears, Dogs, Zombyes, &amp; a few other optional (but fun!) non-historical additions to the game (inspired mainly by figures from Conquest Miniatures). There are six sample armies, &amp; information about how to create your own troops &amp; armies.&#10;&#10;",

The account details the exploits of a hapless party of adventurers returning to Tinderbox to face their patron after a failed quest. Needing to set an example, but realizing that even bad help is hard to find, their benefactor decides that only one of them will be held accountable. But whose fault was it? It's at this point that the players step in to, well, pass the buck.&#10;&#10;The Barmaid's Tale is a simple ten-minute social strategy game of blame and bribery for 4-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

This way, dice and tiles are constantly moving in and out of phase with each other.&#10;&#10;The game will be won by the player with the highest score after all the timers have stopped and there are no more coins left to feed them.&#10;&#10;",
