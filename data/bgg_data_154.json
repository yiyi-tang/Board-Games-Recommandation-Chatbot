    "Description": "In Swedish Parliament 2014, you play as one of eight Swedish parties and compete to become the most influential party after the 2014 parliament elections.&#10;&#10;The most influential party is the one that becomes the &quot;center of gravity&quot; in the next cabinet. To achieve this, you need as many votes for yourself as possible, but more importantly, you need to have better relations with other parties than they have with each other.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you play &quot;idea cards&quot; that move the parties' positions on one of the eight political scales (high tax/low tax, immigration/nationalism etc). Parties who move in concert may strengthen their relation; parties who don't risk weakening theirs. Every move gives the parties more or less favor with the eight voter groups (old/young, men/women etc), which determines the votes cast by the game's sixteen voters (representing every combination of the four voter groups).&#10;&#10;The game is an act of balances: Stick out your neck enough to keep a clear profile and win voters that give you political weight, but co-operate enough to place this weight in the right position of the winning coalition.&#10;&#10;",

Break your opponent&rsquo;s shieldwall before your own army loses heart and flees.

You need to out-think and out-fight your opponent to win the battle. You do so by choosing whether to command your battle line to attack, defend, or redeploy, through clever use of action points. Combat is resolved by the roll of dice, and armies consist of Hirdmen (armoured warriors), Bondi (unarmoured warriors), and Thralls (cowardly but useful skirmishers!).&#10;&#10;- Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Villainy is a game about aspiring super villains competing to be the first to enact their evil plans and overcome Fantastiman, that pesky superhero who watches over the city day and night. It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.&#10;&#10;As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.&#10;&#10;Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics Description:&#10;&#10;In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.&#10;&#10;Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.&#10;&#10;Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.&#10;&#10;Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.&#10;&#10;",

It was part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive (Operation Mars). The Soviet objective was to liberate the Russian city of Velikiye Luki and to cut the north-south rail line to the west of the city.&#10;&#10;Rather than attacking the town directly, the Soviet forces advanced into the difficult terrain to the north and south of the town. Despite heavy losses, they successfully cut the land links to the city, trapping the garrison. Hitler demanded that all the surrounded formations hold out while relief forces counterattacked to open a route to the encircled units. The garrison held out against repeated and determined Russian assaults. In the meantime, Soviet attempts to take their main objective, the rail lines at Novosokolniki, had been frustrated by the counter-attacks of the relief force. An attempt by the Germans to reach Velikiye Luki in late December ran into stubborn Soviet defense and was halted. The German garrison finally surrendered on January 16th.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The basic unit on the table-top is the brigade, representing a few thousand soldiers. At this scale, of course, many things are abstracted. We do not concern ourselves with the actions of small groups of soldiers. Rather, we place ourselves in the roles of generals, ordering thousands of men to move, attack, or defend. And, like those generals of history, we don't know whether or not our officers and men are going to behave exactly as we hope or expect.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CONTEXT&#10;At the beginning of the 20th century, capitalism and the nation-state are in full swing, workers have it hard: Working conditions; Work time; Wages; Unsanitary housing; everything systematically leans in favor of employers.&#10;&#10;Yet since May 1, 1886 and the Haymarket Massacre, workers have tried to organize and resist, supported by a new generation of increasingly committed anarchist and union activists.&#10;&#10;The scenario of &quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; takes place in New York, during the winter of 1910-1911 and stages homes of workers who try to survive and organize themselves to take control of the means of production before the employers become too powerful. It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:&#10;&#10;- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.&#10;- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.&#10;&#10;Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.&#10;&#10;This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;1-A game lasts 10 turns. Each turn, the bosses carry out offensives through cards drawn at random. These cards establish temporary or permanent mini-rules against players.&#10;&#10;2-You will be playing a family or a small group of people living together. Each member is one of your &quot;workers&quot; and has one action to perform per turn.&#10;&#10;3-Each turn, you send your &quot;workers&quot; to the Tiles of New York in order to: a / work and be paid in order to pay your rent, your food and the expenses of the struggle; b / work in political places to cause agitation, strikes or sabotage.&#10;&#10;4-Then, you will use agitation, strikes and sabotage to fight the bosses offensives against your rights.&#10;&#10;5-With the added agitation, evolve the New York Tiles to make them more worker friendly; complete 6 objectives and take control of the means of production BEFORE the bosses take control of everything and even leave you enough to survive.&#10;&#10;6-Be careful, each turn you will have to draw: a / misfortune cards which will make everyone's life even more difficult; b / incident cards which will strike the player who will have the most Risk (obtained according to the work), Police Threat (obtained by causing agitation) OR the least healthy.&#10;&#10;7-You could end up with workers in prison, injured, or sick. Which will lower your possibilities for your next turn.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;1-Victory: Take control of New York's means of production by purchasing 6 objectives with your resources.&#10;2-You lose if you fail to pay the cost of your living or if the bosses reach turn 10.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Flex your financial muscles as the New York Moneybags. Bunt and steal your way to victory as the Sioux City Small Ballers. Deliver take-out slides and headhunting pitches as the Detroit Dirt Bags.&#10;&#10;Bat Flip is a fast-paced card game of action and reaction. Step into the role of manager, decide how to deploy your players to hit, pitch and field over the course of an action-packed 3-inning game. Respond instantly to your opponent's moves. Utilize your best players and abilities in the most pivotal moments of the game. When the time is just right, swing for the fences and flip that bat.&#10;&#10;Similar to the popular game Smash Up, you will draft two team-decks and shuffle them together to form a 24-card deck that combines both teams' players and special abilities.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between the At-Bat Step and the Steal Step. During the At-Bat Step, managers will play player cards out of their hand in an attempt to hit safely or draw a walk. In response, the defending manager may play a defender out of their hand in an attempt to mitigate the damage or record an out. When players hit or walk, their cards move around the bases. During the Steal Step, the batting team may attempt to use their Runners' speed to take extra bases and the defense may, again, respond with a defender in attempt to throw the runner out.&#10;&#10;Whichever team has the most runs after 3 innings, is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Desert&#10;Sere, serene, eternal, the Western Desert stretches across North Africa.  &#10;Here, Rommel - perhaps the greatest of Germany's generals - marshalled Italian troops and powerful German panzer forces to sweep the desert in brilliant blitzkrieg.&#10;Here, Wavell, Auchinleck and Montgomery fought bitterly to destroy the enemy and defend Alexandria. &#10;Here, history's great generals developed the mobile tactics of modern warfare.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rommel in North Africa: The War in the Desert 1941-42&quot; is a two-player wargame, designed by Jon Southard and published by West End Games in 1986, depicting the campaigns in North Africa during World War II using a Point-to-Point Movement map and an unusual sequence of play.&#10;&#10;The game's Point-to-Point movement system and unique battle reinforcement rules create a sense of sweeping manuever, while channeling conflict along routes of movement and supply. The long buildup periods, that drag on and on in most Desert War wargames, require only moments to play in Rommel in North Africa, while manuever and combat absorb most of the playing time. Players experience the realities and excitement of the Desert War without the boredom.&#10;&#10;A turn may last a few minutes or much longer, depending on how hard players are willing to push their forces. Like the war itself, periods of relative quiet explode into furious, quick-playing manuever and combat.&#10;&#10;Three scenarios and the Campaign game:&#10;- Rommel's First Offensive: depicts the first dramatic sweep against Eighth Army.&#10;- Operation Crusader: picks up with the first successful British counter offensive.&#10;- Gazala: a revitalized Afrika Korps is faced by an entrenched Eighth Army.&#10;- The War in the Desert: the entire 20-month War, from April '41 to November '42.&#10;&#10;",

Once all the pieces have been claimed, the players &mdash; starting with the last one to take a piece and reversing the playing order &mdash; take turns placing their pieces on the game board one by one. Whoever gets rid of the largest amount of pieces &mdash; more specifically, whoever has the fewest squares remaining &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Polyssimo Challenge is very tactical, with an emphasis on geometrical reasoning, as for the Polyssimo puzzle game. Giving a handicap to the stronger player is mentioned in the rules (as in Go), allowing for interesting games even when players have different levels, e.g., a beginner playing against an experienced one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.&#10;&#10;This game was devised in 1950 as a simple social game to model the behavior of people when forming coalitions.  To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.&#10;&#10;The objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.&#10;&#10;Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.&#10;&#10;The authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.&#10;&#10;",

The battle was divided into two distinct phases, and a scenario is provided that covers each phase as a self-contained game.  Also included is a Campaign Game that allows the Players to refight the series of engagements as a single, continuous game.  The first Scenario, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, involves the period from December 18-21, 1944.  It presents the phase of the battle when the spearhead of the German 5th Panzer Army first approached the vital road and communication center at Bastogne.  The second Scenario, &quot;the Relief of Bastogne&quot;, depicts the situation from December 21-26, the period of Patton's drive up from the south to relieve the siege of Bastogne and open a supply line to the defenders.  Each Game-Turn represents one-half day of actual time, and the scale of the map is approximately 850 meters per hex.&quot;  (from the Bastogne rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Bastogne is one of four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and and Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany Quadrigame is also included.&#10;&#10;Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with hard zones of control that promote &quot;surround and destroy&quot; tactics.&#10;&#10;",

Fire tokens deal damage equal to the mayhem die, just like a regular attack, but deal their damage at the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;When a character is KOed, they are removed from the board and their opponent gains VPs, with the KOed character returning to play next round.&#10;&#10;When you're not fighting, you use teamwork to complete missions from the special GO! deck for a chance to gain VPs.&#10;&#10;",

From Sword, Gold, and Juno beaches, British Army troops fought their way across the hedgerows and rolling green hills, driving back Hitler&rsquo;s Wehrmacht and SS forces. Fierce German resistance, featuring skilled use of tanks on the defensive, resulted in the loss of huge numbers of men and machines - but no loss of will. The promise of 1940 would be fulfilled.&#10;&#10;Liberation 1944 is a complete game in the Panzer Grenadier series covering the fierce struggles of His Majesty&rsquo;s forces through Operations Overlord, Goodwood, and Bluecoat. There are 41 new scenarios by designer Mike Perryman. Four new mapboards by artist Guy Riessen show the hedgerows, hills, towns and farmland of France. There are 517 playing pieces: 352 combat units and 165 markers.&#10;&#10;Both sides bring swarms of tanks to your game table: Shermans and Fireflies, Cromwell and Churchills match up with Panthers, Panzer IV's, and Tigers.&#10;&#10;",

This feature changes the strategy somewhat, as your final score is a golf score, not a cribbage score. Therefore, 1-point tricks that you would normally take without thinking in regular cribbage must be weighed carefully, as that one point may just put you in a sand trap or water hole on the golf course, costing you a stroke to your game.&#10;&#10;",

Different players can choose a different superpower.&#10;&#10;Name your superhero and draw their costume. Place your Superhero token in the middle circle as your starting place (this is the only time your token will be in the middle circle)&#10;&#10;The game is played over 10 rounds simultaneously, with players trying to earn the most points (honor). All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 4 dice and then spend those 4 dice&#10;&#10;- Roll 4 dice - Roll the 4 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.&#10;&#10;- Spend dice to either &ldquo;Move&rdquo; or &ldquo;Help&rdquo; - each die can be used to either move your superhero or help people in your current location (by marking an X or a number).&#10;&#10;Move - There are two ways to move. Move your superhero token to the location that matches the die, or use a die that matches your superhero&rsquo;s current location to move your superhero token to any location.&#10;&#10;Help- Use a die to help in your current location, marking an X or writing a number (depending on the location).&#10;&#10;Repeat this until 10 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;Using your Superpower: You may use your superpower three times throughout a game. The three blank squares in the middle circle (under your superhero) are there to show how many superpower uses you have remaining. You may use your superpower at any time, even multiple times in a round. For each use, mark an X in the square.&#10;&#10;Superpowers explained:&#10;1 - Shrink - Change any die to a 1&#10;2 - Teleport - Use a die to travel to any location&#10;3 - Ice - Decrease a die by one (Example: Change a 4 to a 3, or a 2 to a 1. 1&rsquo;s cannot be changed)&#10;4 - Fire - Increase a die by one (Example: Change a 3 to a 4, or a 1 to a 2. 6&rsquo;s cannot be changed)&#10;5 - Shapeshift - Change one die to the same number of another die rolled this round (You may not Shapeshift a Wild die)&#10;6 - Grow - Change any die to a 6&#10;&#10;Using Wild Dice: When you unlock a wild die, circle it in the bottom section with all the Wild dice. You may at any time spend a wild die. A wild die is an additional die that is any number. When you use a wild die, mark an X over an unlocked wild die icon to show you have spent it. You can spend multiple wild dice in a round, and you can use wild dice immediately after gaining them. You may use wild dice for moving or helping.&#10;&#10;Rescuing Bystander Meeples: &#10;When a Bystander Meeple rescue requirements are met, you circle a Bystander icon in the bottom section with all the Bystanders. At the end of the game, each rescued Bystander earns you 5 Honor.&#10;&#10;Defeating Robot Minions:&#10;Each location has three Robot Minions that are causing trouble. You may spend any number die to defeat one of these minions, marking an X over it at the location, then marking an X over a Robot Minion in the corresponding section at the bottom. At the end of the game, each defeated Robot Minion earns you 1 Honor. (Robot Minions are a last resort at a location when you do not have any better options, so dice do not go to waste.)&#10;&#10;Each Location Explained:&#10;&#10;1 - City Hall - Mark an X for matching die (1, 2, or 3) in any order. When the 1, 2, and 3 are marked off diagonally, you earn a Wild die. When all locations are marked off (all 9 spaces), you rescue a Bystander. Earn 4 Honor for each row and/or column completed.&#10;&#10;2 - Hospital - Same number pairs. You can use the same number for multiple pairs. You can start a new pair before completing others. You do not have to go in any order.&#10;&#10;3 - Downtown - Same number for the entire run. It can be any number to start, but it must be the same number for the rest of the game. You must start at the bottom, then continue up. Rescue Bystander or gain a Wild Die when the corresponding box is filled in.&#10;&#10;4 - Powerplant - Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be exactly one higher or lower. It may not be the same number. (Example: You use a 5 die to help, writing a 5 in the leftmost square. The next number can either be a 4 or a 6. You use a 6 die to help, writing a 6 in the next square. The next number will have to be a 5, as there is nothing higher than a 6.)&#10;&#10;5 - Warehouse -Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be equal to or higher than the previous number. (Example: You use a 2 die to help, writing a 2 in the leftmost square. The next number can be a 2 or higher. You use a 4 die to help, writing a 4 in the next square. The next number can be a 4 or higher.)&#10;&#10;6 - Church - Mark an X for matching die. You can mark off in any order. If you complete a complete column (1-6 or 6-1) you gain 15 Honor. If you complete the top six you earn a Wild Die, if you complete the bottom six you rescue a Bystander.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;After you have completed the 10th roll/round, total your Honor/points earned from each location, rescued bystander meeples (5 honor per), and defeated robot minions (1 honor per). The player with the most Honor is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game was played on a green beige mat, similar to that use for the soccer version.  The rules mimicked those of cricket (which will doubtless make this review impenetrable to most nationalities).&#10;&#10;The bowling side placed the small red plastic ball in the channel in the bowling piece, which was then flicked to propel the ball towards the batsman and a small plastic wicket (complete with separate plastic bails).  The batting action was achieved by spinning a handle attached to a small plastic cricket bat, aiming to hit the ball to score runs; the number of runs scored depended on the distance the ball was hit.&#10;&#10;The fielding side set out its players, which were small plastic men each on a molded plastic base which included a cup-shaped depression.  If the ball was hit into one of these depressions, that was a catch.&#10;&#10;The rules allowed for run outs (flick the ball to hit the wickets), leg before wickets (a complex and controversial assessment of whether the ball hit the plastic batsman &quot;in line&quot; with the stumps) and even stumping.&#10;&#10;The game did not have the genuine skill and excitement of the soccer version, but strangely it did just about work as a contest.&#10;&#10;In line with other Subbuteo games, there was a variety of &quot;extras&quot; to buy, including scoreboards and boundary fences.  It was well worth saving your  pocket money in the 1970s to save for the Australian team (baggy green caps), or the West Indians (black players with maroon caps).&#10;&#10;",

Twelve wooden pins numbered 1-12 are placed in a cluster in the starting area. On a turn, a player shoots a wooden disc from the slingshot-style launcher on the open end of the board to attempt to knock down one or more pins. If a player knocks over only a single pin, the player scores points equal to the number on the pin; if the player knocks down two or more pins, the player scores points equal to the number of pins knocked down. After scoring, the player stands the pins up where they fell. Alternatively, if the player knocked over a single pin, instead of scoring points they can place this pin in one of the two defense zones near the back of the playing area.&#10;&#10;If a player's score equals exactly 70 points, they win. If a player would score points and go over 70, then they instead lose points equal to the sum of the numbers on the pins, regardless of how many pins they dropped.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player reaches exactly 70 points and wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...&#10;&#10;Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?&#10;&#10;Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.&#10;&#10;The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.&#10;&#10;So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;&#10;     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;&#10;     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The second scenario begins at the end of march, and covers the great allied offensive that will culminate in the conquest of Tunis and the victory in Africa.&#10;As usual, the counters are unmounted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is composed of cards with characteristics, characteristics defining the character of each player (German, French, Russian&hellip;) and objectives. At the beginning of a round, each player gets a character. This character consists of 1 nationality, 1 drink and 1 localization and, inevitably, 1 gesture and 1 word he has to pronounce when they clink glasses. The cards &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; are mixed and posed face hidden in the center of the table. They consist also of 3 characteristics, but are mixed this time (f.e. a German drinks champagne in front of Big Ben). The active player turns over a card &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo;. It is necessary to look at it well if one of your characteristics is on the card which has been just turned over; you will have to make the gesture associated with the drink and to pronounce the word associated with the nationality of that character. Inevitably, it is the fastest player who will win the card. &#10;The game ends when all &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; cards have been played.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.guillaumegames.com/Jeux/TchinTchin/TchinTchinAccueil.htm&#10;&#10;",

Your job is to build a network of roadways around San Andreas proper. But San Andreas is rather prone to earthquakes, which have a tendency to destroy the beautiful stretches of pavement you've been laying. After all the asphalt is put down, which road crew will end up connecting the most highway in between quakes?&quot;&#10;&#10;In Seismic, players place hexagonal highway tiles to build long, complete sections of highways, scoring points for each tile as well as bonus points for the ending &quot;intersection&quot; tiles in their routes. Scores aren't tallied until the end of the game, because at any time, earthquakes can occur, destroying tiles along the most-built direction leading out from the central &quot;San Andreas&quot; tile. Players constantly need to be claiming as many long roadways as possible while ensuring that their highways aren't the ones that are going to be destroyed if and when an earthquake occurs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For some time, there had been reports that a large area of dense jungle northwest of Saigon was a staging base for the Viet Cong. Ideally situated near Cambodia, a nexus point of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and proximal to the capital city of Saigon itself, the area that became known as the &ldquo;Iron Triangle&rdquo; allowed the Viet Cong to conduct well-organized and well-supplied operations into the very heart of South Vietnam. In the meantime, a hundred miles to the south, a US riverine force, comprised primarily of the newly-arrived 9th Infantry Division, began to penetrate into the hinterland of the Mekong Delta, and even into the overgrown rivulets where only &lsquo;Charlie&rsquo; had ever operated before.&#10;&#10;In the first in the Vietnam Battles series, two games are included, Iron Triangle and Snoopy&rsquo;s Nose (named after a distinctive curve in one of the distributaries leading to the Mekong River). Both games utilize the very popular Fire &amp; Movement combat system, and is easy to play.&#10;Units in the game are typically companies and some battalions and occasional brigade equivalents. The full spectrum of the war in Vietnam in 1967 is featured with everything from riverine craft to helicopters. Each hex represents about a half mile, and each game turn represents from about a half a day to several days of operations.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 200 counters.&#10;&#10;(from the editor's website)&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #7, Sep-Oct 2013&#10;&#10;",

If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play.

That theater saw two major campaigns: one in which the forces of the British Empire contested control of the vital Suez Canal and Jerusalem regions with the Ottoman Turks and their German allies; and the Arab Revolt, in which Thomas E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) took a leading role. Both campaigns featured several of the major mobile actions of the Great War. At stake was nothing less than control of the entire Middle East.&#10;&#10;The game has two players: the Allies (British and Arab Rebels) and Central Powers (Ottoman Turks and Germans). Players move and attack with their units in their own discrete turns. The objective is to capture critical cities and thereby win the war in this theater. The game map is divided into two theaters, the Western and Eastern, in which separate campaigns are conducted.&#10;&#10;No Prisoners also includes an optional alternative command system, in which both players control opposing British and Central Powers units in the two map sectors, in the same manner as in old-SPI's classic Battle for Germany game. In that option, the two maps' Allied forces race against each other for victory.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map equals 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across, and each game turn represents three months of operations. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily regiments, brigades and divisions. There are 176 large-size (5/8&quot;) NATO-style (and some iconic) unit-counters in the game.&#10;&#10;",

You score points by connecting your path (or stream) to as many sides of the square as possible, and by isolating your opponent's stream (or path). As you may have to place tiles that not only help you (and hinder your opponent), but also tiles that may hinder you (and help your opponent), there is a depth of strategy that is belied by whimsical art of the cardboard tiles.

With each battle, they will also learn new skills to face the enemy bosses and defeat the Dark Lords. &#10;The path will be created throughout the game and will be different each time you play, since it&rsquo;s generated randomly.

Get all the legendary sets from the different locations and your adventurers will be virtually invincible. &#10;Configure your character with equipment that better suits your playing style. Each adventurer is unique, with strengths and weaknesses that must be complemented by the rest of the group to succeed in the adventure. &#10;Get ready for battle and dwell into the Path of the Adventurers!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Set the pocket watch to 1:00, then give each player one stick of dynamite, one shelf, and one character with a gold chest.&#10;&#10;On a turn, everyone throws their dynamite sticks into the gold mine at the same time, then they all search (using only one hand) to remove face-up tiles from the mine and place the tiles on their personal shelf. If you spot a special tile with bat, rat, snake, or ghost, call &quot;Watch out!&quot; so that everyone else must place their hands on their head and call out &quot;Help!&quot; before continuing to play. When no more face-up tiles remain, the round ends.&#10;&#10;Players can play action tiles to flip over extra tiles, throw an extra piece of dynamite, duel with another player, and more. After twelve rounds, whoever has the most gold wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This children's card game is about gophers collecting their winter food supply.&#10;&#10;Each supply card shows one to three apples, carrots or nuts. During their turn, the active player can uncover in sequence up to four cards from the pile. If the same kind of fruit appears one after the other, then all cards uncovered in this turn are lost for the player. Since there are only three fruit sorts, this occurs regularly, so this provides tension both for children and adults.&#10;&#10;If a player has more than six of a set, then he loses everything that he collected so far from this set.&#10;&#10;If the player has exactly six pieces of a set, the player then receives a gopher trophy in exchange for the set. The first to get his third cup wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is not only pure gambling, but also offers tactical choices so children take part enthusiastically. The minimum age indicated by the manufacturer seems applicable as long as the child can count over six.&#10;&#10;",

Everything you need, except a playing surface, is here - over 100 miniatures, an easy-to-understand rulebook, lots of counters, dice and even a ruler.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is simple - to defeat your enemy using any tactics or strategem you can find.  In Fantasy Warriors there's much more to battle than launching your army in a head on attack - discover the perils and rewards of scouting, boasts, omens, threats and, of course, magic.&#10;&#10;Each player controls an army, headed by a war chief who issues orders to the troops under his command.  Giving the right orders and changing them when the moment is right is the essence of generalship in Fantasy Warriors.  How well will you do in the battle of wits between opposing players?&#10;&#10;You can play the game with forces of any size, from small skirmishes of 20 to 40 figures a side to epic clashes between several armies, containing hundreds of figures.  Battles may be fought between two players, each with an army, or groups of players forming tabletop alliances.  You don't need any sort of referee or games master.&#10;&#10;There's no book keeping in Fantasy Warriors and, after you have decided on your forces, there's no need for pencil and paper.  Once the battle is under way, the colourful counters supplied with the game will give you all the information you need.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Fantasy Warriors is a complete game set for playing exciting fantasy wargames with finely detailed Grenadier miniatures - all you need to provide is a table and the desire to enjoy yourself.  The set contains: two armies [dwarves and orcs] (102 figures) of plastic Grenadier miniatures; around 140 colourful game-play counters; comprehensive rulebook; unique day/night timedial; [5] high quality dice; quick reference sheet; inch/millimetre game ruler.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;     102 Plastic Miniatures&#10;     51 Plastic Shields&#10;     5 Dice&#10;     150 Order Counters&#10;     56-page Rulebook&#10;     Quick Reference Sheet&#10;     A very flimsy box&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Fantasy Warriors Companion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player writes her answer on a piece of paper (or mobile phone) before revealing the three cards under the game box. If players together as a team successfully deduce all three elements, each player receives points for her correct deduction and clue sets collected. The player with the most points wins. However, if the players weren't able to deduce all three aspects of the crime as a team, they fail, the murder takes place, and all players lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players play out a live-action cricket game with miniature figures on a fabric playing field. One player 'bowls' a small ball from a bowler while the other player operates the batsman. Fielders are placed throughout the board to 'catch' the ball in the base between their feet.&#10;&#10;A classic and beloved family game originally released in 1977 and immensely popular in the UK, Australia, India and South Africa in particular. The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.&#10;&#10;In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.&#10;The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. &#10;The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  &#10;The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.&#10;&#10;The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.&#10;&#10;In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. &#10;As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.&#10;&#10;It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.&#10;&#10;&#10;World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.&#10;In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.&#10;&#10;The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.&#10;&#10;The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.&#10;&#10;The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.&#10;Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.&#10;&#10;There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For the 10th year anniversary of Sitting Ducks Gallery a Deluxe Edition of the game has been designed, adding unique ducks, introducing hilarious new action cards and with new mechanics to modify the gameplay. These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.&#10;&#10;Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&#10;&#10;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&#10;&#10;Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&#10;&#10;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Suez '73: The Battle of Chinese Farm: October 15-22, 1973, is a game about the battle that took place the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces, as part of the Yom Kippur War.&#10;&#10;It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian agricultural research station. The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev (&quot;Stouthearted Men&quot;), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.&#10;&#10;Determined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.&#10;&#10;The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day. Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished control of the routes to the canal, opening them up to the Israelis. The battle is remembered as one of the most costly and brutal battles of the war.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: .9 miles / 1.5 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 27&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (480 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Suez '73 rulebook&#10;One 12-page Suez '73 Historical Notes &amp; Scenario Booklet&#10;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC players aid cards&#10;One single-side printed Turn Record/Israeli Unit Composition players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Egyptian Unit Composition players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Israeli Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Egyptian Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",
