So the overall interior grid of holes is 20x20. Around the edges of the board are 23 additional single holes which are scattered sparsely, with values from 25 to 75.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a seesaw-like device with a hole in one end for placing his or her jacks. Players then 'snap' the other end of the device to fling the jack into the air and (one hopes) into a hole on the board. Jacks that do land in holes on the board score based on where they land.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game uses a space exploration theme to teach players about number bases (binary, octal, decimal, etc.).  Each player starts play with a &quot;matrix card,&quot; a supply of plastic chips and a &quot;flight sheet&quot; for scoring.  Gameplay consists of five flights, each containing two phases: &quot;Blast Off&quot; and &quot;Establishing a Flight Path.&quot;  After five flights have been completed, the player with the highest total score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;During the &quot;Blast Off&quot; phase, the player voted mission commander draws and announces cards from a special deck of playing cards containing the standard four suits but only the numbers 1 through 9 (Ace is replaced by 1, and no face cards are included).  Players place chips on their matrix cards, Bingo-style, until every player has at least one complete row or column of chips.  At this point, players choose from among the 3- and 4-digit numbers filled in on their cards to establish &quot;flight numbers,&quot; which are written on their sheets.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;Establishing a Flight Path&quot; phase, players are dealt cards from a second deck of &quot;base cards.&quot;  Some of these cards contain game-balancing bonuses and penalties which apply only when drawn by players holding specially-marked matrix cards.  The remaining base cards list a planet of the solar system, the number base that the planet represents in the game, and a list of digits which are valid in the planet's base.  For example, Mercury represents binary (base 2), so only digits 0 and 1 are allowed.  The player replaces all illegal digits in his or her flight number with zeroes, then converts the resulting number to decimal using a special base conversion wheel included with the game (except for landings on Pluto, which already represents base 10 and requires no conversion).  The final result is added to his or her score.&#10;&#10;The game includes two sets of rules -- &quot;Brief Instructions&quot; which get players started in just two pages, and a 10-page &quot;Guide Book&quot; which includes more detailed instructions, game variations and mathematical background information.  The game was filed as U.S. Patent 3,618,952.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to have each of your thims on the last four squares of the board.  The player can use the blue arrows to advance up the board if he lands on one and if he lands on a square with a red arrow must slide to the bottom of the arrow.  There are some special squares that force the player to roll a six to move past that square and some that allow the player to roll the dice again.  The most interesting square on the board is the STYMIE square.  If a person gets his thim to land on the STYMIE square no other player may move their thims past him until he moves his thim.  This makes for a burst for the finish ending in many games.  Players may move any of their thims on their turn including ones that may be buried in a stack of other thims as long as they take all thims resting on top of theirs.  This rule does not apply on the top row where only the top thim may move.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly simple game and probably appeals mostly to children.  However there are usually four options for the player on every turn and the race for the finish is usually close.&#10;&#10;",

Each player's skeleton has to travel a round course, collecting party event cards on the way. No skeleton can return before a certain amount of party events have been collected altogether.&#10;&#10;The skeletons are moved with cards, which can be either played as movement points or as actions. Movement points can be used to move the player's own skeleton or the graveyard's dog. The skeletons loose a random bone if the dog encounters them. Actions can for example result in one of the other players loosing a bone or a special movement of the player's own skeleton. The actions also typically have some prerequisites, like having a leg remaining, or being within a certain distance of another skeleton.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded for the position in the race back to the starting point and for collected party events. Winner is the skeleton with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The goblins have been led to the surface of Durach, and have poured across the land like a swarm of raging locusts to devour all of civilization.  The proud City of Elidor has beseeched the local Heroes to help halt the advance of these goblins before they manage to gain a foothold in the region.  So begins the Goblin Invasion.&#10;&#10;The Goblin Invasion deck is an optional event deck depicting the efforts of the Goblin king to conquer the surface world.  If used, whenever a player is instructed to draw a Durach card, the card may be instead drawn from the Goblin Invasion deck.

    "Description": "During the game, players take the role of bystanders, cops, and killers.  These secret identities are revealed throughout the course of the game.  Cops attempt to make an arrest.  Killers attempt to kill their target.  Bystanders can help influence the outcome one way or the other.&#10;&#10;A more informative description: The game comes with a full set of english rules already and its game components are fully language independent.&#10;&#10;Cop &amp; Killer is an interactive game for up to 10 players, where the gameplay focuses on a Killer trying to kill his Target and the Cop tries to capture the Killer before he is on his victim. At the beginning each player randomly receives hidden an identity marker which identifies him either as the Cop, the Killer, the Target or a Bystander. These identity badges are kept by the players in their hands under the table, and before a game round starts the players can secretly exchange the badges on a one to one base so that nobody knows the true identity of the others. The ID badges come in different shapes to avoid looking at the badges while exchanging them, so that the players know which badge they are holding, so there is no need for them to look at them under the table.&#10;&#10;When the badges have been assigned by the players, the meeple in form of a bullet is placed on the gameboard and playing commences. In turn, the players now roll a set of a red and a blue dice, and they may move the bullet clockwise around the board for a number of spaces corresponding to the number rolled with one of the dice. During the course of the game, the identities of the players may be revealed, and when this has happened to Cop, Killer or Target their rules for using the dice will be slightly changed. So, the Cop now must use only the blue dice and moves the bullet clockwise, but he may decide to move less spaces than rolled by the dice, to simulate the chosen path of investigation (coffee ? Yes or no?). The Killer on the other hand uses the red dice and must move the exact number of spaces, but he may chose to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. Finally, the Target may use the result of one or both dice and move the bullet clockwise around the board.&#10;&#10;On the gameboard, the players will encounter a number of spaces which allow them to perform an action, but before describing those actions let me say a little bit more about the mechanics of the gameboard. So, each action space either has a blue or red background colour, depending on whether the action is beneficial for the Cop or the Killer. A player who lands on such a space and performs the action afterwards takes a coin of the corresponding colour, representing either a reward for helping the Police or a bribe for helping the Killer. When the round ends, either the Cop or the Killer will have been successful, earning the player of Cop or Killer one victory point. However, in addition the two players (Bystanders) who helped the successful Cop or Killer most and earned most coins of the winning colour also will be awarded one victory point, and then a new round of play will start until all 10 victory points of either Cop or Killer have been distributed.&#10;&#10;At this place, it becomes important to notice that the gameboard is double sides and can be flipped from a side depicting the Cop's office to the Crime Scene and backwards. The side with the Cop's office shows more actions which are beneficial for the Cop and the players who have chosen to assist him, whereas the side of the Crime Scene features more red actions which can be used by the Killer and his henchmen. The change of both sides of the gameboard is triggered by one space on each side, featuring either a car key or an office key, and the player who move the bullet onto the corresponding space flips the gameboard over and receives a correspondingly coloured coin.&#10;&#10;The action blue spaces which are favourable for the Cop and his assisting players are the following:&#10;&#10;* Circumstancial Evidence: the active player may chose any other player- That player must reveal his identity.&#10;    * Successful Investigation: The Cop has finished his investigations. All identity markers are uncovered.&#10;    * Interrogation: The active player may chose another player and ask him a direct question which must be answered truthfully by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. It may be asked whether the questioned player has a specific identity, and if this turns out to be true the player's identity must be revealed. However, the question may also be of a more indirect nature, only asking whether a player would try to assist the Killer during his next turn etc. In this case, no identity marker will be revealed, but the questioned player is bound to his answer on his following turn.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the following red spaces are more useful for the Killer:&#10;&#10;* Informant: The active player may ask an other player whether he is the Target. If this is ture, the Traget must reveal his identity.&#10;    * Betrayal: The player entering this space must reveal his own identity.&#10;    * Target in sight: The Target must reveal its identity.&#10;&#10;When Cop or Killer are revealed, they discard all coins they have collected during this round, since from now onwards they are pursuing their own aims which are not quite congruent with those of the Bystanders. However, until then they should collect coins and normal, and they possibly have the chance to put the other players onto a wrong track by the colour of coins they collect.&#10;&#10;Finally, there are also a blue and a red action space which lead to the climate of the round: the blue Arrest space and the red Assault space. For an Arrest, the identities of Cop and Killer must be revealed, whereas an Assault needs Killer and Target to be revealed. If the Cop or the Killer decide to act, two dice are rolled, and if the acting player (Cop in case of Arrest, Killer in case of Assault) rolls a higher result on his dice than on the other dice, he may shoot that number of arrows with the included Dartgun at a target marker which has been set up at a chosen distance. If one of the darts hits, the round is over and the shooting player and his two best assistants will have won, but if no hit was scored the game continues. However, if the shooting was successful and if, after the distribution of victory points, all ten victory points of one colour have been used up, the game ends and the player with most victory points will have won.&#10;&#10;Wow, this game plays astonishingly well, and the playing mechanism certainly is not just a vehicle which forms the background for some otherwise senseless dartgun shooting. Quite the opposite, the gameplay is quite multi-faceted and offers a good degree of playing depth which is somewhat counterbalanced by the interactive element of shooting. The guessing and deduction of the players starts at the end of a round when the identity markers have to be exchanged, since no player may keep the badge of Cop, Killer or Target for two consecutive rounds. Depending on the positioning of the players around the table, each player may make some first deductions on who might now have which identity badge. During the game itself, it will be especially the Bystanders who will try to spoil an early victory of Cop or Killer, since they first want to collect enough coins to participate in the distribution of victory points at the end of the round. So, it will always be a few players who want to move for ending the round, while the others want to postpone the inevitable end until the get into a better position themselves. For this reason, especially the Interrogation action is rather useful, since a player who is asked a question is bound to his answer on his following turn. This may lead to a considerable restriction of his actions, depending on the way a question is asked.&#10;&#10;The extensive care which was put into this game is reflected by the artwork, the components (including a very robust and seemingly durable dartgun from a German manufacture) and the body of the rules. Special provisions for only four players for teamplay with 7 to 10 players are included, as well as a full English version of the rules. Even the details are harmonious, with a real-looking bullet as a playing piece and a carboard-piece resembling a yellow &quot;Police Line&quot; which is used to mark off the line after which the shooter must stand. To my mind, Cop &amp; Killer is a really outstanding interactive group game, and with people who do not mind the somewhat violent topic really thrilling games should be possible.&#10;&#10;Most of the text is originally written by kulkmanns gamebox as a review by Frank Schulte-Kulkmann on boardgame.de&#10;&#10;",

Each player uses the same starter deck of cards, but there are apparently additional sets of items available.&#10;&#10;The mages can transform between werewolf, human, and vampire, depending on the cards played. Spells cost cards (resources) to play, and have a series of effects - essentially healing, direct damage, or items that affect future card play.&#10;&#10;Different forms suffer different amounts of damage from various spells - a silver lightning spell, for example, affects werewolves more than humans. The different forms also have got some abilities. The werewolf for example has got the ability darkness more than night, which means the oppenents handsize is decreased by one.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to defeat your opponent a series of times, starting as a mage, and progressing to high mage, and finally to battle mage. Each rank has different life totals and has some effect on gameplay.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Extension and deck constructionFor more experienced players are some extensions available.&#10;With the extensions you are able to setup up your own decks.&#10;Each deck consists of 80 cards. Each card with the same name and the same icon you can take up to 8 cards into your deck. If the text in the middle part of the card has got a different color, you have to take less cards.&#10;Bronze = 4 cards&#10;Silver = 2 cards&#10;Gold = 1 card only&#10;&#10;You always have to play with an evil and undead transformation.&#10;&#10;The extensions have got different levels.&#10;The level of baseset is simple. The extensions demon and necromancer have the levels &quot;difficult&quot; and the extension lich is &quot;profi&quot;.&#10;There are some sample decks in some articles in the web available. The next SpielXpress magazine in decembre will explain some sample decks as well.&#10;&#10;Experienced players should play the game with the extensions right from the beginning.

    "Description": "(from Mikugames website:)&#10;&#10;Germany launched their operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 22nd, 1941. Finland, now a co-belligerent with Germany, took the opportunity to take back the areas lost to the Soviet Union as part of the bitter Winter War peace terms. The almost 200.000 men strong German &ldquo;Armee Norwegen&rdquo;, operating in northern Finland is part of Hitler&rsquo;s operation plan Barbarossa. Finland and Germany are fighting two separate wars against the same enemy. Finnish units reached their objectives in late December, 1941, and a static period in the war began (also called the &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo;). In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army launched a major offensive in the Karelian Isthmus after the withdrawal of the German &ldquo;Heeresgruppe Nord&rdquo; from the Leningrad area. This time the Finnish units couldn&rsquo;t hold back the thrust. Viipuri (Vyborg) was lost and the situation was critical. The largest battle in the Northern Europe took place in Tali-Ihantala, where German Stukas supported the Finnish units. Like a miracle, the Finns and Germans managed to halt the Soviet onslaught, and because Stalin was eager to reach Berlin before the Americans, he decided to withdraw a number of units from the Finnish front. Finland was again saved by the bell.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The second game of the trilogy is the largest. Now the Germans make an entrance with a wide variety of units and special rules. The Soviet side gets the Guards units as well as numerous of new air unit types. The grande campaign 1941-1944, can take up to 155 turns! Relax, in the middle of the campaign, approximately from Jan. I '42 to Jun. I '44, there will be a special feature, called the Position War (Entrenchment War), which will speed up the playing considerably.&#10;&#10;There are also two shorter scenarios included, that suites very well for introduction; the 1941-scenario (Jun. IV '41 &ndash; Dec. IV '41 = 26 turns) and the 1944-scenario (Jun. II '44 &ndash; Sept. I '44 = 12 turns). In the 1941-scenario, the Finnish/German side has an advantage, while in the 1944-scenario, the Soviet side has an advantage.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include twelve countersheets in a total of 3.192 die-cut unit counters! Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&#10;&#10;The Mapboard&#10;The map will be 100 cm x 140 cm (39&rdquo; x 55&rdquo;) in four pieces, depicting Finland and its' vicinity in &quot;summer&quot; colors with additional Railroads and Airfields as well as some new Marker boxes. The borderline also runs differently compared to the Winter War mapboard.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;A 48-page coloured rule book includes basic, advanced and optional game rules.&#10;&#10;Order of Battle (OOB)&#10;The three full-colour OOBs (one Finnish, German and Soviet) include a HUGE Main Campaign; a 1941, and a 1944-scenario; and seven Small Scenarios: (1) Litsa '41, (2) Salla '41, (3) Kestenga-Ukhta '41-'42, (4) Rugozero, (5) Ladoga Karelia '41, (6) Karelian Isthmus '41, and (7) Karelian Isthmus '44. See further in the Beta News menu. A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.&#10;&#10;Production Volume&#10;340 boxed copies were produced.&#10;&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Main Campaign&#10;    Extended Campaign (with an emphasis that the Soviet Union would attack Finland early in the campaign '41)&#10;    2 Large Scenarios (using all rules) (1941-Scenario and 1944-Scenario)&#10;    7 Small Scenarios (#1 Litsa '41; #2 Salla '41; #3 Kestenga-Ukhta '41 [+'42]; #4 Rugozero '41; #5 Ladoga Karelia '41 (1st attack phase); #6 Karelian Isthmus '41; and #7 Karelian Isthmus '44)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Mikugames website:)&#10;&#10;Officially the Lapland War started with the Finnish naval landing at Tornio (at the Swedish border) October 1st, 1944. This was a bold surprise attack in the Germans back, the former brother in arms. Since September 4th, 1944, Finland was no longer at war with the Red Army, as the so called Continuation War had ended. One tough part of the peace terms was, that all German units were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Because this was impossible, due to the fact that there was over 210.000 Germans in the northern Finland, the former brothers in arms had to fight each other under the supervision of the Soviet control commission. In the Barents Sea region, in an attempt to crush the German &ldquo;20.Gebirgs-Armee&rdquo; once and for all, the Soviet Army launched a large-scale attack called the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation. The last Germans left the Finnish soil in April, 1945.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The final volume of the trilogy is an expansion, also loaded with a lot of extra features for the complete trilogy. In other words, to be able to fully use this package, ownership of both the earlier volumes is a requirement. The Lapland War game includes also the German operations &quot;Tanne West&quot; and &quot;Tanne Ost&quot; as well as the &quot;Birke&quot; and &quot;Nordlicht&quot; plans. The Lapland War game is divided in two separate battles, the one between the retreating Germans and Finnish units and the one between the German Mountain Corps and the Red Army north of the polar circle.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include one countersheet in a total of 266 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&#10;&#10;The Mapboard&#10;No map is included in the Lapland War expansion.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;A 8-page coloured rule booklet includes special rules for the Lapland War expansion.&#10;&#10;Order of Battle (OOB)&#10;The three full-colour OOBs (Finnish, German and Soviet) include a Main Campaign and two Small Scenarios: (1) Tornio-Kemi '44, and (2) Petsamo-Kirkkenes '44. See further in the Beta News menu. A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.!&#10;&#10;Production Volume&#10;300 boxed copies and 40 ziplock copies were produced.&#10;&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Main Campaign&#10;    2 Small Scenarios (#1 Petsamo-Kirkenes '44 and #2 Kemi-Tornio '44 [FIN vs. GER])&#10;    2 Special Scenarios (Tanne West and Tanne Ost '44)&#10;    Special feature to link Vol. 2 with Vol. 3. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "8 Dragons is basically a memory game. At the start of the game the 42 cards are laid out in a 6x7 tableau. The goal of the game is not to find as many pairs as possible. In each turn you will turn over two cards. If they match either on form or on color you can take them in your hand. As an extra bonus for matching form you can take another turn.&#10;&#10;Since a player has a hand limit of 4 cards you will most likely need to place cards back in the tableau in order to collect a full set of 4 cards which form a dragon. Different color dragons are of different rarity and also score a different amount of points. Add to that a few cards which either give you a bonus or a penalty when you turn them over and you have the game 8 Dragons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rules to recreate battles of the American revolution period based on the warmaster rules.&#10;&#10;The rules were published in Wargames Journal magazine Number 6. There are several scenarios and a campaign system in numbers 7 and 8 of the same magazine.&#10;&#10;Several scenarios are available: Guildford courthouse, Brandywine (4 players) and 3 small actions from the same battle, Camden, Monmouth, Germantown.&#10;&#10;Requirements:&#10;&#10;Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), suppression markers, tape measures, a 4x4&rsquo; or 4x6&rsquo; playing area with appropriate terrain, and suitable miniatures. Typically is used 6mm miniatures on 40x20mm bases (unit faces long side) but the only real requirement is a standardized basing scheme. You may wish to use inches instead of centimeters with 15mm or larger figures.&#10;&#10;Game Overview:&#10;&#10;The game follows a ugo-igo pattern of alternating player turns. Games end when one side achieves its objectives or breaks due to mounting casualties.&#10;Each side operates several units. A unit represents either a company (60 men) or a battalion (600 men) and normally comprises three stands (or bases) of troops that always remain in contact. &#10;Officers and generals are represented by individual bases. Their role is to give their units or groups of units (called brigades) orders. Each officer and general has a command value assigned&mdash;a higher command value indicates a more capable officer and general.&#10;The crux of the game is the activation system. The player with the initiative (i.e., whose turn it is) identifies an officer or general and the unit(s) the officer or general wishes to order. &#10;Shooting is resolved with a single die roll (but many dice!) while melee requires a single competing die roll. Units can be suppressed or routed and stands can be killed. Over time, mounting casualties reduce the combat effectiveness of a unit.&#10;&#10;",

Horus thus combines elements of strategy, chance and luck.&#10;&#10;The game is composed of a the three-dimensional board, an obelisk, 40 playing pieces and gemstones. Except for the gemstones and a thin metal ring, the game components are made completely from THETA-Stone, a new substance developed by Theta.
