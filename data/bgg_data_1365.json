    "Description": "Millennia: Tracks of Time is a competitive civilization game for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s setting spans several millennia, a time span of thousands of years. Players go through eight ages, from the ancient to medieval ages, to the modern age, and finally to the near future, until the player with most fame wins. The game features more than 300 unique cards with more than 200 distinct illustrations showcasing historical inventions, buildings, and wonders. Your goal is to acquire the most advantageous cards to advance different aspects of your civilization, like research, military, population, prosperity, and culture.&#10;&#10;Millennia utilizes a mix of drafting, engine building, and set collection mechanisms, all while introducing a unique twist with the concept of obsolescence. As time progresses, acquired technology and building cards will become obsolete, lasting only one to four ages before they must be discarded. This feature allows for the pursuit of various strategies during gameplay and, combined with the vast array of buildings and wonders, variable setup, and rich thematic elements, creates an incredibly replayable experience.&#10;&#10;Each age has several phases during which the players:&#10;&#10;&#10;     draft new technology cards from that specific era&#10;     acquire important buildings and famous wonders&#10;     simultaneously use their technologies and buildings to increase various aspects of their civilization&#10;     compare their military strength with that of their opponents to determine the strongest force&#10;&#10;&#10;After 8 ages, the player with most victory points is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Reveal is a dynamic and engaging board game with a difference: there are no questions, only answers!&#10;&#10;Reveal can be played as individuals or in teams and the object of the game is to guess the hidden movie, TV show and song titles to gain medals and walk the red carpet to be crowned Champion of the Titles.&#10;&#10;The answer card is loaded into the Reveal card sleeve and then the card is pulled out to reveal only the first letter of each of the words in the title. The player then has two guesses, or 30 seconds, to correctly name the title and win three medals. An incorrect guess will result in the second letter of each of the title words being revealed but the quicker the title is guessed the more medals that are won! Once a player has scooped 15 medals it is time to head for the winner&rsquo;s square at the centre of the board via any of the Red Carpet routes. In order to be crowned the ultimate Champion of the Titles a player must solve one final title from a category chosen by an opponent!&#10;&#10;",

Magic, specialty powers unique to your faction, and the ability to defend against incoming attacks are only a few of the powerful mechanics that augment the classic title into something completely different and exciting; Dead Man's Curse! 30+ unique factions exist in the game so far with more to come!&#10;&#10;Players on their turn will roll a D6 to see if they can draw a boost card (attaches to a figure and changes how it moves or plays), Draw an Epic Card (these are powerful game-changing events), or in some cases use their factions ability.  Regardless of what they do they move to the Battlefield phase where they draw a card that will allow them to move up to 2 pieces if not more plus they also can make a normal move with any piece. All figures move just like normal chess figures would but that is the only tie to Chess. Don't fear getting your King into the battle as they are your most powerful fighter and can devastate the foe and losing it doesn't lose you the game.&#10;&#10;Throw out any pre-conceptions you know about classic Chess, because new moves, accelerated gameplay, and the ability to defend against incoming attacks on each and every combat sets Dead Man's Chess far apart from its predecessor. Strategy is not enough; Luck is not enough&hellip; you will need both to win!&#10;&#10;",

It is designed by Max Brooke (Star Wars: X-Wing 2nd Edition, Legend of the Five Rings RPG) with Luke Eddy (Star Wars: Legion).&#10;&#10;Generational Storytelling&#10;In Stonesaga, you unfold the epoch-spanning story of the people of a remote glacial valley, guiding multiple generations of characters who make a life there amidst harsh conditions, wondrous mysteries, and giant monsters.&#10;&#10;Each game session covers one generation of people within a society, continuing from the last and permanently changing the valley in various ways based on in-game events and the players&rsquo; decisions.&#10;&#10;Cooperative Survival&#10;Stonesaga follows a certain rhythm: faced by a new opportunity or crisis, the people of the valley must meet their society&rsquo;s new needs. Meanwhile, the valley&rsquo;s other inhabitants &ndash; immortal beasts &ndash; will seek to fulfill their own needs as their instincts dictate. You will have to navigate both sets of challenges, using might, dexterity, conviction, and awareness to survive as a tribe in the wild.&#10;&#10;Crafting &amp; Building&#10;Stonesaga introduces a completely new discovery based crafting mechanic. Do you think that a sharpened stone and stick could combine to create a spear? Use the crafting action and find out. You will need to discover the properties of various crafting materials as you expand your crafting &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; knowledge.&#10;&#10;Work together as a community to build your village together. From a simple fire pit and tent to a forge and library, create a civilization that lasts the generations.&#10;&#10;Exploration &amp; Discovery&#10;Stonesaga rewards exploration and chooses to let you experience the world in a unique way each play session. Working on the established rules of the world, you will discover unique materials, monsters, and areas of the world that you won&rsquo;t be directed towards. Stonesaga lets the curious and inquisitive thrive.&#10;&#10;Persistence&#10;Designed for drop-in, drop-out play and flexible playgroup availability, Stonesaga can be played by one group from start to finish, played with a rotating cast, or even passed between groups seamlessly. Components are sometimes permanently altered, but never removed or discarded entirely.&#10;&#10;",

They will go to meet the trials, armed only with their talents, will, knowledge, and with the help of faithful familiars - magical animals. Descending into the dungeons of the tower, players find themselves in the very center of the labyrinth. All possible routes diverge from it, and the most distant rooms contain spell scrolls, only all passages are protected by magical seals of the four elements.&#10;&#10;The search takes place in rounds, at the beginning of each of which the players, in turn, take three different-colored dice from the general supply and roll them. Sinces the mage can easily move from one point of the dungeons to another, if there is no obstacle in his way, it is very important not to give rivals a chance to steal the scroll from under your nose. To do this, you need to skillfully occupy strategically important passages with the chips of your mage and familiar. The collected scrolls not only bring victory points, but also allow you to manipulate dice, seal tokens lying on the playing field, and even the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game end when a rounds ends with the number of scrolls with a strength of 6 is checked (at least 3 for 2-3 players or at least 4 for 4-5 players).&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points (the sum of all his scrolls and bonus points for spells).&#10;&#10;There was room for five circles of magic in the box, and only two of them (one basic and one additional set of scrolls) are used in each batch. Each circle of magic has its own specialization, so their choice affects the nature of what is happening in the dungeons of the tower. This allows you to diversify the game and provides high replayability.&#10;&#10;",

A mini game might even be added!&#10;&#10;Every round, players change their character and a new Event is drawn, changing either the rules or the scoring of the round. Then, according to the rules of the base game, three Forbidden Letters and a Discussion theme are drawn. The player to the left of the Queen of Hearts presses the teapot to start the timer and the game begins. &#10;Each player has to say a word, suitable to the Discussion theme while avoiding the Forbidden Letters before the time runs out. If they successfully do so, they reset the timer and the next player has to give their own word. If someone doesn't say a suitable word in time they are out for the round and when only one player remains the round ends. The longer each player stays in a round, the more points they are awarded.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The team scores points for each word guessed correctly. There&rsquo;s a twist, though: in each round, you have to describe or guess the words in a particular way. For example, sometimes the describer can use just 3 words; sometimes their teammates can make just 1 guess!  Each of the 10 rounds presents a fresh challenge.&#10;&#10;There are 5 categories of word to describe: people and places, adjectives(descriptions), nouns (things and ideas)      ,verbs(actions), and phrases. The words can be described in any order. However, in each round there is a key word worth 1 extra point, so it&rsquo;s often best to start with this.&#10;&#10;You can play LOQ in 2 ways:&#10;Cooperatively; with everyone together against the game, or &#10;Competitively; with teams of two or more players competing against each other.  It&rsquo;s a lot of fun either way!&#10;&#10;The game ends after 10 rounds and lasts about 10 minutes per team. In competitive games, the team with most points wins. If you are playing a cooperative game, check your score against the ratings card for the difficulty level you played at. Was your performance Excellent or just Ordinary?&#10;&#10;DIFFICULTY LEVELS&#10;There are a staggering 6000 words and phrases to describe and guess! These are divided into four levels of difficulty: &#10;Level 1 (yellow) &#10;Level 2 (green)&#10;Level 3 (red)&#10;Level 4 (blue)&#10;&#10;",

Then place the Eidolon anywhere on the Map.&#10;&#10;Powers:&#10;Hierarchy (Ongoing): The Eidolon generates 1 Power during the Gather Power Phase. He can be Captured like any Cultist and is Recruited, rather than Summoned. He cannot Create or Control Gates.&#10;&#10;Eldritch Wisdom (Ongoing): If the Eidolon is in play, after any player's Action you can force each player to write down his or her next Action and then flip this Loyalty Card face-down. Example: an enemy who plans to Move must write &quot;Move&quot; but he need not say which Units are Moving, nor to where. On each player's next Action, they must perform that Action unless it is now impossible to do so. In this case another Action may be taken. Flip this Loyalty Card faceup in the next Doom Phase.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Factions of Sol, humanity launched an early space-age in 1927, spearheaded by Mark Megacore, CEO of MegaCore Inc. In the years following, factions grew their power in various regions of the solar system, establishing a tense but stable status quo&ndash;until Mark Megacore announced his retirement. Now, the mega-billionaire&rsquo;s entire fortune is at stake, and everyone in Sol is racing to earn it. You will take command of one of these 8 factions and do your best to bring them to victory. The path you choose is up to you&ndash;and could lead to unimaginable riches.&#10;&#10;But like all things, accomplishing your mission is easier said than done. To impress Megacore, your ship must travel from planet to planet by spending energy onto the board. But moving into a sector costs energy equal to the amount already in the sector, plus one. Because the energy cost is exponential, the board locks down fast. And your ship can only recharge on one planet: Mercury. So while you may need to travel all the way to Neptune, you also need to make sure you can make it back.&#10;&#10;Each player only gets one movement and action per turn. Actions include using Mars to upgrade your ship, obtaining explorers at Venus, picking up secret objectives at Saturn, and more. But many actions cost resources, which can only be mined from asteroids. Each round, a limited amount of asteroids are placed on the board. Getting to them before your competitors is key. When a player can&rsquo;t take a movement or an action, they must pass. When all players pass, the board is cleared of energy and the race to planets and resources begins again.&#10;&#10;At the end of the third round, the game ends and you total up your victory points from machine upgrades, explored exoplanets, secret objectives, and resources. Knowing this, you may want to come up with a plan and stick to it. But just when you think you have your strategy figured out, a number of things might stand in your way&ndash; or help you cross the finish line.&#10;&#10;Gameplay highights.&#10;&#10;-Stellar events: Each round, players can vote between two game-changing options, each of which break the game in a new way. Make sure your favored event is chosen, or you may be left behind when it takes effect.&#10;-Orbiting planets: Throughout the game, the planets will orbit, mimicking the actual movement of planets in our solar system. Players can use them to perform well-planned slingshot maneuvers.&#10;-Faction abilities and machines: Each faction has a special ability and machine that changes the way they interact with the game. When used well, your faction ability and machine can give you a much-needed boost.&#10;&#10;",

After performing their actions, any supply crates that currently exist within a player's supply chain will move according to their capacity.  After cargo crates have moved along the supply line, players end their turn by building additional supply crates at any and all factories the player has constructed.&#10;&#10;Once a player has successfully delivered 25 crates from their factories to the center tile (City tile) they win the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Five Deadly Venoms is a 3-player 18-card game that plays in 15-25 minutes. Each round, one player will face off against the other 2, attempting to earn coins by winning precisely the number of hands that they bid. The first player to win 7 coins, wins the game.&#10;&#10;The name and theme come from a classic (1978) martial arts movie by the same name. It featured 5 evenly-matched deadly assassins whose techniques were based on venomous creatures. No one assassin could beat another but by teaming up, two might beat one.&#10;&#10;The special features of the game are:&#10;&#10;     Every hand pits one player against the other two.&#10;     The deck is comprised of one wild card (the Student), and 17 cards split among 5 suits with a carefully-crafted uneven distribution of card values among the suits.&#10;     Hands are resolved by comparing the two cards played by the lone player against two cards played (one each) by the other two players.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is presented as a free print-and-play. The rules reference a bid token, but it is optional. The bid token is a disc with a numeral &quot;3&quot; on one side and a &quot;4&quot; on the other. It indicates who bid and how many hands they bid. The rules also mention 21 tokens/coins. These are used for tracking the score. Use any tokens you prefer or keep track of the score with paper and pencil.&#10;&#10;I recommend keeping a copy of the card distribution (the last page of the rulebook) out in front of players. It helps players keep track of the unconventional distribution of the cards among the suits.&#10;&#10;I really hope you enjoy the game. It's small and quick, but it has some depth in the play. If you're familiar with Euchre, it's a bit like a 3-player version in which one player always goes alone.&#10;&#10;It's a nice filler for when you're waiting for other players to arrive.&#10;&#10;",

He even managed to fire an arrow throw the circular centre of a silvermoon that was thrown high in the air while blindfolded! But Shiho Shota is far more than trick-shots and showing off for the crowd; he has dedicated his entire life to mastering the bow, so much so that it is not an instrument in his hands but an extension of his body and fierce fighting spirit. The years have been hard on Shiho Shota, always hunted and on the run from the Dragon usurper, but such is his resolve; he has never let this wear him down. It has only doubled his will to fight now that the Black Eagle has flown home!&#10;&#10;If you wish to run a Shiho warband with a ranged element, Shota is the perfect addition. He can reliably shoot anything. While his ordinary Dai Kyu shots are excellent, his ability to ignore LoS (Line of Sight) while shooting pushes him to the next level! However, the cost of an additional reload marker makes this a complex trade-off. His melee ability is average for Shiho Samurai, but he can benefit from an Enhancement Equipment weapon card. His melee ability is good enough to finish off the enemy models he has already damaged with his bow.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kyudo, the art of archery, has long been the pastime of the Samurai and those that perfect it become known as Kyudoka. It is extremely rare and frowned upon for anyone other than Samurai to take up a bow for whatever reason. However, the Shiho, with little access to black powder, have made the bow a formidable part of their arsenal. Shiho Shota, a master of Kyudo, has been training loyal Shiho Ashigaru to use this weapon to devastating effect. They can fire several volleys and disappear into the underbrush before an enemy force can even sound a call-to-arms. Shiho Hiroto, never one for rules or archaic tradition was ecstatic to learn that he had some of the finest archers in Jwar who were not Samurai but loyal Ashigaru instead. Shiho Hiroto is a champion of the people and not the power that forces them into submission.&#10;They may only be Ashigaru, but they have a pool of three ranged and access to the Lightweight trait, making them some of the best missile troops in Bushido. For 14 Rice, they have outstanding Range - and Strength - and can keep their distance to stay safe. With the Eagle Feather Arrow as a choice, it gives them that chance to let loose that one vital shot that must do damage at all costs.&#10;&#10;Blister contains two miniatures, 30mm bases and a full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your first day at the lab, you are introduced to your new little friend, and together, you will discover new possibilities for rat intelligence.&#10;&#10;In Mouse Maze, players represent young scientists working on various experiments, building the best mouse maze to maximize the mouse's path, trying to get through the most cheese and candy (positive points) while avoiding or closing the mousetraps (negative points).&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a flip and write game in which the players draw the walls of the maze, but it's the opponent who will trace the path (and of course, he&rsquo;ll make the worst route possible). In each turn, one card is flipped to determine which kind of walls the players can draw, some of them including more cheese, candies, or new mousetraps.&#10;&#10;The game has a campaign with 30 exciting episodes (split into 10 chapters) that can be played by 1 to 4 players. New rules, objectives and game elements are introduced with each episode, giving players new choices and strategies (without destroying any components). For players who do not want to experience the campaign, each episode can also be played independently of the campaign and out of order, as well as increasing the number of possible players.&#10;&#10;That's 30 games in one, and you can choose the best one for you!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After leaving Hell, L. enters Purgatory and finds it being consumed by shadows. Using the energy of her soul, she tries to fight off the darkness, but it may just be enough to shine the path and escape. You will take on the role of L. to save her from being consumed...lost...forgotten...&#10;&#10;Purgatorio is a beautiful solo game inspired by Dante's journey in the Divine Comedy. In this game, you will manage L.'s soul's energy and try to light the forest up. Her energy is greatly limited, so you must figure out a way to recycle it as much as you need. The darkness will come, and it will reduce her energy to zero, so be quick...but clever.&#10;&#10;During a turn, you will use up to two Energy cards and resolve the effect depending on the combination and placement of those cards; these effects are revealing and/or moving through Purgatory tiles, storing and restoring Energy (cards), and dealing with the Shadows (cards). Your objective is to reveal 18 tiles before you lose all your energy or lose 8 tiles to the shadows. The Shadow cards will be cycling in and out of your deck depleting your cards and the tiles.&#10;&#10;If you want to help playtest the game, you can find it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965489069&#10;And here is a questionary you can fill up: https://forms.gle/5nruRtZSvkMyP5ps5&#10;I'll be updating the game accordingly :)&#10;&#10;",

The land of the Britons was in his power, and he wrought castles therein&hellip;and extorted from his subjects many marks of gold, and many hundred pounds of silver, which he took of his people, for little need, by right and by unright.  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 1087 &#10;&#10;King Edward the Confessor of England did not prepare well for his death. To avoid trouble, he promised his kingdom to King Magnus Olafsson of Norway (a claim inherited by Harald Hardrada), King Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark, Duke William of Normandy, and Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex. When Edward died on the fifth day of January 1066, these four powerful warlords raised armies to back their claims by force. William the Conqueror won the crown but had to defend his new kingdom from fresh invasions and rebellious barons. To formalise his control of the kingdom after twenty years of conquest, he ordered a Great Survey in 1085, a record so final and unalterable that it was named Domesday.&#10;&#10;Domesday is a card driven game depicting the Norman Conquest of England from 1066 to 1106. The players control Normans, Barons, English, Danes, Norse, Scots, Welsh, and Irish, playing cards to resolve Events or use Marks to activate their units. Players win by earning the most victory points through controlling, contesting, or plundering areas, building cathedrals and towers, and making their leader the King of England.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rome, LLC. is a game of the Eastern Byzantine Empire and Western Frankish Empire from the unification of the Frankish Kingdom by King Chlothar II in 613 CE. to the disastrous defeat of Emperor Romanos IV to the Seljuk Turks at Manzikert in 1071 CE, which precipitated the Crusades.&#10; Heraclius overthrew the Emperor Phocas in 610 CE, but his prolonged war with Persia weakened the Byzantine Empire, which almost collapsed to the might of Islam and the invading Avars, Bulgars, and Slavs. The Empire survived thanks to the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, the secret of Greek Fire, and capable leaders such as John Kurkuas, John Tzimiskes, and Basil the Bulgar-Killer, who reconquered territory lost to the barbarians.&#10;&#10;King Chlothar II united the Frankish Kingdom in 613 CE, but his inept successors were replaced by the warlord Charles Martell, who repelled the Islamic Invasion at Tours in 732 CE. His grandson Charlemagne invaded Germany, Spain, and Italy and in 800 CE was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III, reviving the Western Roman Empire. Like its predecessor the Frankish Empire slowly fell apart, divided by civil war, and devastated by Norse and Magyar raiders. The last Carolingian ruler died in 987 CE and the empire split into warring kingdoms.&#10;&#10;Two players may play Rome, LLC. one controlling the Eastern Byzantine Empire and the other the Western Frankish Empire. The Byzantines have the larger, wealthier, empire, but their enemies are more dangerous. The weaker economy of the Franks makes them more dependent on allies and marcher lords to guard the frontier and must expand their kingdom into an empire. Each plays their own game side-by-side, with their own statesmen and units, co-operating against invading Arabs, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Moors, Norse, Rus, Saxons, Seljuks, and Slavs. The game may be played solitaire, with the player either controlling one empire, or both at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each empire has its own statesmen who are made emperors, kings, governors, or rebels. They are rated for their military, administration, religion, and intrigue abilities, and each has a special ability. St Boniface reformed the Frankish Church and the evangelist of Germany, so is a Western Statesman with 1 Military ability, 4 Administration ability, 5 Religious ability, 2 Intrigue ability, and the Convert special ability.&#10;&#10;The map has provinces grouped into commands with their own governors, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, fights wars, but may assassinate their emperor or rebel and start a civil war. Emperors counters are used to change commands and rules and determine which statesmen of the new dynasty will become emperor, regardless of their abilities (or lack thereof).&#10;Cavalry, Guards, Auxilia, Forts, and Fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces, with some provinces held by allies or marcher lords to protect the frontier from barbarians. Enemy leaders and wars move from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, and shrink the empires. Fighting a war may result in a triumph, which removes the war, increases prestige, reduces unrest, generates gold, and annexes provinces, but may also lead to a disaster or bloody stalemate.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by winning Prestige, which is earned by imperial administration, annexing provinces, defeating wars, and financing prestige projects. The loss of both Constantinople and Rome to the barbarians results in defeat, but bankruptcy and unrest can also drive an empire to destruction.&#10;&#10;Rome, LLC. uses the system from Rome, Inc. (ATO 53). Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each scenario. The five scenarios start in 610 CE, 711 CE, 814 CE, 888 CE, and 973 CE which may be combined into campaign games. Players may continue the scenarios from Rome, Inc. and Rome, IInc. into Rome, LLC. allowing them to play 17 consecutive scenarios covering 1500 years of history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your Father has provided a country large enough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass grows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours forever.&#10;&#10;President Andrew Jackson&#10;&#10;AS LONG AS THE GRASS GROWS is a board game that adapts the COIN Series developed by GMT Games to the Conquest of the American West from 1845-1881. Players use Events, Commands and Special Abilities to place and move pieces on the map to achieve victory. The players take the roles of four Factions; the Great Plains Tribal Faction (GP) consisting of the Comanche and their Kiowa allies; and the Dakota, Lakota, Yankton, and Yanktonai Sioux with their Arapaho, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, and Cree allies. The Northwestern Tribal Faction (NW) has the Chinook, Modoc, Nez Perce, Rogues, Umatilla, Yakima of the Pacific Northwest; the Yaqui of Mexico; the Navajo enemies of the Apaches; and the Crow, Flathead, and Pawnee enemies of the Sioux. The Southwestern Tribal Faction (SW) has the Chiricahua, Lipan, Mescalero and Western Apaches, their Mojave and Yuma allies, and the Bannock, Paiute, Shoshone, and Ute Tribes of the Great Basin. The United States Faction (US) includes the federal, state and territorial governments; the US Army; and militia, miners, pioneers, settlers, buffalo hunters, and railroad companies.&#10;&#10;Cards are drawn from the deck one at time, with one card in play and the following card face up on top of the deck. Each Event card shows the order in which Eligible Factions may choose to resolve the Event or one of their own Commands, sometimes with one of their Special Abilities. Resolving an Event or Command makes the Faction Ineligible for the next card. President Events interrupt play as the Factions determine victory, collect revenue, pay upkeep, make treaties, and relocate pieces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In Rainbow Blvd. players are animal architects, tasked with completing city plans and private contracts with the goal of gaining the most prestige to become the next head architect at the rainbow factory.&#10;&#10;Rainbow Blvd. is played over a series of days (rounds).  Each day begins with players acquiring city plan cards that will reward them for building specific rainbow segments and arcs around the city.  However, take on too many city plans, and there is a risk of losing prestige for uncompleted work.&#10;&#10;While the rainbow factory pays well, there are always opportunities for private contracts to help.  The 6 local color companies that produce the materials used by the rainbow factory want their hues to be used whenever possible.  Each is willing to offer more prestige to whomever completes their various goals.&#10;&#10;The player who manages to collect the most prestige points before spring is the winner and new head architect at the rainbow factory! Rainbow Blvd. utilizes several fun mechanics including action selection, hand management, a time track, set collections, and more, resulting in a wonderfully beautiful experience around any game table!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Argentinian compilation of Laska and Chaos.&#10;&#10;&#10;World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker developed Laska (a.k.a. Lasca), a variant of the Checkers Family, in 1911. The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Chaos, The object of the game is to move your six playing pieces from one side of the board to the opposite side.  The game is played by either two or four players.  The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.&#10;&#10;",

Take control of a new generation of explorers, the most valued members of Summer's End who go out every day in search of food, materials, or other resources that the village uses to survive:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Narii, who believes there's something in the nearby mountain range that can help the village survive.&#10;    Narii's sister Iris, a village guard who helps fend off the bandits who steal valuable resources and materials.&#10;    The apprentice blacksmith, Jasper, who has been trying to build something impressive enough for his teacher for seven years.&#10;    Or, finally, Ouop, a mysterious robot who assists the villagers but can communicate only by saying his name.&#10;&#10;&#10;Fire for Light is a campaign-driven game played out over at least fifteen chapters. During each chapter, you set up a new scenario with new enemies and objectives. Most importantly, players are given choices that will change the outcome of their games and give them access to different rewards or shape future chapters differently.&#10;&#10;A chapter is played over several rounds, each culminating in daylight progressing to darkness. Fire for Light uses a unique &quot;Awareness&quot; system to determine which characters (both friend and foe) activate. When an explorer takes their turn, they utilize actions they have available from different sources such as item or ability cards, their explorer mats, or other scenario-specific actions. These allow the characters to move, attack, gather resources, explore the wilderness, or countless other effects. When an enemy activates, they follow behaviors from top-to-bottom and roll a number of dice whenever they move.&#10;&#10;Make your choices and uncover the mystery of this snowy world in Fire for Light!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is unofficially based on the popular video game series Touhou Project which introduced the 'bullet hell' mode of play.&#10;&#10;In the card game, players choose two of four characters to compete, and each character has their own deck of 18 cards, from which 12 are used.&#10;&#10;The game also uses dice to enable cards to be played and for characters to build up their strengths on a character board. The dice have four symbols, a red sun, a blue moon, a green star, and a black Taijitu symbol (popularly known in the West as Yin and Yang). Players roll the six dice, and can hold two and re-roll the rest.&#10;&#10;The decks include Barrage cards for bullet hell, which can be used offensively or defensively. Players use their dice rolls to bring cards into play, and then activate them next turn. The goal is to exhaust your opponent's hit points to win the battle and the game.&#10;&#10;Players make tactical choices as they develop their decks, but the game also carries a dose of luck with the dice.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;Shoot back!

    "Description": "An Argentinian trivia game about famous quotes.&#10;&#10;More than 1,300 famous, funny or curious phrases present you with as many challenges: try to remember or guess who said them and, if you succeed, advance on the board in a wild race with the other players.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a roll of the dice will tell you which question to answer. There are always several options to choose from and where your memory fails, your wits or luck can pull you through. Those who get it right advance on the board, and the first to complete two laps wins.&#10;&#10;Those old television ads, the slogans (and the whores) of politicians, the reflections of writers and philosophers, the most quoted sayings, the statements of actors, stars, kings and rockers are material for fun and memory in a fascinating game, ideal for meetings between friends or family. Also included is a variant to read and play individually.&#10;&#10;",
