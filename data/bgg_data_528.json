Despite opening the engagement with a successful flank march against two smaller Confederate armies, which had only just combined, the Union army would end the day in a disastrous rout back to Washington, D.C.&#10;&#10;The design of Baptism at Bull Run is based on the highly regarded Bonaparte at Marengo (Simmons Games). In addition to modifying elements of its Napoleonic predecessor to reflect the character of the Civil War battle, Baptism at Bull Run expands on the earlier game's command rules with the addition of a simple card play system that varies each player's command points from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a large map of the battlefield. The military units that participated (or could have participated) in the actual battle are represented by 72 pieces, with many additional pieces provided to represent units reduced by casualties or reorganized into smaller or larger formations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Firefight Games website:&#10;&#10;Mamontov&rsquo;s offensive was launched by Denikin on August 10, 1919, and quickly broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk creating a serious threat.&#10;&#10;It consisted primarily of the 4th Don Cavalry Corps (8500 Cavalry), 3000 infantry, although fully supported with a few tanks, armor cars, and aircraft. Over 300 vehicles provided various duties, as well. The chosen sector for the attack lay between the Red 8th and 9th Armies and was not covered well&mdash;it was very porous. The Red 36th and 40th divisions held the 100 km section of the line (with gaping holes where 40km was not covered) through which Mamontov's corps&rsquo; passed. Mamontov used air reconnaissance to find a sector where his cavalry could slip through without serious opposition to avoid contact with Bolshevik units and struck deep into the Red rear with orders to wreck the rail lines and destroy military stores as they advanced.&#10;&#10;The Mamontov Offensive ripped through the Red lines and at lightening speed made incredible advances into the rear of the Red beast- 125 miles! Both Trotsky and Lenin were very concerned about the White advance and the ineptness of their own troops, many of which defected to Mamontov at Tambov, a supply center. Like the panzers of WW2, the White cavalry seemed unstoppable. So much so, that Red air units were sent flying to find them and attack.&#10;&#10;Like all White attacks, it too, had begun well. However, Mamontov's men were not professionals, they more like mercenaries and were easily diverted to looting, mayhem and rape, which turned the local population against them. By Sept 10, many of his men had simply went home with the loot and soon he found himself and those that remained in a &quot;situation&quot; at Voronezh nearly surrounded as Red troops had finally gathered. Denikin ordered his Kuban Corps to attack from the south to divert Red divisions against Mamontov, and for the next week, a bitter battle ensued with Mamomtov trying to breakout.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 22x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. Scale is 3 days to a turn, 3-4 miles a hex, brigades. A very fast moving game as time plays against the Whites&#10;&#10;NOTE: Rules are split between an 11-page &quot;Russian Civil War Series' core rulebook (actually 11 loose sheets printed single-sided), and a 5-page double sided Rampage special rules book (joined by a single staple). Counters are on a single sheet of paper and must be mounted &amp; cut. The map is on two 11x17&quot; sheets and must be joined together.&#10;&#10;",

The Finnish player tries to play a defensive response with a higher total Force Value than the Soviet cards. If the total Force Value of the Soviet cards is higher, the different in Force Values represents the number of casualties suffered by the Finns and is subtracted from the Finish troop count.&#10;&#10;The player wins if there are no cards left in the Soviet deck and there are still troops remaining. If all 100 of the Finnish troops are killed, then the player loses.&#10;&#10;",

Political Factions tear the otherwise stable American political system into two deeply divided camps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The President (Eagle Faction) under the Homeland Defense Amendment has moved to the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado just outside of Denver, in order to counter what he called the growing internal threats to the American way of Life. He is isolationist and seeks to remain beyond a second term. He is supported by the Air Force.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Congress (Flag Faction) wants to control what they see as the unchecked power of a Demagogue determined to seize total control. They are supporting greater State autonomy but are international in their economic interest. They are supported by the Navy.

Rather, we have aimed at producing a more colourful and attractive package, hopefully easier to use and improving the feel of being at a speedway meet.&#10;&#10;The old plastic boards have gone in favour of a card version; this was done to enable us to produce a colour depiction of a speedway stadium. We hope you approve. If you find the board a little thin, try pasting the two halves onto some thicker card; I personally have not found the need and I believe the card track provided actually lies flat better than the old colour plastic versions.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls the die before fishing. If she rolls a color, she tries to catch a fish of that color while looking in the box. Catch an &quot;out of season&quot; color, and you have to throw the fish back. Roll a starfish, and you choose the color; roll an octopus, and you toss one fish held by an opponent back in the sea; roll a boot, and your turn gets booted! The first player to collect five fish wins.&#10;&#10;",

The deck includes Mission Cards, Munitions Cards, Enemy Cards, and Event Cards.&#10;&#10;Mission Cards are ground targets of various Mission Point values. A player who successfully attacks the target wins the Mission Card and adds the Mission Points to his score. Enemy Cards, representing a variety of Soviet air and ground threats, are played against opposing players. Munitions Cars represent bombs, missiles, or other payload items which aid in attack or defense. Event Cards offer a variety of bonuses and can be played at various times as specified on the particular card.&#10;&#10;There are also six named Pilot Cards that are not a part of the main deck. At the start of the game each player randomly selects one Pilot Card. Each pilot has a special advantage.&#10;&#10;Fuel and ammo counters are used to track each plane's status. The aircraft are required to return to base to refuel and rearm. Damage can also force a plane to return to base where the damage is repaired.&#10;&#10;The object is to have the most Mission Points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It was designed to explore the potential of theatre nuclear weapons in hypothetical battles of the early Cold War era.&#10;&#10;At its core is a recently de-classified set of rules by Lt. Col. Field found by Bob Cordery in the UK National Archives, and is published with suggested amendments and augmentations for the wargamer by the publisher, John Curry.&#10;&#10;It uses a &quot;kriegsspiel&quot; format with a central umpire (controller) to implement the rules and feed relevant information to two sets of players. The umpire is there to provide information and implement the rules, not make his own assessments.&#10;&#10;It works with orders given on an hourly basis to units on a 1:50,000 scale map or terrain model. Units are armour, infantry, artillery and engineers in battalion squadron and regimental sized units that operate, broadly, in 2km map squares. Combat resolution is probability driven and focusses on the need for TIME to plan co-ordinated assaults in attack or increase defence strength by preparing and digging in. One of the main purposes of the wargame was to allow officers to experiment with tactical nuclear warfare.&#10;&#10;These are playable rules, but also a work of reference about operational warfare between 1940 and 1970.&#10;&#10;Obtained from www.wargaming.co&#10;&#10;",

Additionally there is a wargame, called &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;, based on the old styles of warfare and finally a simple &quot;Hit and Miss&quot; game.&#10;&#10;Modern Warfare uses large (1.25 inch) lead Soldiers, Aircraft, Tanks and Artillery as units in the game and they are initially placed in one of four lines (3 main lines and the reserve).&#10;&#10;The main game begins with the firing of a single  artillery piece on each side for 4 turns (a spinner is spun for combat results and movement) followed by an artillery barrage (both artillery pieces fire on each side) until one side loses both their guns.  Then the winning side gets 3 more shots and moves and attacks with his air and tank units in the first line.  The other side then moves all air and tank units in the first rank.  This alternates until one side has lost all their units.&#10;&#10;The winning side retires their remaining air and tanks to the reserve and the infantry then fights alone...  Terrain can be destroyed on the map (indicated by placing a red square on the destroyed item).&#10;&#10;Fascinating instructions with detailed play throughs and fairly complicated rules depending on the unit type and position (line) the unit occupies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tactical level miniature wargame rules covering the Wars of Marlborough, Peter the Great, William of Orange and Prince Eugene (1688-1717).&#10;&#10;Figure scale: 1 figure = 60 men&#10;&#10;-- Welcome to the world of the Duke of Marlborough, Louis XIV, Charles XII and Peter the Great! None Shall Pass! is a set of wargame rules which recreate the glory and atmosphere of early Eighteenth Century battles, hopefully without the accompanying blood and tears. The tactics of the period make it as fascinating as chess, with a much greater number of variations. This time in history is easy to conjure up in the popular imagination. You can put yourself at the head of the French Mousquetaires of the Maison du Roi, they who were made famous by Alexandre Dumas, and lead the charge, emulating the Three Musketeers; rally your grenadiers for one last stand; try out new fangled inventions like cannon with three barrels; join the Swedes in their valiant attempts against the rising star of the east, Russia, or be particularly sad and play uplifting marching music when your line of toy soldiers start their main advance (yes, alright, it was me who did that, caused a laugh anyway!). In short, you can let your imagination run wild, while retaining the odd lingering thought that this could all have really happened.....&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be played on a flat surface at least 3' by 4' in size. This is covered with terrain features such as hills and villages to represent a model battlefield, over which model figures are used as chess pieces. These figures are placed together on card bases, which are the standard playing piece in the game. If you don't yet possess any such figures or terrain, you could use just card counters to start with, replacing them with model later. However, we do urge you to get some models, as the look of the thing is half the fun of wargaming.&#10;&#10;The only other thing you require are six-sided dice and a ruler and/or tape measure marked in inches. Apologies to those who are now used to using centimetres and millimetres, but there still some old strongholds left in England where we refuse to do likewise! --&#10;&#10;- Description from publisher&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    None Shall Pass!: To Arms!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game's time line goes from 1495 to 1615 with players trying to establish colonies in the Americas and bring home as much gold and resources as they can back to Europe. Along the way they will have to deal with natural disasters, other European powers and of course the indigenous people of the New World including the Mayans, Incas and Aztecs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kamelipeli (The Camel Game) is an abstract tile placement game for the whole family published by the UNICEF association of Finland (maybe in the eighties or early nineties?). The rules recommend an even number of players.&#10;&#10;The game includes a fairly large thin cardboard showing a two-colour drawing of the African continent filled with squares (135 of them). Some of the squares have names of African countries in them but this has no effect on gameplay. Similarly highlighted are some areas of severe drought (namely the Sahel area).&#10;&#10;The game is played with event cards and two types of small squares of thin cardboard. One set of tiles is blue on the other side (water) and green of the other (vegetation). The second set is brown on the other side (drought) and on the reverse there can be one of three different pictures of a camel (or a note: pick up an event card).&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of placing a brown tile on the map, checking the size of the camel on the other side and either leaving it there, swapping it for a blue tile, flipping a blue tile green or picking up an event card and following its instructions.&#10;&#10;An example of an event card: &quot;Measles is a very serious disease among African children. You are vaccinating children against it. You may remove one brown tile from the board.&quot;&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build a continuous green line of tiles across Africa. All players build this line together, but the winner is the one who places the last green tile to connect two opposing coasts. A slightly longer game has the players trying to fill at least half of the map with green tiles (the winner again placing the last one).&#10;&#10;",

But this ball moves, and if players take enough of your bars away during play, Taz will bust through your side of the cage making you...not the winner.&#10;&#10;Cage guards are Tweety, Sylvester, Daffy and Bugs. The cage needs adult assembly.&#10;&#10;So you set up your cage bars as strategically as possible, crossing them if you think that may help. Then on your turn, concentrate on pulling the bars out of your opponents' sides of the cage, causing Taz to escape from any side but your own.&#10;&#10;",
