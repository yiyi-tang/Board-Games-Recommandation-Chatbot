    "Description": "Subtitled: &quot;The Marvelous Adventures of Marco Polo&quot;&#10;&#10;Translated text from the game box: &quot;The voyages of Marco Polo to the fabulous cities of the&#10;Orient took more than ten years. To a player of Samarcanda two hours are enough,&#10;should fortune smile, to reach the financial position to be named Doge of Venice. Precious &#10;goods are available to all, but between the Venetian merchants and a thousand dangers stand&#10;expensive tolls, desert raiders or the worst misfortune of all, terrible Genoan pirates just&#10;waiting for the incautious traveler to make a false step in order to clean him out. All of these &#10;don't even take into account the variations in market prices that, with a simple roll of the dice, &#10;could change a fortune into ruin! Up to 6 merchants can try, traveling on earth or sea as they&#10;prefer, this wonderful adventure, which is offered to all players who love games. The refined &#10;graphics of Samarcanda, based on the colors gold, white and green, provide also a&#10;visual pleasure. Moreover the simplicity of the rules, added to the wide variety of situations&#10;that can be created, allows a pleasant passage of time, even to those who, after a hard day's&#10;work, do not want to deal with complex rules. So we invite you therefore, on behalf of the &#10;International Team, to return to the fantastic times of fabulous medieval merchant traders. &#10;Upon which, amidst the experiences of day-to-day modern life, it is impossible not to regard &#10;without nostalgia and interest.&quot;&#10;&#10;A game about trading in the Renaissance with rules in Italian,&#10;English, French and German.  Beware the Genoese pirates!&#10;&#10;",

Players travel between cities that are home to these famous breweries or distilleries answering trivia questions.  A die roll determines what category of trivia question the player must answer.

Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar &amp; Cleopatra (or Hera &amp; Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and &quot;special&quot;.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).&#10;&#10;Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.&#10;&#10;The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Combo is a game in which Bingo-like cards (on which 5x5 grids are printed) are used and instead of calling out randomly drawn numbers, dice are used.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a Combo card and during a player's turn, he or she rolls a red die and 3 white dice.  If the red die's result matches one of those on his or her card, the player then matches and places their white dice to the printed faces in the column below.  A player may also &quot;steal&quot; and use a white die that another player cannot use (because that player's red die column does not have that white die's face).  The next player in turn then picks up and rolls the red die and 3 white dice to do the same.  When a player has filled up an entire row, column or diagonal (the center space is considered already to be filled), he has scored a Combo (the amount of points received depends on whether it is a 4-die or 5-die row, column, or diagonal) and ends a round.  The next round begins with new cards for everyone.&#10;&#10;After completing a pre-determined number of rounds, the player with the highest accumulated score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quik E Ly Dice is part dice game, part card collecting and melding game.&#10;A single set consists of 8 dice in 2 colours and 54 cards, 27 of in each of the same two colours as the dice.&#10;One set is suitable for two players, and there are three sets in all; Using all three with half the 162 cards allows up to six players.&#10;The cards depict two dice faces, one above the other. The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.&#10;Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. &#10;The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.&#10;Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.&#10;If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.&#10; ",

    "Description": "Components of &quot;Gold Robbery in London&quot; include 1 game board, 37 sector cards, 12 tip cards, 1 search block, 6 wooden pawns and 1 marker.  The game seems based on the work of Edgar Wallace (1875&ndash;1932), author of more than 150 detective and adventure novels. The numbers on the hexagonal board correspond to those on the sector cards. Tip cards either say &quot;false tip&quot; or &quot;gold bar&quot;. Each player receives a copy of the police gazette, one of each of the two types of tip cards and three sector cards.&#10;Each player tries to find out what cards the other players have. Landing on a space, the player asks and if players have the corresponding cards, they show the positive tip card, otherwise they show the negative card.  Each player also gets to find out what the player to their right showed. When someone feels they have located the exact place where gold has been hidden, he can interrupt the game and see if he is right.  If correct, he gets a huge bonus, but if wrong takes a major hit to his score.&#10;&#10;2 years later described in Reinhold Wittig's SPIELECOLLECTION No. 1 Spiele zur Schatzinsel (1988) as &quot;Versteckt und Entdeckt&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.&#10;&#10;The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.&#10;&#10;Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.&#10;&#10;Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.&#10;&#10;Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.&#10;&#10;Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.&#10;&#10;The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.&#10;&#10;The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.&#10;&#10;The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.&#10;&#10;The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10;- 3600 counters&#10;&#10;        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Nine maps (A-H,J)&#10;- Four Rulebooks&#10;&#10;        (Standard Rules)&#10;        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Axis Production Spiral&#10;- Soviet Production Spiral&#10;- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track &#10;- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables&#10;- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables&#10;&#10;",

A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.&#10;&#10;Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;",

The large board is themed with the signs of the Zodiac and has 5 concentric rings (orbits) and spirals forming the path of life. There is a large (11cm) latex statuette of Lady Luck and players spend tokens, representing years of their life, to an altar to move themselves and the statuette around the board. They can also block spaces with fire tokens. When each player has spent all its tokens, it has died. When the last player dies, whoever Fortune is nearest to, first collects tokens from the altar as a multiple of their age (the orbit they reached) by the number of players. The next player does the same, but multiplied by one less and so on. Presumably the basic game ends with the player with the most tokens winning (the rules don't say!). The advanced game rules allow additional variants, such as bidding or bartering or a quiz based game. One variant goes on to use the won tokens as the start of the After-Life and the designer, Dr Bronia Grycz, encourages players to develop their own rules. The box has copyright 1977.&#10;&#10;",

You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.&#10;The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear.

It features a large three-fold board of a fine painted lake, sets of large cards with excellent artwork and unbelievably, 6 different solid pewter figures of fishers and two little pewter rowboats. There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.&#10;And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side &amp; their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard &amp; Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.&#10;No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.&#10;&#10;Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards. The graphic artist is named, but the actual designer is not. I suspect it is the eponymous Anglepen. The producers included an order form for parts, baseball cap, T-shirt and future accessories.&#10;&#10;",

Beginners will have instant fun; accomplished players will be endlessly challenged.&#10;&#10;The game's collapsible board consists of five layers connected in a flexible stack, which requires nothing to set up or put together.  The result is a unique three-dimensional gaming experience that can begin the instant the game's box is opened.&#10;&#10;Pentagonal can be played individually or in teams.

On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.&#10;More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.&#10;&#10;",

Players buy, swap, sell, auction, exhibit, damage or fake their stamps until they make a winning set collection.&#10;The stamps are nice.&#10;&#10;",

You could order a copy for $1.25, complete with 2 boards, rules, and over 80 plastic pieces.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to Battleship, with a few additional rules.  Each player has a gameboard (printed on cardstock-paper), later boards from the late 70's were printed on plastic with no backing at all, with 3 islands on it.  Players place all of their units on their board (secretly; you can't see your opponent's board) at the beginning of the game.  Units consist of Head Quarters, Tanks, Pill Boxes, Battleships, Destroyers, Landing barges, Aircraft Carriers, and Planes.&#10;&#10;The objective is to locate which island the enemy HQ is on (when you sink the enemy Battleship, they must tell you if their HQ is on the North or South half of the board), destroy all enemy installations in that island, and send a landing barge to occupy it.  You can also win the game by destroying both enemy barges (so they have no way to land on your HQ island anymore) or by destroying all enemy planes and ships (they can no longer attack).&#10;&#10;Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show.

    "Description": "(From the introduction) King of the Mountain is a moderate skill-level strategy game for 2 to 10 players, Ages 8 and up. The object of the game is to be the first player to have his/her character reach the Citadel at the top of the mountain, which is the center hex of the game board. Players guide their character-counter from the board's edge, which is the base of the mountain, along paths and through tunnels in order to get to the peak. Attempting to stop the players is a malevolent Wizard, played by one of the players. The Wizard controls the different monsters on the mountain, causing them to seek out the characters and do battle with them. The object for the Wizard player is to see that no one reaches the Citadel. Depending on the number of players, the game should last between 45 minutes (two players)and 3 hours (10 players).&#10;&#10;(additional comments) One of the nice things is that each character can customize the stats and equipment of their characters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player moves along a track and draws the appropriate &quot;Therapist&quot; card, performing the stated actions on the card, such as:&#10;&#10;- Hold each member of the group in a way which shows how you feel about him.&#10; - Pick a way in which you are phony and exaggerate it.&#10; - Describe a significant way in which you use your friends.&#10;&#10;After a player responds to a drawn card, everyone votes to determine if the player was &quot;with it&quot; (acted honestly) or &quot;copped out&quot; (was not open with the group).
