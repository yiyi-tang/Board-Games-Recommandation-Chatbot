    "Description": "This children's variation on Pachisi was released to take advantage of the trend in radio-based entertainment. Unlike Ludo, it uses two dice but only provides players with two pieces each. Up to four players compete to be the first to get their pieces - colored metal &quot;Radio Horns&quot; - all the way &quot;Home,&quot; capturing opponents whenever they can and forcing them to start again.&#10;&#10;The player colors correspond to real radio stations of the period: Blue is KOA Denver; Black is KHJ Los Angeles; Yellow is WEAF New York; and Red is the (still very famous) WGN Chicago.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Solar Century is a heavy strategy game with combinative card play that aims to capture the political theatre of interplanetary colonization on a grand scale.&#10;&#10;Players act as the Council of the Imperator who rules the solar system. Each turn marks the passing of ten unified solar years.&#10;&#10;Starting the game, the Council drafts four colonies who send their leaders to explore and conquer planets. Players wield influence over these colony leaders to initiate actions and they have a century to prove themself to the Imperator or take over its Seat.&#10;&#10;Each round has three phases:&#10;- AUDIENCE: ask the Imperator to send agents to a region of the solar system,&#10;- COLONIZATION: either make alliances or wield influence on an ally to initiate and action up to two times,&#10;- SOLSTICE: develop a colony and prepare for the next turn.&#10;&#10;A player within the Council wins with&#10;- the most influence over the colony, which controls at least six planets at the end of a round (absolute win) or&#10;- the most victory points at the end of the century (capital win).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Using only your wits, a fishing pole and a limited supply of fish you must create and navigate a maze path to find the way out. You will encounter twists and turns, polar bears and ice. You may even find yourself stranded on an ice floe, but you can be the hero of the group by being the first one to expose the maze path and find the exit!&#10;&#10;Your Goal: Create a complete, unbroken maze path between the Maze Entrance and the Maze Exit and be the first Explorer to exit the maze. However, be careful not to get stranded in the maze without fish to eat and to keep the polar bears away!&#10;&#10;Exploring the Maze:&#10;Your maze exploration starts by shuffling all the maze tiles facedown and placing them on the table in front of you, being sure to connect at least one edge of each tile to another. You will then roll one or two dice to move over the tiles, turn them faceup, rotate them, and uncover the maze before you run out of your limited supply of fish.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will search for the hidden exit while also encountering various artifacts. Some artifacts, like the fishing holes, will help you to continue your explorations, others, like the polar bear, are not so helpful!&#10;&#10;This is a fun, easy-to-learn game that's different each time you play. Winning this game will require you to adapt your strategy at various stages in the game.&#10;&#10;The Maze Explorers Trilogy!&#10;&#10;The Maze Explorers is a series of worlds each with its own set of unique artifacts and challenges. Each world can be played on its own or combined into a larger world (see the &quot;Related Games&quot; at the top of this page). Stay tuned to the keithkunstgames.com web site and watch for the &quot;Multi-World Explorer&quot; update that will allow you to play the combined version of all three worlds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Coloring Battle Cards is a Trading Card Game that uses very simple rules and cards you can color and battle with your friends.&#10;&#10;Each player requires their own deck to play.&#10;&#10;(Description from the starter deck packaging)&#10;&#10;Each player's deck consists of attack cards and defense cards, ranging in value from 1 to 5, and a single Character card representing the player's persona during the game.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they draw up to 3 cards in hand, then they may choose to play an attack card and select an opponent to attack.  The defender may then choose a defense card to play.  If the defense card equals or exceeds the attack card, the defender takes no damage.  If the attack card is greater, the difference between the attack and defense card is discarded from the top of the defender's draw pile as damage.  A player may make up to three such attacks on their turn, then discard any cards they do not want to keep.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds left around the table. Each player whose draw deck is emptied is eliminated, and the last player with cards in their draw pile wins.&#10;&#10;",

You'll need to plan carefully as you help a team of spelunkers through an increasingly-perilous maze of unstable caverns.&#10;&#10;During the player's turns, there are several phases. They first direct their team of spelunkers to explores the cave's caverns using limited movement cards. They must follow the arrows on each cavern's floor. Second, each spelunker surveys their occupied caverns by rotating the arrow. But be careful--once each cavern can only be moved once! Third, each spelunker excavates their caverns to search for buried treasure. However, each time a cavern is excavated, it becomes unstable! If they linger on that cavern in the future, the entire cave will collapse, and the player will lose!&#10;&#10;Finally, after revealing all four of the buried treasures, each spelunker must return to starting Daylight cavern and escape before the end of the seventh turn. If they can do this, then the player wins!&#10;&#10;Can you explore the cave, excavate all four treasures, and lead your team to safety before Arrow Caverns collapses?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Admiral Yamamoto chose Midway Island, at the far eastern end of the Hawaiian chain, as a target for which the Americans would fight. The Americans indeed came to fight, sinking all four of Yamamoto&rsquo;s fleet carriers for the loss of one of their own.&#10;&#10;Midway Deluxe Edition features not only the climactic Battle of Midway but also the attempted relief of Wake Island, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and battles that might have followed the clash of carriers.&#10;&#10;Midway Deluxe Edition includes 560 playing pieces: 280 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 280 square ones representing aircraft, smaller ships and markers needed for play. There are two operational maps forming a 42x28-inch playing area covering the Hawai&rsquo;ian islands, Midway and surrounding waters.&#10;&#10;Like its sister game South Pacific, Midway Deluxe Edition includes not only the standard, generic Tactical Map but also a special Tactical Map, this time showing Pearl Harbor with all of the locations of American warships on the fateful morning of December 7th, 1941.&#10;&#10;There are 36 scenarios, organized in our popular &ldquo;story arc&rdquo; format that weaves the narrative of the campaign into the scenarios, allowing them to tell the story of these pivotal battles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. The board squares alternate between a light and a dark color in a checkered fashion. On odd-sized boards, the center square must be light-colored.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty light square and on each adjoining dark square that you now control. You control a dark square if your stones occupy more than half of its adjacent light squares.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty dark square that you contest. You contest a dark square if your stones occupy exactly half of its adjacent light squares.&#10;&#10;&#10;You win by completing a chain of interconnected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Two stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent squares or diagonally adjacent dark squares.&#10;&#10;The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsQualos: On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty light square, or place a stone of your color on an empty dark square that you contest or control, or flip an enemy stone on a dark square that you control. To flip a stone is to replace it with a stone of the opposite color. Controlling and contesting are based on orthogonal lines of sight rather than on mere adjacencies, and stones on dark squares also count towards them.&#10;&#10;Fast Quabble: On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty light square and on each adjoining dark square that you now control. You control a dark square if your stones occupy at least half of its adjacent light squares.&#10;&#10;Conquare: Play on an uncheckered square board. Vertices take the place of light squares, and spaces take the place of dark squares. Two stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent spaces or a space and an adjacent vertex.&#10;&#10;Fast Conquare: Conquare with the control rule from Fast Quabble.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

This is a game about how elections can be shaped by money.&#10;&#10;Players are secretly assigned to one of two teams &mdash; Citizen or Super PAC &mdash; and compete to elect candidates through strategic donations. Super PAC players know each other and can corrupt politicians with their donations, so it&rsquo;s up to Citizens to figure out who the Super PAC players are and work around them to elect honest politicians and keep democracy healthy.&#10;&#10;Every round, all players draw 2 money cards from the bank and publicly donate a money card to one of the candidates. All money donated by Super PAC players secretly counts as dark money. When a candidate receives enough money to be funded, players learn whether the candidate was &quot;resisted&quot; (a point for the Citizens) or &quot;corrupted&quot; (i.e. enough dark money was donated to corrupt the candidate - a point for the Super PACs).&#10;&#10;Super PACs win if they corrupt half the candidates.

The advent of gunpowder transformed the way in which armies fought on the battlefield, bringing more and more gunpowder weapons to bare. Slowly changing from massed troop formations to more linear tactics. Empires were forged, colonies were taken and feudal warfare slowly gave way to more national conflicts.

The U.S. Navy still operated biplanes from its carriers, while ships like Hornet and Shokaku had not been commissioned while Oahu is not yet the impregnable fortress it would soon become.&#10;&#10;Midway: Rising Sun 1940 is a Campaign Study with 10 scenarios depicting a Japanese campaign in Hawaiian waters opposed by the American Pacific Fleet of 1940 &ndash; one with far less capable aircraft (biplanes!) and fewer of them.

What was intended as a diversion to keep the Chinese from interfering with the Japanese attack on Hong Kong became a major operation of its own. The six Chinese armies (each the size of a small Western corps, with very little artillery and no armor) of the IX War Zone met the Eastern Sea Demons and drove them back, nearly encircling 11th Army and causing a general retreat.&#10;&#10;Changsha Operation comes with 88 new pieces and eight new scenarios, all based on this crucial World War Two battle. It introduces the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (the central government&rsquo;s army) to the Panzer Grenadier series; they have lots of infantry, some mortar and machine-gun platoons, and not much else. Artillery was held at army level; the Chinese divisions at Changsha had none of their own.&#10;&#10;Panzer Grenadier: Changsha Operation is a download; you&rsquo;ll have to assemble the pieces yourself.

    "Description": "World War II was scheduled to begin on 28 September 1938, when German armies would cross into neighboring Czechoslovakia. Unexpectedly, Britain and France agreed to almost all German demands, and the Munich Agreement caused the Germans to cancel their plans.&#10;&#10;The Czech Army numbered 1.5 million men, with 17 regular and 17 more reserve infantry divisions and four &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; divisions. Their tanks and artillery greatly out-classed those of the Germans. Germany had a paper strength of 3.3 million men, though thanks to the rapid expansion of the German Army not all of these were as yet fully trained. The Czechs would be fighting for their homeland, behind a thick line of modern fortifications sited in harsh terrain, and many of the Army&rsquo;s leaders as well as rank-and-file were not only willing but eager to fight the Germans. The Benes government, almost completely surrounded by German-controlled territory, instead yielded.&#10;&#10;That doesn&rsquo;t happen in Panzer Grenadier: Peace in Our Time. The Czechs fight, and they fight very hard. The Czech Army is well-equipped with tanks, soft vehicles, artillery, anti-tank guns and super-heavy machine guns. You get 176 new pieces and ten new scenarios, all based on battles that could have happened, according to the detailed war plans of both sides.&#10;&#10;Panzer Grenadier: Peace in Our Time is a free download; you&rsquo;ll have to assemble the pieces yourself. The Germans come from 1940: The Fall of France, and the maps from Fire in the Steppe, Elsenborn Ridge and Broken Axis.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Reversal is a Reversi game.&#10;&#10;This is mixed elements of shogi pieces. Some tiles can be flipped over by pinching both ends of the tiles, while others have a unique way of flipping over. It is hard to decide which tile to use and when. It is a game where reversals occur with every move.&#10;&#10;There are two main types of tiles:&#10;Normal tiles: Tiles are turned over if the end of the row or column is a tile of your color, just like in reversi.&#10;Ability tiles: Tiles are turned over in the direction of the &quot;&#226;&#150;&#178;&quot; or &quot;line&quot; on the tile.&#10;The color of the tile to be flipped over is not distinguished.&#10;If your ability tile is flipped over, you lose points and it becomes a tile of your opponent's color, but you can find the difference.&#10;Also, each ability tile has its own points.&#10;&#10;There are two rules you can play by&#10;&#10;(1) Point rule&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the higher point total of the ability tiles of his/her color that are turned over wins!&#10;&#10;(2) Majority Rule&#10;The player with the highest number of tiles of his/her color on the table at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The die is not cast.&quot;&#10;Dice are used as pieces, but no dice are rolled. &#10;It is a Shogi-like board game focusing on the position of the &quot;&#226;&#151;&#143;&quot; on the die.&#10;&#10;The premise of this game is &quot;number of dice rolls = points upon winning&quot;.&#10;&#10;There are three conditions for winning&#10;(1) The total number of die rolls won exceeds 10.&#10;(2) Two consecutive dice with the same number of dice are taken.&#10;(3) Taking 3 of your opponent's dice.&#10;&#10;The first player to achieve this wins the game.&#10;&#10;However, this game is unique in the way the dice are moved.&#10;The position of the &quot;&#226;&#151;&#143;&quot; on the die's eye is the range of the die's movement.&#10;For example, if the die is a 4, it is a die that moves one square to each of the four corners.&#10;If the die has a &quot;&#226;&#151;&#143;&quot; in the center (1, 3, or 5), it will advance one square to the opponent's side.&#10;&#10;When and how many squares are to be advanced, and which way the dice are to be turned?&#10;This is an abstract game where you have to make careful decisions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Earth 2053: Tipping Point, players represent countries that work together to prevent a global climate catastrophe. The main scoring happens on a physical seesaw board where &quot;prevention&quot; tokens are placed on one side and &quot;pollution&quot; tokens on the other. Filling the prevention side lets all players win (with optional placements based on who contributed the most). However, if the board tips towards the pollution side, all players lose.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own country board with their own special ability, where they track their economy and their population's need fulfillment. Increasing the fulfillment levels of certain needs will unlock more and more powerful rewards, but at the same time threatens to create additional pollution.&#10;&#10;One of the major goals of the game is to use your country's board setup to create &quot;influence&quot; tokens which can then be used to prevent climate events from (such as species extinction) from occuring in a negotiation about who is willing to invest how much per event. Stopping these events creates prevention points, while failing creates pollution.&#10;&#10;The primary way of increasing need fulfillment is playing cards onto a grid shared between all players. Some cards have special effects depending on which other cards they are played adjacent to. Playing cards of the same category next to each other comes with its own set of bonuses.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each round, new inhabitants from the neighbourhood are recruited (1d6), allowing the teams to develop their neighbourhood further. After 5 rounds, players win if they manage to lower the ecological danger (whose level is represented on the wheel) to zero.

However, every player has their own scoring agenda in the form of the types of rides to build. Not only does the Carnival have limited space, but each round an old ride must be demolished to make way for new development.&#10;&#10;How far will players be willing to demolish their scoring rides for a common goal? What negotiation skills and mind games will they bring into play? And how long will they work together amicably before the thought of demolishing their neighbour's high scoring rides becomes a juicy option?&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players are awarded points for the bonus objectives their Carnivals have bagged, combined with the number of rides from their scoring agenda that they have built into those Carnivals.
