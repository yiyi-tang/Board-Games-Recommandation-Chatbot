    "Description": "A manqala game.&#10;&#10;From Wikimanqala:&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Um_dyar&#10;&#10;Um dyar (enmediar, manddiar&eacute;, umdiyar, um ed-dyar) is played by the Hassaniya-speaking population in western Mauritania, for instance in Boutilimit (Trarza province) and in Moudj&eacute;ria (Tagant). Hassaniya is an Arab dialect heavily influenced by Tamazigh, a Berber language, that originated in the 15th century. At this time the Yemenite Beni Hassan tribe migrated to north-western Africa and subdued the indigenous Berber tribes over a period of 300 years. Hassaniya is today spoken in the western Sahara, from Niger to Mauritania. They constitute the majority of the population in Mauritania and southern Morocco. The Hassaniya call this region Trab el Bidan, i.e. '&quot;Land of White People&quot;, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or &quot;Land of Black People&quot;. &#10;Um dyar is mostly played by young women, sometimes also by men. However, they do never play among themselves, just with women, for instance as a means of courtship. &#10;The game is played all the year, but especially on Ramadan and during the hot hours at noon time. &#10;Usually the holes are dug in the sand, but there are also traditional wooden boards. Some of them are made of one piece, while others consist of two halves. &#10;The holes are called dyar (sing.: dar, i.e. &quot;houses, inhabited places&quot;). The seeds are called ky&eacute;tan (sing.: kyit), probably related to kyit, Hassaniya for &quot;odd&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board is made of two rows of an even number of holes, between 2 and 12. &#10;The number of seeds which are initially in each hole depends on the size of the board. A board which numbers just four holes has four seeds in each hole. Board that have eight or twelve holes have as many seeds as the whole board numbers holes or, alternatively, just as many as one row numbers holes. Large boards which have 16 or 24 holes have initially in each hole as many seeds as a row counts holes.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. &#10;At his turn, a player takes the contents of any hole of his side of the board and sows them counterclocwise, one by one, starting in the very same hole from where he took them. &#10;     If you move a singleton, it is put into the next hole counterclockwise. &#10;If the last seed ends in a hole making a total of an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole, these seeds are captured and removed from the board. &#10;If you have captured, you also get the contents of the preceding holes (in an unbroken sequence) that contain an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole. &#10;If a player has no seeds to play with, he passes and his opponent plays again. &#10;The game ends when all seeds are captured. &#10;The player who has captured most seeds, wins the game. &#10;If at the end of the game a single seed remains (i.e. there has been some mistake or cheating), the players who has an odd number of captured seeds loses one seed. These two seeds (the lost one and the seed remaining on the board) are not counted.&#10;&#10;Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. &#10;In the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. &#10;The winner fills all his holes with the standard initial number of seeds. &#10;The loser fills all the holes he can with the standard number of seeds. If he some seeds remain, he puts them in another hole. &#10;     The empty holes on the loser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game you don't play in them. &#10;     If the loser has not enough holes for his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. &#10;     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are openend from left to right. However, it is not important. &#10;The winner of the match is who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side. &#10;If there was a couple of seeds out of game (as seen above) they are given to the first player who makes a capture in the next game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game was was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Game 17. Similar games exist in Western Eritrea and Somalia.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Lahemay waladat is played on a board of two rows of of (sic) six holes. The game starts with four stones in each hole.&#10;&#10;The right to start the game is decided by a hand-play referred to in Tigrinya as shekut. To begin with, the two players are holding hands as in a handshake. After breaking the hold, they would either expose the first finger, last three fingers or the open hand with fingers side by side. A player who displayed his first finger defeats one with three fingers, three fingers defeats the hand, and the hand the first finger. &#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. &#10;If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. &#10;The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole. &#10;Groups of three stones made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of three that was effected by the last stone in hand which is won by the player whose hand it was. The latter kind of capture, however, does not terminate the move. The player would continue to move until his last stone in hand is placed in an empty hole (in other words, the player gets a bonus move). &#10;The game ends when a player cannot move at his turn. The remaining stones are won by the player who could move last. &#10;The player who wins more threes wins the round. &#10;For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. If a player has one surplus stone, he cedes it to his opponent who can then together with his own surplus of three stones would open another hole. If each player has a surplus of two stones, their ownership is decided by shekut. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round. &#10;The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is to reduce his provision to less than four stones. &quot;&#10;&#10;Pankhurst, R. 1971.

It is the recreation of adult males, and to a lesser extent boys and youths. The game is played on wooden boards with seeds in the open air or, during rains, in houses or just outside them in the shelter of the roof. The name of the game literally means &quot;grouped in pairs&quot;, a word related to lama, the numeral two in the Gallinya language. The game was first described by the ethnologue and renowned mancala games expert Richard Pankhurst in 1971.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board, called toma tag&eacute;ga, has 2x12=24 pits (awa). Initially each pit contains two seeds known as tag&eacute;ga.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his pits which are then sown in a counter-clockwise direction into consecutive holes. Although Pankhurst stated that the opening move starts with the hole on the player's &quot;extreme right or more preferably penultimate right&quot;, these moves appear to be just common openings observed by him.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are picked up together with the last seed, and continued to be distributed.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;It is not permitted to drop a seed into opponent's holes which contain two seeds except in the very first move. Later these holes are jumped.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an empty hole of your own facing an enemy hole containing two seeds he captures this pair, as well as any other groups of two seeds on his opponent's row.&#10;&#10;Play comes to an end when one of the players can no longer move.

    "Description": "A mancala game from Somalia.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World:&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Layli_Goobalay_(long_board)&#10;&#10;&quot;Layli Goobalay (literally: &quot;closing the holes&quot;) is a mancala game played in Somalia. The board is dug in the ground and the pieces are dry camel dung called salo. Slightly different variants of the same game exist, among them a more simple game, which is promoted by the Somali ethnomathematician Jama Musse Jama in Italy.&#10;&#10;The following rules were observed in 1931 by G. Marin in the area of Berbera, Somaliland, where it was (and probably still is) a favorite pastime of the Isaaq clan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Layli Goobalay is played on a board that consists of two parallel rows of 12 holes on each side. A player controls the 12 holes on his side of the board.&#10;&#10;[Holes all start with 4 seeds each.]&#10;&#10;Each move a player empties the contents of one of his holes that is not an uur and distributes one ball in each of the following holes in a clockwise direction (as observed by G. Marin).&#10;&#10;If the last ball is dropped in an occupied hole, the player takes its contents, including the last dropped ball, and continues to distribute the balls in a clockwise direction. The move ends if the last ball is dropped in an empty hole.&#10;&#10;If the last ball is dropped into an empty hole on the player's own side, he captures this last ball together with the contents of the opposite hole if it contains one, two, four or more balls. A move which captures nothing is called abar (&quot;famine&quot;).&#10;&#10;If the opposite hole contains three balls, one of these is put into the hole in which the last ball was dropped, so that each hole has two balls. These two holes now form an uur (&quot;pregnant&quot;), and both are owned to their creator. An uur may never be emptied by either player. Balls must be added to an Uur during the normal course of distribution. However, if the last ball is dropped into an uur, the move ends.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one player has no legal move left. Each side then counts the balls he has captured together with the balls in his uurs and any balls remaining on his side of the board outside of uurs. Sometimes towards the end of the game the balls continue to circulate in a repeating pattern. Then the remaining balls are divided between both players as in Oware. The player who captures most balls wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;&#10;There is a similar game played on a 2x6 board in the south of Somalia, which is always played counterclockwise. It has special rules for matches that were first described on wikimanqala:&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Layli_goobalay_%28short_board%29&#10;&#10;",

It is mainly the relaxation of menfolk, young and old alike.

If he did so from his middle hole he could place them in any hole, either on his own side or his opponents. If he took the contents of any of his other holes, he could place them in any hole except his opponents opposite hole.&#10;&#10;Thereafter players alternately move either in a clock-wise or anti-clockwise direction by distributing their seeds always in groups of four.&#10;&#10;&#10;     A group of four seeds can be moved to an adjacent hole only on the same side of the board.&#10;     A group of eight or more seeds can be distributed on the basis of four seeds per hole in successive holes on one side of the board or another. &#10;&#10;&#10;If the last four seeds fall in an empty hole, the player captures the contents, if any, of his opponents opposite hole. The captured seeds are removed from the board.

Later the Scottish traveller John Galt observed Mandoli on the Greek island of Hydra in 1810.&#10;&#10;The game appears to be influenced by other mancala games played in the Osman Empire, such as Halusa and Mangala.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;RulesJohn Galt reported in 1810 the following rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;There is, however, a tolerably decent coffee-house; and in winter, even at present, card and chess players may be always found in it. I saw there to-day a game, which, not having seen elsewhere, I give you a description of. The Idriots call it Mandoli, or the almonds, and it is played at a board by two persons. Twelve hollows are scooped in the board, in two rows of six each: in each hollow six balls are placed, and the opponents take each a row. The game is commenced by the first player taking out the balls from any one of the hollows, and distributing them, one by one, successively, round the board. In the first round no balls can be captured, but in the second the contest becomes serious. The skill of the player consists in so managing his distribution, that his last all shall either fall in a hollow where there is only one, or three, or seven, or nine &amp;c. which, by the addition of his ball, are made even numbers, and in consequence become prizes. If in the distribution he makes even numbers in the two last hollows, he takes the contents of both. This is considered a great stroke. The victor is, of course, he who reckons the greatest number of prisoners.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It is known from the Virunga mountains to the Sudanese border, and from Bangui (Central African Republic) to Arui near Uganda. Mangola is a new game which was developed after 1911 according to the ethnologue Philip Townshend and is now gradually replacing older games such as sombi and single lap mancala games. The game was spread by the Belgian colonial administration and military along rivers and roads and is the only mancala game played in the central basin (one of the few African regions where mancala games were still unknown in the 19th century). &#10;There are many local variants, probably more than 30, which have slightly different opening rules (some with simultaneous opening moves) and employ different board sizes. &#10;The game is played by adults on beautiful wooden boards with holes carved in the surface. Children, on the other hand, dig the board in the ground or draw it with chalk on concrete. &#10;It is played by both sexes, but more often by women. &#10;The following rules were reported from the capital Kinshasa by Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain in 1952.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Mangola is a two players game. &#10;It is played on a board made of four rows of eight holes. &#10;At the beginning each hole has two seeds.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the two rows closer on his side, and only moves on these two rows. We will call the row closest to him outer row and the other one inner row &#10;Players take turns to move. &#10;The first move of each player is a special one: they redistribute the seeds by taking the contents of one hole and putting it into the next, and so one, until your side of the board is checkered with holes containing 4 seeds and empty holes.&#10;&#10;The second move of each player must begin from the left- or right-most hole of your outer or inner row. &#10;At your turn you take all the seeds from a hole on your side that contains at least two seeds and put them, one by one, in the following holes, in an anticlockwise sense. Singletons cannot be moved. &#10;If the last seed is dropped in an empty hole, you move it to the next hole and your turn ends. &#10;If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole, you take its contents including the last distributed seed and keep on sowing. &#10;If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole of the inner row, and the two opposite holes of the opponent contain seeds, you take the contents of your hole, including the seed just dropped, and the contents of both opponent's holes, and begin the next lap from the hole following the last empty hole (the same from which you began the last lap that effected the capture). &#10;When one player cannot move (his side of the board is empty or contains only singletons), he has lost the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DracoKrak Chess is a boardgame that is essentially Chess unleashed. The core system allows players to create various pieces, play on a bigger board, have multiple players and more. The fantasy element is strongly emphasized while keeping the abstract game play of Chess. So now, you can play Chess with interesting pieces such as The Cyclops, Ninja War Lord, Succubus, and the Fairy. Expansion for this game is unlimited and at an extremely low cost as players can do everything in a homemade fashion. Unlike normal Chess, the game play is not as competitive and has a much more laid back atmosphere.&#10;&#10;",

A system where everybody obligatory contributes taxes to a fund that redistributes that money to those who need it most.&#10;&#10;The game mimics this system as players start out at different wealth-levels and have to contribute, by sharing their wealth with other players. Players who do so get rewarded, players who don't get punished.&#10;&#10;The game is designed so that when you're wealthy you have more options, but you have to contribute more. When you're poor you have fewer options but get supported by the game's system.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn players receive their income in the form of cards. Some of those go into the social security system to support the less fortunate players.&#10;&#10;Players can trade the remaining cards with each other. Those involved in the trade can perform the action on the card. Actions involve moving up or down on the social ladder.&#10;&#10;The cards have differently colored background and the final goal is to get seven cards of the same color.&#10;&#10;The game is lightened up by using a theme that is not directly related to the matter. Players are boat owners with boats ranging from a luxury yacht to driftwood.&#10;&#10;",

And you will constantly try to outthink your opponent (in a fun way, in our experience :) ) &#10;The game length is about 45-90 minutes (depends on the players). In the gameplay Galaxy of D uses almost no dice/randomizer of any kind, I think this is a very Euro game. Bad moves, and the game can end in 15-30 minutes!&#10;&#10;1. INTRODUCTION&#10;Once again, the Redog (red) and the Cynder (blue) come face to face to conquer a galaxy&hellip;the Galaxy of D !!&#10;You are a space war commander who controls a small fleet of ships on the Redog/Cynder side. You spend money to buy ships, then you can move ships around to attack other ships and enemy Starbases. Also, you can take control of planets and asteroids by moving your ships to their sectors. Holding planets and asteroids is important because this gives you a steady income that can be used to buy more ships, but keep in mind that your enemy is going to be competing with you for those same resources.&#10;If you move a Freighter to a planet, it automatically acquires cargo. Once a Freighter has cargo, you can sell it to the Spaceport. Each Freighter can carry one cargo and only Freighters can carry cargo. Just watch out for those pirates!&#10;One last thing. In an act of sabotage, someone turned on your Starbase&rsquo;s self-destruct mechanism. This means that it will gradually destroy itself, assuming that your enemies don&rsquo;t eliminate you first. Really, you have no time to waste. Get to it, commander!&#10;&#10;2. THE MISSION&#10;Your goal is to eliminate your enemy&rsquo;s Starbase while protecting your own.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.jackdgames.com&#10;&#10;",

Unbeknownst to poor Fluffy, the cemetery is filled with man-eating, er..., dog-eating zombies who just woke up for a midnight snack.

The scenarios all include armor and the armies of Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Hungary or Slovakia.&#10;&#10;FE 116 Bad Neighbor Policy: A small scenario set on boards 3 and 49. The scenario features a March 1939 border action featuring a small Slovakian combined arms force attacking a small Hungarian force. This is nice tourney sized scenario.&#10;&#10;FE 117 Sanok Action: This scenario is set on boards 48 and 2. This is a medium sized scenario set in the opening days of Barbarossa. The scenario features a dug in Russian force holding off a German-Slovakian force that needs to capture some pillboxes.&#10;&#10;FE 118 Zaporhze Island: This is another tourney scenario set on boards 47 and 8. Some dug in Russian defenders defend a stream crossing and try to hold some buildings against a infantry armor Hungarian force.&#10;&#10;FE 119 The Face of War: During the Crimea Campaign, this scenario features the Rumanians attacking some dug in Russians supported by late arriving armor. This scenario is set on boards 19 and 16. This is your typical attack counterattack situation.&#10;&#10;FE 120 Nasty Business: Much of the time Axis Minor troops were performing security services. This scenario set on boards 19 and 49 features a small partisan screening force attempting to delay rear echelon Slovakian troops from attacking the buildings on board 49 from a force of partisans set up on 49. This is a medium sized scenario.&#10;&#10;FE 121 Allies in a Few Days: This one is set on boards 40 and 42. This is a meaty scenario featuring a river crossing with a twist. A dug in Russian force tries to keep a Rumanian force from crossing the river but the twist is that the Rumanians have troops popping out of the ether behind their lines. This action represents a situation where the Russians had broken through the Rumanian lines and reached a river. The Rumanian 1st Armored Division was tasked with counterattacking but the Russians were still dealing with bypassed units.&#10;&#10;FE 122 Slovakian Slugfest: This one is set on boards 40 and 50. The Germans are attempting to squash the Slovakian Uprising. The Germans are attacking down these boards against Slovakian armor and infantry supported by partisans. Some unique set up conditions give this good replay value.&#10;&#10;FE 123 Enemies All Around: The Bulgarians show up in this scenario. A small rear echelon German unit is surrounded. The Bulgarians have to destroy their vehicles. This scenario is set on boards 24 and 50.&#10;&#10;FE 124 Paulis Detachment: This is a very meaty scenario featuring the Hungarians fighting the Rumanians on boards 49 and 22. A dug in Rumanian force tries to hold off an strong Hungarian attack.&#10;&#10;FE 125 Lessons Learned the Hard Way: Here is a quick playing tourney scenario set on board 48. A small German force sets up HIP and tries to ambush a Bulgarian Reconnaissance unit. This should be a good one for lots of play with a great deal of replay potential.&#10;&#10;FE 126 Path to Retribution: The Yugoslavian armored brigade shows up in this one as they try to catch and destroy a German/Croatian combined arms force. This meaty scenario is set on boards 41 and 49.&#10;&#10;FE 127 Junkyard Wars: This scenario features the Bulgarian Armored Regiment attacking a force of Germans. Both sides get substantial armor and this is a meaty scenario. This scenario is set on boards 16 and 48&#10;&#10;",

Also, if a player only has one piece remaining, that piece automatically becomes a king.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who captures all of his/her opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chaos Campaign rules provides an open-ended campaign framework that easily allows gamemasters and players to use a variety of published-tracks to create their own unique gaming experiences using forces of their own creation. Each track that plugs into the Chaos Campaign rules system (there are no tracks found in this Chaos Campaign book which is a free download) provides a backstory that fits into the overall campaign plot. Likewise, each track is set up as a general framework to assist gamemasters and players in creating the opposing forces and adding other battlefield effects specific to that track. In addition, using the Warchest Point System, player groups may choose what direction the campaign takes.&#10;&#10;The Chaos Campaign rules are designed to allow players to customize campaigns from the Jihad Series of Scenario books and a new set of campaign books designed specifically for the Chaos Campaign system.&#10;&#10;The books in this series are:&#10;&#10;     Jihad Turning Points: Luthien fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of units fighting for control&mdash;and survival&mdash;of the Combine&rsquo;s capital world. Enemies from within and without seek to cut off the Dragon&rsquo;s head, while loyal samurai fight to save it.&#10;&#10;&#10;Further books are expected to be released in the coming year.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Classic Battletech: Total Warfare&#10;    Classic Battletech: Tactical Operations&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In essence it&rsquo;s a race to find the X square and discover the location of the hidden treasure. Along the way you have to collect eight various items to aid you in your expedition, but also look out for all the things which can trip you up and tunnels that can aid you in your search.&#10;&#10;Treasure chase is a whole lot of fun with just a little element of strategy thrown in and is designed for the whole family to play almost anywhere &ndash; as there is no board. You just need a flat surface and up to 4 willing pirates!&#10;&#10;Next year we intend to release the garden size version - perfect for the out door and the beach.&quot; This was emailed today 19 Nov 08 and so &quot;next year&quot; would mean 2009.&#10;&#10;",

Players start with 4 seeds in each pit and own the pits on the player's side of the board but this is one of the rare manqala games in which pieces are distinguishable, i.e., one player starts with white seeds and the other black. Sowing is anticlockwise starting in the pit adjacent to the starting pit and sowing one seed in each pit until the last seed is sown, without restriction on laps and sowing in the original pit if a sufficient number of seeds are in the original pit. Captures occur when the last seed is sown in an empty pit. That last seed and all seeds in the pits opposite it are captured. The winner is the player to capture more of the opponent's seeds and play continues until no more moves are possible.&#10;&#10;",

You can hire gunmen to help protect your claims, or use them to jump claims belonging to other players instead.  There are six different activities every turn (mine, claim jump, prospect, sell, hire, and draw), but you may only take three actions per turn.  There is some strategy involved, but also a little luck because you never know how much gold you will find in the mines or whether the dice will roll in your favor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the classic Scrabble word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.  (Description taken from the Scrabble entry).&#10;&#10;This Presidential edition of Scrabble is based on the familiar classic but with several interesting twists.  The letters and basic rules remain the same, but there are several important differences.  &#10;    The board is round and not square.  &#10;    All of the extra scoring spaces are replaced with the various states.  They have two effects.  The give the familiar triple letter or triple word scoring bonus.  In addition each states gives an additional bonus equal to the state&rsquo;s Electoral College value (after all other modifications).  So for instance California is a triple letter space and gives a bonus of 55 points as well (it is also way off to one side).&#10;    There is a list of extra &ldquo;words&rdquo; that are worth extra points; either 5, 10 or 15 points.  Some of these &ldquo;words&rdquo; are things like FDR or LBJ which would not ordinarily be available to use, while others are regular words like vote that just give an extra bonus.&#10;    Finally there is a deck of cards showing all of the Presidents.  Each card has a bit of historical information and gives a way to either get an extra bonus when played or change the rules in some fashion.  The Nixon card for instance allows one to play a word with one letter misspelled.  Players receive five of these cards at the start of the game, and can play at most one per turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aces Over Hungary is a scenario and campaign book for the popular Check Your 6! Air Combat and Campaign Rules. The book provides two campaigns in one cover: the first 11 scenarios show the evolution of the US 15th Air Force&rsquo;s strategic bombing campaign over Hungary during 1944; the next 12 scenarios recreate the intense combat between Hungarian and Soviet air forces as the Red Army overran Hungary in late 1944/1945. As well as covering events typical of the campaign (ground attack, reconnaissance, dogfights) the book also includes WWII&rsquo;s top ace Erich Hartmann, Stuka-ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel&rsquo;s Schlachtgeschwader 2, a rare 'balloon-busting' action, and unique prototype aircraft.&#10;&#10;Historical Research: This book includes several introduction sections that contain campaign historical background, a campaign map plus a bibliography for further reading. Very little reliable information about the operations of the Hungarian air force in WWII is available in English. Professional Hungarian military aviation historian Csaba Becze fills this gap with sections covering the background to the campaign, the relative capabilities of the air forces involved and their weapons and tactics, the course of operations, and fascinating accurate details of each of the battles represented in the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Aircraft Statistics: this book contains statistics for 27 aircraft featured in the campaign in aircraft statistics for Check Your 6!! .&#10;&#10;Table of Contents&#10;&#10;&#10;     Campaign Introduction&#10;     Hungary Campaign Map&#10;     References and Recommended Reading&#10;     Hungarian Aces&#10;     The Protagonists - Hungary, Germany, USA, USSR&#10;     Axis and Allied Aircraft Statistics for Check Your 6!&#10;     Campaign Rules&#10;     Campaign Paragraphs&#10;     Scenarios (23)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Billed as &quot;the fun game that lets you explore your feelings &amp; values&quot;, this TV show-inspired game seems to be in keeping with its Ungame ancestry.  The goal of the game is nominally to collect a set of cards which match your &quot;Winning Ticket&quot;, where the four types of cards correspond to the four main characters from &quot;The New Zoo Review&quot; (Freddie the Frog, Henrietta Hippo, Charlie the Owl, and their human friend Doug).  However, the clear focus of the game is for the players (ideally children and their parents) to discuss various emotions and values in response to scenarios from the show described on the cards.  For example, by landing on a Charlie the Owl space, the player may receive a card which reads:&#10;&#10;Charlie is disappointed when his oil well isn't a big &quot;money maker.&quot;&#10;TELL ABOUT ONE OF YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS.&#10;&#10;One odd element of the game is the Gift Exchange spaces, which require a player landing on them to use a large spinner to select a &quot;gift&quot;, which can vary from &quot;if you have any cards, give one away&quot; to &quot;apologize to somebody for something&quot; to &quot;scratch someone's back for 15 seconds&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a &quot;Christian Version&quot; which includes two pages of notes on how to enhance the religious education aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A manqala game.&#10;&#10;From&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Mbelele:&#10;&#10;&quot;Mbelele is a very special mancala game. It is played by the Manga (or: Mba) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They live between Kisangani and Banalia and the game is played along the road that links Kisangani with Buta between kilometer 17 and 118. The Manga are the most southern Sudanese tribe in Upper Zaire. &#10;The board, which measures about a meter, is made from the wood of the Kombo-Kombo (Musanga cecropioides). A beautiful Mbelele board is shown in the National Museum in Kinshasa since 1975. &#10;What makes it a special game is the bizarre board and the fact that although there are two rows on the board, they are not shared by both players, as each plays only on his own row, making it one of the few two cycle games played on two rank boards. According to Townshend the game could also be regarded as a three-row mancala.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board (called mbele p&aacute;pa) consists of two rows of 16 holes and four intermediate holes that are called teka. At the beginning of the game there are three seeds (Sing.: mbelele; Pl.: mbelese) in each hole. On his turn the player takes all the seeds of a hole belonging to his side and sows them in either direction in multiple laps, until he gets to an empty hole. If he reaches the last hole in his side he comes back. &#10;If the last seed is sown in an empty hole opposite to a non-empty enemy hole, the opponent's seeds are captured. &#10;If the move ends in any of the teka, the capture is made in the correspondent hole of the opponent. &#10;A capture made with a singleton captures only a single seed. &#10;It is not allowed to start a move from the last hole but one on the right, going to the right, if it contains only two seeds (he move would end in the same hole). &#10;The winner is the player who captures all of the opponent's seeds. A draw is not possible.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game.&#10;&#10;Source: http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Moruba&#10;&#10;&quot;Moruba (also Maruba) is a mancala game played by the Pedi (obsolete: Bapedi) in the South African provinces of Limpopo (mostly in the North Sotho speaking parts) and Mpumalunga in former Transvaal. Later, the game has been spread by mine workers to Gauteng. It is closely related to games described in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game was first researched in 1917 by the British ethnograph P. A. Wagner.&#10;&#10;Moruba is traditionally played by men in the late afternoon in the shade of a tree. The game was used during war and was a social activity where men strategised about a variety of activities and events related to them, also shared advise and ideas. Language, expressions and terminology of the game signify what happens when war takes place. As women weren't allowed to go to war, they didn't play the game. In recent days, however, both genders began to play.&#10;&#10;Starting in 2003, Moruba is promoted as an indigenous sport by the CSIR's National Product Development Centre and the South African Sports Commission (SASC). There were team and individual tournaments at the Indigenous Games Festival in Polokwane and the Indigenous Games Competition in Tzaneen. The game is also supported by the Mpumalanga Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture of the Province Gauteng, because it forms an important expression of indigenous identity and, as it was said, of a &quot;healthy life style&quot;. The best players, among them D. Shikwambam and Petrus Shibambu, are organized in Mindsports South Africa (MMSA).&#10;&#10;This renaissance of African games is a response to Thabo Mbeki's call &quot;to rediscover what was lost by indigenous people (of Africa through colonialism)&quot;.&#10;&#10;Today the towns of Sasekani and Bolobedu are centers of the game. Strong clubs are also in Ka-Phalaborwa, Letaba, and Selwane. The newspaper Mopani News reports reguarly on Moruba competitions. The game which is already taught in the Bolobedu High School, will soon be introduced in all schools of Limpopo Province. Dickson Mpofu, the indigenous games co-ordinator in Mpumalanga, even wants to register Moruba with the Olympic committee.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;The size of the game board often depends on the number of players. Most common are boards which have four rows of 12 holes (mekoti) each, but the number of holes can vary from four to 36 holes per row. The holes are dug into the earth. Each hole has two counters, usually pebbles or morula pips, which are called mathlapa (&quot;cattle&quot;) or tinkhomo (&quot;cow&quot;).&#10;&#10;The game is played by two persons and sometimes by teams of up to six.&#10;&#10;Each player (or team) only uses his side of the board.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two stones, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side.&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction.&#10;&#10;The move ends (kulala; literally &quot;to sleep&quot;) when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of his opponent contains stones, these enemy stones are &quot;killed&quot; (tlaba) or &quot;hit&quot;. Additionally, the stones in the hole of the same file in the outer row are &quot;captured&quot; (tlola). The killed or captured stones are removed from the board. The player is then entitled to capture the contents of any two other enemy holes.&#10;&#10;When a player has only singletons, he is permitted to move them, but only in empty holes.&#10;&#10;The player who has still stones at the end of the game is declared the winner. It is a draw, when the board position repeats without anything being captured. &quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From: http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mefuvha&#10;&#10;Mefuvha (&quot;foggy rain&quot;) (&quot;foggy rain&quot;) is a mancala game of the Venda who are living in north-eastern South Africa. It is closely related to Moruba played in the same area by the Pedi and to games known by the Tonga in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game is played by men only, while women play Ndode, a game of dexterity.&#10;&#10;Mefuvha is mentioned in old Venda legends such as the story of Sankhambi and the Baboons, which was written down by the British ethnologist Hugh Arthur Stayt in 1931.&#10;&#10;In the rainy season it is strictly tabu to play the game with stones, for fear that the rain will be turned to hail; fruit pips are used instead. Moreover, it is prohibited to play the game after sunset because this would provoke cattle theft. The symbolic meanings of the game are athmospheric conflict and cattle-raiding.&#10;Mefuvha Board&#10;&#10;Mefuvha is played on solid wooden boards made from the trunk of a tree that can measure two meters and longer. Stayt observed boards up to 28 holes per row. The game was thus regarded to be the largest mancala game until it was reported in 1971 that Nsolo is played on bigger boards (up to 4x36 holes). Since 1995, Tchouba is known to be even larger (up to 4x40 holes).&#10;&#10;The name of the game has often been misspelled as Mefuhva.&#10; Rules:&#10;&#10;Mefuvha is played on a board with an equal even number of square holes in each of the four rows from six to twenty-eight in a row, the usual number being between sixteen and twenty.&#10;&#10;The holes contain two seeds except the leftmost hole of each player's inner row, which is empty, and the holes adjacent to them in the inner rows, which have just one seed.&#10;&#10;Otherwise, the rules are identical to Moruba.&#10;&#10;",

The game was first described in Europe in 1956 by J. H. Chaplin in the British journal Man.&#10;&#10;The boards are most commonly dug into the ground, the predominantly sandy soil making the excavation of holes quite easy. However, wooden boards are also carved.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;A board is used that consists of four rows, each one with eight holes. A player controls the two rows that are closer to him.&#10;&#10;At the start the holes in the outer rows contain two seeds, whereas the inner holes are empty. Each player also has 16 seeds in reserve.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes that contains at least two seeds anti-clockwise one by one into the following holes of his side.&#10;&#10;If the last seed is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are picked up and then distributed in another lap, unless a capture is conducted.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole in the inner row and the enemy hole directly opposite is also occupied, the contents of both holes in the opponent's opposite file are captured. These enemy seeds are re-entered in a new lap, the sowing beginning at the hole from which the capture was initiated.&#10;&#10;A turn ends when the last seed is placed into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;Once in a game a player may distribute his reserve by placing in each of his holes one seed. Then, in the same turn, he continues by making an ordinary move as described.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cannot move.&#10;&#10;The player who could move last wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Nsolo:&#10;&#10;Nsolo, also called Nchombwa, is played by the Angoni in Malawi and Zambia. It is the one of the largest mancala games known to exist. A close variant of the game was already described in 1913 by Meredith G. Sanderson, a military doctor in the British colony Nyasaland (today Malawi). The rules which are given in this description were reported in 1975 from Ndola, Zambia. The holes are usually dug in the ground.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board ranging from 4 x 8 to 4 x 36 holes.&#10;&#10;Each player owns the two rows on his side. If a very large board is used, two teams are fighting against each other.&#10;&#10;Initially, there are two stones in each hole except in the rightmost holes (as viewed from the respective owner) of each inner row which are left empty. The largest variant needs 284 stones.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one for one in a counter-clockwise direction in the consecutive holes of his two rows. If the last stone falls in a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last stone) are picked up and then distributed in the same way.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;It is only permitted to move singletons for a player if he has no holes left which contain two or more stones. However, singletons may only be moved if the next hole is empty.&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the players inner row and the opposite hole of the opponents inner row contains stones, these enemy stones are captured.&#10;&#10;In addition, this move entitles a player to remove, from any part of his opponent's area, the same number of stones as were captured from the occupied hole.&#10;&#10;The captured stones are removed from play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player resigns or does not have any stones left. When the board position repeats, the game is a draw.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pachgarhwa was first described in 1906 by E. de M. Humphries, a civil servant appointed as the Sub-divisional Officer at Karwi Sub-division at United Provinces, Northern India (today in the Bandi District of Uttar Pradesh).&#10;&#10;No cultural background is given except that it &quot;appears to be more popular than its intrinsic interest would seem to merit&quot;.&#10;&#10;A similar games appears to be Longbeu-a-cha in Assam. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;RulesThe board is made of two rows of five holes.&#10;&#10;At the beginning, there are in each hole five pieces made of a material called kankar (presumably a mineral used as a construction material, a calcareous laterite with a high lime content).&#10;&#10;Each player controls the holes on her side of the board.&#10;&#10;At your turn you take all the pieces from any hole on your side of the board and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each hole. After you have sown them, you take the ones in the next hole and keep on sowing with them.&#10;&#10;Your turn ends when you put the last piece of a sowing in a hole followed by an empty one.&#10;&#10;If the hole following the empty one is not empty, after a player has finished sowing, he captures its contents.&#10;&#10;The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.&#10;&#10;According to the description the game ends when &quot;all the pieces on the board are exhausted&quot;&#10;&#10;This is indeed possible, although it is a rather unusual ending. Humphries failed to explain what would happen if a player has no pieces to distribute, while his opponent has still pieces left in his holes.&#10;&#10;Similar games (e.g. Bay Khom, Walak-pussa) include the following rule:&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no legal move and the remaining pieces are captured by his adversary.&#10;&#10;The game was played in several rounds, in which holes could be captured, but the exact rules weren't given as &quot;by that time things began to get complicated and I was unable to discover how, if ever, the game ended&quot;.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
