Among other things, you'll be making tough choices activating your warband, reacting to enemies during their turn, flanking enemies and deciding when to play it safe and when to take risks.&#10;&#10;Xenotactics has no modifiers to calculate, tables to look up or tons of counters to clutter the battlefield. A mission lasts under an hour so you can finish a short campaign in an evening. Or play best out of three if you have a competitive craving. As warbands only number a few miniatures they're quick to paint and prepare for battle.&#10;&#10;The game is not associated with any specific line of models, instead you use whatever models you like best or happen to own thanks to the character creation rules. This allows you to create balanced statlines with for miniatures from almost any sci-fi miniature range. A warband usually numbers about 10 miniatures.&#10;&#10;You can read the rules online on the games webpage. A pdf ruleset is also available which expands the game with campaign rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The House of Representatives then deliberated for four days behind  before voting in favor of the first declaration of war. The Senate concurred in the declaration and the conflict began formally on June 18, 1812, when Madison signed the measure into law and proclaimed it the next day.  The war would wage until the Senate approved the Treaty of Ghent on February 17, 1815.&#10;&#10;Dawn's Early Light tasks two players to recreate this pivotal war in American, British and Canadian history. As the United States, you will be be tempted to invade Canada while also maintaining the country's honor on the high seas.  As the British and Canadians, you will be tasked with keeping the upstart Americans in check.&#10;&#10;Dawn's Early Light is a low complexity, card driven game for two players (with solitaire rules). Players relive the decisions and dilemmas of this crucial period in history. Fast setup and a playtime of 45-75 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Ranging far ahead of the main battle line, they prosecute full-spectrum campaigns of domination against the enemy by sabotaging communications, demolishing supply caches, and draining morale with terror strikes.

The Enlightenment format sees three players racing to claim all five elemental rings, while Team Conquest allows players to join up into two teams to break each others' strongholds. When the clans clash in open war, none can be victorious alone! Not only does the expansion include the rules for how to play these formats, but most cards in the set synergize with multiplayer play, and a treaty pad and cards included in the expansion allow you to form and break alliances.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is 1985. This is World War III. But this is not your typical World War III.&#10;&#10;There are many accurate-to-the-underwear-brand World War III games to choose from, and the ones that I have played are quite good. This, however, is not one of them. Although The Long Road flirts with reality, it&rsquo;s not ready to move in and live with it. This game has a twist. From the moment I designed World at War: Eisenbach Gap I envisioned a war that was something else, a war that was predicated by something other than oil or warm-water ports or ill-defined land grabs. A war instigated by powers without geographical affiliation, powers unknown to us.&#10;&#10;The agents of those powers might be nothing more than a special ops team of mysterious origin sent to assassinate a world leader, nothing more than a militia, ambushing foreigners raping their mother country; nothing other than normal. Then again, they might be other than normal, or&mdash;by definition&mdash;paranormal.&#10;&#10;So that is the twist, a wargame with paranormal elements. Make no mistake, I&rsquo;ve strived to make this an accessible, yet accurate wargame. Included is everything from advanced sights, multi-spectral smoke, artillery-delivered minefields, to electronic counter measures, anti-tank guided missiles, attack helicopters and the man-portable, air defense systems required to bring them down. You&rsquo;ll command the weapons of the time; Abrams tanks, T-80 tanks, M60A3, T-64B, and Sheridan tanks. Bradleys, M-113s, BMPs, infantry, spetsnaz, and more.&#10;&#10;But of course, war isn&rsquo;t won by equipment; war is won by soldiers. In The Long Road soldiers&rsquo; training and morale is integral to the game, integral to combat resolution. But even more important than the rank and file grunts are the heroes. The men and woman who can - turn the tide of battle. We&rsquo;ve included them too. People like Mike Hudson, Colonel Adrik Aleksandrov Shabalin, tank commander Sergeant Matt Dahl, and Commissar Colonel Elena Petrova. Heroic humans, but humans nonetheless.&#10;&#10;But there is something more. Somethings that are not &quot;humans nonetheless.&quot; Demons that summon electrical storms, rendering advanced weaponry nearly useless, Lycan clans that fight with assault rifles, RPDs, and RPGs, as well as the fang and claw of their elders. A witch with an agenda, plus the powerful spells to make it happen, and of course, Katarina Ubirek; an amoral Romanian vampire worth dozens of inexperienced soldiers in combat. You know those things that you have read about, watched in movies, heard about on horror podcasts? Well, in The Long Road they are real.&#10;&#10;But not every scenario contains nightmares. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll fight with/against/in spite of these paranormal beings, yet often your battle will be about nothing more than depleted uranium rounds, reactive armor, maneuver, and massed fires. In fact, we include a separate scenario book in the game titled Long Road Tactics that includes nothing but historical, for lack of a better word, scenarios.&#10;&#10;So that is The Long Road; part military horror, part authentic recreation of World War III, but all fun. We hope you enjoy it.&#10;&#10;Coming to Kickstarter soon!&#10;&#10;Each copy of The Long Road includes.&#10;&#10;&middot;        5 sheets of thick (2mm thick), large (1&quot; square, large) counters.&#10;&#10;&middot;        3 MOUNTED 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map geomorphic boards. Not paper, not stiff cardboard, but rather 2mm-thick, wrapped and backed mounted game boards.5 sheets of thick (2mm thick), large (1&quot; square, large) counters.&#10;&#10;&middot;        27 full-color Action Cards. The game isn't card driven; it's card assisted.&#10;&#10;&middot;        Full-color rules.&#10;&#10;&middot;        4 Player Aid Cards.&#10;&#10;&middot;        5 ten-sided dice for resolving combat.&#10;&#10;&middot;        A quarter ton of scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Putin Moves East is an operational-strategic level two player wargame covering a struggle for control between the Russian led Eurasian Union and a Coalition of opposing states, led by the People's Republic of China, to gain control of the Far East. Among other things, the game presumes a breakdown in Russian Chinese relations leading to open belligerency. Units represent operational task forces of corps or reinforced size; special forces; airpower; and cyberwar. Additionally, paramilitary forces play a significant role in the game rules. The objective of each player is to seize critical resource, industrial and communications centers, thereby gaining control of the Far East. Each hex on the map represents 100 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to a couple weeks of refitting. Ground units represent mostly corps sized task forces. Special forces units are regiments, brigades or groupings of cadres.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on one sheet &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;&#10;Modern War, Issue #50&#10;&#10;",

The dying sun is releasing intense bursts of solar radiation that&rsquo;s destroying the planets around it, making it an invitation for death for anyone who enters the system. However due to the extreme solar activity, brand new elements are being formed and are worth billions of units. You&rsquo;re one of a few brave mercenaries trying to make your way through the system gathering as many resources as you can before the sun goes supernova. You&rsquo;ll find higher valued resources as you get closer to the sun, but it&rsquo;ll be hard on your shields. Will you get the resources you need to set yourself up for life, or will you fly too close to the sun and be destroyed?&#10;&#10;Built into the game is the Supernova tracker. This keeps track of how close the sun is to going supernova. The tracker advances after each round (after each player takes their turn) and whenever a supernova event card is drawn from the drill deck. The amount of supernova event cards put into the deck depends on how many players are in the game.&#10;&#10;In Project Icarus, players take turns moving around the board, drilling resources off of planets, and visit space station to repair and upgrade their ship. Players need to manage their resource space, engine power, drill integrity, and shield levels in order to survive and win the game. Each player is working on getting the resources shown on the selected goal card and be the first to return to their hyperspace vector before their shield runs out and before the sun goes supernova.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The saboteur has struck again... but who is the saboteur?&#10;&#10;Can you and your fellow miners build a path to the hidden gold, or will the saboteurs thwart your efforts? You&rsquo;ll have to overcome cave-ins, broken lanterns, and busted pickaxes, along with special action cards that let other miners steal your gold and swap their identity. But the key bonus features in this set are team play and new characters who add competing motives -- some help the miners, some aid the saboteurs, and one is more interested in crystals than gold.&#10;&#10;This bonus pack includes everything from the original game and the Saboteur 2 Expansion Pack, plus a collectors&rsquo; card that introduces a devious special character. With its unique combination of cooperation and betrayal, Saboteur reveals new secrets every time it&rsquo;s played. So whether you dig into the original game, add on the expansion pack, or mine the possibilities of the collectors' card,  with this Saboteur bundle you've hit the mother lode of treasure and treachery.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

The first team to take all 9 lives of their traitor wins the game!&#10;&#10;But these families are bringing in the big guns. We're talking drone strikes, holy hand grenades, rocket launchers, sticky bombs, napalm strikes, explosive arrows, and more!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you will draft 5 cards, program them out in front of you (choosing the top or bottom action of each card), then watch the chaos unfold. After each turn, projectiles move (either due to gravity or due to their momentum) and airborne cats fall toward the ground.&#10;&#10;Just remember, no plan survives contact with the enemy. Your carefully placed grenade might be run into by your own teammate. Your sprint could be negated as you're pushed off the ceiling fan. Your enemy could slap you so hard you spin around and start attacking your own team!&#10;&#10;Rocket Cats was born out of our love for old-school, 2-dimensional, side-scrolling artillery games like Worms Armageddon and Scorched Earth. We wanted to take the fun, chaotic excitement from these games and transform it into a boardgame. A game where you know things probably won&rsquo;t end up exactly as you planned&hellip; which is half the fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At JRK Innovations we&rsquo;ve been innovating for over 10 years. This time around, we&rsquo;ve put our sights on the next best game with the Brownie Points Card Game, an electrifying game with unique elements combined into one challenging, fast, heart-pounding game.&#10;&#10;When you see games being played with typical cards, they can be fun, but you&rsquo;ll see after a short period of time people tune out and begin to wonder, what&rsquo;s next. Think about it: how many times have you played a game that just didn&rsquo;t capture your attention?&#10;&#10;The brownie points card game is a major tune-up. Here&rsquo;s how we do it:&#10;Central to the brownie points card game is the no hand is safe and every hand can be won or lost. the brownie points slap attack injects a level of competitiveness for all gamers at any level dramatically improving awareness and engagement by all players.&#10;&#10;This means two important things: 1) No matter how good or bad you are at games, everyone is on the same playing field. No one can hide from the slap attack.  2) Every player must be alert and watching each hand play. This creates urgency and awareness not typical in other games.&#10;&#10;Control the score keeping from the palm of your hand with the free Brownie Points Scorecard that syncs to all your players devices so everyone has a front row seat to the scorecard. With the built-in trends feature, you can instantly see who&rsquo;s trending up or down along with how many trophies you&rsquo;ve earned by winning rounds.&#10;&#10;The Scorecard can accommodate small or large groups, so invite the neighborhood, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. And with the friends and worldwide leader boards, you can see how you stack up to the competition.&#10;&#10;Got 60 seconds? Here&rsquo;s why the Brownie Points Card Game is different:&#10;&#10;    1. Five key elements that change the game on a dime when you never expect it.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    2. Every player is engaged with the ability to steal each hand or hold of for an even bigger play.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    3. No hand is safe in this game no matter how hard you try to out-think your opponent.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    4. One card that makes every player a little nervous as it can take you out of the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;WHAT IS THIS?&#10;&#10;THIS IS A CARD GAME THAT HOLDS NO MERCY&#10;&#10;Brownie Points Card Game is a highly strategic, fast pace game full of surprises that you can never plan for. Players take turns drawing cards, Brownie Point Slap Attacking their opponents and earning as many points as possible each round. The deck is made up of cards that let you send all your opponents to the Dog House, a Game Changer that immediately trumps the pile, and a Brownie Squirts Card that can instantly turn all your cards to negative points and take you out of the round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gravity Falls: Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure is a fan-made adaptation of the Disney series Gravity Falls: The now-13 year-old Pines twins return to Gravity Falls with dreams of having another amazing summer adventure with their friends, but it's not starting out to be much of an adventure. Waddles has been banned from the bus system and had to stay behind in Piedmont, Stan and Ford are both off on their own adventures in parts unknown and Wendy got a new job outside of town! Tourism is way down and business is not good at the Mystery Shack so far either. Soos has been nice enough to let Dipper and Mabel stay in the Mystery Shack attic again as his guests, but what's the point? It starts to seem like the twins aren't going to re-live another 'amazing summer' after all... that is until Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, and Gideon pay a surprise visit to the twins. They tell the twins tales of new strange things going on in town and how the four of them have been out adventuring every day and are now on a quest to get to the bottom of all this new weirdness. For Mabel and Dipper, nothing sounds better than a Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure in Gravity Falls!&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of one or more of the Gravity Falls characters: Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, or Gideon. Each character has unique abilities and each can be &quot;leveled-up&quot; to further expand their uniqueness. Players take turns moving their character(s) on the game board, which is a representation of the Gravity Falls townsite and surrounding area. On each board space a player may choose to stop and perform an action, such as visiting local shops to purchase equipment, supplies, or items to use as weapons, or they may &quot;Search&quot; their current location. Searching requires players to draw a card from the Search Deck, which contains random events, Foes, and item cards.&#10;&#10;Encounters with enemies (Foes) requires that characters first make a &quot;Fear Test&quot;, pitting their own &quot;Weirdness&quot; against their newly-encountered Foe. The game also employs a &quot;Fear Tracker&quot; which has increasing threat levels indicating how frightened the characters are at the moment. When the Fear level is low, creatures like a Gremgoblin or Giant Fruit Bat may not seem so scary at all. But, as the Fear level increases, it is possible that even encountering cute critters like Fairies, Beavers or a Snake-Badger (or is it a Snadger?) may be terrifying causing characters to initially flee before they are willing to re-consider engaging in battle.&#10;&#10;Games may be played using a fully randomized game board and Search deck, or players may use the Quest book that is included with the rules to play through a story-driven series of increasingly difficult Quests to discover what is behind these strange goings-on in Gravity Falls. For each of these Quests that are completed the players may draw a single Treasure card, which is often a rare or unique item that they can keep or trade in to the Mystery Shack in exchange for in-game bonuses or perks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Player characters form an Adventuring Party that interacts with the inhabitants of Filigree and with each other. Each character has their own unique set of items, skills and magic. Together you will solve puzzles, engage in battles, gather loot and decide the path your story will take. As the game progresses, your character will earn Experience Points and level up, discover new locations, acquire and craft items, learn new skills and magic, master weaponry and become increasingly powerful through many different types of encounters in an ever changing world.&#10;&#10;Adventure Ink is a write-and-role playing game. At times you will be drawing cards and rolling dice, and then writing the results of your draws and rolls on various game components, including the dry erase gameplay board. These results will assist you in role playing as your character within the illustrated settings you help create. Using an innovative character personality system and a deterministic tactical combat system, battle outcomes will be determined based on your strategies and decisions, not on dice rolls or randomly drawn modifiers. The game can be played as a single competitive/cooperative skirmish or as a cooperative campaign over a series of sessions where, as a group, you will use the accompanying Scenario book to choose which path to follow from a series of encounters. A Game Master, or &ldquo;GM&rdquo;, who reads the story and controls the various Non-Player Characters (&ldquo;NPCs&rdquo;) is not needed to play Adventure Ink.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You lead a group of nine adventurers, explore secrets and find relics of the island.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical deck of nine adventurer cards. Each adventurer card has one greater effect and one lesser effect written on it. At the beginning of each round, players choose four cards from their deck to form their hand.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play an adventurer card. If you play it for the lesser effect, it is resolved immediately. Otherwise, its greater effect is resolved at your next turn. Other players may counter the greater effect by playing the same adventurer card on their turn.&#10;&#10;Depending on the card played, you gain resources, spend resources to accomplish a quest, find a relic, or encounter a fate.&#10;&#10;After the fourth round, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game was designed by WY Games (WY&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#186;) collectively.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#229;&#174;&#191;&#229;&#145;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#170;&#232;&#184;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#232;&#177;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#185;&#157;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#134;&#146;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#151;&#167;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#229;&#175;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#191;&#189;&#231;&#169;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#232;&#186;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#182;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#155;&#132;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#232;&#168;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#233;&#135;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#191;&#138;&#232;&#139;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#181;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#230;&#165;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#229;&#138;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#230;&#165;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#233;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&hellip;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

Now Hamilton the goat has to try to communicate with the family's three cats to try and destroy the machine to save the world.&#10;&#10;One player plays Hamilton, the other players play the cats. Each player has a card. To destroy the machine, the cats have to position themselves around the machine, and one of them must have a tool card next to them. But only Hamilton knows the necessary position and has to communicate it to the cats. However, the cats can only say &quot;Miau&quot; like a cat (and point to cards), and Hamilton can only say &quot;B&eacute;e&quot; like a goat if at least one card is in the correct position. If the players find the correct placement for each card within four rounds, they win. Otherwise the little villain comes back from school and destroys the world.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are Sherlock Holmes&hellip; at home at 221b Baker Street, when a mysterious letter is posted through your door. What is the meaning of the message cut from newsprint? Is there a clue hidden in the letters? Could there be more to discover in the fog-bound alleys of London town? This ingenious new series is a spin on the current urban craze for &lsquo;Escape Rooms&rsquo;, in which participants are locked in rooms, and must solve the puzzles they find there to make good their escape. Here, the book becomes the locked room, the pages become the path, and the reader can take on a challenge every bit as brain-teasing from the comfort of their own home. Visual clues are hidden among the intriguing illustrations; fiendish riddles, logic puzzles, and timed challenges unlock hidden doors and reveal the direction of travel; and mathematical problems provide the codes required to follow the correct path. There are maps and mazes to explore; references to the original Sherlock Holmes adventures to unravel; and a code-wheel that holds the key to unlocking the next page. Solve the puzzles correctly to escape. Get them wrong, and you will find yourself further and further along the path to your own demise.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Repeat for all 8 question cards in the round. Once you're done with the round, compare answers question-by-question, team-by-team. If you and your teammate pick correctly for each other (you get theirs right and they get yours right), you get 1 team point. Anything else is 0 points. The team with the total number of team points after all 3 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are two main additional ways to play: Party Mode and 1-on-1. For Party Mode, one person reads each question out loud and people shout out what they would choose. Then everyone argues about why they're right and everyone else is wrong. For 1-on-1, you and that someone you think you know well are the only team playing. Which one of you knows the other person better?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

He must play a red card followed by a colour of his choice followed by another red card etc and can continue playing until he gets a question wrong.  With each turn, the rules of snooker apply ie. after playing and answering correctly questions on 15 red cards and the following card of his choice the player must then answer one question each from yellow green brown blue pink and black packet in that order.&#10;Before playing a card of the colour chosen the player rolls the die which determines which question on the card he must attempt to answer.  The person on the players right checks the answer and places the card question up on the bottom of the pack.  The person on the players left keeps the players score.  When the player fails to answer a question correctly play passes to the left.  The first player to finish his turn with an exact score of 147 is the winner if after his final score turn a players score totals over 147 he must retire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",
