If you decorate your house with as many lights as possible, you will make a good impression. Do you know after the neon party who lives on who on which house number lives? Then you have a big chance of winning the neon party game!&#10;&#10;The player tries to get many points as possible on his house number. The players don't know each other's house number. There are 2 sets of house numbers cards 1-5. One of them are placed in the middle of the table. Each player receives a secret housenumber from the other set of 1-5.&#10;&#10;The rest of the cards consist cards with numbers -5 (defect neon lights) to 5(working neon lights) and a few special cards. These cards form the draw pile. If it is a players turn, he will take a card from the draw pile. He can place this card on both sides of a house number. Then it's the next players turn and he does the same. If there is a total of 5 cards on both sides of a house number, there is a scoring. &#10;First, it is determined which side of this house number has the most cards. The side with the most cards will be placed on table below the house number card. For the order house numbers, the same side will be placed below the house number card. The entire other side of the house numbers with cards will be placed on the discard pile. After this, there are no more neon light cards on table (except below the house numbers and the discard pile). Then the game continues. If there are 5 cards placed at a house number another scoring takes place. The game ends when the draw pile is used up.&#10;&#10;There are 2 special cards with which you can remove cards and do 2 turns in a row.&#10;&#10;The players then guess from each other which house number they have. Each correctly guessed house number earns 5 points. If someone is well guessed by all persons, he is out of the game and therefore does not participate in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;Everyone counts the points on the cards under their house number. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A fun game for parties, family gatherings, or just a casual evening with friends, Blackpool is designed to engage kids and grown ups alike.&#10;&#10;Along with luck, you will need to use sound strategies to win this game. To win, you have to be the first player to get all of your travellers (the tokens are called travellers in Blackpool) out of the mystic whirlpool and land them safely back to your camp. You can use curse cards to stop others, charm cards to move ahead, and take advantage of anyone who is ahead of you by using the special piggybacking technique. You can jump on someone who is ahead of you to slow them down, or move ahead with them. Smart use of piggybacking can become the difference between winning and losing the game.&#10;&#10;The race starts from the middle of the board, and the players have to move outwards. Each player has three &lsquo;travellers&rsquo; whom they have to save from the whirlpool. In order to do so, the travellers have to get to their camps, which are at the corners of the board. The travellers have to go through several rings to get to the camp. Like a real whirlpool, in Blackpool, it gets easier to move as you get further away from the center. The players movement depends on the dice roll and on the ring they are at. The first player to get all their travellers to their camp wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This reversible Blood Bowl pitch features one such ruin, in two different states. On one, the temple lies dormant, the flora and fauna of the rainforest threatening to reclaim it. On the other side, the temple has been pressed into new service by the Lizardmen, with fresh glyphs and blazing pyres.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll also find a pair of matching double-sided dugouts to complete the theme. Each dugout features a score tracker, boxes for Reserves, Knocked Out and Serious Injury, plus goal and re-roll trackers.

Only after 1261, in competition with the Genoese, did the Venetians organize the first commercial activities related to high-value cargo. Despite the difficulties in recruiting and commanding the crews, the connections with the Black Sea were essential for the Venetian economy in the period.&#10;&#10;At Pontus Euxinus, players take on the role of traders sailing the difficult Black Sea, with all its challenges, to earn profits for their family and reputation for their home. Throughout the game, players will need to not only make the most of the goods they transport, but also build ports along the huge coastline, build cities and establish influence at various points.&#10;&#10;The game works through an innovative system of data use in which each round the parameters change and the players need a good planning to face the difficulties.

After all, you want to get in the graces of the Prince, right?&#10;&#10;The Jester&rsquo;s Gambit expansion introduces two new types of cards: Events and Hidden Agendas, to spice up the struggle of the guild leaders in the slyest of all medieval cities!

    "Description": "While very similar to All-Star Baseball, Ethan Allen saw it as a different game rather than an expansion or 'supplement' in that it was more strategically involved and more sophisticated than the original game. New material was incompatible with the original game.&#10;&#10;Description of All-Star Baseball:&#10;&#10;signed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time. The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabiltyi of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball. Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately. The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number. The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense. Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details. Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard. Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

World explorers have discovered new lands, and the race is on to discover what new valuables and resources await those who manage to hold onto the claim. Wars and rumors of war continuously occur across the old Continent, and everyone&rsquo;s looking for an edge.&#10;&#10;But these new lands, much of it is already populated by unknown peoples with strange customs. No matter&hellip; perhaps they can be convinced to become an asset for us, or be forcibly removed. Maybe these inhabitants should just be left alone in peace, much like so many wish for their own here at home. But the continuous undertow of world supremacy rages on, and all are caught in her current.&#10;&#10;This is where you find yourself today: Will you sit back peacefully and leave to chance your country&rsquo;s rise to dominance on the self-destruction of the others, or will you dive right in and grab what you can of what the New World has to offer, using that tried and true technique: Exploitation.&#10;&#10;Exploitation is a 4x game (3.5x essentially), whereby players manage their resources to navigate the world, founding/conquering settlements and using them to reap more resources. In turn, they can be used for exploring farther regions, building stronger armadas, battling other players, enlisting the help of Privateers, and otherwise trying to be the nation with the highest prestige in the historical setting of the Colonial Era. In the course of play, players are also confronted with the moral complications of the slave trade and the plight of indigenous native populations of the New World.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Do you: stack one card or balance cards, directly attack others or choose a card just to prevent another from getting it, save it for later or spend now? In the scoring phase each player throws their resulting food tokens like dice (each side has a number) adding any modifiers obtained resulting in their round score.&#10;&#10;",

For the setup, on the exterior of the board, just outside of each of its six sides, equal and alternating strings of the two colors (one black string, one white string) are placed.  These exterior stones are known as the &quot;exo-stones.&quot;&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player places a single stone of his/her own color into any empty cell; once placed, stones never move. Play continues until the board is full or both players pass, at which point the game is scored. Any group of own-color stones has a score equal to the number of &quot;exo-stones&quot; that it contains.  The owner of the highest scoring group wins.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie for highest scoring group, then the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups are compared; the owner of the highest scoring group among the remaining groups wins. If these groups are also tied, then the process is repeated (that is, the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups compared) until a winner results.  (It is impossible for group scores to be tied &ldquo;all the way down.&rdquo;)&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Pie Rule&rdquo; applies:  After Player 1 plays the first stone to the board, Player 2 can decide whether to play his/her own color to the board, or alternatively, switch colors with Player 1.  (The purpose of this rule is to offset the first player advantage: if Player 1 plays too strong of an opening move, then a rational Player 2 will decide to switch colors and make the just-played stone his/her opening move.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The maps should be printed on 12 x 18 inch paper to produce an 11 x 17 inch map.***&#10;&#10;Ambush at Rannugen depicts a never fought 1985 engagement in the Fulda Gap using Jim Day's and GMT&rsquo;s MBT Game pitting a reinforced US tank company team of the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) against a reinforced Warsaw Pact Motorized Rifle Battalion in Germany.&#10;&#10;The scenario reflects my experience as a Company Commander in 1984-1985  The game explores a way to use terrain in a different manner to defeat the enemy.  In a conventional defense, the US establishes a killing zone by positioning on good terrain with frontal and flank shots to destroy the enemy once he enters the zone.  Here, the tactic is to position the US force in such a manner that he is rewarded with shots on the enemy's rear and flanks while at the same time perhaps avoiding some of the enemy's artillery bombardment.  The dicey part, however, is withdrawing and getting to a new position after finishing the engagement.&#10;&#10;Like other scenarios I have released, it is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game. The expansion includes 4 11 x 17 maps scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game), a Scenario Briefing, a US Battle Book and a Soviet Battle book with deployment instructions and order of battle listing, and a terrain key. The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.&#10;&#10;Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders. A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.&#10;&#10;Rannugen can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 4 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 5 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

From D-Day to the Falaise Pocket to the drive on Brest, these 12 scenarios explore the fierce fighting engaged in by the infantry, armor, and mechanized cavalry of the American, British, and Canadian forces attacking (and being counterattacked by) a wide range of German defenders, primarily fallschirmj&auml;ger and elite SS forces. The scenarios are created by veteran designers Pete Shelling, Bill Sisler, and Ted Wilcox and developed under the guidance of veteran playtesters and tournament directors Bret Hildebran and Bill Hayward. These scenarios will stretch your tactical knowledge and skills, with many different situations. Bocage features heavily (but far from exclusively). There is one night paradrop scenario, and one is an assault on a fortified gun battery, but none of the scenarios uses offboard artillery. Several scenarios feature combined arms on both sides, several more combined arms on only one side, and several are infantry only.&#10;&#10;Two new boards were designed specifically for this pack and feature significantly in its scenarios. Board 84 features a large hill mass next to a small village with many hedges, numerous orchards, and scattered woods conveying a very claustrophobic rural terrain. Board 12a/b features a larger village with stone buildings partially surrounded by a board-length gully, with orchards, grainfields, and hedges throughout. Both boards show off the skill of artist Charlie Kibler. With great boards and great scenarios, Action Pack #14 is sure to be a winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Everyone's a suspect when murder is on the menu. And with a Classic Detective Murder Mystery you have everything you need to serve up the perfect murder dinner party. First the invites, you choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Then the shopping list, menu suggestions and recipes. Plus of course...a really tasty murder to solve. It will be drop dead fun, and by the end of the evening, one (or more) of the suspects, your 'friends', will be caught out as the murderer!&#10;&#10;It's 1919 and the world is still reeling from the shock of the Russian Revolution. For those inside the country, the political upheavals are matched by personal tragedies, and nowhere are this truer than within the Russian royal family. The Tsar, his wife and children have all been killed, and the surviving royals are anxious to escape the same fate. Which is why they are now sailing into exile on board the British warship the HMS Winston.&#10;&#10;But even here, it seems, no one is safe. On the second night of their voyage a stowaway is discovered on board. He's found face-down in one of the lifeboats, and he has a jewel-encrusted dagger stuck in is back. Who is this mystery man? Who killed him? And what does any of this have to do with the assassination three years earlier of the mad mystic, Rasputin?&#10;&#10;The suspects are:&#10;&#10;     Dowager Empress Marie &ndash; The mother of the murdered Tsar and the great matriarch of European royalty, she is reluctant to leave Mother Russia for the first, and maybe the last, time.&#10;     Prince Felix Youssoupov &ndash; The playboy prince whose behaviour scandalised St Petersburg and is most famous for being the man who killed Rasputin.&#10;     Princess Ivana Legova &ndash; A niece of the Tsar, she is reputed to be the richest woman in Europe, particularly since the death of her financier husband.&#10;     Grand Duke Boris Borisovich &ndash; One of the great landowners of Russia, though the source of his wealth is still something of a mystery.&#10;     Captain Pretty &ndash; The naval officer in command of HMS Winston is very young for such a position, but he has a distinguished war record and is expected to rise high in the service.&#10;     Martha Harry &ndash; An American journalist who has been covering the Revolution for the Washington Fox and now seems in something of a hurry to leave the country.&#10;     Charles Bronstein &ndash; With mixed American and Russian parentage, he has been brought along to act as translator between the royals and the naval officers.&#10;     Jane bond &ndash; An Englishwoman who was employed as a nanny for the Tsar&rsquo;s daughters and is now accepted as almost part of the family.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game wants to put a focus on the rights children (should) have.&#10;On a 7 by 7 grid square tiles similar to Labyrinth show paths and dead ends. On your turn, roll a colored die that allows you to flip, rotate or switch one or more tiles. (The color &bdquo;red&ldquo; on the die allows  to go directly to an adjacent tile ignoring the path system.) Then move your pawn along the paths to reach a destination. Each player has one secret destination card and tries to accomplish it. After you reached your destination, try to accomplish the task or answer the question. The other players may help you. If you succeed, read the written text (articles of the convention of children&rsquo;s rights) on the back of the tile aloud and keep the card. When all destinations are reached, the player with the most accomplished cards wins.&#10;&#10;Developed by Matthias Gradinger&#10;Produced by Ravensburger Freizeit- und Promotion-Service GmbH.&#10;&#10;",

It is one of the most intriguing places on earth! But in this area you can expect some devastating earthquakes.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to build temples in the city of Bagan in order to collect the most points. &#10;In the building school, you can train your builders to become a master or architect. This will make it easier for you to build the right building pieces, but you will not be able to use those builders to build on temple grounds.&#10;A part of the game play is based on that other famous tower, the Hanoi tower. This means you can not build or move a large boulder on top of a smaller one.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of:&#10;&#10;     The (re)placing of the builder(s) on temple grounds and in the building school.&#10;     Rolling the building dice or moving a building piece.&#10;     If the player has builders on the beginner's places in the building school: draw action cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues until all the action cards have been used or until the Central Temple has been completed. Then, points are counted.&#10;&#10;The higher the temple, the more points you get. Empty or hardly built-up temple grounds with only one building piece give you penalty points. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a mixture of strategy, luck and tactics. &#10;A lot of choices have to be made: Choose whether to train your workers, or let them build temples. Choose whether to build higher temples or more. Decide whether moving a boulder is a better choice than building one...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
