    "Description": "One player playes Dickie Dick Dickens (DDD) and up to four players are his pursuers. DDD has to get from one D-Space to the other. Movement is determined by a die. The pursuers start at the blue V-spaces and try to catch DDD by landing on the space he occupies. If DDD lands on a space that is occupied by a pursuer, the pursuer goes to prison for the rest of the game. If a 6 is rolled the player may not move but draws a card and has to follow the instructions printed on it. DDD may not move through the blue areas, whereas the pursuers are forbidden to move through the orange areas.&#10;&#10;DDD wins the game if he reaches the other D-space. The pursuers win if they manage to catch DDD.&#10;&#10;The game was most likely published between 1957 and 1962, when the DDD radio show was aired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mr. Rhee: Surviving the Nightmare World is a 3-6 player asymmetrical card game, where the one plays the hero and the many are the villains. As a Villain, spend Greed to recruit and send your evil minions to take control of locations throughout Nightmare World from the innocents -- or use your character specific win conditions to seize the day. As the Hero, use Hope to gather Fight, Charisma, and Magic to hold out for six rounds -- the day and night of the Three days of Darkness that are consuming Nightmare World -- using your team and abilities to mitigate damage... and set the Villains at each other&rsquo;s' throats. Fast-paced and wickedly fun, this game plays in about 30 minutes. Will you take over the Nightmare World, or just survive it?&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Gameplay starts with the hero determining which villain should play first. That Villain spends Greed to recruit Minions, and place them in Locations. Placement happens either secretly (face-down where they will do team damage), or with fangs bared (face-up where they may single out a specific victim among the Innocents, Heros, or opposing Villain&rsquo;s Minions). However, Greed is flipped to Hope, so the more actions a Villain takes, the more the Hero will be able to counter. The Hero then uses Hope to move to locations, and gather Fight, Charisma, and Magic. Each Hero abilities card costs more Hope than the previous, so the Hero determine what skills are worth the cost.&#10;Once the alternating sides of Villain and Hero have each taken their turn, any Locations with conflict are resolved. This time, the starting Villain may choose which Location resolves first. The Innocents fight the Minions with the help of the Heroes, who now use their skills of Fight (brute force against the opposing side) Charisma (persuading a Minion to turn on his allies) Magic (targeting a single Minion to attack) while the Villains strategically use their Minions abilities and brute strength.&#10;When the conflict is concluded, so is the round, and the fight begins anew. Either the heroes use their skills and special powers to hold off the terror for all 6 rounds (Day and Night of &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness&rdquo;), or one of the Villains meet their asymmetrical win conditions to take the city by force, rule the world, and win the game!&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;In the graphic novel series NIGHTMARE WORLD we learn that once upon a time an Archangel named Lucifer, incensed with what he saw as a tyrannical reign over all Creation by God, organized a revolt coup that he hoped would give him control of Earth and all humanity. It failed. As a result, Lucifer and the angels who followed him were banished to the bowels of the Earth as punishment, forever banned from Heaven and Earth. Realizing that the numbers were on his side, Lucifer has since spent years organizing a plan for revenge &ndash; this time relying not just on the Fallen Angels, but also recruiting Lilith and her countless demon spawn, Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones, rallying them together as part of one concentrated effort to occupy Earth and take control of Creation in a campaign of monstrous terror dubbed &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness.&rdquo;&#10;In the spin-off graphic novel series TALES OF MR. RHEE we learn that humanity is not without its defenses against the forces of darkness, both with the street-fighting magician Mr. Rhee as well as the covert cabal of magicians known as The P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Group. When &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness&rdquo; erupt across the world, The P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Group, dedicated to the &ldquo;Permanent Reduction Of Monsters in Society Everywhere&rdquo;, emerge from the shadows to join forces with Mr. Rhee and a collection of other heroes who know they may not be able to win, but are nonetheless willing to sacrifice everything to make sure the forces of darkness won&rsquo;t either.&#10;Written by horror comic master Dirk Manning &ndash; who also serves as a consultant on this game &ndash; NIGHTMARE WORLD Volumes 1-4, the NIGHTMARE WORLD OMNIBUS, and TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1-4 (so far) are all published by Devil&rsquo;s Due Publishing and available anywhere comics are sold.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are also question boxes; and trip boxes, which assignes a try-out. The other boxes all have a specific function, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, including those that make leaving the game.

A day is split into two phases: activity phase and trade phase. During the activity phase, your members invite another member to help you gain products and raise your publicity.

A player with highest publicity makes a trade first, and may even make multiple trades in a row if that player's publicity is far ahead of anyone else. There is limited demand for products, so players with low publicity might miss chances to sell.&#10;&#10;All ten members have their own special abilities which improve their activities and trades. However, members sometimes belong to two players at a time, in which case only one player may use that member. Player order is important in various ways.&#10;&#10;",

The results of the battle were disastrous for the Republican forces, with tens of thousands of dead and wounded and little effect on the advance of the Nationalists.&#10;&#10;Game uses brigade-battalion scale. One of the most important aspects of the game is to keep as many bridges on ebro as possible, since it's the only way for tanks, artiller and supply to cross the river.

    "Description": "Dark Side of the Mine takes place in the near future, where mining corporations compete to extract resources from nearby asteroids. Order your mining robots to secure the richest mineral deposits and score more points than your competition before the asteroid deck runs out.&#10;&#10;In Dark Side of the Mine, a series of cards are laid out to represent the asteroid. A certain number of cards are placed face down (depending on the number of players), representing the area where players cannot send a communication signal to their robots -- the dark side. Each turn, players flip over the left-most face down card to reveal a new mineral deposit. They will then issue orders to their robots, draw a card, and, finally, place a card from their hand face down on top of the right-most face down card.  This represents the dark side moving as the players orbit the asteroid. Slower robots may get trapped on the dark side of the asteroid, lose contact with the company so they cannot receive orders, and must wait until the dark side passes by so communication can be restored.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they have two out of four actions to perform:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Prospect - play a card and order the mining robot to secure the next mineral deposit of that type moving clockwise;&#10;     Upgrade - play a card and permanently increase the mining capabilities of the robots;&#10;     Communicate - Move counter-clockwise around the asteroid until you find another robot and share information with them about the asteroid;  &#10;     Recharge - Draw a new card into your hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;Dark Side of the Mine is a deep strategy game in a small package.  Every card can be used for multiple purposes, whether to prospect the next mineral deposit, mine that deposit, upgrade your robots, or take advantage of the work other companies have done. Careful hand management and planning will ensure that you are the most successful mining corporation in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is accomplished by players playing cards to introduce hallways, ninjas and walls to each floor.  Players are trying to make the biggest room possible with the presence of their ninjas by capping a hallway with walls.

Players take the roles of Jon Johnson and his Special Operation Bros as they battle invading alien monsters. Along the way, players will face terrible social and political mishaps, friendly fire, and special boss monsters. Each game wave lasts 20-30 minutes, with up to four waves of increased difficulty. The competitive mode offers a cutthroat wave of resource grabbing, trophy hoarding, and backstabbing.&#10;&#10;At the start of a players turn they will draw a card off the Battle Deck and either place the monster in the Battle Zone or resolve a political mishap. Next they can take one action to attack a monster, buy a item, heal, etc. After their action the player will draw one card from the Grunt Support deck to either aid or hinder the player on their turn. And finally, the monsters attack the player, causing 1 point of damage for every 4 strength. Then play moves to the next Bro.&#10;&#10;The game continues until all monsters in the Battle Zone and Battle Deck are defeated. The players loose if all Bros die. If a Bro dies, you aren't out of the game yet! You can continue as a Bhrost and aid your team from the afterlife by drawing from the Battle Deck as normal and drawing 2 Grunt Support cards and choosing the better of the 2.&#10;&#10;Competitive mode plays the same, however Bros will total up their kills at the end of the game, applying various modifiers.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played solo! The player simply controls all 4 Bros at once, taking their turns one after another.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There is a single path through this map.&#10;The second part of the board are fields at the border of the board with fields known from Monopoly. Instead of streets this are chapters from the New Testament. There are some special fields where you have to ask questions from the bible.&#10;&#10;The game starts at the start point of the map track. The actual player roles 2 die and moves. dependent of the points on the die he gets questions from different stacks of cards (all from the bible). If he knows the answer he gets the points written on the card.    &#10;When the track ends the figure changes to the Monopoly kind path. Like in Monopoly you can by the fields, but not with money but with the points you have collected with the right answered questions. You have to pay parking fee for fields owned by other players.

The player with the most points wins (including value of area cards and stones).&#10;&#10;Variants (mentioned in rules):&#10;1. Just role the die and run first the Mediterranean Sea path and after that the Monopoly path. The first player who comes to the Start of teh Monopoly Path again.  &#10;2.

    "Description": "CODE RED! is a card game that pits players in a grand contest of global competition and conflict.  With the boxed set of Code RED! players assume the mantle of the United States or the People's Republic of China.  Where conflict erupts is determined by which Theatres a player puts into play during their turn, from Washington to Beijing and everything in between.&#10;&#10;Players initially construct their deck.  Paying attention to how many Theatre cards they include, tempering this against the number units and force multipliers they need in order to get the job done.  If your deck is too small you can't effectively carry out your plans or respond to threats.  Too big and you find that F-22 Raptor or Nimitz Carrier just never seems to be drawn.&#10;&#10;Make sure your force mix can operate effectively within the Theatre you want to dominate.  Be wary, include forces that can defend your home territories too.&#10;&#10;Aside from decks, players begin the game with an allocation of Command and Control tokens.  Command tokens let you do things in game, from drawing additional cards, withdrawing revealed units to activating force multipliers.  Running out of Command tokens can see your grand strategy grind to a halt or your ability to counter your opponents actions (like being able to intercept that ICBM!).&#10;&#10;Control tokens are your life blood, the ability to gain Control tokens at the expense of your opponent is crucial to winning Code Red!  Run out of Control tokens at the end of your turn you lose the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is handled with a three step turn sequence which alternates between players.&#10;&#10;Resupply - Draw cards and possibly Command tokens if you're contesting Theatres.&#10;&#10;Reorganistation - Deploy Theatres, deploy and reorganise your units and force multipliers within Theatres.  Pay attention when assigning forces to Theatres you wish to defend as well as those you wish to attack.&#10;&#10;Operations - The business end of the turn, players activate units and force multipliers in a Theatre by declaring a Code Alert for each Theatre they contest.&#10;&#10;Code Blue - do nothing&#10;  Code Green - Use your units to detect the enemies hidden forces&#10;  Code Yellow - Through a show of military power, force the enemy to withdraw from a Theatre, ceding control to you.&#10;  Code Red - War becomes hot!  Attack and destroy all enemy units within a Theatre, obliterate them to win control.&#10;  &#10;Remember, if you are reduced to zero Control tokens at the end of your turn you lose the game.&#10;&#10;The game is expandable, we've just added 54 card expansions for both China and the United States.  With plans to include decks representing Russia, Iran, Syria, North Korea and Israel in the  future.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Those closest to SOL: the Core Worlds. These worlds have been settled the longest, and thus tend to have the highest population, but have consumed most of their resources.  Those furthest out: the Outer Rim worlds, which were settled just before SOL&rsquo;s fall.  These tend to have low population but high resources.  And between those extremes are the Green Worlds&hellip;where the players start, here there is a good balance of population and resources.  But beware, these worlds are on the cusp of challenging for dominance on their own, and have the fleets to make their conquest a hard fought struggle!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Sherman appears in many Panzer Grenadier games (more of them than you&rsquo;d think, thanks to all of those Allied Shermans).&#10;&#10;But are those Shermans studly enough? Designer Brian Knipple gave them an armor rating of &ldquo;3&rdquo; in Battle of the Bulge, the first game in which they appeared. They remained so rated in Desert Rats, their next appearance (this time in British colors) and it&rsquo;s been that way ever since. Should they have had armor of &ldquo;4&rdquo;? Some fans thought so from the beginning, but we have stuck with &ldquo;3.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Our &ldquo;Belton&rsquo;s Bane&rdquo; variant gives you two dozen Sherman tank platoons of various types (M4 Shermans, M4/76 and M4/105) and service (Army, Marines). While the Sherman had a bewildering number of sub-types, most of the differences aren&rsquo;t enough to show up in game terms and we&rsquo;ve always kept the naming conventions simple.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Despite their status as a new team then, they have an influx of incredible talent, and are already proving themselves to be nightmares (do you see?) for their opponents&hellip;&#10;&#10;This multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble the Naggaroth Nightmares, a Dark Elf Blood Bowl team. The team consists of 6 Linemen, 2 Blitzers, 2 Runners and 2 Witch Elves &ndash; each is clad in some pretty spikesome armour, with the hides of Cold Ones draped over their shoulders. The Witch Elves are ...slightly less armoured, and can be modelled either with hands pointing imperiously toward their opponents &ndash; or clutching a still-beating heart. The Linemen have 3 different designs of head.&#10;&#10;There are a host of extras in the kit &ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins featuring a Dark Elves icon and 4 balls &ndash; 2 kraken eggs (with protruding tentacles) and 2 balls made from the hide of a Cold One, lacking pegs.&#10;&#10;Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases, a 1,000,000 GP roster and a Dark Elf transfer sheet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Pitches bear the Bugman&rsquo;s B, while the bearded face of the master brewer grins down on players from massive billboards. When Bugman turns up at a match in person it is a spectacle to behold.&#10;&#10;Bugman is no mere spectator, however, as the stout brewer owns numerous teams, and coaches them from his private dugout as he knocks back beer after beer. For all his bluster, and the vast quantities of XXXXXX he consumes, Bugman is actually a fair coach, having a good eye for the ebb and flow of the game &ndash; the problem arises when things don&rsquo;t go his team&rsquo;s way, or he gets excessively drunk, or some combination of the two, and he staggers out onto the field to take matters into his own hands&hellip;&#10;&#10;This resin kit contains the components necessary to assemble 2 models &ndash; both of which depict the iconic, stout figure of Josef Bugman. The first is Josef as coach, pipe and rulebook in hand, watching over his team with a stern, furrowed look and one foot resting on a beer barrel &ndash; the second depicts Bugman in a rather less disciplined state (probably something to do with the beer barrel mentioned earlier&hellip;) &ndash; this is Josef Bugman, Star Player, holding a ball aloft in his left hand and a foaming stein of XXXXXX in the other.&#10;&#10;This kit is supplied as 9 components, and includes 2 32mm round Blood Bowl bases. Rules are included for fielding Josef Bugman as a part of Dwarf, Halfling, Norse, Human, Amazon and Ogre Blood Bowl teams.&#10;&#10;",

Get out your Pepper Spray Wand to handle the rioting leprechaun hordes!&#10;&#10;Minotaur's Maze Tavern: This quest is kind of menacing but honestly they haven't even put up all the dry-wall in the maze yet... moments of TERROR mixed with uncomfortable reminders of how boring your day to day life is.

Players start by purchasing fishing tackle (using tackle tokens) based on their game strategy. On a players turn they have a limited number of actions such as... moving their boat to a different fishing location, casting for fish, selling fish for tokens, buying more tackle, etc. When a player rolls FISH!, they draw a FISH! card and, if they have the right tackle, they get to keep the fish! If the player does not have the right tackle, the fish must be placed back at bottom of fishing location's deck. The winner is the first player to reach the tournament target in fish.&#10;This game is well-balanced between strategy, skill, &amp; luck. Players with good memory &amp; bluffing skills will do best. Perfect game for family get-togethers (young &amp; old) or playing ruthlessly against friends.&#10;&#10;",
