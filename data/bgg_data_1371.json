Pawns may pass over any hexes not containing an opponent's stone or pawn. Pawns can pass over owned stones. Control tiles never impede movement and simply indicate ownership of a hex.&#10;&#10;When a pawn reaches its destination hex, the player may place a control tile and an owned stone on top in any one of the empty hexes adjacent to the pawn that is not adjacent to any other stone.&#10;&#10;For each hex adjacent to a placed stone, if the hex is not adjacent to any opponent stone, place a control tile own-side up in the hex; and if the hex has one or more adjacent opponent stones, replace the opponent&rsquo;s control tile with a contested tile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all hexes contain a control or contested tile. To determine the winner, players count the number of control tiles they have on the board. The second player adds a komi of 3.5 points to his total.

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589. The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.&#10;&#10;This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are with areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.&#10;&#10;The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; en haie &raquo; (in hedge), the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the three battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible... Are you ready to put on the boots of Henri de Guise or the Prince de Cond&eacute; and fight your enemies ?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Obsessed with the search for your cosmic brothers and sisters, you set out exploring from your homeworld. To aid in exploration, your scientists have invented The Singularity Probe, a machine that can travel into space and speed up time, turning the millennia it would take to travel to the stars into hours. As a side effect of time speeding up however, life on nearby planets grows in leaps and bounds every time the Probe causes one of these leaps in time. Oversee and guide the development of life in the Universe, and discover whether we are alone in the Dark Forest.&#10;&#10;In this action selection game, players will use Seekers to Sow the seeds of life on planets, Settle their own Watchers on a planet, and plan jumps to new solar systems that will occur during the next Leap in time. Watchers then will work to Suppress or Elevate the native life on a planet, tending them for a later Reaping, or perhaps helping them evolve to higher forms of life. Each new planet you discover will have unique properties, yielding a new worker placement spot that will alter the possible strategies in the game. The winner of the game is the first to find and make peace with an Ancient Civilization, if one exists, or to become the only advanced species in the universe if not.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pangaex is a world-conquering game with aspects of Risk, Catan, and Terraforming Mars. The game is played on a modular board (81 2&quot;-square tiles), each of which indicates one of the following resources: Culture, Food, Weapons, Commerce, Mountains, or Lakes. Each player starts with a Capital game piece and two village game pieces, which are placed in a snake-draft system. Each player also begins with some resources and a soldier, who begins the game on the Capital tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two repeating phases: Production phase (collecting resources based on villages and/or soldiers in play), and Action phase. The Production phase happens simultaneously, where all players collect resources at the same time. The Action phase is where the bulk of the game is played. Players can move their soldiers; they can also use resources to build villages, train soldiers, and even convert enemy villages to their own culture. Like Terraforming Mars, each player may take up to two actions on their turn--however, a pass is not a pass for the whole Action phase, but merely a pass on a given turn. The Action phase ends when all players have passed consecutively.&#10;&#10;Soldiers are more than just soldiers in Pangaex. Soldiers raze enemy villages, but they also help to rebuild their own villages. They prevent peaceful cultural conversion, and they even collect resources at times.&#10;&#10;When any player plays their final village, the game ends after the Action phase concludes (i.e. final village signifies final round, not final play). Points are awarded for villages on the board, enemy villages that you've collected (by razing or converting), and other metrics to balance out the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to clean up the cat's pawprints across the house. But the cat keeps being naughty.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of cards, numbered from 1 to 12 in six colours. There are also some special action cards, including a joker. The start player (who most recently cleaned) lays out a card and players must play a card or combos that are better, or pass. Once everyone has passed, the last player to play leads the next round.&#10;&#10;Cards must be played out in the style of [thing15878], in sets and runs, which can include the jokers. So a pair of 4s can be raised by a pair of 5s, or by three 8s. But three 3s won't do, nor a run of any kind. Likewise, if a run is lead, it can be raised by better runs, but not by sets.&#10;&#10;As cards are played out, the cat marker is moved down, and when it hits zero, the players hands are scored. The player with the most points is covered in pawprints, and the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;The publisher says the game is easy enough for young players to enjoy.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A king&rsquo;s army is more powerful, can move quicker, and can siege an enemy castle more easily.

Players of Invasion will need to juggle using their king&rsquo;s offensive capabilities, with protecting them from their enemies. Players will siege castles, block their enemies&rsquo; movement, kill their soldiers, and battle their king&rsquo;s army in an all out war to decide who is the most powerful kingdom in the land.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game title means something like 'hazy sea charts'. Players are building up a nautical chart from memory of their voyages, complete with sea monsters. But they aren't quite sure what goes where, and work together to remember what they saw.&#10;&#10;In the game, players place tiles showing land and sea. As they place a tile, they can add player pieces, or a pawn worth 2 pieces. If a tile gets to four pieces, it is confident enough to stay. But if it has fewer than four, then some black balls are added to make it up to four.&#10;&#10;When a continent is completed, it is scored. Players with the most pieces/pawns get the most points (counting all the pieces on the island), for having been most confident in their memory of the voyage. The next most gets the points of the majority pieces, and so on down. There are bonus points for places of interest on the land (buried treasure) and for adjacent sea monsters.&#10;&#10;But the black balls are collected by the majority scorer, and count as negative at the end of the game, along with any player pieces remaining in hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends when ten black balls have been used.&#10;&#10;The game is a mix of co-operating, and bluffing to complete island with the most confidence.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The leaders of the USA, UK, France and USSR &ndash; the four most powerful countries in the world - are meeting to foster peace between East and West and to stave off the rapidly growing divide now dubbed The Cold War. Naturally, the summit will be neck-deep in spies, rumours and complex loyalties. But as head of the Swiss security forces, you must descend into this miasma of truth and half-truth, for you have learned there are traitors here, anarchists that would gladly catapult the world into lawless chaos. Can you identify all of the anarchists before they derail the summit and threaten global security?&#10;&#10;Each card in the deck represents a person who was actually present at the 1955 Geneva Summit, from Ike Eisenhower, US President, down to Germaine Goutte, French Personal Assistant. A pile of random anarchists is dealt at the start of the game, with the remaining cards acting as informants from which you might extract clues. A cunning series of icons lets you compare the front of an informant with the back side of a hidden anarchist to detect whether they match by suit, value, or as a multiple or factor of the value. By clever hand management and astute use of clues you may deduce the suit and rank of each anarchist. But can you find them all before your clues run out and they act?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To do this, players will move their creatures on a board made up of hexagons, then it will be up to them to make the most of the map to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Each player will be able to construct their deck and choose a specific Board that represents their half of the battlefield, once the two players connects their halves the game can start! Both players will then place their Emanation portals and Leaders.&#10;&#10;During their turn, players will be be able to:&#10;&#10;- Play a card from their hand (Creature or Spell) for 1 Energy Point.&#10;- Move a creature on the board.&#10;- Attack or Activate a Special Ability.&#10;- Draw a Card for 1 Energy Point.&#10;&#10;Most of the Creatures will attack and move by the adjacent hexagon but this range can be increased thanks to spells and Special Ability like Throw or Overfly.&#10;&#10;First Player that deactivates the 3 Emanation Portals of the opponent wins the game!&#10;&#10;Each Creature is unique so during the Deck Construction phase before a match it will be crucial to choose the best combination of Creatures and Spells even of different Temen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player is the head of their gang and places their initial four cards face-down around the city.

If they are correct, the player outsmarts the opponent ands gains an advantage.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own board for their gangster head, which shows their abilities, recruitment, and player levels and score. The other side is the same but with a special unique ability, meaning players can play a simpler or more complex game.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the player who has gained the most notoriety in the city wins the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",
