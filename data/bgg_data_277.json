    "Description": "Splash Down&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, place all your frogs in the 'home' space. This is the tile just before the first pad of the map.&#10;&#10;Each Turn&#10;&#10;Each then you roll a die; this determines the maximum spaces you can move in any direction. The first player may re-roll on the first turn.&#10;&#10;You then pick a pad to land on. There are 4 types of pads:&#10;&#10;Green Pads: Land here safely&#10;Yellow Pads: When land, flip a frog coin; if it lands on heads, you lose a life. &#10;Red Pads: Lose a life when you land here. &#10;Dark Green: Like green pads, but you cannot dunk a player who is on them. These pads usually have flies, as shown above.&#10;&#10;When you land on a pad, you automatically gain the number of flies indicated. It is now in your possession. The flies are then removed from the lilypad and cannot be gained by another player.&#10;&#10;You can also land on a pad another player is already on. When this occurs, you may attempt to dunk them.&#10;&#10;Dunking&#10;When you land on the same pad as an existing player, you can choose whether to try to dunk them. If you want to, roll the frog dice. If it's an even number, you can move that far, and they lose a life. If it's odd, you may not move. However, if it's a 1, you lose a life.&#10;If you die holding flies, they FLY back to the location they come from and can once again be claimed by another player. &#10;Notes:&#10;You must roll for the pad first when attempting a dunk on yellow/red. You may leapfrog even if you lose a life, provided you have not been eliminated.&#10;When there are 2 or more people on a pad, you dunk them all!&#10;&#10;Lives&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 lives. Upon running out of lives, a player is eliminated and loses the game without any further actions possible.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collect flies, and return them to the start point. The winner is the (living) player with the most flies at the end. Once you've returned, you cannot go out again.&#10;&#10;Optional Rules&#10;&#10;An optional rule is Fly Stealing. When this rule is chosen, a player steals a fly from any opponent they successfully dunk.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scrimmage - Tactical Professional Football is, in many ways, &quot;the ultimate wargame&quot;.  It combines varieties of movement, combat and objectives rarely found in actual warfare.&#10;&#10;First published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #37, Jim Dunnigan transformed the game of Football into a wargame, with limited success.&#10;&#10;Played on a hex map football field (6 hexes = 10 yards), players set up their teams and run plays.  Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.&#10;&#10;Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.&#10;&#10;",

Descriptions should be truthful, yet clever, so the player in the hot seat doesn't get an easy guess.&#10;&#10;In this game, all players except the one in the hot seat look at a guess word and then creatively describe what theirs is like. They might be telling about their swimsuit, neighbor, closet, hair or any of the other 300-plus words in the game. The player in the hot seat then tries to link all the clues together to figure out what is being described. The best part about this game is that the hilarious clues come from people who play the game. The player who guesses his or her word with the fewest number of clues wins.&#10;&#10;What do you think players are describing with these clues?&#10;&#10;Mine keeps getting bigger.&#10;&#10;I compare mine with others.&#10;&#10;My wife likes mine.&#10;&#10;I never see mine.&#10;&#10;I receive mine once a month.&#10;&#10;You wouldn't believe what I do for mine.&#10;&#10;Mine disappears too fast.&#10;What's Yours Like? is for 4 or more players ages 10 to adult.&#10;&#10;",

Your choices will guide you through different storylines, from the seductive merfolk in the lagoon, to the brave natives in the mountains and all the other secrets the island has to offer. Gain allies and items, unlock new abilities, interact with locations and characters and gain experience during multiple adventures. As everybody's Neverland is different, every game will be a new adventure, with new possibilities and challenges to face. Although there will be a winner at the end of the game, the unfolding of the stories on the immersive island of Neverland are key.&#10;&#10;In this story driven adventure game, 2-4 players take on the role of a main character in the world of J.M Barrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo;. The game takes around 30 minutes per player, is played in turns and is suitable from the age of 12. The base game includes 6 characters with unique stats and abilities, each with a competitive story. In addition the base game includes one cooperative story for multiple characters. Additional stories can be added and combined. Adventures are narrated through story cards, happenings, and side quests of your choice. You can interact with other characters and locations on the island. While the immersive stories ensure you'll find yourself in a world of wonder and mystery, the players' choices will re-imagine Neverland every time you play the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each turn a player has 3 actions to move and interact with player characters and non-player characters. Players explore the island of Neverland while interacting with stories, happenings, other characters and special locations. The story, goal and challenges are narrated through cards with multiple available options. As every chapter of every player poses multiple outcomes, your adventures on Neverland will be different every time you play. Players can earn adventure points to level up their character. &#10;The game ends when the side quest deck runs out or all players finish their story. The player with the most adventure points wins the game. (Cooperative stories may have different end of game and win conditions)&#10;&#10;The game is suitable from the age of 12 and takes about 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Herd is a two player game played with two standard, six sided dice and unlimited red and blue stones on a hexagonal grid of any size, initially empty. The two players, Red and Blue, take turns placing their own stones on the board, one or more stones per turn. Red goes first. Players are not allowed to pass. Mark Steere designed Herd in August, 2022.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;ON YOUR TURN&#10;&#10;     Roll the dice.&#10;     Remove enemy stones in the quantity indicated by the lower die value.&#10;     Place your stones on any unoccupied cells (except where prohibited as described below) in the quantity indicated by the higher die value.&#10;     If you completely surround an enemy singleton (enemy group of size 1) - that is, every one of its adjacent cells is occupied by one of your stones - you must immediately remove it.&#10;     For each enemy stone you surround and capture, you must add an additional stone of your color, which could then capture more enemy stones and require you to add yet more of your stones during your turn.&#10;     Prohibited placement: You may not place a stone on a cell completely surrounded by enemy stones - that is, a cell whose every adjacent cell is occupied by an enemy stone. If at any time during your turn, the only unoccupied cells are such self-capturing placements, your turn is concluded.&#10;&#10;&#10;BALANCING RULE&#10;Red, on his first turn, places the number of stones indicated by the LOWER die value.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends when the board is completely filled. Who has the most stones on the board wins.&#10;&#10;",

The player controlling the ghost must capture/tag another player if he wants to win.

The other players must collect the right key cards to move through the colored doors, but may only hold four key cards.&#10;&#10;If the ghost captures another player, they switch roles with the captured player becoming the ghost and moving to the dungeon to start the next round.  The former ghost takes the key cards from the new ghost and tries to escape the castle.&#10;&#10;Most important: The player figures glow in the dark!&#10;&#10;",

Players keep a grid of 10 cards face up in front of them, flipping them as lines are cleared to keep track of their score.  Each player may hold two cards at a time in their hand.  Cards may feature blocks known as Tetriminos which can be used to clear lines or special action cards that can hinder other players.&#10;&#10;A puzzle will be displayed on the top of the draw pile.  To clear a line, players must use the Tetrimino cards in their hands.  If the Tetrimino on a card fits in this puzzle so that it completes a line (or lines) five squares across without any gaps, it can be played to clear a line (or lines).  In order to fulfill this goal, Tetriminos may be rotated.  For each line cleared, a card is flipped in that player's matrix.  If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cheat is a standard deck playing card game; it is a simple game of bluffing and deduction for 3-10 players.&#10;&#10;A regular deck of 52 playing cards is dealt in its entirety to all players. Players take it in turn to play 1-4 cards onto the stack of cards. When a player plays, they must declare the number of cards played and give the value of a card (ace - king): for example &quot;three queens&quot;. The value given must be either one above, one below or the same as the value given by the previous player. Any player may call &quot;cheat&quot; before the next player plays. When a player calls &quot;cheat&quot;, the number of cards declared is then revealed. If the cards are all of the value given, the player who called &quot;cheat&quot; must take the whole stack of cards into their hand and the falsely accused cheater may start a new stack. However, if the cards are not all of the value declared, the cheater takes the stack into his hand and the first accuser starts a new stack. A player wins by emptying their hand. The game ends when there are only three players remaining.&#10;&#10;This game is also known as Bullshit.  In Hoyle's Rules of Games it is referred to as I Doubt It.&#10;&#10;Similar games include MammuZ, Verish' Ne Verish', &#208;&#154;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#161;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;, and Elephonkey.&#10;&#10;",

It is a chess variant with the board expanded to 12 x 12 squares. Follow-up variants in the next two issues of Command added a some interesting variant pieces with new moves and powers and a whole different chess-like game based on 20th Century military units, none of which got the attention it deserved because of the outrage and bad feeling left over from the initial impression. For chess players some interesting ideas, many of which have been seen before in one form or another. For historical board wargamers, it was simply not enough there, and it seemed like a rather pathetic and transparent attempt to cover up XTR's failure to have a suitable alternative to the planned issue game.&#10;&#10;EDIT REQUEST:  Does anyone have any information about the game itself?  How it plays, how it differs in strategy and &quot;feel&quot; from regular chess?  Any information other than how it came to be published?&#10;&#10;And from the images, it appears the board is 16x16, rather than 12x12.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The story thus far...&#10;&#10;The life of a Strategic Space Sheep Commander isn't easy, especially if that Commander is assigned to the Lambda Sector. Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&#10;&#10;All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.&#10;&#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&#10;&#10;You are a Sheep.&#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&#10;     Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&#10;     Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&#10;&#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&#10;     If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&#10;&#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Be the best Barista by trying to brew the perfect cup of coffee. But, be careful. You may just spill your masterpiece.&#10;In Barista, players compete to be the first to brew a customer's specialty coffee drink, as ordered. The player who brews the cup first, or comes closest to it, will earn tips toward victory as the best Barista.&#10;Each round, 4 dice are rolled, each representing one aspect of the specialty coffee to be brewed. Generally on a player's turn, he will draw a card and discard a card, trying to match the symbols rolled on the dice. As players acquire these cards, they are played face-down in front of them. There are Action cards to turn the tables a bit, as well as cards to earn or lose tip money. Perhaps you will wish to make a 'Barista Challenge' against the other players. Think your coffee will beat someone else's? Go ahead, make their day. But, how about just making some coffee.&#10;The game comes with 56 cards, 4 special dice, a coffee mug dice cup/tip jar, 20 tokens (tips), a special token bag, and rules that could be written a bit better. All in all, a good experience for specialty coffee fans everywhere.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This very portable beer &amp; pretzels game comes as a pocket travel case containing 2 pig dice, two pencils and a scoring booklet that also includes the scoring table. The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first to score 100 points using &quot;pigs&quot; as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a &quot;snouter,&quot; &quot;trotter,&quot; or &quot;leaning jowler&quot; (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to &quot;cash&quot; the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again. If you roll a non-scorer (&quot;pig out&quot; - one pig on the right flank, the other on the left flank; a fairly frequent result), you lose any as-yet-uncashed points. If you throw an &quot;oinker&quot; (both pigs touching each other), you lose your entire accumulated score. If you throw a &quot;piggyback&quot; (one pig on top of the other), you're altogether eliminated!&#10;&#10;The variant Hog Call rules allow the other players to risk predicting the outcome of the throw; if predicted successfully, the hog caller earns twice the value of the position *and* deducts that same amount from the roller's score!&#10;&#10;Schweinerei, the German edition, was released by Milton Bradley in 1984; Milton Bradley in 1996; Winning Moves Games (USA) Deutschland in 2001.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll the dice and enter their coordinates on the DVD, which produces all the pirate challenges. At the beginning of the game, players receive a mission card that tells them how much gold, silver and rum they will need to collect for the game. You keep this a secret from the other players. Successfully completing pirate challenges, searching for booty and attacking other pirate ships are the ways you can get the gold, silver and rum you  need to complete your mission and win the game.&#10;The game, based on the hit movie franchise Pirates of the Caribbean, incorporates clips from the films and takes players to recognizable places such as Tortuga Island and Rum Runners Island. However, this is not a movie trivia game. The movie only serves to enhance the action/adventure game play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board game Awkward Family Photos, based on the website of the same name that features photographs that should have stayed tucked away in the family album, invites players to ponder the inner lives of the sad specimens depicted on the cards in order to score and win.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls the die, then moves a pawn around the perimeter of the game board to determine which question to ask about the photo revealed from the top of the deck. Samples questions include &quot;Which celebrity would fit into this shot?&quot; and &quot;What was the last thing someone in this picture said before the photo was taken?&quot; Each other player secretly submits an answer, then the active player reads them aloud and chooses her favorite answer. This player places a token on this photo image on the game board. With four or more players, the active player then guesses who submitted which answers; if correct, she places a token on the game board, too.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all five of her tokens on the game board &ndash; or to place three tokens in a row &ndash; wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.&#10;Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.&#10;&#10;Will You Volunteer for this Dangerous Mission?&#10;&#10;You and your opponent compete to be the first executive your perilous mission. Maneuver your fighter planes over the enemy fortress by die roll. &quot;Fly&quot; at high or low altitude by raising or lowering your planes on their bases for real 3-dimensional game play Zoom up and over fortress walls and dive down to blast enemy targets. Engage in dogfights at close quarters to force your opponent to retreat. Penetrate enemy radar to challenge Zaxxon to a showdown!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: &#10;1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. &#10;2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. &#10;3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination&#10;4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME: &#10;Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses several decks of cards, a roll and move game track, and voting rights based on the number of third world countries 'owned'.  A player chooses between one of four actions on his turn:  Moving his pawn on the board via die roll; military fortification of a previously influenced country; military response to another player's prior coup d'etat against a non-fortified country; or attempt an invasion of a non-fortified country.  The game centers around keeping other players' military influence markers out of strategically valued countries, and installing your own influence and subsequent fortifications in same.  Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.  Of course, before you can militarily influence anybody, you have to get economic influence going, and the various spaces on the board track take care of giving everybody opportunity for same.&#10;&#10;",

The shared central playing field is seeded with 4 cards. In turns, each player places cards from their hand into the central field using typical solitaire rules of alternating suit colors and strictly sequential cards in declining value order. Any kings cards in the initial deal or drawn later are placed in the &quot;corner&quot; slots at the player's first opportunity.

    "Description": "Welcome to Limgrave, a mysterious and otherworldly realm where the landscape is rich and varied. As you explore, you&rsquo;ll build out a hex-based map of your surroundings, with unique locations to visit, resources to gather, NPC&rsquo;s to interact with, and enemies to fight. Your progress is tracked by a narrative story that provides objectives as well as guidance on how to achieve them &ndash; and, depending on your decisions, alternative side-quests and emergent narrative to experience, too.&#10;&#10;Diceless and with strong elements of deck-building, combat is both deadly and personal. As your Tarnished character levels up, you must carefully build your attack and effect decks to best optimise with your equipment. Although exploration takes place on the zoomed-out hex map, each player has their own dedicated quest book on which combat encounters will take place face-to-face.&#10;&#10;When you enter combat, you&rsquo;ll open your quest book to the indicated page. There, you&rsquo;ll find a battlefield grid that raises the level of combat from one of simple physical positioning to state of mental readiness. Using rows and lanes, this unique system means your position dictates not only your physical position in the encounter, but your battle stance: aggressive, neutral, or defensive. Each battle stance has benefits and drawbacks to exploit and avoid with the changing state of battle, which can even vary from one encounter to the next.&#10;&#10;Understanding enemy attack patterns is key, helping to inform when to expose an enemy weakness and press home an attack, and when to play defensively while your stamina returns. Drawn at random but possible to manipulate, the marching order will determine which characters act when, and give you the vital opportunity to plan ahead, just as you&rsquo;d learn &lsquo;tells&rsquo; in the video game.&#10;&#10;A single bad decision can mean death to the unwary, sending unlucky Tarnished back to the nearest Site of Grace to respawn.&#10;&#10;Because combat takes place in your individual quest book, your encounters also won&rsquo;t disrupt play for everyone else. After making the three actions in your turn &mdash; and enduring any enemy attacks &mdash; your combat will pause while the other Tarnished continue exploring the overworld, with combat resuming once your turn comes back around.&#10;&#10;When your party locates a dungeon, your quest books will be joined together, allowing you to take on bosses together on a much larger stage while still being up close and personal. But boss encounters aren&rsquo;t the only time you&rsquo;ll fight side by side. If one of your fellow Tarnished is in trouble, there are also ways to join their personal combat book and lend a hand &mdash; or a sword.&#10;&#10;The official tabletop adaptation of the hit video game that sold over 13 million copies in its first month after release, ELDEN RING&trade;: The Board Game features huge and lavishly detailed miniatures, as well as close to a thousand cards, four large quest books, and a towering stack of exploration tile, all in the core box alone.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a big box cooperative campaign game for 1-4 players, where each session is playable in 90-120 minutes and core box campaigns will span 30-40 hours, increasing to 90 hours with the expansions. And your Tarnished can make the entire journey with you, from one region to the next&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&#10;&#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!&#10;&#10;",

Fundamentally, it is a set collection game in the manner of Game of Authors (America) and Happy Families (Britain).&#10;&#10;May be played by three or more players. Shuffle well and deal equally among the players who must examine their cards; if a player holds any complete fours, lay these on the table.&#10;&#10;The player on the right of the dealer asks any player if he holds a card needed to complete a set of four. The enquiring player must always have at least one of the set in their hand before asking. If the player asked holds the card in question, he must surrender it. The player who was succesful may continue to ask the one who has surrendered a card for a further card. The moment that player cannot supply the wanted card, he becomes the one to ask any player for a card.&#10;&#10;If a completed Four is obtained, the succesful player should lay it on the table and that set is now safe. This continues round the table until all the sets are laid down and the player has tabled the largest number of four, wins.&#10;&#10;The type of questions asked will enable an attentive player to know whom to ask for a wanted card to complete a four. A pool of counters or pennies formed at the start pays an agreed bonus to the player with the most fours. A stipulated fine may be paid to the player who is misinformed about a card.&#10;&#10;",

If they roll another number, it becomes their &quot;point&quot;; they continue to roll until they either roll that number again (in which case they win) or roll a 7 (in which case they lose).&#10;&#10;The wagering system varies depending on where you play and whether you have a casino-style layout.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A high-pressure game of getting rid of a &quot;hot&quot; potato so as not to be holding it when time runs out.&#10;&#10;This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:&#10;&#10;Jack's alive, and likely to live&#10;If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.&#10;&#10;The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&quot;&#10;&#10;That was written in 1888.&#10;&#10;Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.&#10;&#10;By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

How can you become that lucky person? It's simple! As the old saw goes, you don't have to outrun the zombies; you just need to outrun your friends.&#10;&#10;At the start of Zombie! Run for Your Lives! each player receives four cards from the deck; cards are one of two types: a zombie (which come in different varieties) or a potentially helpful item that can protect you from those aforementioned zombies. The different types of zombies and the items that affect them are color-coded and bear identical symbols for easy recognition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw a card from the deck, then play a card from your hand, sending a zombie after one of the other players or using an item to help yourself; if the item matches a zombie card in front of you, both cards are discarded. A player cannot have identical items or zombies in front of him. If you ever have five zombies in front of you, you've succumbed to the horde and become a zombie yourself. As a result, your mental abilities are extremely limited, which means that on your turn, you simply draw the top card and play it on a living player, getting revenge against whoever killed you or perhaps aiding the player you care for the most.&#10;&#10;If, on the other hand, you collect five items in front of yourself, you've proved yourself invulnerable to zombies and instantly win!&#10;&#10;",

The double matching feature permits covering cards already in play.  This eliminates frustrating ties found in traditional Tic Tac Toe.  But don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple rules. Action Cards interject deep strategies so players can flip sides mid-game, wipe out their opponent&rsquo;s hand, or play two cards on a single turn.

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.&#10;&#10;In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.&#10;&#10;The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.&#10;&#10;The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.&#10;&#10;If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!&#10;&#10;",

To see who survives, they will engage in that time-honored tradition, that Sport of Kings...&#10;&#10;Yes, that's right. Rock-Paper-Scissors.

So, while the game uses the RPS mechanism, there are real and interesting decisions to be made which will have the zombies debating their strategy (or at least as well as their limited mental capacity allows).&#10;&#10;If you hate zombies (and you should!), you'll find altogether more zombies than you're comfortable with in I Hate Zombies.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had all the guns, ammo, and canned food I could ever need.

    "Description": "&quot;It's boring when you're dead. So, you and your deceased friends have decided to have a little race around the graveyard....&quot; Thus begins the wackiest game from Twilight Creations yet! The players control their pawns as usual. But: the pawns in this game are self-propelled windup toys!&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 8 cards and then draft them by passing first 4, then 3, then 2, and finally 1 to the player to their left. Other players then lead one of their sets and other players must play all their cards for the same action. Whichever player plays the most of that action takes it - if there's a tie, they both take it. The actions include Winding your pawn from 1-4 times, rotating left, rotating right or rotating your opponent.&#10;&#10;As players move on the board they encounter hazards, which might make them lose progress and brains. Each time they hit a brain they can take a brain token. Brain tokens allow them to take special actions when discarded.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player manages to cross the finish line and exit the graveyard. There are 4 double-sided boards which allow many different races.&#10;&#10;",

The players take the roles of mad wizards who own the five dungeons surrounding Dungeonville. You recruit parties of adventurers and send them into the dungeons, earning points by defeating other parties in combat and by killing other players' characters in your own dungeon.

Roll a die each turn for movement, with players trying to choose the optimal routes.

With 180 cities on the board, there are multiple paths to choose each turn, and no two games are ever the same!&#10;A Ravensburger Family game.&#10;Note: The rule book also includes educational information about notable attractions for the 63 'special' cities.&#10;&#10;",
