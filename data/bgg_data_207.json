    "Description": "Livestock Uprising is a tactical resource management game in which you harvest farmland, marshal animal armies, and battle for control of the farm. Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.&#10;&#10;The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own. The Super Armies then drop the gloves and battle it out for all or nothing victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Suez Canal was essential to British strategic communications and trade in the Great War, as well as being an important political symbol. In August of 1916, the Ottoman Empire sent an expeditionary force, which included contingents of Germans and Austro-Hungarians, against the canal. While the British were expecting an attack, the Ottomans gained tactical surprise by attacking at night. If the Ottoman attack had succeeded, Britain&rsquo;s prestige and warmaking capacity would be severely damaged.&#10;&#10;Suez 1916 uses the Fire &amp; Movement system. The movement and combat systems are designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;The historical battle was a touch-and-go affair, ending with the British pushing the Turks just far enough to keep the canal safe. The British have the stronger force, but the Central Powers has the advantages of surprise, initiative, and strong artillery support. The player who best utilizes his strengths and is prepared to capitalize on opportunities will prevail.&#10;&#10;Details:&#10;&#10;    Level: Regiment/Brigade&#10;    Hex: 0.6 miles (1 km) &#10;&#10;&#10;",

This aspect is represented by players hiding cards in their &quot;debt&quot; pile in hopes that these cards will later match the face-up cards in the middle of the table. Players score points for every card (aid shipment) they are able to accurately predict by the end of the round, scoring more points for shipments they were able to spot while they were still high up in the air, but losing points for cards they were unable to match. Drop Site is fast-playing, intuitively strategic, professionally manufactured, and easy to teach and learn.&#10;&#10;",

The table value determines how many hot dogs can be sold at that table.&#10;The remaining dollar cards are sorted according to value (1, 5, 10 $) and also placed on the table. The start player gets the ketchup/mustard card.&#10;&#10;All players simultaneously decide at which table and how many hot dogs they want to sell. Each player puts the corresponding table and hot dog cards on the table, face down. They can also put down dollar cards to reduce the price of their hot dogs.&#10;When all players have made their decision, the cards are revealed and tallied up, beginning with the lowest table. &#10;When several players want to sell at the same table, the player who wants to sell the lowest number of hot dogs at this table puts them next to the table first, followed by the player who wants to sell the second lowest number at that table etc. Once the number of hot dogs from the players' cards has reached the maximum specified on the table, no other players can sell hot dogs there and any unsold hot dog cards are returned to that player's hand. Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4). If hot dog prices are equal, the player with the ketchup/mustard card goes first.&#10;As soon as a table is full, each player receives one dollar for each hot dog he/she has at this table.&#10;At the end of the round, each player takes back the table card he/she played and the ketchup/mustard card is passed on to the next player.&#10;A new sales round starts.&#10;When someone plays out his/her last hot dog card(s), he has to announce this by saying &quot;last hot dog&quot;, otherwise he may not sell them. When one player has sold all of his/her hot dogs, the game ends. If tables have become full that round, there is a last payout.&#10;Then all players count their dollars and write down their points. After three games, the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you or another player roll the four six-sided dice, then each player uses the results to create two two-digit numbers, writing each number into an empty city. If you write a double-digit number (11, 22, etc.), then mark off a bonus box; if you fill, say, a blue city with a two-digit number that used the blue die for one of the digits, mark off a bonus box.&#10;&#10;You can write each two-digit combination (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, etc.) only once, marking them off on the bottom of the sheet as the turns pass. If you can't mark off one or two cities based on the die results, then you must place an X through one or two cities. You have two special powers you can use once each game: re-rolling 1-4 dice when you're the active roller, and re-using a digit on one die in each of the two-digit numbers you create that turn.&#10;&#10;After thirteen turns, the game ends. You score 1 point for each marked bonus box and -1 point for each X. If you have four or more cities in consecutive order, e.g., 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, then you score 2-9 points based on the length of the chain. You also identify your longest chain of non-X cities that are in increasing order and score 1 point for each city. Finally, you score 0-9 points based on how many of the three zones have no Xed cities. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when a player has nothing behind their screen at the beginning of their turn.&#10;The winner is the player whose landing craft at the end of the game is furthest advanced on the score chart.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The title of First to Fight refers to the famous slogan and poster distributed in European countries after Poland was the first country to be attacked by Germany in September 1939. This game, released by Fabryka Gier Historycznych (Historical Games Factory)in cooperation with Fundacja Niepodleg&#197;&#130;o&#197;&#155;ci (Foundation for Independence), takes place throughout the entirety of World War II, with the players taking the roles of commanders of the Polish forces that are fighting on numerous fronts: Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, etc. By allocating their troops in different regions of the world, they aim to carry out missions (including the most famous battles of WW2) and earn victory points (VPs). The players do not &quot;own&quot; or control the soldiers, which are represented by neutral cards, moved by the players around the board, and activated only when it is the time to play a mission card in a given region; that said, their particular specialization may increase a player's chance to win a mission. The player with the most VPs at the end of the War (May 1945) wins.&#10;&#10;The game presents true historical characters, events and places. First to Fight shows the scale of various activities that took place during the war &ndash; but it is not a wargame. Over its 40-70 minute playing time, a player will get to know many people and places that played an important role in achieving the victory over Germany. Among the soldiers to command, you can find Antoni Chru&#197;&#155;ciel ps. Monter, August Emil Fieldorf ps. Nil, Jan Kozielewski ps. Jan Karski, Zdzis&#197;&#130;aw Jeziora&#197;&#132;ski ps. Jan Nowak, Stanis&#197;&#130;aw Maczek ps. Baca, Jan Piwnik ps. Ponury, Zofia Rapp-Kocha&#197;&#132;ska ps. Marie Springer, Stanis&#197;&#130;aw Skalski, El&#197;&#188;bieta Zawacka ps. Zo, Witold Urbanowicz ps. Kobra. In order to win the game, you will have to train your soldiers and send them to various fronts &ndash; from the cold regions of Northern Europe, through the sun-baked deserts of Northern Africa and peaceful (only in theory!) Western Europe, to Warsaw, always fighting to the last bullet and the last soldier! All characters and events presented in the game were real.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lie Detector includes a small plastic non-electronic 'Lie Detector Machine', a plastic peg board for keeping score, and numerous 'Arrest', 'Summons', 'Secret Information', and 'Suspect' cards.&#10;&#10;Of the 24 suspects, one of them has committed a crime. The players have a number of turns to find the guilty party by interrogating suspects with the Lie Detector machine.&#10;&#10;To play Lie Detector, the Suspect cards are divided among the game players.  One of the six square 'Guilty' cards is inserted into the back of the Lie Detector machine so that no one knows which suspect is the criminal; each 'Guilty' card has four suspects on it, with the guilty suspect being determined by the orientation in which the card is inserted.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player questions a suspect by taking the  suspect's card, placing it over the front of the Lie Detector and inserting the Lie Detector's wand through a hole in the card and into the Lie Detector itself.  If the testimony is false, a bell rings and a needle on the machine points to &quot;False&quot;.  If it is true, no bell rings and the needle points to &quot;True&quot;.  (e.g. - The Racketeer says &quot;the Suspect has a 'Big Jaw'... if it comes up 'True' you know that one of the six suspects with a big jaw committed the crime)&#10;&#10;Also included in the game are special 'Secret Information' cards. These cards have testimony that is known only to the player who own the cards.&#10;&#10;By process of elimination, the suspects are narrowed down, until a player feels confident that he can make a successful accusation and 'make an arrest'.  He checks the guilty card in the machine.  If he is right, he gets 5 points plus bonus points for the number of face-up suspects still showing on the table.&#10;&#10;Additional rounds are played until one player's score is 25 points of more.&#10;&#10;Mattel, Inc. re-issued this game as Spy Detector with different artwork, and it did not sell nearly as well.&#10;&#10;",

As the game progresses, players gain success by selling out to more mainstream music and learning how to do effective marketing.

A medida que la enfermedad se acerca devorando pa&iacute;s tras pa&iacute;s, el caos comienza a cundir en Espa&ntilde;a.&#10;&#10;M&aacute;s de 500.000 ejemplares vendidos avalan la calidad de los libros escritos por Manel Loureiro.&#10;&#10;Apocalipsis Z es un juego cooperativo, con una duraci&oacute;n aproximada de 40 minutos, recomendado a partir de 14 a&ntilde;os, de 1 a 4 jugadores donde nos pondremos en la piel de uno o m&aacute;s personajes, que son los protagonistas principales de los libros, cada uno de ellos representado por una ficha de personaje con sus propias caracter&iacute;sticas y habilidades especiales.&#10;&#10;El juego se estructura alrededor de una campa&ntilde;a no lineal donde se podr&aacute; decidir entre varias varias l&iacute;neas argumentales. Aunque tambi&eacute;n se puede jugar cualquiera de sus escenarios por separado.&#10;La campa&ntilde;a tiene un componente narrativo, integrado en la historia contada en los libros y situada entre el primer y segundo volumen de la saga. Los protagonistas empiezan esta aventura refugiados en el hospital de Meixoeiro y deber&aacute;n abandonar definitivamente ese refugio por causa de un incendio.&#10;&#10;Dicha narraci&oacute;n est&aacute; llevada a cabo por el propio autor de los libros, Manel Loureiro.&#10;&#10;En cada escenario tendremos una selecci&oacute;n de cartas para el mapa inicial, adem&aacute;s de una selecci&oacute;n de eventos y unos objetivos a cumplir antes de que se acabe el mazo de amenaza. Esto hace que el prop&oacute;sito principal del juego sea cooperar estrechamente para conseguir unos recursos concretos manteniendo al grupo a salvo. Si nos dedicamos a acabar con todos los zombies a base de &quot;tirar dados y realizar ataques&quot; es posible que fracasemos.&#10;&#10;En cada ronda los jugadores deciden el orden de actuaci&oacute;n de sus personajes buscando la mejor estrategia para el grupo, al inicio del turno de cada personaje se roba una carta de amenaza que puede tener consecuencias positivas o negativas, en funci&oacute;n del evento revelado. O nefastas en caso de ser la &uacute;ltima carta de evento.&#10;&#10;Cada personaje dispone de unos puntos de acci&oacute;n para gastar cada turno, las acciones posibles son: mover, atacar, buscar recursos en edificios, levantar barricadas, intercambiar objetos del inventario con otro personaje o llevar a cabo la acci&oacute;n especial de algunos personajes.&#10;&#10;Los puntos de acci&oacute;n disponibles se ver&aacute;n disminuidos por las heridas, limitando las acciones a realizar en cada turno.&#10;&#10;Listado de componentes b&aacute;sicos del juego&#10;1 Caja del juego&#10;1 Reglamento&#10;1 Libro de Campa&ntilde;a&#10;1 Dado de seis caras&#10;4 Personaje + fichas personaje &#10;25 Zombis &#10;30 Cartas de objetos &#10;36 Cartas de eventos &#10;30 Cartas de localizaci&oacute;n/calle&#10;1 Carta de L&uacute;culo y su token&#10;20 Contadores de acci&oacute;n/herida&#10;35 Marcadores (V&iacute;veres, Combustible, Medicamentos, Municiones, objeto y barricadas).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Parsec - Age Of Colonies&quot;&#10;The Ultimate sci-fi board game.&#10;&quot;Parsec - Age Of Colonies&quot; is a unusual 3X-style space strategy game (expand, exploit, exterminate) with a mix of resource management and fleet space combat, using dice rolls and card decks.&#10;&#10;Colonize and control planets and asteroids, gain resources, expand your domain and build a powerful fleet to rule the galaxy! In Parsec: Age of Colonies you can achieve victory in different ways: taking control of space economic system, colonizing most of the planets or crushing your enemies one by one with your war fleet. Turn in your favor cosmic events like black holes, space-time distorsions, meteor swarms and much more. During the struggle for total domination, you will have the chance to break through new scientific discoveries that will let you develop your space navigation capability, your weapons and your defenses, helping you achieve your goals. Watch your enemies, because they won't just seat there.&#10;They will oppose you by all means with sabotage, spying, interfering in your commercial negotiations or stealing your technologies and vessels. Ally with your opponents in order to gain strategic advantages or striking down more powerful enemies. &#10;Will you colonize the Galaxy to control its riches or will you use them to move to war against your enemies? This call is only yours! In Parsec: Age of Colonies in order to found a new galactic empire, players must colonize the planets and take control of asteroids, building colonies and cargo ships that will let them extract the three key resources: Titanium, Gold and Energy. &#10;Using a blend of strategy and war tactics, you must find the right balance to achieve your goals, taking advantage of the peculiar abilities of your Faction and of the rich deck of Event cards divided in four categories: &#10;&#10;     Strategic Events [ Technologies, Weapons, Tactical actions ]&#10;     Natural Events [ Black holes, Asteroid fields and similar ]&#10;     Bonus Events [ Additional resources, Vessels ]&#10;     Permanent Events [ Building capabilities, Attack and Defense ]&#10;&#10;&#10;With the modular game board, the Event cards and the Faction cards, every game will be different. You will be able to explore and fight in always different battle scenarios and to experiment with always new combat strategies. Each of this key gameplay elements will let you live unprecedented epic galactic battles.&#10;&#10;The scifi themed board games are usually very complex, somehow cluttered by dozens of parts used to represent almost anything. In Parsec - Age Of Colonies this is not true, the game is very simple and easy to learn. All the technology has been moved onto the cards. The cards decide your faction, the faction (almost) decide your strategy. Cards are divided in four classes (strategic, natural, bonus and permanent) and are constantly flowing through players that can buy, use, steal or sell them in order to achieve specific goals. This approach, along with dice rolling, the modular board and the factions randomness, add a virtually endless replay value to the game. Players can bind alliances on the fly to combat against other players when they are too close to victory, but without knowing the enemy's card deck it will be anyway a difficult task. Parsec - Age Of Colonies is much more deeper than it looks at a first glance.&#10;&#10;Quick and easy trading capabilities also has been added, just to add some spice to the overall tense taste of the game.&#10;Over a year in play-testing, polishing the design and refining gameplay, adding more depth to various elements of the game.&#10;The game rules are rock-solid and fully scalable, and have been thoroughly tested considering all possible game scenarios.&#10;The rules are simple yet deep enough even for the more demanding gamers.&#10;The cards, as said, play a pivotal role in the gameplay. You will gain access to special items or additional resources, diplomacy, weapons and, most important, you'll be able to unleash the power of natural events in your favor.&#10;The game is made by three playset for two players each that can be combined together to form a massive playing field, up to six (or more...) players.&#10;In each set there are:&#10;&#10;46 colored pawns for each player&#10;2 dices&#10;4 event counters&#10;6 table modules&#10;35 Event cards&#10;60 Resource cards (titanium, energy and gold)&#10;4 Faction cards.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;Furthermore, additional Event card decks and two more expansion sets are arriving to bring the total player numbers to eight, for even more challenging games!&#10;In PARSEC - AGE OF COLONIES&reg; you can achieve victory in different ways: taking control of space economic system, colonizing most of the planets, or crushing your enemies one by one with your war fleet.&#10;&#10;The game will be released fully translated in english and italian.&#10;&#10;Link&#10;Tabeltop Simulator Version&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns drawing a card from the deck or discard pile to replace the cards in their grid.  Each card has a number value, the higher the value the worse the card.  Action cards such as Peek, Steal, and Swap allow players to rearrange their grid and take cards from other players.  The hand ends once one player's cards are all face up.  Then players add up the total value of their cards.  Multiple hands are played, and once one player reaches 50 points, the player with the fewest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Marlborough: War of the Spanish Succession (&quot;Marby,&quot; for short), is a wargame of intermediate-to-high complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating that critical conflict of the early 18th century. The dynastic struggle began when France's Louis XIV attempted to place his grandson, Philip IV, on the throne of Spain. The other major powers saw that as a threat, and so supported their own candidate, Charles III. That in turn began over a decade of fighting that grew into a general struggle for domination over all of western Europe.&#10;&#10;Marby is a two player game. One controls the forces of France and its allies, known as the Bourbon coalition, after the ruling house of France. The other player controls the forces opposing France, led by England and Austria and known as the Grand Alliance. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to win the game by controlling states and economic centers.&#10;&#10;The game includes several scenarios. Shorter scenarios represent critical parts of the war, while the &quot;Grand Design&quot; scenario covers the entire war. Certain rules are designated &quot;optional,&quot; and the players don't have to use them. The optional rules are suggested for use only when playing the Grand Design scenario, as they add considerable complexity, historical detail and playing time.&#10;&#10;The 34x22&quot; large-hex map shows western and central Europe during the early 18th century. The grid of hexagons printed over the map provides locations for playing pieces and geographic features. During the game, the cardboard pieces are placed within individual hexes.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents one year; each hex scales to 50 miles. Each army represents 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and support personnel, camp followers, etc. A leader represents that person plus his guards, entourage, lackeys, wine cellars, etc. A fleet represents 60 warships and an indeterminate number of transports. The rules run to some 17,000 words, making for play sessions lasting from four to 12 hours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qu&auml;senb&ouml; is a card game for the Decktet. It is similar to standard-deck Crazy Eights, but is, however, somewhat more complex due to the multiple-suit nature of the Decktet cards, and because the third consecutive play of the same suit is penalized by having to draw an extra card.&#10;&#10;The author makes the historically dubious claim that  &quot;Qu&auml;senb&ouml; was a popular game at the court of the badger Charlemagne. Its name means 'too many.' The theme is thought to reflect political issues of royal succession in the many small kingdoms of the Empire; although some feminist historians believe it instead derives from the qu&auml;senb&ouml; pan, a cast-iron skillet capable of turning out vast numbers of sp&auml;tzle at a time.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Indian handlooms date back several centuries. The tradition of weaving by hand formed a part of the country's cultural ethos. A piece of fabric with a design could indicate the meaning, its purpose, the culture of the era, and even the way the people lived. Handlooms thus became a precious part of the generational legacy and exemplify the richness and diversity of a country and the artistry of the weavers.&#10;&#10;Innovative weavers with their skillful blending of myths, faiths, symbols, and imagery provide the fabric an appealing dynamism. The appeal of the handloom lies in introducing innovative designs that cannot be easily replicated. This rich tradition of hand weaving still thrives at Kanchi, a prominent temple town in South India. Fabrics were part and parcel of trade done by the Indian weavers for which they got back &quot;Annas&quot; or goods in return.&#10;&#10;In Ettana: The Looms of Kanchi, players take the role of weavers to complete designs and be the first to make eight &quot;Annas&quot; (victory points). In detail, set up the 5x5 game board by placing one of 25 yarn discs (five of each in five colors) on each space, then place 16 of the 18 number tiles (three each of the numbers 1-6) at the intersections of the spaces on the game board; place the remaining two number tiles on the side in the reserve, along with one yarn disc of each color. Each player receives a random action card, a random design card, and two tokens with a value of 1. Each player places their pawn on one number tile.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the two dice: a color die and a number die. If a player's pawn is touching a space that shows the color rolled, they receive a 1 token; if the die shows black, which is not a yarn color, you take an action card and no one else gets anything. You can then move your pawn as many spaces as the number rolled, after which you can swap two yarn adjacent to your location. Additionally, you can play as many action cards as you wish, and you can pay tokens to take design cards, take action cards, and swap any two yarns. Action cards allow you to move, swap, gain tokens, replace a yarn or number with one from the reserve, etc.&#10;&#10;If the pattern of yarn on the board matches a design card in hand, you can reveal that card to score its points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;It is the near future; Earth. Years ago, scientists successfully constructed the Belief Engine, a machine that warps reality based on peoples&rsquo; strongly held beliefs. The machine was turned on for testing, but it proved too sensitive: widespread belief in the depravity of man and fears of social collapse suddenly took on the full force of objective fact, and science skepticism rendered the Engine&rsquo;s creators helpless to intervene. Without resort to a shared external reality, civilization crumbled like a sand castle in the tide.&#10;&#10;&quot;From the ruins have now arisen cults led by charismatic, messianic figures possessed of seemingly divine powers derived from the still-functioning Engine. You are one such a figure&mdash;the true one, the Messiah. It is God&rsquo;s will that you build temples and marshal followers, then mold their beliefs to perform miracles and destroy your rivals. They&rsquo;ll be doing the same, but don&rsquo;t worry&ndash;God is on your side&hellip;&quot;&#10;&#10;How it's played&#10;&#10;Rounds go player by player, with each individual player turn broken up into phases:&#10;&#10;1) Beginning (reset any praying followers to active status; recruit followers and build temples; draw back up to 6 cards);&#10;   2) Action (move units, have followers on temples pray to produce belief, use belief to perform miracles);&#10;   3) Combat (adjacent enemy units attack one another according to deterministic rules);&#10;   4) End (discard down to 3 cards, loot any empty enemy temple you have units left adjacent to, make sure you have enough units left to support the continued functioning of your own temples).&#10;&#10;Each round ends with the Market, in which players make secret bids on an assortment of 5-7 miracle cards. Bidders get to spend their bid on up to 2 cards, with high bidders buying first. Purchased cards are placed into each player's discard pile, eventually to be cycled back into their decks Dominion-style.&#10;&#10;A player wins by slaying an enemy messiah, by reducing an enemy to less than 4 followers, by capturing an enemy's holy city, or by reducing an enemy to less than 8 miracle cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players represent up to four factions: the Reds (Communists), Siberian Whites (monarchists), Southern Whites, or Northern Whites. Each turn represents three months, and the game begins in Summer of 1918 and concludes, should one player not win outright, in the Spring 1921 turn. This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.&#10;&#10;Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).&#10;&#10;Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.  Having the ability to fight through adversity makes one a powerful adversary in Red Russia.&#10;&#10;",

After throwing the dice, all players must quickly try to think of a single word that fits the category and includes all the letters shown. For example, the two letters A and C and the category &quot;Breakfast Food&quot; might lead to &quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;cereal&quot;, &quot;pancakes&quot; or even &quot;cantaloupe&quot;. The fastest player receives the card and then turns over a card for the next round. At the end of the deck, the player who collected the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;When you launch a rocket, you're not really flying that rocket. You're just sort of hanging on.&quot; Michael P. Anderson&#10;&#10;It's 150 years in the future and mankind has spread throughout the solar system. To supply far-flung colonies, they look to the Rocket Jockeys! The planets depend on timely cargo arrivals &ndash; but this is not enough for the rocket jockeys. They compete with one another to see who can complete the fanciest maneuvers, transport the most important cargo, and visit the most planets.&#10;&#10;In Rocket Jockey, you must be daring and you must be quick. You must also be tough, for first contact with alien life is near at hand. Deliver your cargo with the most flair and speed and you will win the game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Place 9 numbered planet cards in a row, with a random cargo card, showing a DIFFERENT destination planet, under each one. Players are each dealt 2 maneuver cards, which allow maneuver between 2 specific planets; the rest of these cards forms a draw deck, from which 3 are placed face up. Players also each start with 4 Copilot cards. The 2nd time through the maneuver deck, shuffle an Alien card into the bottom several cards.&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw a maneuver card from the deck, the 3 face up cards, or the top of the discard pile. Then, either draw another or make a delivery run. When making runs, may start on any planet and pick up that cargo; use maneuver cards to chain, until you get to destination planet. If possible, may pick up that cargo and begin new chain ... all stops in these consecutive chains count towards the number of stops; chains with more stops are worth more VP. Alternatively, may make multiple deliveries with different starts/ends, but you must calculate VP for each such chain separately. Save all delivered cargo in your score pile; at end of game, you get bonus VP for having visited more planets. You can use Copilot cards in 2 ways:&#10;- use max 1/maneuver card, to alter one of the 2 planets shown by 1&#10;- place on a cargo to reserve it until your next turn; if someone else takes it, they lose 5VP; if you fail to make the run next turn, you lose 5VP and the card. Otherwise, you get your card back next turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, draw up to a hand size of 2 (if you had fewer), then replenish the face up display. If you reveal the alien, place it at just beyond Pluto. At the end of each turn, it advances 1 step. Alternatively, it can be picked up like cargo and delivered to Earth. Score planets at the end of each run through the deck. The game ends immediately if the Aliens get to Earth; most VP (from deliveries during game + bonus for number of planets delivered to) wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fujian Trader is a victory-point based, gateway game. The theme and mechanics are based upon the re-discovered Selden Map which depicts trading routes in China and had been lost for nearly 300 years. In Fujian Trader, players assume the role of Ming-era merchant families following trading routes in the East China Sea. Victory-points are gained by trading (or raiding) the goods of iron, silk, and rice for silver and influence. To win, players must accrue the most victory-points in order to successfully endure the Manchu invasion and subsequent Ming Empire collapse at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided up into six different regions separated into six different colors. Each region has several ports. Players start out with a number of ports (dependent on the number of players) and may receive goods based off of which ports they control. When ports produce goods depends on the roll of a colored die. The color the die lands on coincides with the six colored regions and determines which produces goods for that round. Players may purchase additional ports with money gained from trading or incite rebellions in already controlled ports to wrestle them from an opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the Manchu first invade the Ming Empire. The invasion starts once the last of three Manchu Move cards is drawn from the Event deck. Players then have a three rounds to trade goods and two rounds to store silver, thus accruing victory-points. After the third round of the invasion the game ends, and players tally up victory points to determine who wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron combines the simplicity and strategy of a 15-minute head-to-head card game with the depth and detail of a pro football simulation. Years of development have yielded a realistic football simulation that combines simple and elegant rules with unlimited depth and strategy. By focusing on one key play in each scoring drive, you play an entire football game in under 15 minutes. Every player, from your star quarterback to your under-appreciated right tackle, has their own player card; and each player has the ability to impact the result of every game.&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron can be played by anyone; even those who are new to the game of football. Intuitive rules mixed with tense competition gives this game an addictive edge you won't find in any other sports game.&#10;&#10;History&#10;&#10;Clay Dreslough, the game's lead designer, wrote his first dice-based sports simulation in 1976. He later discovered similar games from companies like Strat-O-Matic and Sports Illustrated, but he didn't enjoy them very much. It's tedious to spend several hours picking plays, flipping them over, rolling dice, looking up the results on a chart, rolling more dice, moving counters on the &quot;play clock&quot; and so on, just to resolve each play.&#10;&#10;Instead, Clay created the award-winning Baseball Mogul and Football Mogul computer games, capable of simulating entire seasons in just a few minutes. We used this technology as the under-pinnings for Masters of the Gridiron -- to create realistic player ratings for over 680 current players, and to create realistic playbooks for all 32 teams.&#10;&#10;Over the last four years, we have boiled down 26 pages of rules to the bare essentials, creating a head-to-head card game that feels like football.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;You choose your starting offensive and defensive players, and combine them with a playbook of 24 (or more) cards. You can pair an MVP quarterback with 3 superstar receivers, or focus on your offensive line and the running game. Choose a standard 4-3 defense, or add a nickel back to help stop a team built around the passing game.&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron encourages you to create your own customized deck, combining your favorite players and plays from multiple decks. Three simple rules govern the creation of your own customized team roster and playbook. This gives your freedom to build your offense around a power running game or a vertical passing game, and tailor your defense to pressure opposing quarterbacks or focus on forcing turnovers (to name just a few examples). Assemble an offensive juggernaut and try it out against your friend's shutdown defense -- the possibilities are limitless!&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 offensive player cards, 3 defensive player cards, and 4 playbook cards. To mount a scoring drive, you match a playbook card to an offensive player with the appropriate skills (such as &quot;passing&quot; or &quot;run blocking&quot;) and lay them down on the table, announcing the player rating that your opponent needs to beat in order to stop your attempt to score. Their ability to stop you depends on a combination of their strategy decisions and the luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;Players alternate possessions until &quot;time runs out&quot; (when each team has no more offensive player cards to draw). Along the way, you enjoy all the aspects of a real football game, from goal-line stands and two-point conversions to game-changing interceptions and last-minute field goals.&#10;&#10;The playbook cards themselves are used to track your score. So the only thing you need to play are two decks (one per team) and 15 minutes of time.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;Each deck contains 54 high-quality full-color playing cards:&#10;&#10;13 Offensive Player cards&#10;13 Defensive Player cards&#10;24 Offensive Playbook cards&#10;4 Defensive Playbook cards&#10;Each team includes their own printed card box for safekeeping. Our cards are also compatible with other card-storage boxes and sleeves, such as those used for collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon.&#10;&#10;Licensing&#10;&#10;Please note that Masters of the Gridiron is not licensed by the National Football League. Our games use real player names and stats, but do not include registered trademarks (such as team logos).

One of the teams is always 1 player alone called 'the fugitive'. The other team is trying to hunt him down on a map of The Netherlands. The hunting team must reach the same coordinates within 25 turns while using smart tricks like drones, calls and restrictions. The fugitive wins when he can't be captured before the last turn ends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Tribulation, number tiles are laid out in a 7 x 7 grid, similarly to Boggle.  Each tile has a number from 1 to 9 on it (the 9 tile is also used as a 6 in some editions).  Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.&#10;&#10;Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).&#10;&#10;",
