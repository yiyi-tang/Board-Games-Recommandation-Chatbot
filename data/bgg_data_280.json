    "Description": "A motorized elephant blows nylon butterflies up into the air. Players try to catch them in their nets (or gather them up from off the floor). The player who gathers the most once the elephant is finished blowing earns a butterfly token for their net.  Also, the player who catches the special blue butterfly also wins a token. The first player to get three butterfly tokens wins!  In alternate editions, the golden butterfly is an instant win, and otherwise simply getting the most butterflies makes you win.&#10;&#10;Musical Freddy and His Flying Fish is the same game, but with instead of an elephant blowing butterflies, it's a large fish blowing smaller fish.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Penguin is a fast-paced game in which players stack colored plastic penguins that they draw at random from a bag at the start of the game. Players keep their penguins behind screens so that no one knows who has which colors.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds a penguin to the pyramid. The first penguins are placed in the bottom row (obviously), but once two penguins are adjacent, a penguin matching the color of either of those penguins can be placed on top of them; e.g., either a red or blue penguin can be placed on top of adjacent red and blue penguins. The bottom row can be no more than seven penguins long. If a player knocks down the pyramid, he takes penalty points equal to the number of penguins behind his screen, then players start again from scratch. When a player can't play &mdash; whether because he has no penguins at all or no penguins that can legally be played &mdash; he passes. Once all players pass, the round ends and everyone scores one penalty point for each of his unplayed penguins. Anyone who played all of his penguins returns two penalty points.&#10;&#10;After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

For each player who voted incorrectly the player must move the Grim Reaper one space forward towards their own piece!

(There are also sets made with 1-12.)&#10;&#10;Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.&#10;&#10;The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:&#10;&#10;One number which is the combined value of both dice.&#10;&#10;Or...&#10;&#10;Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.&#10;&#10;For example:&#10;&#10;If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.&#10;&#10;The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)&#10;&#10;The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.&#10;&#10;In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.&#10;&#10;If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!&#10;&#10;This was later the inspiration for the NBC Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until 1988.&#10;&#10;",

Kids love the suspense as they watch his belly grow; the player who makes his belly burst loses the game. Redesigned in 2013 to make it easier for kids 4 and up to play, children can quickly reset this pig game with one pump of the pig&rsquo;s head and experience consistent belly busting game-play each and every time. Pop the Pig provides hours of fun and is completely kid powered (no batteries needed). For added convenience, all pieces can be stored inside the pig. Kids won&rsquo;t see a pop up pirate, but they will get to pop a pig. For ages 4 and up, 2-6 players. From the makers of Gooey Louie and Jumping Jack.&#10;&#10;",

In a difficult situation, players can pledge their properties &ndash; otherwise, the player bankrupts and loses the game.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money &ndash; after everyone else's bankruptcy or after established time os over.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Game mechanics is almost exactly the same like in Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player rolls two dice, moves around the board and buys properties located in various European countries (from communist period), grouped by their region.&#10;1) If a player lands on an unexploited property, he can buy it or allow the bank to auction it to other players.&#10;2) If he lands on someone's property, he must pay its owner a rent (proportional to the value of the land and its buildings).&#10;3) If the property belongs to the player and he has all the lands in the country, he can build houses or hotels that increase rent for visitors.&#10;There are also other places on the board that you can't buy, but they require the player to draw a &quot;Chance&quot; card, pay taxes, collect income, and even go to jail. Each player also has regular income everytime they pass the starting field.&#10;&#10;Properties are located in countries listed below (from cheapest to most expensive):&#10;&#10;     South: Greece (2 properties) &ndash; yellow color, Italy (3) &ndash; red color.&#10;     West: Spain (3) &ndash; blue color and Great Britain (3) &ndash; orange color.&#10;     North: Benelux (Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, summary 3 properties) &ndash; green color and Sweden (3) &ndash; purple color&#10;     East: RFN /West Germany/ (3) &ndash; brown color and Austria (2) &ndash; black color.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game continues until everyone but one player leave the game (bankrupt) or until an established time is over. I the latter case all players sum up they fortune &ndash; cash, power plant, railway stations, water supply, properties (not taken to pledge) with the value of buildings, half value of properties taken to pledge.&#10;&#10;It is still avaible in shops for around 8$.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It&rsquo;s year 999. The Christianisation of the Scandinavian countries is ongoing, but some Vikings are stubborn and are fighting to keep their culture and their beliefs. A new territory has been discovered, which could be the promised land they have always looked for, where gods walk alongside the worthy; a land of opulence, abundant harvests and good living, the very idea of Valhalla.&#10;&#10;The first expedition settled there and founded a colony. Months later, a second expedition is sent there. The sea voyage goes very terribly and many men die. A small band of survivors arrive hungry and exhausted at the colony camp, which does not look at all like what they imagined. They discover an icy and disturbing place, immersed in the mist, surrounded by an oppressive forest... and empty! None of the settlers are there. What was their longship is planted into the earth in the centre of the camp like a sinister totem. They will have to rebuild the camp, survive the hostile conditions, explore this cold and frightening land before understanding what happened and solve the mystery.&#10;&#10;HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative survival horror viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura. The game offers players the chance to lead a small group of survivors, each with their own background and secret motives. The players must cooperate if they want to survive the immediate dangers of cold, hunger and external threats, but they will also have to complete their inner quest to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name. HEL: The Last Saga is highly narrative, with chapters to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with a bit of resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

According to Whitehill, the game based on the children's story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market. The game is of the &quot;racing&quot; variety in the style of the European &quot;Goose Game&quot;, that is the first player to reach the end of the &quot;track&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players move around a map of Europe, scoring points for each destination they reach. Card play determines destination, transportation method, and distance traveled. Players may play hazard cards to block or slow down their opponents. One of the players is the assassin and scores bonus points by getting a &quot;hit&quot; on one of the other players. Game length is variable: when a weapon card is drawn by a player, it is placed on the map. When the fourth weapon card is drawn, the game ends.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of EuroHit.&#10;&#10;[Below descriptive text from the box back]&#10;&#10;Assassination has been the tool of the desperate and the ruthless seeking change since time immemorial.  The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &quot;one of the crowd&quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &quot;Jackal&quot;.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.  Played against the backdrop of modern Europe, players travel about the board, scoring points for visiting as many cities as possible.  But beware, for some unknown reason one among the players is an &quot;Assassin&quot;, who scores even more points by making a &quot;Hit&quot; when in the same city as another.  Perhaps the intercession of an &quot;Interpol Officer&quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &quot;Espionage Agent&quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &quot;Innocent Bystander&quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.&#10;&#10;Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.&#10;&#10;A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!&#10;&#10;",

When any player sees two cards which are alike turned up on the table, he may call out &quot;SNAP&quot;, and the one first calling takes all the turned up cards in both places where the duplicate cards appear.&#10;&#10;4. The successful player takes all cards won and places them face downwards under his original pack and must then play his first card upon the table.&#10;&#10;5.

Players also must gather resources to upgrade equipment like their Broom and Wand, while also improving attributes such as Knowledge and Strength to succeed at classes and duels and prove themselves to be the best student. Between certain school years, special magical events await each with its unique requirements and characteristics. Some players may choose to get ahead through &quot;sneaky&quot; moves that earn them darkness cards and may brand them a dark wizard!&#10;&#10;Whoever has  collected the most victory points (VP) for their own house after a total of 5 school years and 3 Magical Events wins!&#10;&#10;",

When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Even the youngest of children can join in the fun and even play by themselves.&#10;&#10;Number of players: Two to eight, each for himself.&#10;The Deck: Standard 52 card pack.&#10;&#10;The Deal: Any player is able to deal first. Just shuffle and deal out cards, one at a time to each player in rotation until all have been used. The cards need not come out even. Each player squares up his hand into a neat pile in front of him without looking at the cards which are face down.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To win all the cards by being the first to slap each jack as it is played to the center.&#10;&#10;The play. Each player in turn, starting from the dealer's left, is required to lift one card from the pile in front of him and place it face up in the center of the table. The players must turn up the card away from him and not toward him; he must not see it earlier than any other player. At the same time, the play should be made with a swift movement so the other players may not see the denomination of the card before he does.&#10;&#10;If the card played to the center is a jack, the first player must slap his hand down on it, take it, and with it, all cards below it in the center of the table. The player who wins these cards must turn them face down and shuffle them with the cards in his hand still remaining on the table in front of him, in order to form a new hand.&#10;Suppose more than one player slaps at a jack. The one whose hand is lowest (directly on top of the jack) is declared winner of the pile. If a player has no more cards left, he remains in the game until a jack is next turned, and he may then slap at the jack in an effort to get a new hand. Should he fail to win, the player is declared out of the game. The play continues until one player possesses all the cards. That player is then made the winner! NOTE: If a dealer's card is exposed, then all the cards must be shuffled before they are again placed face down. If a player slaps at any card in the center other than a Jack, he is required to give one card, face down, to the player of that card.&#10;&#10;",

If your marble fails to make it to the end, you&rsquo;ve got a dud on your hands and must re-engineer your path to victory.&#10;&#10;",

In the first part, players circle the board, feeding money into the eight available properties, then bidding on those properties (not being able to see how much the property is worth) and collecting &quot;Trump&quot; cards.  When all the properties are gone, the negotiation phase begins.  Players use their Trump cards to buy and sell properties, some cards award huge payoffs for specific sets.  After each player has passed their turn, the property values are revealed, and the player with the most money wins (usually in the $400-$600M range).&#10;&#10;",

If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards.  Don't forget to yell &quot;Dos!&quot; whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards!&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards. That player earns points based on the values of the cards left in the other players' hands. Continue playing in rounds until someone reaches 200 points. That player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.&#10;&#10;Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;&#10;&#10;Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of a clear plastic tube, 30 thin sticks, and 32 marbles. Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the hole at the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles fall through. If any do so, the player who made them do so collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Toy Story Ker Plunk!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Afrikan t&auml;hti (&quot;Star of Africa&quot;) is the most important Finnish board game ever. Designed in 1949 by then 19-year-old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.&#10;&#10;Players start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.&#10;&#10;When someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.&#10;&#10;A rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.&#10;&#10;The first official expansion, Afrikan t&#195;&#164;hti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Inkan Aarre&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiddledy Winks varies based on publisher, but they all generally have a cup or other container that sits in the center of a target.  The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).&#10;&#10;Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of &quot;worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons&quot;, and its rules threatened that &quot;proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.&#10;The Reader&rsquo;s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.&#10;&#10;During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.&#10;- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.

    "Description": "BlackJack originated in French casinos around 1700 where it was called &quot;vingt-et-un&quot; and has been played in the U.S. since the 1800's.&#10;&#10;Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.&#10;&#10;A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.&#10;&#10;The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:&#10;&#10;Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.&#10;&#10;Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.&#10;&#10;Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.&#10;&#10;Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.&#10;&#10;Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.&#10;&#10;When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.&#10;&#10;Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.&#10;&#10;",

Known as Awase or Kai-awase. In USA and England known as Pairs, Pelmanism, or Concentration. But these are played with simple playing cards. In Switzerland was a domino-like game named Zwillingsspiel with the same roots. In Czech Republic this type of game is known as Pexeso. The name is an acronym of &quot;pekeln&#196;&#155; se soust&#197;&#153;ed!&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;hellishly focus!&quot;.  It usually consists of 32 pairs of square cards. There are thousands of Pexeso sets with different themes.  There are hundreds of different Memory games - starting with 24 cards for the youngest, with all kinds of animals, art, about countries, also a gay and a &quot;Breast Memory&quot;, several free giveaway Memory games published by companies.&#10;&#10;Players lay a series of tiles upside down in random order.  Then proceed to uncover 2 at a time.  If they match, the player keeps both.  If they don't, the player loses his turn.&#10;&#10;There are 2 different types of memories: &#10;type A: Pure memory games with pairs of identical motifs and &#10;type B: memory games with similar motifs, e.g. 1x1 memory with a pair consisting of the numbers to be multiplied and the solution.&#10;&#10;Game end when all tiles have been matched.  The player with the greater number of tiles wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Top Trumps has been a popular card game in the United Kingdom since the seventies. There are many different card decks based on different subjects, e.g cars, planes, films, military jets, or TV shows. The decks are also available in the USA. Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features an item or character related to the subject of the deck; each card has a picture, some numerical statistics, and possibly some additional text. The pack is the size of an ordinary pack of cards so is readily portable.&#10;&#10;Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may only look at their top card. The player to go first chooses the a statistic (usually a high one) from their top card, e.g. &quot;Top Speed 252mph&quot;. All other players read out the same statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.&#10;&#10;During a round, if 2 or more cards tie or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side. The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Familiarity with the deck is useful since the player will know which statistics are high (and, particularly, which cards have the absolute highest value for a given statistic).&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. Quartets.&#10;&#10;",

Please be careful when submitting new versions of this game; basically, anything published after 1987 will almost certainly be Anti-Monopoly II and belong to that game, even if it's called &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)&#10;&#10;The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.&#10;&#10;Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.&#10;&#10;Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?&#10;&#10;",

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.&#10;This game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.&#10;&#10;The Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff). Board squares shall be not less than 2 inches nor more than 2&frac12; inches wide. Tournament pieces are Red and White, but called Black and White in game related literature.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Roulette is a French word meaning &quot;small wheel&quot;. It is the oldest casino game still in existence today. The exact origins of the game are unknown - there's probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. &#10; The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.&#10; The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.&#10;&#10;Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).&#10;&#10;When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. &#10; ",

    "Description": "The Game of Goose is an ancient children's classic, possibly tracing its roots all the way to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen which was played in early Old Kingdom times.&#10;&#10;Francesco de Medici in Italy sent a copy of this game to King Felipe II of Spain during the 16th century.&#10;It became one of the most popular games in Europe during that time.&#10;&#10;Circa 1600, Beno&icirc;t Rigaud's heirs printed in Lyon &quot;Le Jeu de l'oye, renouvell&eacute; des Grecs, jeu de grand plaisir, comme aujourd'huy princes &amp; grands seigneur&quot; [sic] &quot;le pratiquent&quot; - Le jeu de l'oie, renewed from the Greeks, game of great pleasure, as today princes and great lord [sic] play it -, the oldest French copy known.&#10;&#10;Father Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois Menestrier describes the game in his &quot;Biblioth&egrave;que curieuse et instructive&quot; (1704) : 'There's another type of game, that seems easier to learn, and easier to play; it's the game of goose so common and it is said to come from the Greeks, though nothing can be found about it in their authors. This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.&#10;&#10;The game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.&#10;&#10;It turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title &quot;Royall &amp; most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H. OVERTON at Ye White Horse without Newgate where all sorts of Fine Prints and maps are Sold and Framed at Reasonable Rate&quot;.&#10;&#10;By 1851 it had been copied by the American publisher J.P. Beach of New York who entitled it The Jolly Game of Goose. An 1855 edition was called simply The Game of Goose.&#10;&#10;It is a simple game of racing, using a spiral track with lovely illustrations. The main principle is one shared with Snakes and Ladders as well as the later Game of Life: virtue is rewarded and vice is punished.&#10;&#10;Schmidt Spiele rates their G&auml;nsespiel for ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;Bibliography&#10;Whitehouse, F. R. B. (1971) [1951]. Table games of Georgian and Victorian days. Birmingham: Priory Press Ltd.&#10;'Jeux de princes, jeux de vilains', edited by Eve Netchine, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France / Seuil (2009).&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from Wikipedia:&#10;The board consists of a track with consecutively numbered spaces (usually 63), and is often arranged in a spiral with the starting point at the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a Pachisi board.&#10;&#10;Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps. These can be valued for their historical or artistic merits even by those who have no interest in the game itself, with some editions having been sold for thousands of dollars at auction or displayed in museums.&#10;&#10;",
