    "Description": "Star Saga: One - Beyond The Boundary, released in 1988, was the first in a short-lived series of science fiction adventure/role-playing games by Masterplay Publishing.&#10;&#10;Loosely based on the Rekon pen &amp; paper role-playing system,[1] the game series was designed by Andrew C. Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla.[2] In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text:&#10;&#10;In 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The &quot;Space Plague,&quot; a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.&#10;&#10;Now, a Space Patrol enforces the &quot;Boundary,&quot; that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the &quot;Space Plague&quot; from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.&#10;&#10;Thus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... &quot;&#10;&#10;The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.&#10;&#10; Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Star Saga: Two &#226;&#128;&#147; The Clathran Menace&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The second title, Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace was the sequel, released in 1989. In this title, a gigantic armada of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life. Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat. The game background text describes this as:&#10;&#10;The ominous approach of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot;, it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely kept in the dark by their &quot;superiors&quot;, so as not to cause any undue panic. What good was it to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished?&#10;&#10;To Professor Lee Dambroke, Dean of the Department of Xenobiology on the university world of Harvard, the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot; was a matter of science and knowledge; the line must be breached and stopped, or the darkness of ignorance and stagnation would fall over the galaxy for all eternity.&#10;&#10;To Laran Darkwatch, mystic Disciple of the Final Church of Man, it was a question of faith; faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, faith in the Founders of the Final Church, and faith in their vision of mankind's place in the Cosmos.&#10;&#10;To M.J. Turner, the top pilot in the Space Patrol, or the whole galaxy for that matter, it was a question of pride; pride in the abilities of mankind to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of its ultimate destiny ... to rule the stars.&#10;&#10;All were impressive goals, solid tenets upon which to build a society and a glittering future. Or were they merely brittle conceits, ready to crumble at the first pressure from the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot;?&#10;&#10;Although Star Saga was to be released as a trilogy, Masterplay went out of business before the third game was released, leaving only Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary and Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace.&#10;&#10;The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.&#10;&#10; Sequel to: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Star Saga: One &#226;&#128;&#147; Beyond The Boundary&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the 'meat' of the game lies in the necessary wheeling and dealing between players that is found to produce the desired result - all kinds of bribery, promises, treachery and the like can be used; in fact, unless expressly forbidden by the rules, it can be tried.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a simple game for two or more players, played with two dice and two counters (e.g. coins) per player.&#10;&#10;Roll one die to see who goes first.  Then players take turns (clockwise) rolling two dice.  If either die displays a 1 (an &quot;ace&quot;), a counter is put in the pot (that is, in put in the middle of the table).  If two 1s are thrown, two counters are put in.  If either die displays a 6, both dice and one counter are passed to the player on the thrower's left.&#10;&#10;A player without counters cannot roll the dice, and thus merely passes them on.  (He or she is not out of the game, however, since  he or she will receive a counter if the player on the right rolls a 6.)&#10;&#10;Play continues until there is only 1 counter left outside the pot.  The player with this counter makes three consecutive rolls.  If he or she does NOT roll a 6, then he or she has won.  If, though, a 6 is rolled, the counter and the dice are passed to the player on the left, who in turns rolls three times.  And so on. The first player to roll three times without a 6 wins the game.&#10;&#10;Despite being entirely luck-based, the game is fun on account of its dramatic twists and turns and come-from-behind wins.  The luck is an equalizing element that makes this game especially suitable to play with children&#10;&#10;Source: R. C. Bell, Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is a fairly basic race game, with an elimination element once the first player has finished. &#10;Villagers head towards a well, camping overnight on the way.

Each letter card also has a picture from Chicago's history or architecture; the joker, which is a wild card, shows Mrs. O'Leary's cow.&#10;&#10;There are rules for two games:&#10;&#10;The Game of Chicago: Deal 7 per player and turn up the top draw card to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from either pile and discards 1.  The hand ends when a player can lay down a 7-letter word from the hand.  Then everyone scores for the longest word they can spell: 100 points for 7 letters; 60-30 points for 6-3 letters respectively.  Spelling &quot;Chicago&quot; earns 500 points, which is the goal total of the game.&#10;&#10;Alphabet Rhummy: Start as above.  In a turn, a player: draws 1; lays down a word of 4+ letters, or adds to either end of an existing word, or substitutes letters in an existing word; and discards 1.  The letters substituted for are taken in to the hand, and must be at least as many as were just played.  The hand ends when a player goes out; he then gets 1 point per card in others' hands.  The game ends when a player reaches  52 points.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a picture and phrase for the color, e.g. &quot;The Blue Bike&quot;, &quot;Santa Wears a Red Suit&quot;, &quot;Taste a Juicy Purple Plum&quot;.&#10;&#10;Deal all the cards out.  Starting at the dealer's left, a player leads a primary color and calls (for example) &quot;Blue Snip&quot;; the next player follows with a different primary and calls &quot;Yellow Snap&quot;; the next player plays the secondary color that combines them and calls &quot;Blue and Yellow makes Green Mixem&quot;.  The one who completes the set lays it aside and leads to the next one.  (It's unstated, but presumably a player who cannot play correctly passes.)  The first player out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A rummy-type word card game that rewards long words.&#10;&#10;It has 175 cards, each with two letters; you can use either one when making words.  The upper left corner has the letter used in upper case; the lower left has the other letter in lower case, so you can tell whether you want to reverse the card to use the other letter.  The game also includes four two-piece foot-long wooden racks to hold cards.&#10;&#10;There are enough cards that the instructions say don't bother shuffling.  Deal 15 each, and players have 3 minutes to form them into words.  In a turn a player draws 1 from the top of the draw or discard pile, and discards 1 unless they go out.  A player goes out by making all 16 cards into words of 2 or more letters; any player may claim the top discard out of turn if they can use it to go out.  When a player goes out, the hand ends and others have 3 minutes to make the cards they have into words.&#10;&#10;Words are scored according to length: 2-3 letters gets 1 point; 4 gets 2; 5/4; 6/7; 7/11; 8/16; 9/22; 10/30; 11/40; 12/52; 13/68; 14/90; 15-16/120.  The one who goes out gets a 30 point bonus if they go out with 1 word; 20 with 2 words; 10 with 3 words.  If a word has 3 or 4 letters (e.g. paraLLeL, SciSSorS), it gets a 15 or 25 point bonus respectively.  Two-word couplets that are grammatically correct (&quot;spring flowers&quot;) get a 10-point bonus.  Play an agreed number of rounds, and the high total wins.&#10;&#10;The rules say you can register the game and get rules for the advanced game Academie Royal.  They also say this is &quot;Part I of the Cavendish Academie System&quot;; I don't know if other parts were published.&#10;&#10;",

Several outer spaces affect the player's next turn (roll &amp; move twice, choose which direction to go, etc.)&#10;&#10;Each player also has an inner path, whose steps are labeled with important spiritual steps (baptism, confirmation, temple marriage, enduring to the end) toward the center (heaven).  Their Celestial Marker is placed on the first step when the pawn lands on a colored space; each step after that comes from turning in 2 bonus tokens, which are earned by landing on a corner space.  The first player to the center wins.&#10;&#10;Options are also described for cooperative play, team play, activities, chance cards, etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A different sort of word card game, where word fragments are combined in a search for valid English words.&#10;&#10;It contains a deck of about 60 orange cards, each with 1-3 letters that start a word; and about 120 yellow cards, each with 2-4 letters for the end of a word.  When an orange card is placed atop and at right angles to a yellow card, the letters combine to form a potential word.&#10;&#10;In the main game, players are each dealt 2 yellow cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 orange card from the draw or discard pile, and lays it on each of his yellow cards, pronouncing the &quot;word&quot; aloud.  Each yellow card that is part of a real word is turned down and saved, and replaced from the yellow deck; finally the orange card is discarded.  At the end of the game, the player with the most won yellow cards wins.  Players may be challenged if they fail to speak a word aloud, pronounce it wrong, or declare a nonexistent word; the loser of a challenge gives the winner one of his won yellow cards.&#10;&#10;In the Tic-Tac-Toe game, 9 yellow cards are dealt into a 3x3 array.  In a turn a player draws 1 orange card and lays it on an empty yellow card to form a word, placing one of his tokens on it; if it cannot be placed to make a real word, it's discarded.  A player wins on getting 3 tokens in a row; then the cards are discarded and a new yellow array is dealt.  Presumably, play continues until a certain number of games is won or time is expired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A unique game of guessing a hidden word.  There is a deck of 52 Letter Cards -- 2 of each letter, except 1 J and Q, 3 As and Es.  On the front it has the letter and its value (1-5), and on the back it has its value and all letters of that value: &#10;1 - AEIOU&#10;2 - HLNRY&#10;3 - CSTVX&#10;4 - BDFGZ&#10;5 - JKMPQW&#10;There are also 7 Clue Cards - &quot;1st Letter&quot; thru &quot;6th Letter&quot;, and &quot;Any Letter&quot;.  The game board has 6 spaces for cards with an elastic to hold them in place, and a scoring dial.&#10;&#10;A dealer is chosen, who thinks of a word of 4-6 letters, takes the Letter Cards that spell it, and places them face down under the elastics, showing the points and possible letters of each.  The Crypt-O Number for the word -- twice the sum of its letter values -- is set on the dial.  Each other player is dealt a random Clue Card.&#10;&#10;In a turn, a player either: asks a general yes/no question, asks a yes/no letter question (&quot;is the 4th letter R?&quot;), guesses the word, or gives the dealer his Clue Card and peeks at the front of the card indicated.  The turn continues until a &quot;no&quot; is received or the Clue Card is used.  Whatever the answer, for each question the scoring wheel is decreased: for a general question, 1; for a letter question, the letter's value; for a wrong word guess, 2.&#10;&#10;If a letter is guessed it is turned face-up; if the word is guessed or the last card expose, the round ends.  To score, if the word wasn't guessed, the dealer scores its Crypt-O value, other wise the guesser gets the value on the scoring wheel and the dealer gets the Crypt-O value minus that amount; and each player gets 5 points for each Clue Card they hold.  If the word is unknown to half or more of the players, the round doesn't count.&#10;&#10;Rotate the dealer with each round; the game is won by the player who first hits 150 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;During the late 1800s, two emerging industrial powers began to build large modern fleets: the United States and Germany. Perhaps inevitably, tensions rose between them. Each entered the imperialist race very late and had to content itself with the leftovers which the British and French had passed by. When the United States seized Spain&rsquo;s colonial empire in 1898, German jealousy raged hotly. Some German business leaders lusted for the Philippines and Puerto Rico, urging the Kaiser to purchase them from the Spanish before the war ended, or from the Americans afterwards.&#10;&#10;German and American squadrons did not, as legend has it, almost come to blows in Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War &mdash; the British spread that story, eager to cultivate American public opinion. But the German and American admirals on the scene did cultivate an intense dislike for one another, and the feelings spread to the top on both sides.&#10;&#10;Black Waters is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on American plans to fight Germany. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, but some actions are also placed in European waters.&#10;&#10;There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Black.  The Americans get ships ranging from three examples of the South Dakota class through the first American dreadnoughts, the South Carolina class, and the last of the American pre-dreadnoughts, the Connecticut class. There are also a pair of light carriers based on American plans to convert big armored cruisers.&#10;&#10;The Germans add three of the GK4531 battle cruiser design and three representatives of the GK4251 battleship. And of course Germany receives an aircraft carrier, the proposed conversion of the huge liner Imperator. Argentina and Brazil receive part of their fleets, and there are two hypothetical Mexican battleships and small contingents from the Netherlands, Venezuela and Colombia.&#10;&#10;There are over two dozen new scenarios, including the &quot;War Plan Silver&quot; subset based on Woodrow Wilson's very serious threat to go to war with Italy in May 1919, plus revised versions of most of those originally seen in Plan Black.&#10;&#10;This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to play most of the scenarios and Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Red to play all of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sun &amp; Moon is a building game designed for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  It is for two teams of 1, 2, or 3 players (in other words, it's a game specifically for 2, 4, or 6 players).  One team represents the sun cult (orange); the other, the moon cult (black).  The players sit around the table such that the turns will alternate between teams.  With the board set up using bars to divide the outer ring into quarters, and one druid in each of 5 colors on the outer ring, players take turns moving druids and taking actions based upon the movement.  All the druids start out in the building quarter, where the various enormous stones of the trilithons are available for construction, but must make laps of the outer ring in order to collect the energy to build the magnificent Stonehenge.&#10;&#10;You may move a druid from a quadrant to the building quarter, spending one card of its color for each quadrant it moves, and one card of its color for each existing stone in his color's trilithon (black cards are wild).  This builds a piece of that trilithon, and scores your team a point.  You may overpay in order to get extra points.&#10;Alternatively, if you move a druid from one quadrant to the next, you draw two cards, keeping one in your hand, and putting the other face-up in front of you.&#10;&#10;If you build on a trilithon, you automatically use any appropriate cards your team has face-up on the table.  This also discards any cards of the trilithon's color the opposing team has on the table.  Additionally, each team has a secret trilithon bonus card:  Once that trilithon is complete, that team gets an extra two points.&#10;&#10;Sun &amp; Moon is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Each card is assigned a specific color and action.  Using a rainbow color range, the number of cards available for each color diminishes as you go from red to violet (red being the most common and violet being the rarest).  Players must play the action of one card on their turn, balancing the need to keep rare colored cards with the need to use the abilities those cards possess when played.  The rarer a color is, the more powerful its action will typically be.  When a player collects a set of cards, they call &ldquo;Shenanigans&rdquo; and score a point.  The first player to call &ldquo;Shenanigans&rdquo; three times wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trivia game on the occasion of the 1200th birthday of the city of M&uuml;nster/Westfalia in Germany coupled with the occasions of the 300th birthday of Johann Conrad Schlaunn, the 200th birthday of Annette von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff and the 350 years of Westfalian Peace. The game was published by an insurance company for that occasion.&#10;The game comes with a board which has two different prints on both sides several colour coded memory cards depicting events of the city history, pawns, dice and a rule book.&#10;The game allows for four different variations. Two of them are roll and move while the other two require knowledge of the city history.&#10;Variant 1: The players alternate in rolling dice. If they can exactly move their pawn on a field featuring the same colour as the topmost of the cards they can gain it. Whoever has the most at the games end wins.&#10;Variant 2: A team game. Two players each play together. Unlike variant 1 it is only allowed to move one space. The rules for collecting are the same. One team wins if they have six of a colour.&#10;Variant 3: Like variant 2 but you only get the card if you can answer the question printed on the backside.&#10;Variant 4: Not really a competitive game. On the backside of the board are squares to hold each memory card. The cards are randomly shuffled into the squares and the players alternate in trying to put the right card into the right square until all cards are sorted.&#10;&#10;",

The duration of the game can be up to 4 hours, but there are also shorter versions, for example Russian empire against Austria-Hungary for 2 players (cca. 45 minutes).&#10;Die is used for fighting, but bonuses can be added to the number rolled on die if you: have a double number of units in a fight, have surrounded your enemy, have modernized your units, have used a tactical advantage card&hellip;&#10;You can buy infantry, ships, planes, harbours... &#10;Both sides draw event cards in every round &ndash; Russian winter, famine, the possibility to get some neutral country to fight on your side, American intervention etc.&#10;There is the factor of luck in the game, but hey, it adds to the excitement!&#10;&#10;Go and let the best one win!&#10;&#10;",

New US, German, and Italian units represent the full historic strength of the fighting forces that struggled for control of the mountains Samb&uacute;caro, Lungo, and Rotondo, and the small village of San Pietro Infine located in the foothills of Monte Samb&uacute;caro.&#10;&#10;Collins Epic Wargames is working with artist Mark Mahaffey to produce a functional and beautiful large, mounted 32&quot;x27&quot; full color map at a scale of 1&quot;=500'.  Each 1.2&quot; hex represents 200 yards with platoons and sections as the basic maneuver units.  All terrain modifiers are conveniently printed right in the hex to provide even more terrain representation flexibility and ease of reference during the game.  Large 7/8&quot; counters are easy to read and pair one for one with the game&rsquo;s Unit Cards - Cards that handle all of the important combat and maneuver stats, track earned experience, and provide a step-loss reduction to easily track damage.&#10;&#10;",
