However, the young pirates can&rsquo;t approach the island directly by boat, because the surrounding sea is too rough and dangerous &ndash; and they would all get seasick! Then they have the idea of building a bridge. This will help them reach their goal in safety, even though the big waves make building difficult. Keep a cool head and use your building skills, and your pirate may be the first to make a stable bridge which he can cross to reach the island and find the treasure.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to throw the symbol dice and gradually construct a bridge with the pieces thrown. The first player to finish building a complete bridge to the small island is allowed to cross it straight away and dig up the treasure.&#10;&#10;The parent/teacher takes a &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; (e.g. a couple jelly bears, or a little treasure chest) and hides it under the palm tree.&#10;&#10;",

The custom components in the deluxe edition replace the standard components from the retail edition.]&#10;&#10;Setting:&#10;Coloma is the town where an unexpected event happened that shaped history of the Western Frontier. In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below. Sure enough, it was gold! Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of &lsquo;49.&#10;&#10;Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land&rsquo;s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!&#10;&#10;In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently travelled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone&mdash;every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them...&#10;&#10;Overview of Play:&#10;At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust&mdash;which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated&mdash;slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.&#10;&#10;When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monster is a gambling game in which the best&#10;hand must defeat the Monster, a hand made&#10;from everyone&rsquo;s discards.&#10;&#10;Equipment: &#10;A Pairs deck.  A button for indicating the&#10;dealer, and chips for keeping score.&#10;&#10;To Begin: &#10;   Start by paying an ante into the pot. If you have 4 or 5 players, the ante is 2 chips. With 6 to 8 players, the ante is 1 chip.  &#10;   Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. The player on the dealer&rsquo;s left will act first. (Move the dealer button only after a full game, i.e., after the pot clears.)&#10;   Each player acts once, in turn. On your turn, you may discard zero to three cards, or fold. You are not allowed to keep a hand that includes a pair; if this is your only choice, you must fold.  You may want to fold some other hands as well,&#10;depending on circumstances&#10;   Your discards go facedown into a pile in the middle, which becomes the Monster&rsquo;s hand. Folded cards do not go to the Monster; they go completely out of play. Note: This is not draw poker. Your discarded cards are not replaced!&#10;&#10;The Showdown: &#10;After each player on the next page) becomes the &ldquo;Champion,&rdquo; and&#10;must compare hands with the Monster. When the Champion faces the Monster,he must defeat it in order to take the pot. The&#10;Monster wins ties.&#10;&#10;If the Champion loses (or ties), he pays 5 chips to the pot and is knocked out of the game.&#10;&#10;Definition of High Hand: &#10;Any player hand that contains a pair is a losing hand, and&#10;can&rsquo;t be kept for the showdown. All hands in the showdown will be compared by highest card, then second highest card, and so on. The best player hand is 10-9-8-7-6-5. A card is better than nothing, so a hand of 10-8-7-4 is better than 10-8-7.  This is similar to comparing poker hands for high card, except that there is no limit on the number of cards that can play. The Monster uses the same rules, but it ignores duplicate cards. Treat the Monster as if it had only one card of each rank.&#10;&#10;Winning: &#10;To win the pot, you must become the Champion and defeat the monster. If no one wins, play another round with only the&#10;surviving players. Players who folded, or who lost a fight with the Monster, are out. All cards are reshuffled in the next round&#10;(the Monster does not keep its cards).&#10;&#10;Oddities: If one player is left, he automatically wins. If zero players are left, either because they all had to fold, or because the last player couldn&rsquo;t defeat his own discards, then play again with the same players who started the round.&#10;&#10;Ties: &#10;If two Champions win with exactly the same hand, they split the pot. If two Champions have the same hand but lose to the Monster, they must each drop out and pay the 5 chip penalty, unless they are the only two players remaining, in which case they pay 5 chips but play another round.&#10;&#10;Strategy: In the first few rounds, you may want to &ldquo;duck,&rdquo; playing low hands and trying not to become the Champion. As players leave the game, it becomes easier to defeat the Monster, because it is getting fewer cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Slasher Movie can be scary, ridiculous, gory, trashy, witty social commentary or just dumb fun.  SLASHR is a fast playing, free wheeling Slasher Movie emulator captured in 9 simple playing cards.&#10;&#10;Before starting play, make sure that you set the rating for this movie (a PG-13 game is very different than the Hard R version).  If we are okay with our movie getting a hard R Rating, make sure that the players are all comfortable with that.  You may want to check out some standard RPG safety mechanics - such as an X-CARD.&#10;&#10;Have everyone sit around a circle.  Take your SLASHR deck, shuffle it, and put it in the middle of the area you are playing, in easy reach for all the players.  If you really want to get in the mood, service some greasy popcorn, turn the lights down and sing &quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&quot;.&#10;&#10;As a group, come up with a setting for a 1980s-style exploitation flick.  Once you have a setting, settle on a title for the film.  The setting and title are going to really lock down what the players do over the course of the movie.&#10;&#10;The first player is the last person to have seen a horror movie.  They begin the game by introducing themselves (their actual self) as starring as a character in the movie.  So, for instance, let's say that we are playing a movie called Unholy Pigskin (a PG-13 slasher about a High School Football team full of vampires.  You would say something like, &quot;Starring Chris O'Neill as Head Coach N. Romancer&quot;. Then have the next player in the circule introduce themselves and so on, until everyone has been introduced.&#10;&#10;Each player will then take a turn creating a scene in the Movie.  The most important thing to remember is that you are SETTING UP A SCENE - not resolving it.  To properly set up a scene, it should involve your character, at least one other character, and a location. These two players should both want something, or need an answer to a question.  This simple mechanic should drive us immediately into action.  &quot;Okay, so the Cheerleader and I are having a fight in the parking lot about leaving town.&quot;&#10;&#10;When the scene starts, the players can start role-playing their characters, or narrating activity in the scene.  Anyone that is not directly involved in the scene acts as additional &quot;uncredited&quot; characters and background effects.&#10;&#10;When one of the following happens, ANY PLAYER should yell CUT!&#10;&#10;     A Character is about to get the thing they want.&#10;     A Character is about to get the answer to a question.&#10;     Anything stupid, weird, or dangerous occurs.&#10;     Things are getting slow or boring in any way.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whenever someone yells CUT! the active player takes the SLASHR deck, cuts it, and flips over the top card.  Depending on the card, the scene is then resolved in a specific way.  After resolving the scene, shuffle the deck and play passes to the next player clockwise.&#10;&#10;FEAR, LUST, LIES, GREED, or STUPIDITY(THE RED CARDS) If the player cuts to a RED CARD, they resolve the scene in their favor using the prompt on the card, then return that card to the deck.&#10;&#10;MURDERED (BLACK CARDS)&#10;When you pull a BLACK CARD, you got Murdered.  In the game, this means that this scene - no matter what it was about - ends in your grisly murder at the hands of the SLASHR KILLR.  Only the ACTIVE PLAYER dies, and they always get to narrate their own death!  If the Slasher has not been revealed yet, the death should be laden with mystery.&#10;&#10;When you die, you flip over the remaining cards in the SLASHR deck and take one of the 5 RED CARDS out (Fear, Lust, Lies, Greed, and Stupidity) and plays it face up in front of them.&#10;&#10;When your character has been eliminated, you are still playing.  If it becomes your turn again, instead of setting up a scene with your character - you set up and narrate a quick scene using your prompt as inspiration.  You are encouraged to be the unnamed people in the other player's scenes in the movie, to add narration, to make sound effects, and to shout encouragement from your theater seats.&#10;&#10;Don't forget to put the BLACK CARD back into the deck.&#10;&#10;DON'T TURN AROUND&#10;If the player cuts to DON'T TURN AROUND, they have a brush with Death, but don't die.  Early on in the game, when this happens - the player should narrate their &quot;jump scare&quot; or &quot;cheap heat&quot; moment - cats jumping out, car crashes, kids pretending to be the murderer, etc.&#10;&#10;After the SLASHR is in play, this card should always result in a near death experience with the SLASHR KILLR.  Put the card back in the deck.&#10;&#10;SLASHR&#10;When you flip the SLASHR card - you are the SLASHR.  You should resolve the scene as the SLASHR, revealing your identity and motive.  You get to resolve the scene in your favor - but as your can only die when you are the active player, your opponent in the scene does not get killed.&#10;&#10;YOUR INEVITABLE GRISLY DEATH&#10;As you play, you will be removing cards form the deck, and making it MORE LIKELY that the next player is going to die. With either (a) the deck runs out of RED Cards, or (b) there is only the SLASHR. and one other person alive; the game ends.  Each player that was eliminated during the game gets a chance to &quot;pitch&quot; the ending of the movie to the remaining player(s).  The ending should involved the survivors defeating the SLASHR or getting away.  Afterwards, the SLASHRget to add a &quot;sequel clause&quot; scene where they show how they actually survived for the next movie.&#10;&#10;",

The King&rsquo;s Landing cycle takes a new approach to the Game of Thrones LCG. Rather than following the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire, this cycle is centered around the capital of Westeros, allowing you to explore the world of Westeros more freely than ever before.&#10;&#10;Your journey begins at the great wall that surrounds the capital city. Aegon I Targaryen had seven gates built as the entrances to his grand metropolis in honor or the number sacred to the Faith of the Seven. Now in At the Gates, the great Houses of Westeros gain access to these blessed locations. Each gate is a low-cost location that can provide you with income from their tolls and the chance to sacrifice them in exchange for two draws if you embrace the spirit of your chosen House. Additionally, this Chapter Pack features new versions of beloved characters, embracing the plots and deadly intrigues of A Song of Ice and Fire with the continuation of the shadow keyword, first reintroduced in the Dance of Shadows cycle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Luckily, some local friends can help!&#10;&#10;Mr. Fox-It, Po &amp; Lars Construction, Hoof's Roofs and The Iceburgh Sealers are ready to use their savvy building skills to turn ice and wood into new buildings to improve the town and show off the ICEBURGH to the world!&#10;&#10;Welcome to Iceburgh is a 2-4 player resource management game where players gain water, wood and coins to upgrade buildings in the town of Iceburgh for victory points.&#10;&#10;The game is made up of 15 iceberg tiles that are put into a 4 x 4 grid with 1 space left open.  A boat tile goes in that empty space and each player puts one of their work meeple onto the boat.&#10;&#10;Over 12 rounds players will rotate as first player which allows them to move the boat either horizontally or vertically along the grid, shifting the icebergs when them move the boat.&#10;&#10;Each iceberg has an action that a player can choose to take to help them gain or convert their resources as needed.  If a player has enough resources they may upgrade one of the current buildings on the icebergs to gain points. They do this on their turn by choosing the upgrade action or by upgrading a building adjacent to the boat by paying the appropriate cost (combination of water, wood and coins). Then the player will flip that iceberg over to show the upgraded building and new actions available.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player at the end of 12 rounds with the most victory points and they will get the KEY TO ICEBURGH!&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But if you come from the sea and traverse the white beach below the promontory, where mysterious sea creatures are said to gather, the rumors say that a Passage to the fabulous mansion can be found.&#10;It is time to put into practice your experience as explorers, to unveil the secrets of Mount Circeo and enter the palace and find out if the legends that say it is still inhabited by the mysterious sorceress Circe and her servants are true. Be careful, Scholars, because if you encounter the sorceress, you will have to resist her devious spells, capable of turning her enemies into servant animals for all eternity!&#10;&#10;You are the ideal candidates for this job, so get going, and do not disappoint the expectations of Rocca Civetta. Set on the slopes of Mount Circeo, this Dungeonology expansion will lead you to unveil the secrets of the immortal sorceress Circe. You are going to face a thousand dangers: the sorceress will try to turn you into one of her sevant animals, her servants themselves will jealously guard the secrets of Circeo, the Leonine Guards of the palace will always be on your trail, and, if you aren't carefull, you may find yourself facing Circe's terrible pet Kraken!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But, they must be aware of their opponents' weapons and build their defences appropriately.&#10;&#10;Death Rabbits also contains 5 Booster cards which come into play later in the game, giving the clans additional powers that enhance their attack, defence or movement abilities.&#10;&#10;The last clan with Rabbits alive rules the world!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Circus Corgis is a Trick-Taking, Treat eating, Star Bidding, low rider game for all levels! &#10;Once cards are dealt, players bid on how many tricks they&rsquo;ll win. The more specific you are with your prediction, the greater the reward. Earn Treats to incentivize your pups and play the higher value of a card. Earn 5 Trophies to win!! &#10;Outbid and out-trick your opponents, and put on the most spectacular show in Circus Corgis!&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 9 cards, then bid on how many Stars (or tricks) they will win.  &#10;In turn order, each player plays a corgi. They may play a Treat to play that card's higher value. Players must follow suit and play the same color as the starting card. When all players have played a card, the highest card wins a star. Play continues until all cards have been played. &#10;When the round is finished, each player assesses if they have successfully achieved their bid. If so, they take the corresponding rewards: treats and trophies. If they over bid or under bid, they do not receive any points. &#10;The game ends when one player earns a total of 5 points!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Museum Director just jumped ship, leaving behind an enormous hidden deficit.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s up to you and your fellow curators to increase visitor attendance and keep the museum running. To do this, you must present grandiose exhibitions that will attract crowds of visitors and fill the museum coffers to save the institution from financial ruin.&#10;&#10;The curator with the most popular exhibitions will become the new Museum Director!&#10;&#10;In the beginning every player has got a couple of art (painting) cards and also a couple of (secret) exhibition cards as goals to complete collections. Every exhibition card consist of art cards, but there are a lot of paintings that belong to more exhibitions. If a player collects every card of her/his exhibition card she/he gets more victory points than the independent cards have. &#10;To collect cards players have to roll dice and move pawns, they can get cards (art or exhibition) in various forms, they can steel from each other, they can answer trivia about the paintings. At the end of the game the player with the most victory point wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
