    "Description": "-Abundance Through Play-&#10;&#10;Lark is a party game for venturesome people. Players challenge each other to get out of their comfort zones in fun and affirming ways using challenge prompt cards and the roll of a 12-sided die.&#10;&#10;How to play: Players all draw four cards. One Player (the Dealer) chooses a prompt from her cards or makes up her own for one or more Players and assigns the odds of it happening using the 12-sided die. If Players consent to the challenge and odds, the Dealer rolls the die and the play either commences or not. Regardless of the outcome, the Player who accepted the challenge becomes the new Dealer. Discard and draw a new card when you've played both prompts on your card. Play Wild Cards when it suits you. Incorporate as many variations and inspirations as you like. Be adventurous. Be good to each other. Dealers can prompt one or every play with every turn, including themselves.&#10;&#10;On winning and losing: Traditionally, the gameplay is not competitive. However, for those who like the added tension, players can win by collecting points for consenting to a proposal IF and  ONLY IF they are not then required to perform the feat based on the role of the die. The first player to 15 points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The ticking clock will be a very important factor to add excitement and fun!&#10;&#10;Olivia and Cukito's adventure is the ninth title that we have produced from El Espejo, and it is of great importance to us as it is our first specifically cooperative proposal. It is an invitation to the game for early childhood, with a neighborhood theme where we seek to work on the issue of waste, trying to problematize the idea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&quot;individual environmentalism&quot; (see section), emphasizing the importance of cooperative work and proposing as a challenge build works or &quot;manufacturable&quot; objects from said waste. With the premise of promoting group work, throughout the game the challenges intensify in difficulty and in the forms of communication between the players.&#10;&#10;Olivia, along with Cukito and her friends, are thinking about what to do with so much waste that is scattered around their neighborhood. It occurred to them to put together Projects to recycle, turning some waste into useful objects or reusing them in different ways. To achieve this, they must move at full speed, locker by locker, lifting those elements that serve to complete the projects.&#10;&#10;",

Players build up a tableau of cards and send units across to fight the opponent and capture their castle.&#10;&#10;The designer likens the strategy to Shogi, in that a player must be careful which units are deployed and how they attack with a longer view to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards and lays out a castle at the back of their tableau, and a forest at the front of the tableau. There is an empty row between the two cards, and two empty spaces either side (so the tableau is 5 wide by 3 deep).&#10;&#10;Each player draws cards and plays them to their tableau. Buildings go to the back row and generate military units. These can advance and attack in different patterns. So one unit might advance like a pawn, another like a knight in Chess. A player wins by successfully attacking the opponents castle.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The Wider World expansion adds four more A2 sized maps for Maritime Europe, Latin America, North America, and India, plus extensive named naval units, and numerous colonial units. The Wider World expansion adds naval rules including rules for movement between theatres of war. For the most ambitious players the expansion also includes the Global Grand Campaign that stitches together all theatres of war providing the ultimate bird&rsquo;s eye view of a world at war.&#10;&#10;",

It shows the fate of homeless dogs, both those living on the street and those that ended up in animal shelters. &#10;A dog running in the streets may be caught by the guards. By throwing the dice, we check if he has a chip with an address. If he has, he goes to the owner. If not, he ends up in a shelter. A homeless dog can also run into a car, and then goes to the vet for treatment. If he has a chip, it returns to the owner, if not, he goes to the shelter. The dice rolls decide about the events. Someone can come to the shelter to get the dog. A dog from a shelter can also appear on television and attract attention so that someone adopts he.&#10;The winner is the player whose first four dogs (pawns) find a home.&#10;&#10;The game is co-financed by the &quot;Program for the care of homeless animals and prevention of animal homelessness in the capital city of Warsaw&quot; prepared by the Environmental Protection Office of the Warsaw City Hall.&#10;&#10;",

Care must be taken as overworking and accumulating waste will damage the restaurant's reputation, resulting in loss of ratings and dismissal of staff.&#10;&#10;In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to hire management staff to dispose of waste and keep the store clean.&#10;&#10;",

When they play, there is room for creating their own stories.&#10;&#10;The folder is laminated on 2 mm thick cardboard and has a size of 98 x 34 cm when fully unfolded. The package includes a bag with a wooden cube and 4 figures and a set of chips made of hard cardboard.&#10;&#10;The Poaching Game is a cooperative game where a team plays against poachers who steal animals. The goal is to secure a given number of animals on all continents and free the stolen animals from poachers. Players travel the world and save an animal when they enter a field with the particular animal. However, there are also hordes of poachers on the route, over which you have to win in dice fights, otherwise the animal will go into captivity. The tension in the game can be increased by putting more animals in captivity at the beginning. The game plan with the animals is set in a real map, so non-violent learning about the continents and their animals is ensured.&#10;&#10;The Bird Game is a contribution to refreshing our birds knowledge. Players travel in concentric circles to a nest. You overcome cats in battles and run away from a storm, hawk or ornithologist. To enter the next circle, the player must collect 4 tokens, which you get when entering the squares with birds.&#10;&#10;In Evolution, players run freely around the game board and on evolutionary accelerators you gain and exchange different parts of the body in exchange offices. The goal is to collect the body parts for the animal you choose and bring it to its field. At the end of the game you have the honor to describe or draw a monster in which you would evolve using all the body parts you have collected.&#10;&#10;Crazy Animals is a simple game in which children compose torn sentences about animals in Czech and English. This is how sentences like &quot;I am a green giraffe singing in the fridge&quot; are created.&#10;&#10;",

There are a ton of unique mechanics, including:&#10;&#10;- Ascension (with use of our &quot;Evoval&quot; (or evolution value) concept)&#10;- Soul tokens (living shields)&#10;- Crystal progression system&#10;&#10;Lore:&#10;Within Omni, a realm of constant flux, there stand massive Relics of unknown origin. These Monoliths, the Gate Crystals, are the source of all existence in Omni. From them, Souls manifest and engage in battle for complete omnipotence. Enhance your Souls with Quirks which provide unique abilities and allow them to ascend into Entities of considerable power. Change the tides of battle with Events that become reality through the magic of these Crystals. Be wary! When one of these great Monoliths shatters, the gate of creation closes with it. Wage war against other crystal wielders; use your mighty Gate Crystals and their adaptable creations to claim Omni for your own!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Game starts with players selecting a Soul from their Existence deck (or &quot;Monster&quot; pool) to begin the battle, placing one crystal on their board, and drawing three cards from their Standard deck (Event and Quirk deck). During a player's turn, they can improve their Souls by equipping Quirks and eventually Ascending them into Entities; this is done by meeting the required EvoVal points for the Entity chosen (determined by Quirks' cumulative EvoVals). Players may also play &quot;Stabilizers&quot; or &quot;Destabilizers&quot; (Omni's equivalent to &quot;Spells and Traps&quot;) that will have an immediate impact on the gameplay. There are no &quot;Deck Outs&quot; in Omni - simply reshuffle the Standard deck and continue play. Once all of a player's Crystals or Souls are destroyed, they have lost the game!&#10;&#10;",

This card determines the capacity of each area for placing meeples, based on the number of players and shows the events of the beginning of the year and the end of the year, based on the rainfall amount. &#10;Each game may be played in several years so be prepared for any upcoming events!&#10;&#10;Blue meeples can only be placed in Planting and Floriculture areas and the Green ones can only be placed in Extracting and Technology Areas. Pink meeples are the most valuable meeples; You can place them in any area (even ignoring that area&rsquo;s capacity) and use them to obtain Event cards so take care of them!&#10;&#10;After all players placed their meeples on the board, you should do the actions of the different areas by removing the meeples from the board and placing them in Resting Space.&#10;&#10;Expand your farm and obtain the needed resources (Water, Light and Fertilizer) to have the best harvest. The Lands with special powers need more resources but help your achieve the products sooner.&#10;&#10;Cultivate Saplings and harvest your lands and produce the best Damask-Rose products. You can develop your technology and gain new facilities, paying its price!&#10;&#10;After all actions were resolved, take the meeples from the Resting Area as you wish and depending on your strategy, in clockwise order, starting with the First Player. Your choices would affect the others&rsquo; play!&#10;&#10;As a beginner, you can play Varda without the Event cards which give you combinatory actions and special abilities and add them to the game only when you got enough experiences!&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who can produce the best and more precious Golab and Essences before the rivals, develop their technology more than the rivals and reach their goals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to knock the other player&rsquo;s health points to zero through clever card combinations, while simultaneously preventing your own defeat by planning tactical defensive moves.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is divided into two major phases. The planning phase sees players laying out their actions for the turn, which represent attacks and blocks that the players will perform. The resolution phase has players rolling combinations of dice as dictated by the cards they played in the planning phase in order to determine what attacks hit or miss, and what damage (if any) is dealt or avoided.&#10;&#10;The starter set includes: Volcanic Warrior &amp; Shadow Assassin.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most points win.

    "Description": "Kellia is a cooperative strategy game for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Players work together to survive in the Egyptian desert and build their hermitages (kellia). Every turn, they start from their kellion (singular of kellia) at the edge of the board and wander into the desert to explore, build, and gather food and water to survive the night.&#10;&#10;The turns have two phases: day and night. Each day, players have three actions, which they can use to move to an adjacent square (and reveal it, if it is face-down), get 'attention to nature' cubes by contemplating the desert, or spend cubes to either build their kellion, improve a resource square or construct a building or resource in the desert. Furthermore, they can exchange cubes with other players they meet or end their turn prematurely by begging for food or water at the church in the center of the board. Players can buy additional three actions by spending an 'inner life' cube. Due to the limited number of actions, turns have to be as well planned in advance as is possible with the hidden information.&#10;&#10;During the night, players gain 'inner life' cubes and have to give away food and water. The players often need to cooperate: if one player fails to end the day with at least 1 food and 1 water, the game is lost for everybody. Before the next day starts, an incidence card affects the game: either a sand storm, famine or drought destroys or disables a part of the board, which is chosen randomly by rolling a dice, or bandits, fasting, or akedia affect the players.&#10;&#10;The game ends, if one player has no food or water during a night (lost), all players built their kellion and survive the following night (won), or the 9th, 10th, or 11th day is passed without everybody having built their kellion (lost, the number of days depends on the 'difficulty' option).&#10;&#10;Kellia is created and illustrated by the Brothers of the Taiz&eacute; Community, which is inspired by the lives of the desert fathers and mothers. It combines spirituality, mutual help, and ecology.&#10;&#10;",
