Here October 21, 1600 two samurai armies, more than 80,000 people each, met in the bloody battle. Tokugava Leyasu, an experienced general and politician, profited from the treason in the ranks of the enemy and defeated its troops thus stopping endless wars and establishing his shogunate in Japan.&#10;&#10;This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet in the plain between mountains. Tactic maneuverings are very important in the game. Under a skillful leader a smaller army can defeat an outnumbering enemy. You can either recreate the historic battle or change the course of the fight. Anyway you should rely not only on the number of your army but also on your leadership and war skills.&#10;&#10;Zvezda 8224&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pyramid (Battlestar Galactica) is a card game based on the 1970s television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. It was depicted as leisure activity for the characters in the television show. Later on, rules and decks of pyramid playing cards were made available commercially to fans of the show. Both are currently out of print.&#10;The game uses a 55 count deck of hexagonal cards separated into three kinds of suits and three ranks as well as a 'capstone' card which is used as a wild card. The game is played very similarly to poker. Players are dealt hands and place bets based on how strong their hand is. There is a discard between bets and players reveal their hands to determine the winner of that round.&#10;&#10;Winning hands are determined by a number of factors including suit, rank and matching sets. There are approximately fourteen different hand combinations possible in the game. There is no 'end' to the game, players merely quit at their leisure.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 55 hexagonal cards, which is divided into 3 suits: purple, green and orange. Purple ranks highest and orange ranks lowers. The deck also contains a Capstone (*).&#10;&#10;Each suit contains:&#10;- 3 First level cards&#10;- 6 Second level cards&#10;- 9 Third level cards&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Each player is dealt 6 cards. If a player feels a better hand is possible, he may discard up to 4 cards and receive replacements from the dealer. This may only be done once per hand, much the same as &quot;Draw Poker&quot;. Players then construct their best possible pyramid and compare to the other player hands to determine the winner.&#10;Ranks of Hands&#10;A pyramid is made up of at least three cards.&#10;&#10;1. First level pyramid consist of 2 third level, and 1 second level card.&#10;&#10;2. Second level pyramid consist of 3 third level, and 2 second level card.&#10;&#10;3. Third level pyramid consist of 3 third level, 2 second level cards, and 1 first level card.&#10;&#10;4. Any of the above may be considered &quot;perfect&quot; when all of the cards used are of the same color. (&quot;Perfect&quot; pyramids rank higher than non-perfect pyramids.)&#10;&#10;5. If two or more perfect pyramids are the same level, then the highest suit would win. (NOTE: Only perfect pyramids can be ranked by suit; non-perfect pyramids are considered to have no suit.)&#10;&#10;6. If two or more pyramids are still equal, then the persons play another hand to decide the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;    ) The Capstone can be used in place of the first level card in a Perfect third level pyramid. This is the highest of ALL PYRAMIDS!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        ) The Capstone may also be used as a wild card to replace any card in any pyramid.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taken from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;Played with gloriously illustrated Character and Prompt cards and a variety of quotations from Shakespeare.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a light game of memory and card collection requiring a familiarity with Shakespeare's plays.  It is best suited to play after a dinner party.  Match Prompt and Character cards to your Quotation cards to create sets.  The first to match all their cards into sets wins.  There are 30 sets.&#10;&#10;There are two levels of difficulty, which give different methods of play.&#10;&#10;The easy method requires players to complete a Shakespeare quote by filling in the missing word(s) on a Quote card, from a Prompt card and matching them to a Character card.  The mechanics of acquiring cards is similar to the children's card game Go Fish.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game the mechanics are similar to Happy Families but a good knowledge of Shakespeare is required to get you the cards you desire.  If attempting to obtain a Quote card from another player one has to recite the quote in full and be &quot;Dead Letter Perfect&quot;.&#10;&#10;In both types of game the mechanics may well be based on children's games, but it is unlikely to appeal to children due to the subject matter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The only tennis strategy game that plays like the real thing!&quot;&#10;&#10;A tennis simulation game, with different boards, but similar mechanics, for playing singles and doubles. The game is played on a board with 81 boxes on each side of the net, grouped in 9 sections. When you play a shot, you call the section (1-9) that you are aiming at, and then roll 2 D6 to see which box in that area it lands in (1, 12 = fault, 2-11 - numbered sectors). If the box is next to a line, 2D6 are rolled to see if the ball is called out. Players can only play a shot if they can move to the ball to play it. The number of boxes that you can move depends on the type of shot played by your opponent (volley, power shot, lob), and where on the court you are. You also can move some boxes after your shot to set for the next one.&#10;&#10;The rules do not specify what length of game, etc., to play. Presumably you would decide to play a set, or a tiebreak, or whatever, and use tennis scoring to decide who won.&#10;&#10;",

The Communist forces hoped a popular uprising by the &quot;oppressed&quot; people in South Vietnam would lead to a general uprising and overthrow of the &quot;puppet&quot; regime supported by the United States. &#10;The city of Hue was the only city to be completely occupied by the communist forces during the massive offensive, and was the scene of violent and close-quarter fighting that waged for nearly a month, from January 31st to February 25th, 1968. The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist's disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of &quot;collaborators&quot; after they took control. The fighting to retake control of the city and oust the NVA and VC devastated the city and Imperial Palace, symbolizing the tragic and confused nature of the war.&#10;&#10;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players will have capabilities to inflict harm upon their opponent, while also having liabilities to protect. Contestants will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Game Scale: The map scale is about 350-400 yards per inch. &#10;Each combat unit represents a platoon (25 to 30 men, 2 tanks or 6 APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers) and artillery batteries (M-109, Katyusha rockets, and mortars). &#10;A game turn represents 2-3 days of time.&#10;&#10;",

(They're even labeled 1-8 from outside to inside and a-h counterclockwise, and the rulebook calls them &quot;squares&quot; despite their curved shape.)&#10;&#10;The pieces are set up with one player on the outside of the circle facing in and the other in the center facing out (but otherwise exactly as in ordinary chess or checkers) and the rules of those games are unchanged except that file &quot;a&quot; and file &quot;h&quot; are considered adjacent for the purposes of movement.  This is equivalent to the variant in which pieces are allowed to move off the right side of a square chess board onto the left and vice versa, but on the round board all legally-adjacent spaces are also physically adjacent.&#10;&#10;From the designer's notes included with the game:&#10;&#10;&quot;An engineer by profession, I have always had a fascination with the game of chess.  As a member of my high school chess team, I played hooky from school to strengthen my game.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the 1960's the concept of a round board interested me as a novelty.  However, some 25 years later I made a serious study of that novelty and concluded that the round board is a major evolutionary advancement in the games of chess and checkers.  I hope you share my belief and enjoy your games on CHECKCHESS RoundBoard(TM).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A boxed set of cards used in three games intended to explain, and educate about, monetary and banking systems.&#10;&#10;The box contains two sets of cards - one set represents machine parts, the other bank notes - and score sheets.&#10;&#10;Both games are based around the premise of an engineer shipwrecked on an island - he has a limited source of gold.  The islanders have machine parts from an earlier shipwreck.&#10;&#10;In the first game one player represents the engineer and the others the islanders.  The engineer wants to buy machine parts (collect complete sets), but the cost of buying parts goes up the more he buys in one go from any one islander.  The islanders want to get as much of his money as they can, and one of them can win by 'breaking' the engineers bank by holding more notes than he can cover with his supply of gold.&#10;&#10;In the second game the islanders are purchasing goods produced by the engineer by bidding. In this game the engineer does not score, but merely acts as banker.  The winner is the islander who has managed to accumulate the most merchandise&#10;&#10;The third game represents an experiment by our one-time shipwrecked engineer, now financier.  He has a contract with the islanders by which he pays &pound;200.00 for a complete eneterprise (set of machine cards). To ensure that they can find and supply the complete enterprises to him he lends them money which they can use to bargain with amongst themselves.&#10;This game is meant to illustrate the mutual indebtedness which is the characteristic of banking, and involves considerable amounts of maths.&#10;&#10;The Money Game was first published in 1928 but Angell included a 1912 copyright in the game on the grounds that he had first conceived it before the war. The game was presented as a book with the the cards and money in boxed compartments at the back of the book. It included many quotes from people recommending it. Though Angell worked on the game subsequently he never published a subsequent version.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Triplexity, and its sisters Triple-Triplexity, Duple, Double-Duple, and Monotony, were created in 1984. The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.&#10;&#10;The designers describe the game:&#10;&#10;&quot;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):&#10;&#10;&quot;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies.&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries.&#10;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game.&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game.&#10;It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times.&#10;DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly.&#10;In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position.&#10;From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.  &#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!)&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play.&#10;In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years.&#10;Have fun.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance.&#10;After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid.&#10;The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now.&#10;So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Peter must enter at the gate, visit each of the twelve points (leaving a brass button behind to mark his visit), and then exit through the gate. He is pursued in this endeavor by Mr. McGregor who is restricted to moving on the garden pathways, unlike Peter. Mr. McGregor wins by catching Peter. Should Mr. McGregor choose to guard the gate rather than pursue Peter, an alternative escape route becomes available.&#10;&#10;The game includes copies of Potter's handwritten rules for the game (both original and revised) and her original letter to the publisher introducing and endorsing the game - all from 1904 - as well as a recreation of her 1893 letter to 5-year-old Noel Moore, in which she first told and drew &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This two player abstract strategy game is played on a standard eight by eight Chess board, though the board is oriented diagonally.  Each player is given an equal force of pieces in a different color -- five tall hexagonal Wall pieces, ten numbered Zin pieces (four 2's plus one of each of the other numbers between 1 and 7), and an unnumbered Rogue Zin piece.  All of the Zin pieces are portrayed as stacks of four hexagons of decreasing size.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture the opponent's 1-Zin piece.&#10;&#10;The board is set up with the player's numbered Zin pieces behind a row of five Walls, with the Rogue Zin to the player's left near the center of the board.  Players take turns moving one piece per turn, starting with the Black player.  All pieces move in a straight line through unoccupied spaces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Zin pieces may end their turn on top of Wall pieces.  The numbers on standard Zin pieces determine the maximum number of spaces that they may move.  Rogue Zins can move up to three spaces and have some special powers which make them more flexible than standard Zins.  Walls move only one space per turn, and only if they are unoccupied.&#10;&#10;Pieces are captured by being landed on by an opponent's piece.  Regular Zins may only capture opponents on the same or a lower plane (i.e. they can't capture an opponent on a wall if they are on the surface of the board).  Walls may be either captured or landed upon at the player's discretion.  They may also be promoted to other types of pieces of they reach the opponent's side of the board.  In capturing, as in movement, Rogue Zins have some special rules which make them more powerful than their standard counterparts.&#10;&#10;As a special gimmick, the game includes a special extra 1-Zin piece called a zinK featuring a serial number sticker on the bottom.  Players are encouraged to play special games where the winner keeps the opponent's zinK, with the ultimate goal to collect a zinK with as low a serial number as possible.&#10;&#10;",

The full deck is only required for a full complement of players.&#10;&#10;All players are dealt 4 cards, except the player to the dealer's left who receives 5 (the 'captain').  The clock is wound and held until the deal is completed; the timer is then released.  Cards are passed to the left on the direction of the captain until one player has four-of-a-kind; this player places their cards on the table.&#10;&#10;As soon as this happens, opponents do the same, regardless of cards held at the time.  This procedure mimics 'snap' and the player whose hand is on top also stops the clock timer and scores the amount indicated on the dial.&#10;&#10;When any one player reaches 25 points, the game is over.  The winner is the player with the lowest score at that time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Rackham's Website:&#10;&#10;Take a company&rsquo;s fate into your hands!&#10;&#10;This first extension for Confrontation 3 proposes a new gaming mode that introduces a new way of playing your favorite skirmish game. Indeed, it provides a method of creating a free company made up of fighters from the four corners of Aarklash to amass glory and riches. The rules on alliances must nevertheless be respected.&#10;&#10;This new gaming mode is based on the idea that the battles they wage have consequences on the soldiers and that these consequences cause an evolution of those they affect. Unlike the old Incarnation system, which was focused on a Character, it gives you the opportunity to unite different fighters, to personalize them and to let them evolve freely from one exciting skirmish scenario to the next. This new gaming mode makes the fun of a good game of Confrontation last well beyond each battle by involving recruiting, improving characteristics, abilities and equipment, managing the wounded and the fighters&rsquo; resources, etc.&#10;&#10;The young free companies will need new challenges. That&rsquo;s why this first extension provides enhanced rules on fortifications and scenery, as well as the revision of those on nexuses (see Cry Havoc, vol. 01).&#10;&#10;And this extension has many other surprises in store&hellip;&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Confrontation&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It derives its theme from the well-known (for Dutch and Flemish at least) children's book &quot;Pluk van de Petteflet&quot;, also known as &quot;Towtruck Pluck&quot; in English, by Dutch children's book writer Annie M.G. Schmidt. The players relive Pluk's adventures during the game.&#10;&#10;In essence it is a roll and move game: each in turn rolls a die and advances his pawn on the track. The winner is the first one to reach the finish. But to be allowed to finish, you must have the game token (Pluk's pigeon friend Dollie). That token is acquired by landing on spaces marked with a pigeon, or by landing next to the owner of the token.&#10;A few spaces on the board allow you to take another player's pawn and put it next to yours.&#10;&#10;The board is lavishly illustrated with scenes from the book.&#10;&#10;",

Your playing piece is one of 8 comically greedy cartoon characters with a single-minded desire for Pies.  With the clock ticking, the object of the game is to move your character out of the stadium, rush from Pie-stand to Pie-stand collecting as many Pies as possible and return with them to your seat before the time runs out.  But, along the way, there are a myriad of dirty tricks and hazards.  Elbow your opponents as you pass and make them drop their Pies!  Trip them up and make them miss a turn!  Make them slip on Banana Peels and make them drop a Pie AND miss a turn!!  Lock them out of turnstiles!  Lock them out of bathrooms!  And, of course, your opponents are going to try to do the same to you.  Plus, you&rsquo;ve got to be careful of those turnstiles &ndash; you and your Pies might not fit through them!  And, all the time, you&rsquo;ve got to watch out for those Pies &ndash; some of them are Dodgy Pies!

    "Description": "Portcullis features an upright wooden board shaped like a castle gate, which is very thick to prevent players from seeing each other&rsquo;s pieces before placed.  It has a 6x6 grid of holes into which 36 playing blocks&mdash;18 dark, 18 light&mdash;can be pushed.  There are two wooden trays for each player to sort their wooden playing blocks.  (When not in use, the pieces, trays, and board are all able to stack on top of each other for display.)  The blocks have one of four different flags painted on either end, always a different flag on each side for a total of six combinations of flags.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player must create a pattern of flags on his side, the shape of which is to be agreed upon before the game.  It can be a square shape (A) or a flag shape (B):&#10;&#10;AA&#10;AA&#10;&#10;B&#10;--BB&#10;B&#10;&#10;or&#10;&#10;---B&#10;BB&#10;---B&#10;&#10;Typically the flag shape is used, as it is harder to block.  A player&rsquo;s pattern may utilize flags from either player&rsquo;s pieces (the directions the flags point is of no consequence) and the pattern is not affected by any other flags in the board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns choosing their blocks in secret and placing them according to a key painted on the upper right hand corner of each side of the board, pointing the flag on the player&rsquo;s side according to the key in order to remember what flag is on the opposite side.  When either player sees a complete pattern on their own side, they turn the board and the game ends.  A draw can occur if all blocks are played with no pattern completed.  The rules provide for several variations that include bluffing, different goals, pushing blocks out, and different endings.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From BGN:&#10;&#10;Alchymia - La Qu&ecirc;te du Cristal Noir (The Quest for the Black Crystal) is a small print (500) game, self-published by Swiss designer Frank Schwab. The game accommodates 2-5 players and plays in roughly 30-60 min (my best guess). Images and rules (in French) are available at the Alchymia website.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a personal board and 3 potion cards and 8 atomic element tokens in 5 colors are placed in the central reserve. Each potion card depicts 1-4 atomic elements used to create the 5 Elemental Crystals (Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Time). Players attempt to collect and place the atomic element tokens on their board in such a way as to mimic the current configuration of one of the 5 crystals. They do this, in turn, by playing a potion card to retrieve an atomic element token of one of the types shown on the card from the central reserve and place it on their game board. They can also choose to remove an element token from their game board by playing a potion card with that element type. Alternatively, players can pass their turn by wiping their board clean of tokens.&#10;&#10;Once a player has matched a crystal configuration, they wipe their board of tokens, collect the crystal structure card they matched, reveal a new crystal configuration card and begin collecting beads for another type of crystal. The twist is that each type of crystal confers upon its owner an additional special power (for example, the Time Crystal allows you to rearrange your board during your turn, instead of taking or removing an element token). The first person to collect each of the 5 crystals becomes the master alchemist who can create the coveted Black Crystal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From BGN:&#10;&#10;Ergomia is a small French publisher of games that uses ergonomic comma-shaped cards. Their newest game, designed by Marcel Rigaut, is a kid&rsquo;s symbol matching game revolving around the animal food chain. Each card depicts an animal and the 1-3 things it likes to eat. Players can start a new food chain circle by playing a green card or they can add to an existing food chain circle by playing an orange or blue card with at least 1 matching food element to the adjacent card(s). The shape of the cards allows 8 cards to be played in a circle or &ldquo;rose&rdquo;. Whoever places the 8th card in a food chain circle gets to claim the set. Whoever claims the most sets is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
