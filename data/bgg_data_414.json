Each spot has a matching card which forms a pair; these cards are shuffled and form the draw pile for gameplay.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of drawing a card and finding the matching spot on the gameboard.  Unmatched cards are placed face up in front of the drawer until the appropriate match is made.  Cards may be taken either from the draw pile, from in front of an opponent or from in front of the drawing player.  The player with the most matching pairs when all spots have been removed from the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game has a garage theme tacked on rather loosely - the 'spots' are representative of spots found on a garage floor and many of the words on the discs relate to this theme - dirty spot, wet spot, danger spot, grease spot etc.  The gameboard is the garage floor.&#10;&#10;",

For each attempt a chip is paid, when the Guesser gets it correct, the Reader scores the chips paid, the Guesser scores the remainder.

The board has a scoring track and there is an element of beating the Guesser too.&#10;&#10;This Edition is especially for kids Ages 8 - 12.&#10;&#10;",

Each player, or &quot;Risk Manager&quot;,  starts out with $3,000,000.  Movement around the game board, via rolling of the die, allows for the opportunity to buy and sell insurance (certificate of insurance cards).  There are also spaces where an &quot;occurance&quot; ...umm, occurs.  At that time you take an &quot;occurance card&quot; whereupon one of your insureds has made a claim.  Hopefully you bought the right insurance and the &quot;occurance card&quot; does not affect you, otherwise you'll end up paying some of your (ahem) hard earned cash.  Play continues around an endless loop (similar to Monopoly, say).  Risk Managers decide at what point they choose to withdraw from the game, as the rules explain: &quot;when frustration level or boredom so indicates.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The players draw 5 cards each from the stack of 56 cards. On these cards are pictures of other shapes, created by the 5 cubes. If the player on turn thinks, he can rebuild the existing shape into one shape of the cards on his hand by moving only a single cube, he plays a card and tries it without turning the board and in a single trial. If he is not able to rebuild the shape, he has to draw one more card from the stack.&#10;&#10;The player who first gets rid of all his card, wins.&#10;&#10;There are different rules in the box, so you can vary from lighter gaming to more heavier: Without building over the border of the board, with penalty cards for mirror-shapes etc.&#10;&#10;Potzklotz is for children up from 7, but also for grown-ups.

During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, may conduct attacks with the units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.&#10;&#10;In this game, each turn represents between one week and one month, depending on the time of year, and each hexagon on the map represents 10 miles across. Units of maneuver for the US Army are primarily battalions, while Indian units are warbands, awarded one strength point for each 80 to 120 individuals within them.&#10;&#10;Low complexity, 280 counters.&#10;&#10;",

The main difference between the two editions is that the European interpretation is much more co-operative as a lot of the information is shared by all, making it a more open, but somehow also a faster and more atmospheric experience for all involved.&#10;&#10;Since there were only 10 solvable cases that came with the base game, it was inevitable that additional cases had to be published to keep its players' base entertained. Both publishers happily obliged, each releasing their own additional sets. Jumbo only released 5 extra cases that appeared in Dutch, French, Italian and German, meaning that not all of their European language editions saw additional cases beyond the initial 10. And like before, the murders are pretty tough cases to crack, as even with all the available information revealed, some educated guesses willstill have to be made by the competing sleuths.&#10;&#10;",

One of the piles is used as your hand.  The game is a slight variant on &quot;War&quot;... the active player chooses an opponent, they both lay down their cards, and the higher number wins.  There are a few cards that modify the number on your card, but that's really the only variation.&#10;&#10;The artwork on the cards is from the GI Joe Street Fighter line. Several characters look nothing like they do in the game (Ken in particular), and E. Honda's name is misspelled on the cards as &quot;E. Hondo.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each Battle Card has two spaces each for pizza and weapons tokens, and a designated bad guy.  The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &quot;hideout&quot;, which is part of the finish space.&#10;&#10;Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.&#10;&#10;The linear path is on a a nicely illustrated 15&quot; x 15&quot; board, with clearly labeled &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot; spaces.  There are 12 pizza spaces, 11 weapons spaces and two special &quot;Splinter&quot; spaces (Splinter is the benevolent rat master from the comics/tv/movies.)  The Splinter spaces allow for a &quot;redo&quot; if a player has yet to collect the needed tokens before advancing to the finish space.&#10;&#10;In summary, a very, very simplistic roll-and-move style game for die-hard fans of the game.  The box states &quot;4 and up&quot;, but I imagine beyond 6 years a child would bore of the gameplay itself.  Nice theme presentation, but very little game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher's Web Site:&#10;&#10;Ramesses' War is a two player board game covering the ancient war between Egypt and the Hittite Empire. During the later stages of the Hittite Empire, circa 1400 BC to 1250 BC, the Hittite Empire had recovered from a period of weakness where it had been on constant warfare with the Arzawa and Mittani states. By 1290 BC the Hittites had managed to conquer Arzawa entirely and had captured the Mitanni capital, though elements of the Mittani people still resisted the further advances of the Hittites. Further, the Hittites had moved into the northern Palestinian region and had come to dominate Syria. This led to friction between the Hittites and the Egyptian, who themselves held large parts of Palestine and had ruled there for more than two centuries. Historically the showdown between these two powers culminated in the battle at Kadesh, initiated by Ramesses who had rallied Egyptian military might in order to directly challenge further Hittite expansion.&#10;&#10;Ramesses' War is an easy to play two player game that lets you revisit that ancient conflict. However, the map provided expands the conflict to also encompass the various regional powers. Troy, an ally of the Hittites, plus Lukka, the Mittani and Ahhiyawa (Most probably the Hittite name for the Mycenaean Greeks), as well as providing units for an Arzawan rebellion and troops for each Palestinian city state.&#10;&#10;The Ramesses' War Includes:&#10;&#10;     2 piece, 17&quot; &times; 22&quot; color game map&#10;     37 Full-Color Hittite Counters&#10;     9 Full-Color Trojan Counters&#10;     8 Full-Color Arzawan Counters&#10;     4 Full-Color Lukka Counters&#10;     11 Full-Color Ahhiyawa Counters&#10;     37 Full-Color Egyptian Counters&#10;     7 Full-Color Mittani Counters&#10;     23 Assorted Full-Color Palestinian Counters&#10;     Game Rules&#10;     D10&#10;     4&frac12;&quot; &times; 5&frac34;&quot; &times; 1&frac12;&quot; Game Box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The grid levels are only about 2 inches apart.&#10;&#10;Another odd feature is the posts that separate the layers. There are spacers between the layers with an elastic running through the center of the posts. Thus you can rotate the layers of the game and get it fold.

Its three decks of question cards are arranged in three levels of difficulty. Players with a very limited or a Beginner's level of knowledge play the game with Deck A; Intermediates with Decks A &amp; B; and, Experts with Decks A, B &amp; C. The game's goal is to stimulate curiosity and encourage all players to eventually &quot;graduate&quot; to playing Feilong with all three decks.&#10;&#10;TO PLAY&#10;&#10;Players start by deciding if the game will be played by the rules for Beginners, Intermediates, or Experts. They then select one of the &quot;Tours in Time &amp; Space&quot; listed in the Rules Folder and enter the chosen tour's eight destination numbers (i.e., space numbers on the game board's playing track) in the blocks at the top of the Score Pad. Players advance around the playing track by correctly answering questions and outwitting opponents that exploit the game's strategy options. The first player to &quot;visit&quot; (i.e., land on the space of) each of the tour's eight destinations and enter the map of China in the center of the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An early and original abstract game for 2 to 4 players, heavily influenced by &quot;Halma / Chinese Checkers&quot; and &quot;Draughts&quot; and meant to fill the challenge-gap between &quot;Draughts&quot; and &quot;Chess&quot;.&#10;&#10;The board depicts three pyramids of 23 fields each (the 3- and 5-layer appear twice). These pyramids touch each other at the tips in the very center of the board, and are angled in such a way that a hexagonal playing area is created. One player occupies the top 6 fields of each pyramid at the center of the board with 18 black pawns. The remaining pawns are placed on the two base-rows of each pyramid, 10 pawns in 3 colors, one color for each pyramid.&#10;&#10;One player plays the beleaguered black pawns and tries to eliminate all other pieces. The remaining player(s) try to occupy one of the 3 center fields with a pawn in their color. The 3-player game is a bit contrived as one player will play 2 outer colors.&#10;&#10;Pieces move like draught-pieces: they either move one space or capture a piece by hopping over it to a free field behind it. Pawns from the outer colors can only move or capture sideways or towards the board center (sideways to a neighboring pyramid is also possible). Outer pieces can capture only the black pawns with the same direction restrictions. The black pawns can capture any of the other colors in all directions. A player isn't obliged to capture.&#10;&#10;In the opening move the outer colors start, opening with two different pawns per color, then the inner player moves one pawn from each pyramid. From then on, outer colors play one of their pawns in sequence, then the black player can play as many different black pawns as there are outer colors left in play, and these do no longer have to belong to different pyramids. If a player cannot move the turn moves on to the next player in line. Play continues until a victory condition is met.&#10;&#10;Publication history: the game originally appeared in 1897 as Ravensburger Spiel Nr. 63 and made a bit of gaming history when it was released. Up until that point Otto Maier had been publishing only classic and widely known games as &quot;Chess&quot;, &quot;Halma&quot; and &quot;Reversi&quot;. This was the first time he published an original abstract boardgame through his now famous games imprint.&#10;&#10;He quickly discovered all the obstacles to success that are still in force today: it is hard to market a game with rules that aren't commonly known, that has no promotional campaign to attract a critical mass of new players, and that has to be sold by salesmen who are unfamiliar with the game. Overall it became a learning experience, one that made him reflect a few years later when the game was withdrawn from sale after a single print-run: &quot;abstract boardgames are harder to market than those who are underpinned by fitting themes and illustrations&quot;. This realization might have been the beginning of the paste-on theme solution of which the German (and Euro) games are so often &quot;accused&quot;, but which does appear to have a function that is easily overlooked by the &quot;accusers&quot;. Themes draw buyers in, and rules are easier to explain when there is a story to tell, especially to younger players.&#10;&#10;The original edition was issued in a remarkably lavish production (for that time in the German market) with great attention to detail. Even the board and box were covered with quality imitation-leather. It then disappeared until 1983, when it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (1983/1, jan-mar) as the sixth game in their emerging &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen / Game to Remove&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; or &quot;Pearl-Pyramid&quot;&#10;&#10;Quick playing abstract pyramid stacking game for exactly 3 players. Each player uses a pool of 25 &quot;pearls&quot; in their color and placement starts on a 5x5 base grid, with pearls in subsequent layers being supported by four underneath.  A completed pyramid will thus contain exactly 55 pearl bricks.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn will add exactly one piece to the construction, and the aim is to have the most external pearls visible in the completed pyramid. Players will be placing their pearls only onto the base of the pyramid, making sure all placed pearls touch what's already there (orthogonal or diagonally). Placement of pearls on the additional layers is triggered automatically by what is present underneath. The moment that a square group of four pearls is created in the same layer, a special &quot;filling&quot; placement interrupts the regular turn progression. To resolve which pearl gets placed on top of the four pearls underneath players need to look at how many different pearls are present. If one color is in the majority (3:1 or 2:1:1) then another pearl of that color gets placed on top. However, if two players each have two pearls  present than a pearl of the third player becomes the peak. If all four pearls are from a single player then the player who would have the turn after this colour's player gets to place the bonus pearl. When the bonus pearl itself triggers the completion of another group of four in the next layer then again bonus pearls are resolved before the normal turn-order is resumed. When the 25th base pearl is placed the completion of the pyramid is triggered and the game ends. The winner is the one with the most external pearls present.&#10;&#10;Three variations are also included.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: Peter Pallat was one of the original designer &quot;Altmeisters&quot; of the German game industry.  It was his designs that found their way into many family homes from way back in the 1930s, through Ravensburger, then known as Otto Maier Verlag, and others. He remained an active designer throughout his life, but his career went through a renaissance when, in his older days, he found a welcome and supportive group of younger designers and admirers, who, in their turn, had become torch-bearers of German game design. One of these, Reinhold Wittig, published a handful of Peter Pallat's games and ideas in small editions through his own Edition Perlhuhn designers imprint, giving him the recognition for his longstanding input into our hobby he fully deserved. These games later found their way to publishers like Abacus and the Danish Abra who released wooden versions of some of these. As did this game. &quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; appeared with Edition Perlhuhn in 1978 and was republished by the Danish Abra as part of their abstract wooden game series of the latter part of the 1980s. It is hard to get hold of these days.&#10;&#10;",

The marbles jumped over may be taken away. Similar to Halma until here, the main difference is that the marbles can only capture marbles the same size or smaller. Because of the very limited space the game is fast and allows no false move.&#10;&#10;Played with two players the marbles of the third color just stay at the starting position and will not be moved. The space is even more limited now ...&#10;&#10;The first player with only one marble left, loses. The winner is the one with the most points left on the board: The big marble counts 3, the medium sized 2 and a small one 1 point.&#10;&#10;",

It has retained its unique rules ever since, and presently has its own league, founded in 1932, and is still widely played in its natural home of Friesland. Friesland is now a province with its own language and culture in the North of the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;The &quot;normal&quot; version of draughts only slowly made its way into Friesland, and is known there as &quot;Oer Hoek&quot; (over corners) or &quot;Holl&acirc;nsk damjen/Hollands dammen&quot;. These days you are more likely to hear people talk about &quot;Frysk Damjen&quot; than &quot;Oer Hoek&quot;.&#10;&#10;The set-up and basic movement is identical to the commonly known game, but it won't be long before the main difference will become very apparent: capturing isn't restricted to just diagonal jumps, but can be executed horizontally and vertically as well. Yes, a piece can capture in all 8 directions! If you think that makes it easier to solve, try it. It has a lot more action but it doesn't become easier.&#10;&#10;There are other subtle variations:&#10;A promoted King can be moved only three times in succession when a player still has normal pieces. After that it must be &quot;released&quot; by a capture (which can be made with the same king) or by moving another piece. When a player has nothing but Kings then this rule is ignored. When you can capture, you must, but if a King and a standard piece can both capture a stone, or stones, of equal value, then it is the King that has to make the capture. When there are multiple capturing opportunities of equal value than the one that includes most Kings must be taken. The moment a player obtains a second King (and his opponent has only one), than that player has seven moves to finish the match or it automatically becomes a draw. Kings can make long jumps.&#10;&#10;A few more names:&#10;The Frisians are still proud sailors and it should come as no surprise that there are more pockets along the North Sea and Baltic Sea that play the game, where it is known under many names that all refer to the erstwhile important Frisian harbour village of Molkwar/Molkwerum, famous in the Netherlands for its ad-hoc infrastructure. Early Dutch literature (mockingly) refers to Frisian draughts with its free-form any-direction capturing as &quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; as an homage to the labyrinthine village.&#10;&quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; (Dutch). A similar game is &quot;Makv&aelig;r&quot; (Danish) or &quot;Marquern&quot; (Swedish), however, it is played on an 8x8 board and, in Makv&aelig;r, a King doesn't only move diagonally, but also orthogonally, that is in 8 directions.&#10;&#10;And more still:&#10;&quot;Jeu du Dame Bablionique&quot; (French), &quot;Babylonian Draughts&quot; (English)&#10;&#10;There is even a game played in Siberia that follows very similar rules to Frisian Draughts, except that it is played on a 64 field chess board.&#10;&#10;",
