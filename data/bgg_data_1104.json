    "Description": "Iganie 1831 covers the battle of Iganie, one of the most brilliant victories of Poles over Russians during the November Uprising. It was fought between the Polish army commanded by General Ignacy Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski and the Russian 6th Corps commanded by General Grigory Rosen. The battle was the final part of the Polish Spring Offensive. The goal of the operation was Russian army&rsquo;s main depot in Siedlce, which supplied all Russian forces fighting in the Kingdom of Poland. After two first successful for Poles battles at Wawer and D&#196;&#153;be Wielkie (both on March 31st 1831) the pursuit for the defeated Russians was stopped. It allowed them to control chaos which appeared during the retreat, reorganize their units and bring reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The battle of Iganie was the last try to broke Russian 6th Corps near Siedlce and capture the Russian main depot. Planned by General Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski attack of three groups approaching from three different directions failed becaue of the lack of operational coordination and poor command of General Jan Skrzynecki. Two groups which had to cooperate with Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski&rsquo;s maneuver group did not appear during the battle and has come to the battlefield in the late evening or the next day. This caused that Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski&rsquo;s forces had to fight outnumbered by Russians. Russian forces also were divided into parts. General Rosen was bound by the orders from Field Marshal Ivan Diebitsch which urged him first of all to defend Siedlce and keep defensive position on the eastern bank of the Muchawiec river. That gave Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski chance to beat the enemy situated on the western bank of the Muchawiec river before Russians combine all their units and destroy his group. The decisive moment of the battle was when Russians started to move battalions from the eastern bank of the Muchawiec river to its western bank where the battle was taking place. Pr&#196;&#133;dzy&#197;&#132;ski decided to seize the only bridge on the river. During terrific bayonet fight Polish 5th Line Infantry Regiment completely broke the elite Russian Jaeger Brigade (13th &amp; 14th Jaeger Regiments), called Warna Lions (because of their fame gained in the recently finished war with Turkey), and captured the bridge. This cut off Russian units on the western bank of the river from the rest of their comrades. Finally Poles won the battle. The Russian losses are estimated between 3 600 &ndash; 4 500 soldiers, while Polish one numbered 400 &ndash; 500 soldiers. Tactical success of Poles was undoubted, however they did not decide to attack through the swampy river Muchawiec also because of the informations that the main Russian army is near and would join the Rosen&rsquo;s forces the next day.&#10;&#10;The game is an expansion for Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831. It means that Iganie 1831 uses system rules (also charts &amp; tables) and markers which are in Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831. There are two scenarios in the game: the historical and the alternative one. The first one in more detailed way simulates the battle and all background of it, especially specific events and operational situation of both sides. The alternative scenario is more flexible, giving the players more possibilities to create their own strategy and modify the course of the battle. However this scenario also stays in historical frames. Although the game bases on Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831 system rules, there are few new rules for this battle only. The most important are command points and changeable phase order. In the rule &amp; scenario book you will find also a detailed historical article on the battle and some additional system rules for Ostro&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;ka 26 maja 1831 (especially an integrated table of artillery fire with round-shot and granades). The playing time varies from 2,5 to 4 hours, however there is an autowin option which can end the game faster.&#10;&#10;Components (all packed in ziplock):&#10;- One mapsheet 42 x 30 cm &#10;- 108 die-cut counters&#10;- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)&#10;- One sheet with information on Russian artillery modifiers&#10;- Two sheets whit unit rosters (for Poles and Russians)&#10;- One sheet with turn track and command points tracks&#10;- One sheet with mapsheet legenda&#10;&#10;",

Ordinarily this token rarely moves, but if enemies begin to gain the advantage and are allowed to run amok, the token will begin to descend down the track. If the Enemy and Old One tokens ever meet, then the Avatar awakens and appears on the game board!&#10;&#10;The Avatar has its own board, which describes the effects that it has on the game. These are things that players must be wary of doing, because each time that the player triggers one of these effects, it brings the Avatar one step closer to arriving in the world.&#10;&#10;For players to have a chance at winning, they have to trigger the endgame. This is done in one of 2 ways:&#10;&#10;1. Reaching the end of the Discovery track - If players can do this, they have gathered enough knowledge to now attempt to subdue the Avatar. This is known as the Slumbering Objective&#10;&#10;2. Defeating the Avatar - If at any point the Avatar is summoned, the end game immediately is triggered and players must defeat it somehow. This is known as the Arisen Objective&#10;&#10;In both cases, once the endgame has been triggered the Avatar board is flipped, and the player's objective is revealed&#10;&#10;",

Players stop at certain intervals in the game to collect gems, which are worth 3 points and treasures, which are worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;Each player has a score card where they accumulate the items for later end-of-game scoring.  Points are also awarded for landing on the Pas de Deux squares, the Prima Ballerina square where one player will get the tiara and the final stage square for the bouquet and bow.&#10;&#10;In addition to the cards, each player has five 'Position Tokens' each of which can only be used once and then is turned over after executing the given 'power-up' move or action.&#10;&#10;The player who is positioned last, in relation to the front edge of the stage gets first selection of movement cards shown on the table and play proceeds clock-wise from there.  The result of this turn designation is that players tend to travel though the game board fairly closely together.&#10;&#10;Since the winner is determined by a calculation of points, arriving first at the end of the stage does not guarantee a win.&#10;&#10;On Pointe is a dancer's journey in a board game.&#10;&#10;",

Building and running an economically viable farm will require the skillful management of resources as well as the strategic deployment and timely slaughter of cattle for income. Along the way you will also raise revenue by milking your cows, breeding cattle and sending your herd to graze on both your own and your opponent's farm, all while attempting to defend your own patch of grass from your similarly inclined neighbor.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards from which they play farmland, cattle, action, enrichment, and building cards. Farmland cards are free to play and produce grass which can be spent to play other cards. Any unspent grass can be grazed on by your opponent's cattle to earn money. Money can also be earned by milking cows or slaughtering cattle. Action and enrichment cards directly affect the player or other cards in play. The winner is the first player to earn 100 coins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

After each player has used all but one of their cards, the last card determines which ninja they get points for, with more points going to ninjas closer to the &quot;ku&quot;.&#10;&#10;In order to win you'll have to use your powers to rearrange the grid while balancing that with holding on a character in a good position, even if they have good powers. You also have to be careful not to favor any character too obviously as other players can interrupt your plans.&#10;&#10;Can you get close to the &quot;ku&quot; and finally become a full kunoichi?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Do you believe psychics can glimpse into the future or that all psychics are frauds? The mystical and hysterical game of Trust Me, I'm Psychic might change your thinking!&#10;&#10;In this unpredictable game of predictions, one player acts as the Customer, asking a question about their future that the Psychics must answer. All other players act as Psychics, and are dealt a Vision card that tells them if they are a true Psychic or a Fraud. All the players who are true Psychics see the same tarot-inspired image that they can use to craft a fortune for the customer. The Frauds do not see the picture, and will just have to wing it (with some help from the Cursed Words clues on their card)!&#10;&#10;The Customer asks a question on any subject about his or her future. Will I win the lottery? Will I find true love this year? Whether you are a Psychic or a Fraud, use your imagination to spin a fantastical fortune for the Customer. Of course, fortune-telling is not as easy as it seems. Psychics and Frauds must avoid speaking the forbidden Cursed Words listed at the bottom of their cards. If your fellow Psychics/Frauds catch you saying a Cursed Word, you'll get a Curse Token.&#10;&#10;If you tell a convincing fortune the Customer rewards you with a token and gets to look at your card. If the Customer chose a true Psychic, they can use the image on the card to deduce who the remaining Psychics are. But if the Customer accidentally pays a Fraud, he or she gets a Curse Token.&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has a turn being the Customer. The player with the most money tokens (after subtracting Curse Tokens)wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first player then secretly changes one or two pieces and shows it again to the other player, who must identify the changes.  Players take turns until one has identified ten changes correctly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kim's Game - Players take turns being the dealer.  They place 20 silhouette pictures on the table, give other players a few seconds to look and then secretly remove one or more.  Players then must mark on their board which pieces have been removed, keeping the markers for correct guesses.  After each player has been dealer twice, the player with the most markers wins.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     What Followed Next? - Players start with a set of eight pictures face-down.  The first player chooses a picture, looks at it, says aloud what it is and then places it face-down, starting a row.  The second player chooses a second tile, looks and then must say the name of the first and second tiles in order.  The third player must name the first two tiles in order and then his or her newly-drawn tile.  This continues until a player thinks another has made a mistake and calls for a check.  The tiles are checked and whichever player is wrong is eliminated.  Play includes until only one player remains.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the Pocket Game - Each player has a board depicting 20 objects.  Silhouette tiles of these objects form a supply.  In turn, each player chooses a silhouette and hides it.  The player to the left then asks a yes/no question about the item (e.g. &quot;is it round?&quot;).  If the answer is no, the next player asks a question.  If the answer is yes, the asker may guess the identity of the item.  If correct, the player receives the tile and places it in the correct space on his or her board.  If incorrect, the next player may take a turn.  The player who wins the tile becomes the next to choose a tile and answer questions.  The first player to get five tiles wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You can avoid ghost types that are about to play a trick on you, or you can go after them to trigger the trick on purpose.&#10;&#10;The first player to ten points wins the round and escapes the tomb with their treasure - and their life!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You want to be the strongest member of the winning army, but you'll have to find out what the other players are planning while hiding your own intentions.&#10;&#10;At the start players are dealt three cards, and four cards are dealt to the middle, two face up and two face down. Each turn you take cards from the middle, put some from your hand back, and then add more cards to the middle from the deck. Once someone has ten points in one color they can announce victory for that team; everyone else gets one chance to announce victory for another color if they also have ten points, and then you move on to scoring. Declaring victory in a color is advantageous but might not be enough to overcome a sneaky player; whoever has the most points total over all victorious colors wins the round. This means that besides winning on the strength of your own hand, you can win by investing in multiple suits other people are stronger in.&#10;&#10;The most subtle part of the game is the different kinds of cards. While some cards give a simple color bonus, those are the rarest. The next most common type can count for either of two colors during scoring, but don't count towards the 10 for declaring victory. Most cards are worth few points on their own, but worth more in pairs with specific cards - in particular, the purple color has no invidually strong cards, but is worth the most with the right pair. Each color has its own distribution, and keeping that in mind is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Can you read the other players to figure out which color you should throw your lot in with?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You play adventurers chasing after the precious scales of the Star Dragon; the game is semi-cooperative, with a pure coop mode for 2-3 players and a more competitive mode with the potential for betrayal for 3-4 players.&#10;&#10;Each turn has three phases. In the preparation phase, you can spend Stars to buy items or heal, and you choose an item to use in the combat phase. In the combat phase, you flip a card from the Star Dragon deck and resolve its attack. Only the players with the highest attack or defense rating take part in combat. If things go well you can earn Stars here, but if they poorly some players will take damage. Some Dragon cards also have special effects like doing damage to players with too many Stars. Finally, in the Spoils phase the Stars earned in combat are split evenly among all participants. The game ends after ten turns, when the Dragon's Crown is revealed.&#10;&#10;Because Stars are used to heal damage as well as to buy the items you attack with every turn, you'll have to balance offense and defence in order to survive the dragon's attacks. If you're playing to win you can play it safe in a round by trying to avoid combat... but since you won't get a share of the spoils that's risky too. You'll need balance in how you deal with the Dragon as well as your allies to come out ahead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

When a discard pile has some flies in it any player out of turn can play a fly swatter card.  When playing a fly swatter card on one of the discard piles that player then collects all of the cards in that piles.  The more flies you kill the more points you are awarded at the end.  There are other cards that allow you to steal from another player hand or from another players kill pile (the bug zapper, and frog cards).  The spider allows you to kill two flies directly out of your hand. The food cards allows you to name a type of fly and any player that has that type in their hand must give you all of those flies. You can't forget the poop card when played forces the opponents to place a fly directly on it, but also when someone uses a fly swatter card on a pile that has a poop card that player must complete a penalty to continue on the game.&#10;&#10;The theme is based off of flies, butterflies, and dragonflies.  The art is goofy but totally fits with the style of play. It is a fun family friendly game that only takes about 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In Herd, you are obsessed with one thing: creating the greatest herds in the land. Score points by acquiring geep, a half-goat half-sheep hybrid, and organizing them into herds. Protect your herds from marauding wolves, but if a wolf emerges from the hills you can send it to devour the herd of another player.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of three cards to start the game. During their turn, players begin by drawing a card from the draw pile. Four options are then available: Form a herd, play a wolf on another player's herd, play a specialty card, or allow the next player to go. A player scores points by forming herds using three geep cards of the appropriate colors. Herd: Fleece your Friends is played in rounds. A round ends after one of the players plays her last card and has nothing else in her hand. Other players have one final turn. At the end of the round, the point values of the player's herds are totaled and the point value of the cards remaining in the player's hand are subtracted from this total. This is the player's score for the round. The player with the highest total wins a victory token. The first player to collect three victory tokens is the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This trade route will be represented by a punchboard ring placed around your City. Each of these rings has two protruding branches, which will allow that City to be connected to two other Cities. This means each City can only be attached in two directions, creating a road-like chain! Of course, these rings will be fully illustrated to represent the trade routes they&rsquo;re creating!&#10;&#10;These trade routes give players a wealth of new options:&#10;&#10;When a City is connected to a trade route, its owner gains Victory Points equal to the number of other Cities that are part of that route.&#10;&#10;When a City is activated, the player receiving those resources can choose to take Knowledge of the colour of that City OR of any City connected to the same trade route.&#10;&#10;Cities connected to a trade route can be used as both their colour or the colour of any other City connected to the same trade route during the game when it comes to Mastery cards and other effects.&#10;&#10;Trade routes can be worth big points.

They then take the three cards from the player on their right and choose another card to keep. This is repeated one last time so that all players have 3 Dynasty cards in hand.

These tiles are essentially a new common objective system that replace the ordinary Objective cards in the game. When playing with the Hegemony tiles, players do not draw a personal Objective card at the start of the game as they normally would. Instead, they will all be trying to satisfy the demands of the Hegemon. These demands are determined by drawing three Hegemony tiles, which will each have a criteria based on Cities, Knowledge cards and colours of Nodus. Players will then battle it out for dominance over each objective dictated by the tiles: at the end of the Age, the player with the highest number of each of the 5 criteria is awarded additional victory points! In the case of a draw, no player gets the points - the Hegemon is only interested in the best&hellip;&#10;&#10;However, as time passes, old leaders shall fall and new ones will arise&hellip; The start of each new Age will bring a new Hegemon to power, and their demands could be very different this time around! Two of the objectives are constant: the number of Monument levels in your possession, and your Influence score. However, the old tiles will be shuffled back into their piles, and three new tiles will be drawn. As a result, your objectives could remain the same (at least in part), or change completely for the next Age!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the Provinces expansion, you will come into contact with other nations, which will give you the opportunity to conquer and assimilate new territories into your Civilization!&#10;&#10;This expansion includes exciting new tiles to add to the board, new Mastery cards, Conquest cards, Rebellion cards, Objectives cards, and more! It is also fully compatible with all of the other Dominations expansions!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each Age, each player will draw a Province card, then take the corresponding Province tile which will be added to their hand. This tile must be placed on the board during the Age during your Growth phase, at the same time as a regular domino. Each player will hence be playing six dominoes during the Age instead of the usual five. These dominoes will have unique illustrations and characteristics : some will have resources, some will have other effects, much like the Monument tiles.&#10;&#10;Once your Province tile has been placed, you can Conquer it. To do so, you&rsquo;re going to need a whole new resource : Conquest! Conquest is represented by a deck of small Conquest cards that can only be gained one way - using one of the expansion&rsquo;s new Mastery cards: Conscription. Conscription is a unique Mastery card in that it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any Domain: at has a value of 3 that can be purchased using any kind of resource. It is then used as a converter &ndash; changing any Knowledge type into Conquest cards.&#10;&#10;When Conquest cards are purchased, they are drawn from the Conquest deck, which is placed face down on the table. Each card has a value of 1 to 5 Conquest Points, and as they&rsquo;re drawn randomly, you never know what you&rsquo;re going to get! Additionally, some of these cards have special powers and bonuses!&#10;&#10;To conquer a Province, you must pay the corresponding number of Conquest points as stated on the tile&rsquo;s Province card. However, these Provinces won&rsquo;t allow themselves to be conquered easily. Each Province card also has a &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; value. This refers to the deck of Rebellion cards, which - similarly to the Conquest cards - are drawn randomly, have a value of 1 to 5, and some of them have special powers that can be good or bad. You must draw the number of Rebellion cards specified, then add their value to that Province's Conquest value to determine its full cost. If you have enough Conquest points, then you conquer the Province &ndash; placing a City token on it and gaining the bonus stated on its card. As with the classic dominos, just because you placed a Province tile, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s yours - once placed, any player can conquer it!&#10;&#10;However, although the tiles MUST be placed during the Age, you don&rsquo;t have to conquer them. Each Province has an End of Age effect, which is triggered if it has not been conquered. These effects can be good or bad &ndash; from allowing you to gain additional resources, to unleashing hordes of barbarian invaders to destroy neighbouring Cities!&#10;&#10;These combinations of different effects bring a fascinating new strategic facet to Dominations. Will you conquer as many Provinces as you can to reap the benefits, or will you simply place the tiles next to your opponents&rsquo; Cities, forcing them to react to avoid negative End of Age effects?&#10;&#10;Provinces brings a slightly more aggressive stance to your games of Dominations, in that your actions can potentially damage your adversaries : Provinces is the first expansion where your nation can actually lose ground : Cities can be destroyed, resources lost.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Into the Dead is a competitive game (or can be played cooperatively) of strategy and risk-taking in which players take the roles of survivors and their loyal canine companions to navigate a landscape teeming with hordes of the undead. By gathering supplies, killing zombies, and reaching safety, players show their aptitude for surviving the apocalypse through the completion of missions and collection of survival points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players take turns acting as both the zombie horde and the survivors of the apocalypse. The winner is the player with the most survival points, and these are acquired by completing survivor missions, reaching safety, and increasing their zombie kill count. Once per round, a zombie master rolls dice to spawn and move the dead toward any survivors nearby. Then each survivor must weigh the choices of completing missions at personal risk, running toward safety, gathering supplies, and more. By using the cards from their starting hand and those acquired at the various supply drops on the board, they can increase their movement speed, lob grenades and fire weapons, and direct their trusty canine companion to attack the threats facing them. Dice rolls determine whether a nearby zombie will bite and the level of damage a weapon will deal, making the game a balance of risk and strategy.&#10;&#10;Cooperative Play allows 2-4 Players to make the the run to the farm in the same way they would in the normal competitive mode but with the exception of working together with the other Survivors as opposed to against them. In Solo Play, a single Player can control from 1-4 Survivors during the run, taking on the run with a solo Survivor being the greatest challenge.&#10;&#10;Survivors will be able to work together, planning strategies for Missions and trading Supply Cards with each other along the way. Additionally there might be a few other special ways Survivors will be able to aid each other during Co-Op that aren&rsquo;t normally available in the core version of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion is inspired by ghost stories from Chinese literature. There are different elements that will bring more interaction between players in intriguing ways.&#10;&#10;The Fox Ghost appears in many Chinese legends. It is a spirit that could shape-shift into different forms, often in a beautiful woman. &#10;Initially it was an evil and disturbing character, but in the novels that were released after several years she got a positive meaning.&#10;&#10;In the game, the Fox Ghost will take the shape of any other character available in the game by placing the Fox Ghost Token on top of a character card. Both the active and sight preference abilities of the character she shape-shifted into will be available to her.&#10;&#10;The Demon like in other cultures is often represented in the popular Chinese beliefs.&#10;&#10;In the game, he will weaken the characters he sees in his line of sight by deducting 3 points from their sight seeing score. The players can defend themselves by using the &quot;shift&quot; lantern (if not used previously) to move a character into another place.&#10;&#10;Another way of defending your characters is by placing a cat on the board.

By placing a cat, the player will also get one prestige point and the nature element indicated in the card.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the Ghost Soldier which is bound to The Great Wall is a figment of my imagination.&#10;&#10;The Soldier will grant the possibility to buy a decoration card without placing the decoration on the board. If placed in the garden, the Soldier will grant 3 prestige points without any requirement or 7 if he can see the great wall in the Panoramas in his line of sight.&#10;&#10;",

You begin on the &quot;meet&quot; hex with your partner and are attempting to reach &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; by laying journey markers.

On the way you may meet helpful guides and mischievous fellow-travelers.  With some luck you may find enough treasure and magical tools to enable you to find the home of your dreams and live happily ever after.&#10;&#10;This game is played entirely in the hand, so there is no need for a table.  You can play it anywhere.  If you are interrupted, you can put it in your pocket and take it up later.&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;&#10;Remove the four Jacks from a deck of playing cards and shuffle the rest of the deck, including the two Jokers.  Arrange the Jacks face up in the order Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, with Spades in the back and Hearts in the front.  Place the rest of the deck face down on top of the Jacks.   The Jacks will act as counters to keep track of how many times you&rsquo;ve gone through the deck; when they show up, put the first one behind the other three and continue playing.  When you reach the Jack of Spades you have gone through the deck four times and have finished the game. The Jacks also hold your items for you.&#10;&#10;Interpretation of the cards&#10;&#10;The four suits represent four kinds of landscapes.  Hearts are oceans, lakes, and rivers.  Diamonds are plains, fields, moors, and prairies.  Clubs are forests.  Spades are mountains.&#10;&#10;The values of the cards represent various treasures, tools, items, landscapes, and people.   The &ldquo;view&rdquo; is the name for the four cards that are fanned face upward in your hand.  They are not only the cards you can view, but they also represent the things you can see as you look around you.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards represent first a location, and then, under the right circumstances, an item that you find at that location.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;&#10;Travel though various landscapes, collecting treasure and magical tools.  Eventually use the tools to find the home of your dreams and live happily ever after.  If you find your home, you have won the game.    But once the Jack of Spades appears, you have finished your journey, whether or not you have met your goal.&#10;&#10;Terms&#10;&#10;View:  the top four cards fanned out face up on top of the deck.  In some situations there may be more cards in your view.&#10;&#10;Discard:  place a card face down at the back of the deck.&#10;&#10;Store:  place a card face up behind the face-up Jack of the same suit&#10;&emsp;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Hold the deck face down in your hand, with the Jacks face up in the back.  Turn over the top four cards and fan them so you can see them all.  These cards form your current view.  If in the course of play your view becomes less than four cards, replace them with cards from the front of the deck.&#10;&#10;You may discard any card from the view at any time.   At any time you may look to see what cards you have stored behind the Jacks.  They will be easy to find because they will be face up together, while the rest of the deck will be face down.&#10;&#10;A complete description of the rules will be found in the files section.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game allows you to use your own characters from your system of choice and play mini-adventures. &#10;In this game, everyone gets the opportunity to play, and everyone gets the opportunity to GM. It's a rule-lite game that builds player confidence with d20 RPG systems and encourages skills and experience with GMing.&#10;&#10;The Game-play:&#10;&#10;Players: 2-6 (but can stretch to 8 depending on the mode)&#10;Playtime: 30-180min (dependant on how much players like to roleplay)&#10;&#10;The game is formed primarily of:&#10;Quest cards, hunt cards, location cards, a set of meeples, and a set of dice. The quest/hunt cards have plot-hooks written on the front and GM notes on the back. The location cards are drawn when the players are resting in the town after a hard day adventuring; the cards contain a mixture of bonuses and setbacks.&#10;&#10;The game has three primary modes of play, head-to-head, co-operative, and classic. &#10;In head-to-head, 1-4 players build a party of four adventurers and compete with each other to become the most successful/famous party in the land. Players move from town-to-town, completing quests and trying to earn: coin, renown, and experience points.&#10;In co-operative mode, 3-6 players choose a character and join forces to form a party. The players head to a local town and aim to clear the board of quests within 5 days. &#10;In classic mode, 2-6 players choose characters to form a party and compete with a GMs rival party of adventurers.&#10;&#10;Applications as a tool:&#10;The game was originally designed to be used as a prop during DND. The game can be used to manage downtime or as a way to introduce the party during session zero. It can also be used to generate plot-hooks or side-quests during the game. &#10;The game itself is a great way to pass the time while you are waiting for other players to show up or as an alternative when players unexpectedly cancel.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They learn of a stock exchange where they can bid on assets and make a killing. But there is also a hidden back door they can use to steal cryptocurrency from others.&#10;&#10;Players place bids using the assets they have on hand in order to score the most points and be declared the winner. Each player is given a role at the beginning, and this affects how points are scored but is not revealed until final points are tallied.&#10;&#10;The regular players earn points by bidding, acquiring and playing cards, while trying to avoid having points stolen by the Virus Player. The Virus Player conceals their identity and tries to get the other players to take their assets, earning points by taking them back at the end.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

Your fate is determined by how well you deal with the inherent dilemmas of the game, and the conflict.&#10;&#10;1) Will you push to gain prestige at the risk of escalating the crisis to global nuclear war?&#10;2) How do you best manage your hand of cards to further your own plans while depriving your opponent of options?&#10;&#10;Work out these dilemmas in order to emerge as victor of the Cuban Missile Crisis after thirteen suspenseful days.&#10;&#10;13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a meaty filler utilizing the card-driven game mechanisms. Rich with history, yet accessible to gamers with no prior knowledge of the crisis. It is targeted specifically at catering to two groups of gamers: the enthusiasts that just don't have the time they used to and the curious newcomers that are scared off by the heavy commitment and long play times of the classics in the genre.&#10;&#10;13 Minutes: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a card-driven microgame with tough decisions. Playing as either Kennedy or Khrushchev, your aim is to exit the Cuban Missile Crisis as the most powerful superpower. During the game you play only five strategy cards that you use to place Influence on battlegrounds to score majorities or manipulate battlegrounds. Each card you play turns into a new battleground, so the &quot;world map&quot; is ever-changing. Be careful because each decision is important and you may trigger global nuclear war!&#10;&#10;",

Should they emerge victoriously, they receive a special golden Legendary Action card that gives your character permanently a second gameplay action!&#10;&#10;The sheets can be used as a legacy element, allowing your hero to start a new game with a part of their story and some Heroic Feats cards already unlocked.&#10;&#10;Effectively, this add-on introduces interesting personal objectives for each of the characters, and a small legacy element, at the same time reinforcing the character backstories and providing a deeper look into the world of Tainted Grail.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;52 Legendary Action cards (4 for each of 13 Characters) &#10;52 Achievement Sheets (4 for each of 13 Characters) &#10;Echoes of the Past booklet (24 pages)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tom Russell's first published game was Blood in the Alma. That humble little magazine insert game, published in 2012, introduced concepts that over time gave birth to Hollandspiele's Blood in the Fog and, eventually, the Shot &amp; Shell Battle Series. So it is perhaps fitting that seven years and nearly forty published designs later, Mr. Russell would turn his attention back to the topic that started it all, redesigned from the ground-up through the lens of the Shot &amp; Shell system. The result is The Heights of Alma.&#10;&#10;The heights overlooking the Alma River provided a natural defensive advantage for the Russians, who proceeded to utterly squander it with slapdash entrenchments and a left flank that was completely exposed. It didn't help that the commander of that left wing was several sheets to the wind. At least he was on the field; on the opposing side, British commander Lord Raglan snuck behind enemy lines for a better view of the battle without telling his subordinates, leaving his army without any orders. Frontal charges against the Russian heavy guns were as costly as they were pointless. Eventually, a group of men disobeyed orders, choosing to stand and fire instead - discovering, to their delight, that their new Mini&eacute; rifles outranged the enemy artillery! They would have known that from the beginning if anyone had bothered to listen to their French allies - the only side to acquit themselves competently.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario recreates this glorious mess of a battle. Three additional scenarios explore increasing levels of coordination and competence on either side. This game has more special rules than the previous Shot &amp; Shell title (Seven Pines; or, Fair Oaks), resulting in a more complex and nuanced experience, but not so many rules that it bogs the thing down - a given scenario will still be resolved within a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This third expansion to the popular Table Battles series focuses its attention on a single day: 2 July 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Famous engagements from throughout the attack each get their own scenario - Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill - while a final scenario zooms out for a &quot;big picture&quot; view of the whole thing. These battles were hard-fought, stubborn, and bloody affairs, often without any decisive result, ending only when both sides were too exhausted to fight any further. That's reflected here, and so it's significantly harder to get a decisive result, and you're more likely to see epic slugfests in which you win only because the other side collapsed an eye-blink sooner.&#10;&#10;",

Rules for stealth, fist fighting, martial arts. multiple combats, cavalry, spears and a whole host of other weapon types are included. Most games can be played in a couple of hours and so are suitable for club nights. Although these rules were primarily designed for our 40mm Samurai range, they could be used with our 28mm Prehistoric Settlement. These rules will also help you find a use for all those part finished armies that we all have. As you only need a small number of figures, taking up a new period need not be a vast and time consuming occupation.&#10;&#10;The game has a Character development section, enabling the Player to chart the progress of their Characters.

In every show, the fierce competition between queens makes them give everything on stage, making the crowd go wild each night. But, who&rsquo;s the best of the best? Which queen deserves to be recognized as the Divaest Diva of the show? It&rsquo;s time for you to put on your heels, gown, nails and wig and show you deserve the crown, even if that implies sabotaging your fellow queens&hellip;&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player gets one of four secret Divas, indicating with which card and how many copies of them in front of them, they have to get to win the game. If you&rsquo;re Miss Kitty, the comedian, you&rsquo;ll have to get 5 Laugh cards to become victorious. If you&rsquo;re Pink Lemonade, the fashionista, you win with 4 Fame cards. Katie Hart, the showgirl, wins with 4 Spotlight cards and Lee O&rsquo;poldo, the evil queen, wins when another player gets 4 Shade cards in their area.&#10;&#10;So, there&rsquo;s a deck with these four cards: Laugh, Fame, Spotlight and Shade. You get 4 initial cards. In your turn, you draw one card from the deck and play one of the cards in your hand in front of you (or if it&rsquo;s Shade, in front of another player). Clockwise, players will draw and play cards until one reveals their secret identity, showing it accomplished their objective, winning the game.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s not all! Each card, when played and even on the table, has an especial effect. Fame cards allow you to play additional cards in your turn. Shade cards cancel Fame cards and allows you to steal cards from that player&rsquo;s hand. Laugh cards makes you switch a cards position on the table from one player or another. And finally, with the Spotlight cards, you draw 3 cards and discard 2. Every card is useful, even if they doesn&rsquo;t make you win the game directly!&#10;Balance is settled with card mix and double cards, that you can play using one of the sides only (and remain in that position even when stolen) and also affect the winning condition, making players hard to deduce how wins each player.&#10;&#10;Las Divas is a game of temporal alliances, betrayal, deception and fabulous-ness, encouraging players to act like be a queen, making drama, stealing the show and revealing their hidden talents.&#10;&#10;It was published in Argentina in 2018, thanks to a succesful crowdfunding campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Assault Artillery (AA) recounts the Battle of La Malmaison, 23-27 October 1917, in which the French employed their Artillerie Sp&eacute;ciale (tank force) and creeping barrage to capture Pinon, Vaudesson, and the coveted Chemin des Dames ridge. The French victory confirmed their recovery from the mutinies spawned by the disastrous Nivelle Offensive fought over some of the same ground six months earlier.&#10;&#10;In a six-day preliminary bombardment, French guns, with a three to one advantage, silenced most of their German counterparts and smothered German rear areas with dense gas to impeded German reinforcements. At 0515 on October 23 (zero hour), six divisions of the French XI, XIV, and XXI corps attacked on a 7.5-mile wide front. French infantry advanced in the predawn twilight behind an elaborate creeping barrage with 63 Schneider and Saint-Chamond tanks in support. Twenty-seven of the 63 tanks bogged before reaching the front line. A combination of German fire and mud stopped 15 more in no man's land. Twenty-one French tanks (1/3rd of the starting total) actually made it to the German second position. The French 38th Division captured Fort de Malmaison and XXI Corps took Allemant and Vaudesson. From 24 to 25 October, XXI and XIV corps advanced while I Cavalry Corps came forward to exploit a hoped-for German collapse.&#10;&#10;With specialized &ldquo;eingreif&rdquo; companies sprinkled all along the front, the Germans launched numerous local counterattacks. However, the French wave was inexorable. Still, the German 7th Army retired from the Chemin-des-Dames to the north bank of the Ailette in good order.&#10;&#10;By October 26, the French had gained 3.5 miles in some places at a cost of only 12,000 casualties, far fewer than Germany&rsquo;s 38,000 and a significant improvement over the 30,000 French losses suffered in the same area during April&rsquo;s Nivelle Offensive. The French also bagged about 11,500 German prisoners. The Artillerie Sp&eacute;ciale proved its worth by smothering numerous German machine gun posts.&#10;&#10;AA is the third volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles. Ownership of previous volumes, The Battles for Ypres and/or Last Laurels at Limanowa, is NOT required to play AA; everything you need to play AA is in this box. AA offers the same rules as The Battles for Ypres and Last Laurels at Limanowa except that sections 12 and 13, the scenarios and campaigns for volumes I and II, are intentionally left blank while section 14, the AA scenarios and campaigns, has been added.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;Solitaire suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 10 minutes per turn&#10;Map Scale: 200 yards per hex&#10;Unit Scale: Companies, squadrons, sections&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Schutztruppe, Heia Safari, 1914-18 delivers an intriguing and detailed look at the East African Guerrilla war, 1914-1918. This is a moderate complexity wargame with detailed naval and supply rules, and a map and order of battle representing the authoritative treatment of the campaign. The overall game presentation is enhanced with a mounted game map and larger 9/16&quot; counters.&#10;&#10;Heia, heia Safari! was a call which for four years echoed throughout East Africa. With this call the officers of the Schutztruppe in German East Africa rallied and encouraged their askari in the defense of their country during the First World War. This small force, whose strength never exceeded 3,000 white and 12,000 black soldiers (askari), was opposed by some 300,000 men (150,000 at any one time), comprising British, Indian, Rhodesian, Nigerian, Gold Coast, South African, Belgian and Portuguese troops. Led by Major-General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the Schutztruppe fought within its own home territory for the first three years of the war. During the final year von Lettow-Vorbeck transferred his resistance to Portuguese East Africa and trekked south to within 60 km of Quelimane. He reappeared in Northern Rhodesia in November, 1918, and that is where news of the general armistice that ended the war reached him.&#10;&#10;Forces represent the German, British, South African, Portuguese, and Belgian combatants. Special rules provide a game that is highly-playable yet rich in historical detail featuring weather effects, supply and supply depots, replacements, provisional reinforcements, rail movement, naval transport, naval battle, amphibious assault, aircraft, blockade runners, garrisons, German retreat movement, Allied ambush, infiltration movement, land and naval reaction, artillery bombardment, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battles of Herdonia, 212 &amp; 210 BC, is GMT's Battle Scenario for SPQR, published in RBM's C3i Magazine Nr. 20.&#10;&#10;After Cannae, most Roman generals accepted the wisdom of Fabius the 'Delayor'; against Hannibal, discretion was definitely the better part of valor. Fortunately for the historical wargaming community, two generals were foolish enough to accept Hannibal's challenge, both names Fulvius, and both on the field before Herdonia. As had occured at Cannae, both these armies were also envelopped and annihilated. Unlike Cannae, at the Herdonia battles Rome fielded only two, not eight, legions. So here is an opportunity to fight Cannae-Lite, two classic battles of envelopment, scaled down to one-quarter of Cannae's monumental size.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     Herdonia Setup Card.&#10;     21 new counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;Expansion module for the Great Battles of History (GBoH) series game SPQR.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
