Within a set period of a time, they must generate, trade, and gather as much wealth as possible with the holder of the most wealth being the controller of industry for this colony.  This won't be a trivial task.  The world experiences strange weather, pirates and gangs loot, and other players get revenge for your own actions against them (or just simply doing better than they are).  Technology isn't exactly your friend as the cranky and failure prone (Reconfigurable Industrial Gathering Systems) RIGS will produce but with the risk of spontaneously blowing up.  Unfortunately, they are the key tools for industry... and the only one available.&#10;&#10;Players are grant plots of land, survey the land for Luxuries (the only thing the rest of the universe wants), place RIGS on plots, and hope for the best as Disaster and other players strike.  Weather the disasters that affect your production, resources, and RIGS.  Manage to produce not only Luxuries, but other needed Energy, Metal, Supply resources to keep your operation running and growing.  Then, sell the Luxuries on the ever-changing market.  Make deals with other players for simple trades or pacts against other players.  In the end, final value of all resources a player has (except RIGS... no one wants those troublesome things) is determined.

There is a tray which fits in the box, and the 25 Little Baby Tiles are placed randomly on the tray.  A plastic punchout overlay sits on these tiles, and 24 slider tiles are placed on this with one space open.  This will give you something similar to a Sliding Puzzle.&#10;&#10;Players each have 3 face-up Big Mommy Tiles.  On your turn, choose one of your face-up tiles and announce that you're looking for its associated Little Baby Tile.  You get up to 5 slide-moves to try to find it.  A slide-move consists of moving an adjacent Slider Tile into the open space.  This will uncover a different Little Baby Tile where the tile used to be.  You may continue sliding tiles until you either find the match for the Big Mommy Tile you named, or you have moved five Slider Tiles.&#10;&#10;Tiles match if they have a Mommy and Baby of the same animal (the game rules includes pictures of all the matching sets).  They also will have the upper and lower case versions of the same letter.  If you uncover a match on your turn, take a &quot;MATCH&quot; Scoring Token and cover the Big Mommy Tile.  Draw a new tile so you always have three face-up tiles.&#10;&#10;After the last Big Mommy Tile is drawn, continue playing until the next MATCH is scored.

It moves fast while retaining the excitement of the longer 18xx variants. However, with four players, one person is left without a railroad to operate. The following rules describe how to add a fourth corporation to 1876-30 while, at the same time, completely destroying the beauty and symmetry of the original game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are turned facedown again, and are covered with a cloud token.

    "Description": "This deluxe game of Puerto Rico began as Puerto Rico: Anniversary Edition, a tenth anniversary edition of Andreas Seyfarth's Puerto Rico that celebrates Puerto Rico's  debut at Spiel 2001 with a production-ready copy that met mass acclaim.&#10;&#10;Game play is the same as the original Puerto Rico game: The players are plantation owners in the days when ships had sails. By growing up to five different kind of crops &ndash; corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee &ndash; they try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.&#10;&#10;The game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is his turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who ends up with the most victory points &ndash; achieved by shipping goods and building &ndash; wins the game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico: Anniversary Edition and its follow-up versions include two expansions: Puerto Rico: Expansion I &#226;&#128;&#147; New Buildings, that first appeared in 2002 in Spielbox magazine and was later published by alea and Rio Grande Games, and the Puerto Rico: Expansion II &#226;&#128;&#147; The Nobles expansion from alea's Schatzkiste collection of game expansions.&#10;&#10;The game has completely redesigned components and artwork: The cardboard doubloons are now sixty metal coins, while the fifty octagonal resources have been replaced with colored wooden crates. The building tiles are now illustrated, and the cardboard for those tiles and other components are nearly 3 mm thick to give the bits more heft. The individual player boards, the VP tokens, the ships, and other components have also been redesigned.&#10;&#10;",

Sister product of Balyna Football. Both games were designed to be a competitor to Subbuteo's cricket and football games.&#10;In many ways the game is quite surreal, with the bowler being represented by an aluminim funnel from which the fielding team bowls the ball. The batsman is a counter weight which is held by a piece of cotton by the player. When the ball is bowled, the batsman releases the counter weight and, depending on the angle can play a variety of shots. Great scoreboard too, but completely useless as the scoreboard is metal and the score numbers cardboard. They fall apart far too quickly.&#10;&#10;",

After a player has determined the correct loot, he takes the corresponding card from the table. If he has picked the right card, he gets to place the card in front of himself.

But, when it comes to business, someone has to get ahead, and in the universe of Windfall, being the best means being the one with power.&#10;&#10;Windfall: Galaxy is a tableau building game where the goal is to get the most VP's from the central pool and build the best structures.

There are many reasons to trade: To get a resource you need, to make a card you own better, or to use something of someone elses.&#10;&#10;The sector board gives players a chance to use other player's turns to their advantage.  By piggy backing of an action, they can use their structures in the same sector, to perform a small action like drawing cards or taking small amounts of VP's, before it even gets to their turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;I remember back before the great war, we didn't have any fancy machinery guns to add to our two-winged air-scrapers.  So, when two hot-shot fly-boys needed to settle their differences, they grabbed a buddy and had them duke it out mano-a-mano on the wings of aeroplanes. Those crowds would sure hoot and holler as we flew nearly 50 mph to heights of almost 30 feet.  You kids wouldn't remember those days.  So, I made this paper and card game-set box to show you nancies how we used to do it.  Back when flying and racing was pure.&#10;&#10;Did I say racing?  Why I can't really remember why we were racin' too.  But, hell, that's exactly how I remember it, so that's how you're gonna play it.  The old-fashioned way.  We called it &quot;Punchin' Planes&quot; and that's how it was.&quot;  ~Grandpappy&#10;&#10;In &quot;Good 'Ol Punchin' Planes&quot; players relive the days of early Pre-WW1 aviation.  The days when the only way to fight was to have a buddy stand on your wing and engage in fisticuffs (machine-guns were too heavy, or course).  Through the use of dual-purpose action cards, players have to navigate obstacles on the modular race-track while their fighters spar on the wings of their planes.  Will you win over the crowd and cross the finish line or go down in a ball of flames?&#10;&#10;Play is fast and actions are revealed simultaneously.  While the game uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanic for fighting (punch, kick, grapple), there is always the option for the losing player to &quot;trade blows,&quot; essentially turning the tables.  But, since cards are not always drawn each turn, losing a battle may sometimes be more beneficial than winning.  With obstacles that bring players one step closer to explosion, hand management, and plane positioning complicating each situation, &quot;Punchin' Planes&quot; is a short game for 2 players with a surprising strategic depth.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shakespeare CARDUTA is a simple card game based on the traditional Japanese card game Hyakunin Isshu      (100 Poems by 100 Poets), which uses one hundred ancient Japanese short poems. &quot;CARDUTA&quot; is a made-up word from &quot;card&quot; and the Japanese word &quot;uta&quot;, which means &quot;songs&quot;.&#10;&#10;The full set includes 48 word cards and 48 word-and-picture cards, with the cards containing quotations (and half-quotations) from Shakespeare's plays. For example, a word card might read &quot;No profit grows where is no pleasure taken.&quot;, while the corresponding word-and-picture card reads only &quot;where is no pleasure taken&quot;, with the picture giving a clue to the first half of the quote.&#10;&#10;To play, lay out all the picture cards face-up on the table. One person draws a word card and reads the first half of it; everyone else looks for the matching picture card, with the first player to pick up the correct card claiming it. The next player then draws a word card, etc. The player who claims the most picture cards wins.&#10;&#10;Shakespeare CARDUTA is also available in two half-game versions: a Tragedy Set and a Comedy Set, each with 24 word cards and 24 picture cards.&#10;&#10;",

This places a double burden on the people: to build the castle and to uncover Trelleborg's secret!In Das Geheimnis von Trelleborg, players gain investigation points by investigating the secret. However, it is just as important to gain construction points by aiding in the construction of the castle and loyalty points by supporting life in the village.&#10;&#10;When the Stone Circle has been completed, the player who can contribute most to the construction of the castle wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with one planet dice to build expand his empire. Players roll planet dice for resources to build weapons (dice) and gain power. This power can be used to conquer planets from other players.&#10;Some free planets (dice) are in a common pool called &quot;Galaxy&quot;. When a player rolls a &quot;Transporter&quot; ship icon on his weapon dice, then she/he can capture a fresh planet to add to his empire.

Each space on the spinner has two colors with associated numbers. When the spinner lands on a spot, both cars with the appropriate color move the number of spaces indicated. (For example: There's a spinner spot that shows a yellow 5 and a blue 3. When the spinner lands on this spot, the Yellow Car moves five spaces, and the Blue Car moves three.&#10;&#10;Cars may change lanes if they have an unoccupied spot to move to. (A car that is boxed in my even move backwards to get free.) If two cars &quot;collide&quot; by occupying the same space, then the car that initiated the collusion is penalized two laps, and the car that got hit, one lap.&#10;&#10;The number of laps is determined by player agreement at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a board, four plastic cards, and an insert with a spinner and a series of peg holes to track the laps. (Some plastic pegs are also included.)&#10;&#10;There is no indication of copyright year on the box, but based on other similar titles by the same publisher, it was probably produced in the 1960s.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;You are a court gardener of the mythical Queen Semiramis. All plants have gotten mixed up and your task is to put them in such an order that neither plants of the same shape nor plants of the same color are standing next to one another. There is only one unoccupied space - and after solving the task, this space should be in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The fronts of the 24 cards show different starting positions. The first tasks can be solved within a relatively short time, but then they become increasingly more difficult.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": " The game board for Ennea consists of nine wooden squares, each with four holes on them and each having a different pattern of grooves that connect these holes to one another and to the edges of the square. Designer Michail Antonow has created six games that can be played on this game board, each of them lasting 10-15 minutes. Four of these games &ndash; Bockspringen (&quot;Leapfrog&quot;), Wie du mir... (&quot;What Goes Around...&quot;), Ber&uuml;hr mich nicht! (&quot;Don't Touch Me!&quot;) and Landung (&quot;Stop&quot;) &ndash; start with an assembled game board, while the other two &ndash; Die vier Quellen (&quot;The Four Springs&quot;) and Eine Insel entsteht (&quot;An Island Forms&quot;) &ndash; create the playing area from these squares over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10; Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Neun Quadrate, vor jedem Spiel neu angeordnet, machen die Faszination dieses Spieles aus, genauso wie die unterschiedlichen Spielm&ouml;glichkeiten!&#10;&#10;Viel T&uuml;ftelei und &Uuml;berlegung war notwendig, um Ennea entstehen zu lassen. 9 Quadrate mit g&auml;nzlich verschiedenen asymmetrischen Linien sollten es sein. Diese Linien mussten dann auch fortlaufend &uuml;ber alle Quadrate hinweg zusammen passen.&#10;&#10;Sechs verschiedene Spiele f&uuml;r 2 Personen hat Michail Antonow sich einfallen lassen. Die Spieldauer bewegt sich immer zwischen 10 und 15 Minuten, die Vielfalt ist trotzdem gro&szlig; - da dank des variablen Spielbretts kein Spiel wie das andere ist.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Abstract patriotic game, made at the start of WWII and trying to appeal mainly to young boys. Each player places his planes (pieces) in one corner, if a 4 player game, or in two corners if a 2 player game. Movement is one square at a time, with the objective to be the first to get all your planes first to the opposite side of the board. The gun placements in the middle of the board are out of bounds for the planes. If an enemy plane is next to one of your planes, you may fly over it, but, note, no planes are ever captured.&#10;The game has been inspired by Chinese Chequers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary&#10;&#10;This title includes 4 &quot;Exciting&quot; race games Grand Pree Road Race, Demolition Derby, Drag Race Championships, &amp; The 500 Mile Race. These games share some of the same components, but each game has a unique board, and two of the games have card decks just for them. It appears that none of these games were ever produced separately. All games may be played solo, or with a number of other players based on the game.&#10;&#10;Grand Pree Road Race&#10;&#10;Players use cars 1 through 12 and move the their cars around a game board track as instructed by a spinner and by use of a deck of cards that comes with the game. Special rules govern how many cars may occupy a space, and which car(s) get to move in the event of too may cars heading toward the same space. First player to pass the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;Demolition Derby&#10;&#10;Up to 30 cars may be included, although 10 players seems to me the suggested maximum. (This allows each player to control three cars.) Game is played on the Demolition Derby board which features some Safe spots where cars may not be hit.&#10;&#10;Cars move by means of a spinner (numbered 1 to 30) to determine which car is moved and a special deck of cards which determines distance and direction of movement. (Some cards allow for a choice about direction.) Since there is a set turn order, a player may end up moving an opponent's car.&#10;&#10;When a car passes onto or over another car, the stationary car takes a Hit. Cars that take three Hits are eliminated from the game and removed from play. A wipe-off scoreboard with a crayon and a felt eraser are included to keep track of Hits. Play continues until only one car remains.&#10;&#10;Drag Race Championships&#10;&#10;Again all 30 cars are used. The game uses the Drag Race board. Before play begins, the 1-30 spinner is used to determine which cars are in which Heats. Play progresses by using the 1-12 spinner which shows which color car is moved, along with the roll of a single die to determine distance. One car advances from each of the 6 Heats. A final round is played to determine the Champion.&#10;&#10;The 500 Mile Race&#10;&#10;This game is played on the box insert which shows an oval track with various Sequence Tables printed in the center. Game may be played with up to 30 players, each controlling an individual car. The game starts with the Sequence Marker on Sequence Table &quot;A&quot;. Two dice are rolled and the numbers are added together. (The Sequence Table contains results from 2 to 12.) The result of the Sequence Table tells which cars may be moved... these cars are all advanced 3 spaces on the track. In the next turn the Sequence Marker is advanced and Sequence Table &quot;B&quot; is used. The Sequence Marker moves each turn, and goes back to Table A again if the game last long enough. Some Sequence Table results show hazards like Crash, Pit Stop, etc. The 1-30 spinner is used to determine which car is affected.&#10;&#10;Four cars abreast stop cars behind them from advancing. However, there are a couple of spots on the board where cars are considered to crash if there are ever four cars on them. (This cuts down on the amount of log jams in a really crowded game.) Play continues until a car crosses the finish line. In the event of a tie, play continues until one car advances ahead of another.&#10;&#10;The (many) game elements for this title include: one double-sided rules sheet, 30 die-cut pressboard cars, a sequence marker, a double-sided game board (with the Grand Pree race board on one side, and the Demolition Derby and Drag Race boards on the other), a wipe-off scoreboard (for Demolition Derby), a crayon &amp; felt eraser, a 1-30 spinner, a 1-12 spinner, two 6-sided dice, a deck of 20 cards with an image of a tire on the back (for Grand Pree Road Race), &amp; a deck of 20 cards with checkered flags on the back (for Demolition Derby).&#10;&#10;No publication date is included with this title.&#10;&#10;",
