    "Description": "The Devil&rsquo;s Crown is a campaign for Fistful of Lead: Tales of Horror. The campaign is a series of 6 linked scenarios to be played in order. The outcome of each scenario has a direct effect on the next game. The player with the most Renown at the end of the campaign wins, and possesses the dark power of the crown.&#10;&#10;The scenario book also has rules for a new faction: Gypsies! Sometimes against, sometimes with the Forces of Darkness.&#10;&#10;And a printable catacomb for use with scenario book.&#10;&#10;&quot;Few know that the War in Heaven was only surpassed in length and ferocity by the War in Hell. Soon after the Fall, Lucifer was faced with a power struggle of his own. The Legions of the Damned fought a fierce civil war for the Infernal Throne that lasted untold ages.&#10;As a symbol of his victory over the fractious demons, the princes of Hell presented their Dread Lord with a crown. Forged in the very fires of Hell, the crown was a thing of terrible beauty, dripping with blood, and pulsing with malign power.&#10;Not long after the coronation, the crown was stolen, perhaps by a disgruntled devil of the losing faction. It was hidden, it was said, in the mortal world. Many have sought it, few, thankfully, have found it. Those who do, usually meet with an untimely and painful end.&rdquo;&#10;- From the writings of Brother Theodoseus, just before his mysterious death in 1563&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warr Without An Enemie is a set of wargame rules for the English Civil War developed by the Wyre Forest Gamers. The English Civil War is notable because of the large number of small actions that happened during the war. These provide a variety of interesting historical battles to fight. The player commands one to three 'brigades'. Brigades are usually 3 to 6 units, with 4 to 6 bases of figures per unit. For non historical battles brigades are generated randomly to provide interesting challenges and opportunities for the players.&#10;&#10;A base represents 60 to 100 infantry and half that for cavalry. The players decide how many figures to use per base and base size. Units lose bases of figures, not individual figures.&#10;&#10;The emphasis on the rules is on command and managing unit disruption caused by battlefield action. Quality of the commanders and units is usually more important than numbers or weapons. Raw units will need constant vigilance to keep them in the action while hardened Veterans will sort themselves out, dust themselves off and carry on. Commanders have different command rating and also can have individual qualities to reflect their character. A commander can thus be 'Steadfast' and good in defensive situations or a 'Drunkard' and a loose cannon. Units can receive disorder from movement, manoeuvre, combat, friendly units suffering reverses, etc. Disorder adversely effects a units abilities and after the limit is reached will lead to loses of bases. High quality units and good commander have a better ability to remove disorder.&#10;&#10;Infantry are rated in one of 7 categories, I1 to I7. The number indicates the number of muskets and pikes within the unit. I1 means the unit is an all musket unit, while an I7 unit is all pikes. Most units are of course in between these two extremes, two muskets to one pike is an I3 unit for example. All bases fire and melee so there is no need to exactly model the ratio of weapons. When firing you need to roll your I number or higher to hit, while if in melee you need you I number or lower to hit. In this way the mix of weapons within a unit is quickly reflected. For example: An I3 unit (2 muskets to 1 pike) needs to roll 3 or higher per base to hit when firing but an I5 unit (1 musket to 1 pike) must roll 5 or higher to hit. So when firing the I3 unit will have the advantage while in a melee the reverse is the case. In a close combat the I3 unit will need to roll 3 or less to hit, while the I5 unit will need 5 or less.&#10;&#10;There are four kinds of mainstream cavalry along with lancers and dragoons. The four kinds of cavalry allow the representation of the tactics of the period that is not possible in many other rules and is, like much of the rest of the rules, based on modern research of this fascinating period. 'Pistoleers' rely on firepower. 'Gallopers' rely on the reckless speed of their charge and the sword. While the dominant tactics of the war are the Dutch and Swedish styles of fighting. Entering combat at a high speed is an advantage but runs the risk of getting more disorder. Shooting the attackers can stop the aggressors in their tracks and leave them open to counter attack. Yet if it doesn't work.........&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to provide a set of rules that combine modern views of the war with an innovative and entertaining game. In the future the rules will be expanded to cover other wars and work on the Thirty Years War is well on the way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

That's why you need to take photos of them.&#10;&#10;Explore the island, take many photos but beware, dinosaurs are not used to visitors. Some will flee but other may find you tasty! You will not be able to show your photos when you're eaten. Also remember that it's not the quantity of photos that count but quality. Big and dangerous dinosaurs are worth more points than small, easier to find ones.&#10;&#10;Let the Dino Safari begin!&#10;&#10;During setup players are required to create the &quot;island&quot; using tiles with hexagonal spaces starting with &quot;camp&quot; tile. Once it's done 12 randomly chosen dinosaur tokens are randomly placed on &quot;nest&quot; spaces facing down. Then each player choose their character and place him/her in the camp. Players take their turns clockwise. During player's turn you have three movement points and one &quot;take a picture&quot; action. You can spend those in any order you want. Characters can move in any direction they want, &quot;plains&quot; space costs 1 movement point while &quot;forest&quot; space costs 2. You cannot enter &quot;crags&quot; or &quot;lake&quot; spaces. To take a photo move to a space adjacent to dinosaur token and uncover it then take the card with species you've uncovered. On each species card you can see how much points it's worth and its skills like movement points and special rules. Players can also take pictures of already uncovered dinos to get their cards but you can score only once for each species. Starting with round two after you're done with your character's actions you can move 1 uncovered dinosaur token (you must be in possession of that species card). You can use that to run away from other players, scare off another uncovered dinosaur to remove its token so nobody can take a picture of it anymore or, if it's a carnivore, attack other players. Attacked player loses one life and is forced to return to camp. If a character is attacked third time (losing last remaining life) he/she is considered &quot;eaten&quot; and eliminated from game (his/her score is 0 no matter how many cards were in his/her possession). From now on during eliminated player's turn he/she can only move dinosaurs. Game ends when all 12 tokens are uncovered. The sum of points on cards in your possession is your score. Highest score wins. There is also a chance that all players are eaten. In that rare case game ends and nobody wins.&#10;&#10;",

Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.&#10;&#10;The Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions.

He decided that the next day he would send a large strike out to the west of the garrison&rsquo;s position, tasked to capture a nest of AA batteries near the villages of Bang Ong Pet, and Ban Ban. The man he chose for the job was the most respected leader in the French garrison: Major Marcel Bigeard, affectionately known by a nick-name earned during his days in the resistance: Bruno. Behind a powerful barrage and ample air support the French attack came in. The 6th BPC (Colonial Parachute Battalion) struck Bang Ong Pet while the 8th BPC struck Ban Ban. The 8th achieved its objectives quickly, but the 6th was pinned down by stiff resistance. Three Chaffee tanks came up to reinforce the latter French assault and Viet Minh resistance soon gave way. When it was over the French were astounded at their success. Not only had they captured five 20mm AA-guns, twelve 12.7 AA MGs, and killed some 350 of the enemy, but they had done it against the elite 308th division, viewed by both armies to be the best unit the Viet Minh possessed.&#10;&#10;Game components include:&#10;&#10;9 maps measuring 18.5&quot; x 12.5&quot;&#10;3 countersheets (1 x Viet Minh, 1 x French Infantry/Light Weapons, 1 x Vehicles)&#10;9 AFV cards&#10;4 scenario cards containing 7 scenarios&#10;4 page battlefield walkaround&#10;1 page player aid&#10;&#10;The game depicts the action around the Eliane strongpoints of Dien Bien Phu.&#10;&#10;Scenarios included:&#10;&#10;The Battle for the &ldquo;Five Hills&rdquo; &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Eliane 1,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 31st 1954&#10;    In French Hands - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 31st 1954&#10;    Death by Pale Moonlight &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Champs Elysees,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 30th 1954&#10;    In the Shadow of Bazilles - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, May 6th 1954&#10;    The Last Day &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Elaine 4,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, May 7th 1954&#10;    Mop Up - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, April 2nd 1954&#10;    Under Old Baldy &ndash; Champs Elysees, French Indochina, April 4th 1954&#10;&#10;Requires ownership of the ATS Rulebook 2014 + small and large markers.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naval Command is a set of wargame rules for recreating naval battles with fleets of miniature warships and aircraft in the age of the guided missile and jet aeroplane. Covering the period from the late 1950s to the modern day or near future.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with fleets ranging in size form one or two ships per side to full sized battlegroups of ten or more ships. The rules can be used for different sizes of ships ranging from small fast attack craft up to super-carriers engaged in open sea battles or littoral and amphibious missions.&#10;&#10;The aim of these rules is to create a game that captures the feel and provides a fairly accurate recreation of modern naval engagements but is still relatively quick to play with reasonably sized fleets and does not require excessive bookkeeping and paperwork.&#10;&#10;New 2021 Edition&#10;This new version of the rules is the culmination of years of playing the game and the execellent feedback and expertise provided by the Naval Command Facebook group. As well as lots of small improvements and updates the follwing changes have been made:&#10;&#10;New system for submarine deployment, movement, and detection that will require players to carry out effective ASW tactics.&#10;The addition of altitude levels for aircraft and missiles meaning that different air defence systems now have more well defined roles.&#10;Improved missile and torpedo procedures&#10;Updated and expanded fleet lists.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer on wargamevault.com&#10;&#10;",

Afterwards, the power company collects income.&#10;&#10;The postcard shows 4 power plants.  In the first round, the player only collects income from the first plant.

    "Description": "You never thought your dream vacation would be like this!&#10;You were expecting lavish huts and guided tours. Instead you were dropped off to fend for yourself in a jungle full of wild animals. You've always stood up to face challenges, and it's no time to stop now. Can you summon your skills to master the animals, find the most food, and emerge &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;?&#10;Get ready, let's explore....&#10;&#10;In Amazing Jungle Run, you'll compete to be the first player to reach 9 points. Points are collected by earning &quot;fruit&quot; cards or the valuable Shaman card, which is worth 3 points all by itself.&#10;&#10;A players turn consists of three phases:&#10;&#10;     Action phase in which you can choose Resource cards, Peril cards, or peek at the bottom of main decks to see what may be hiding there.&#10;     Main phase in which you can choose to collect common cards(to gain 3 of a kind for special abilities) or &quot;point&quot; cards that get you closer to the win. Some resource cards allow you to do both in one turn. A player can manipulate decks with cards like &quot;hideaway&quot;, &quot;transport&quot;, or &quot;explore&quot; during this phase.&#10;     Defense phase in which you can keep a deck &quot;off limits&quot; or limit your opponents options with &quot;quicksand&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game invites imaginative play to form strategies, and tactical opportunities abound. The &quot;hidden&quot; knowledge aspect of being able to play from the bottom of decks keeps you on your toes.&#10;&#10;Tension builds as the decks dwindle, and the higher points cards (planted in the bottom half of decks during setup)start to appear.&#10;&#10;Have fun and be wary of pitfalls....it's a jungle out there.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player is the leader of a clan of Dwarves returning to a lost mountain kingdom. Players are competing with each other to remove threats, find artifacts, complete tasks, and earn honor. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game becomes the new King of the reclaimed mountain.&#10;&#10;It is fundamentally a worker placement game, but with many rules that increase player interaction. Players compete to recruit four different worker types as they also compete to utilize locations before their opponents.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of 20 halls, semi-randomly placed at the start of the game. The top 8 halls were undefended, but the lower 12 halls have threats that must be cleared before they can be accessed.&#10;&#10;Each hall has one or two labors that can be performed in them. Each labor requires a particular type of dwarf, and often will require a team of dwarves plus other resources to be completed. Each labor offers its own rewards, from honor or gold, or mine cards, or artifacts, or retaining more dwarves to a players palace.&#10;&#10;A particular labor can only be used from one to four times a year, so players are competing to use use labors before each other. Because labors have different requirements to complete, they are also competing to gather the types of dwarves needed for the labors they want to perform.&#10;&#10;There are four kinds of dwarves: Workers, Warriors, Craftsmen, and Nobles. They are generally used for the kinds of labors one might expect from their names.&#10;&#10;Unlike most worker placement games, the players do not have their own pieces. There are common pools of dwarves available, and the players take or assign dwarves from those common pools. One pool is a hall called The Commons, which has dwarves ready to work in them. Players can use one dwarf from The Commons on each of their turns. Dwarves are also in The Camp outside of the mountain, recovering or resting until  players recruit them to their palaces.&#10;&#10;Play goes around the table, with players selecting a labor they want to perform in a hall, or a threat they want to remove. When a threat is removed, the hall it guarded is revealed and the player effectively gets a free turn to be the first to perform a labor in the hall.&#10;&#10;Players can obtain mine cards that will have either gold, iron, gems or mithril. Gold is turned in immediately, while the other three are kept secret until they are used to complete a labor or a task.&#10;&#10;There are also Tasks which the players can complete to earn victory points, which generally require four or five resources.&#10;&#10;Artifacts may be gained in several ways, and provide victory points as well as the opportunity to attract a dwarf from the Camp when it is revealed. They are a way to hide your possible activities from your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five segments, each representing a year, though players can agree to shorter games by reducing the number of years played. A year ends when The Commons is empty of Dwarves and a player passes. That player will be the first player for the following year. Then the dwarves out in the halls return to The Commons to be available for the next year.&#10;&#10;Many of the threats have year-end effects that can remove dwarves from The Commons, remove them from the players' palaces, take gold or mine cards, re-close halls, or even remove a hall from the game.&#10;&#10;Players are also determining what kind of values the reclaimed kingdom will be known for. There are four Dwarven virtues - Military, Craft, Wealth, and Heritage. Players can promote these virtues by completing Tasks and performing Labors. The most promoted virtues can earn players bonus points at the end of the game for each Task they completed or Artifact they acquired associated with those virtues.&#10;&#10;The combination of randomly placed hidden halls and randomly placed threats with varying effects provides an enormous amount of replayability. Players need to consider the kinds of labors and threats that are present when devising their plans, as well as what dwarves are available in The Commons.&#10;&#10;It is a victory point gathering game. There are six ways to earn VP:&#10;Rewards for a Labor&#10;Completing a Task&#10;Acquiring Artifacts&#10;Clearing Threats&#10;Bonus points for clearing the most threats &#10;Bonus Points for matching Tasks and Artifacts to the most promoted Dwarven Virtues&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Random Ground Asset and Naval Vessel tables are also included. The solo game relies on regular playing cards to generate unknown hostile aircraft and ground assets, so prepare to be surprised!&#10;&#10;The Mercenary Air Campaign:&#10;&#10;Manage a group of fictitious Mercenaries as you purchase aircraft and ordnance, select missions, get paid and attempt to survive! This campaign runs on the basic Missile Threat rules, and is aimed at solo play but can easily be a co-operative game. Players start with a selection of pilots and a pool of funds and must purchase aircraft and ordnance from a weapons market. They then use what they have to fly available missions and if they succeed: get paid.&#10;&#10;The Mercenary air campaign is all about the &quot;rule of cool&quot; - you won't be limited to light attack aircraft, but rather any aircraft around in your chosen theater, period and faction. The campaign uses the Complete Aircraft &amp; Ordnance List provided with the Missile Threat rules, and allows you to buy and fly many of the more unusual or lesser used aircraft from the last 60 years, as well as the regulars.&#10;&#10;The Mercenary air campaign has 3 difficulty options, ranging from easy mode with 4 pilots and a sh*tload of cash, to the hard mode of a lone wolf pilot with the last of his savings.&#10;&#10;There are 5 different periods to choose from: 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s+&#10;&#10;Each period has 5 different theaters to play in: Balkans/Eastern Europe, Central/South Africa, Middle East, South America, and South-East Asia&#10;&#10;Each theater has 2 factions you can work for: Either the government or the rebels.&#10;&#10;In this way there are 50 different options for playing the campaign. You could be working for the rebels in South America in the 1990s, or working for the government in the Middle East in the 1960s. Each option has a customized random aircraft and ordnance table to reflect the period, theater and alignment. That's 100 D66 tables!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When you arrived at the old port, you could see immediately that the submarine was not in the offered condition. This junk box was never worth 1.2 million euros!

At the beginning of each round 5 ships are loaded with 2 fruit tiles, and set sail for 4 ports within the city. Normally, on a player's turn they'll dock one of the available ships at an open port, and unload a fruit tile into that section of the city, thereby establishing a market. The remaining fruit tile is added to the player's stockpile. Each player controls a gang of 6 ragamuffins, of which only 4 will be deployed within the city each game. These ragamuffins are tasked with stealing from specific markets. These targets are hidden from the other players. At the end of the game, the player who manages to increase the demand for their stockpile the most, via robbing the various markets in the city, is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is the fourth entry in the Wars of Empire series.&#10;&#10;Following the defeat of the French regular army in the frontier battles, the surrounding of Marshal Bazaine in Metz and the defeat and capture of Napoleon III at Sedan the war was expected to end. Instead The French Empire was overthrown and a new Republic created to carry on the war.&#10;&#10;With astounding speed new French armies were formed to continue the war using remnants of the old army, the garde mobiles and depot companies not overrun by the Germans. With these they attempted to harass and defeat the Germans besieging Paris. The Germans were themselves tied down in the siege of Metz and Paris and thus only had a small number of forces to hold back the French. It was to be a close run thing.....&#10;&#10;Scope: Included are a set of corps and army level figure rules with a full colour Campaign system to fight the war. Thus your battles will have a context of when and why they were fought. There is also a system for fighting one-off battles.&#10;&#10;Game Aids: 67 pages gamebook of the history, campaign and battlefield rules, 2 pages of game and unit counters, 2 pages of French and Germans orders of battle, page of Campaign Action Cards, Campaign Calendar, Off map display for sieges of Paris and Metz, 2 Page Playsheet, Battlefield options cards, 3 pages of battlefield Fate Cards, 2 page Line of March Cards and 4 x A4 or 2 x A3 Colour Campaign Maps.&#10;&#10;Scales&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ground Scale: 1&rdquo; = 100 metres.

The onus is on the Prussian&rsquo;s and their allies to advance against the Austrian allies in West Germany as well as cross into Bohemia and seek a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;Depending on the campaign results the Diplomatic Chart will influence the political stance of Britain, Russia, France and Denmark. It can also affect the deployment of Prussian Landwehr, and a possible local armistice in the German States or Italy. Thus you cannot ignore the political dimension of the conflict.

    "Description": "You've finally fulfilled your lifelong dream, to open a bar! But when you go to tell your friends, you discover they have also opened bars, in the same town even! So in the spirit of good natured rivalry, you'll stock your bars with the best beer and attract the town's best customers. May the best bar win!&#10;&#10;Draft Beer is a pick and pass drafting game for 2-6 players, taking approximately 20 minutes to play. There are three rounds where you draft 8 cards, and at the end of each round you will use those cards to attract customers from the town to your bar to score points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The cards are double-sided with the front having beers and food that you draft, while the back has the various customers in the town. Each round, players are dealt 8 cards to draft, and 5/6/7 customers will be dealt into the &quot;town&quot; (depending on round). Beer cards have 3 symbols, representing qualities: color, price and taste. These qualities each have 3 possibilities; light, dark, cheap, malty, etc... Customer cards have a point value, and one or two qualities they are looking for. So they may want cheap, light beers, or maybe dark expensive beers. After all the cards have been drafted, players will reveal their bar's selection, then go through the customers one by one to determine which bar they go to. The player whose bar has the most symbols they want is where they will go, and on a tie they will patronize both bars equally (awarding VP chits to all tied players).  Customers are kept until the end of the game for scoring.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are two other kinds of cards: salty snacks and bar food. These can attract customers, and are kept between rounds to score you points at the end of the game. The players with the most of each will get points.&#10;&#10;Once all three rounds have completed, the player with the most points has the most successful bar and is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
