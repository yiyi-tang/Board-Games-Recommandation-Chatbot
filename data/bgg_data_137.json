Each year there are exactly enough resources to fulfill and the players have to decide which resources to claim for themselves.  It's a simultaneous selection of the resources, so you don't know what the others are choosing.  Sometimes you don't quite fill all your energy needs, so you have to buy resources from other players or the bank to cover.  Action and event cards modify the energy market from year to year, and clever play of these cards can turn the tide of the game.  The player with the most cash at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Even though the game says it supports up to 5 players, the fifth player's responsibility is to be the banker.&#10;&#10;",

Casper) Ryx written by a Polish writer Mariusz Wollny.&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of gangs ringleaders, who fight for the title of the King of Beggars, the ruler of the Cracow underworld. The winner will be the one who at the end of the game will have the highest value of points of influence (respect). The players score points by performing tasks described on the objective cards which they are drawing at the start of each turn. Many objectives will require a capture of taverns, which will become bases of operation for players and will allow to take control over districts of the Renaissance Cracow.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into 4 phases. Income, Action, Objective phase, and Investigation. With the passage of time and the disclosure of new crimes conducted by players, both the time and investigation marker, which start at the opposing end of the time-investigation track, will move closer to each other. When they meet the game ends and the player who scores most points of influence will be the new King of Beggars.&#10;&#10;A 2 players variant follows a somewhat different principles. The map of Cracow is limited to 6 districts, players do not use time/investigation track as well as the influence track. Instead they compete for fulfillment of the 4 explicit objectives drawn from separate &quot;duel deck&quot; set next to the board. Upon completion of a task, the player takes the duel card to his pool and draws new one to replace the one he took. The player who first accumulates 4 objective cards wins the game. Thanks to these modifications the game is as playable as the 3-5 players variant, but much shorter.&#10;&#10;",

If the entire tower falls on your turn, you have to collect all the pieces, including any left standing. No one is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;40 unique shapes. No two stacks are the same. It&rsquo;s nail-biting. Surprising. Delightful.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cysmic is an epic sci-fi strategy wargame set amidst a crumbling planet. Players assume the role of one of the factions on the planet that is fighting desperately to survive. Throughout the game, players gather resources, capture enemy units, and work to construct their colony ship. Once built, the colony ship must be launched once all of your units are evacuated. The faction to do so first not only escapes with their lives but also ends up destroying the planet with the force of their ship's ignition. There are no points in Cysmic. The winner is the player who completes the objective first.&#10;&#10;THE STORY:&#10;&quot;The Space Exploration Expedition Network (SEEk) selected several leaders in various fields to lead an odyssey to Kepler-62e for terraforming and civilization planning. Some of the members were chosen and funded by the World Council while others self-financed their way to have influence or presence in the new world. Industry experts, religious leaders, entertainers, scholars, businessmen, politicians, and entrepreneurs all took part in the mission. Once there, the project worked beautifully at first. The different groups of people lived and worked together as a familiar society with all of the benefits and growing pains one would expect from a newly formed civilization. It had its share of infighting and corruption, but even those issues never threatened the delicate balance of this new world. It was slowly becoming the utopia many had hoped it would.&#10;&#10;As the project moved forward, an unexpected instability in the terraforming process started wreaking havoc on the landscape. The news broke quickly that their efforts to terraform and create a better world had destabilized the planet. Their new Eden was doomed.&#10;&#10;When the colonists realized there was no hope in saving their dream of a new civilization, chaos broke out among the hundreds of thousands of people as they turned to their respective leaders for salvation. Those in leadership roles... either voted in by public opinion, volunteered at will, ascended through capitalism, or ordained by faith... now rise to the occasion as wartime leaders.&#10;&#10;Massive Terraformers that once bent the landscape to their will have now been taken over by powerful organizations and converted into colony ship construction and launch platforms. These rival factions compete for information and resources across the dying planet as their last hope to escape offworld in the original Colony Ship plans that brought them there to begin with.&#10;&#10;After society splintered, the information splintered with it. Each faction holds part of the module plans to build the colony ship but must retrieve the others to finish their build. Instead of working together, they now battle for resources and information. Workers and civilians are hastily trained in combat to protect the individual faction bases from each other while still performing their regular job duties. Soldiers are tasked with capturing enemies with the knowledge of providing blueprints for the construction of the colony ship modules.&#10;&#10;Once the leaders obtain the blueprints and construct their colony ship, they must launch it before the impending destruction of their homeworld. The immense energy exerted from a single colony ship launch will likely doom the rest. Which faction will gain the resources necessary to escape first?&#10;If this new world war doesn&rsquo;t destroy this utopia, the planet surely would.&quot;&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:&#10;Gameplay consists of managing your empire until you can safely evacuate your people offworld. Players must recruit units, explore their surroundings, wage war against enemies, manage their economy, and obtain the resources necessary to construct their Colony Ship. The game is played in rounds made up of 5 turns per round. Each turn, players play one Unit card or Tactic card and then perform a bonus action. Each round ends when all players complete 5 turns. The next round starts with whomever currently holds the first player token.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE FOR WINNING THE GAME:&#10;Be the first player to build their colony ship and launch off the planet. Be careful evacuating your units before launching or else your conscience may not allow you to leave.&#10;&#10;",

It is based around actual events and the US OpPlan 32 plus various histories of the war.&#10;&#10;The game offers players a wide range of strategic options to choose from.  Optional rules and events allow nuclear weapon use, Soviet and Chinese participation and much more.&#10;&#10;Also included are introductory land combat scenarios covering the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the Chinese attack on North Vietnam in 1979. Operation Linebacker II is provided as an advanced air rules familiarization scenario.&#10;&#10;(from the first edition's introduction)&#10;&#10;&#10;Victory in Vietnam has appeared in two editions:  Microgame Design Group printed and published the first edition as a DTP edition, with unmounted counters and somewhat minimalist (but still very nice looking) components, and later Schutze Games republished the game as a more professional printing, with mounted and die-cut counters, a larger rulebook incorporating accumulated errata and Q&amp;A, and additional components such as cardstock event cards.  The core of the game remained the same across the two versions, but the Victory in Vietnam II edition has enhanced components and additional rules and scenarios.&#10;&#10;Components of the MDG edition (Victory in Vietnam):&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 11&quot; x 17&quot; game map&#10;     1 sheet of 280 single sided playing counters&#10;     1 rules booklet (16 pages)&#10;     5 black &amp; white player aid sheets with various tables&#10;         1 two-sided game charts sheet&#10;         1 Victory Point Schedule&#10;         1 two-sided Political Events sheet&#10;         1 Communist Set-up Sheet&#10;         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet&#10;    &#10;     1 cover sheet&#10;&#10;&#10;Components of the Schutze Games edition (Victory in Vietnam II):&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 29.7mm x 42mm game map&#10;     1 sheet of 308 single sided die-cut playing counters&#10;     1 rules booklet (24 pages)&#10;     4 full-color player aid sheets with various tables&#10;         2 game charts sheets (1 black &amp; white)&#10;         1 Communist Set-up Sheet&#10;         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet&#10;    &#10;     5 two-sided cardstock event card sheets (must be cut apart prior to play)&#10;     1 scenario booklet/victory point schedule (8 pages)&#10;     1 cover sheet&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the 8th December 1941 American soil was invaded for the first time in the war, the small American and Guananian garrison was overrun and 2 days later the Govenor surrendered the Island to the Japanese. On 21st July 1944 the Americans would return to retake the island and drive the Japanese invaders off; a day that is still celebrated as 'Liberation Day'.&#10;&#10;There were many reasons why the Americans decided to invade Guam not least of which was the fact that the station of the trans-Pacific cable and the naval radio station at Agana made it a focal point of the communication network in the Pacific. It also had the best anchorage in the Marianas, 2 airstrips and, of course, it was an American Protectorate.&#10;&#10;The only beaches suitable for an invasion are located on the south-western side of the island. The Japanese knew this as well and had prepared accordingly. Another thing unique to the planning was that the 2 landing beaches chosen would be 7 miles apart. It was unprecedented for two landing forces to land with such a wide separation.&#10;&#10;Guam &ndash; Return to Glory will be the second game to utilize the Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 4 maps.&#10;&#10;The game will come with 6 scenarios and 1 campaign game:&#10;&#10;W-Day &ndash; Fortune favors the bold &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the northern beaches. 3rd Marine Division must land against Japanese defenders dug-in on a ridge overlooking the beaches. Single map and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;W-Day &ndash; Send in the Fire Brigade &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the southern beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north towards Orote Peninsular to join up the to beachheads. Single map and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;W-DAY - This is the first day of the Invasion on the both beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north, whilst the 3rd Marines fight their way south and the two forces try to join up the two beachheads near Orote Peninsular. Two maps and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;Orote Peninsular &ndash; The first 8 days of the fighting saw the Americans expand their beachheads and join up so as to cut off the Orote peninsular with it's important airfield. Once it was cut off, the Americans, then, had to force their way into the heaviest defended area on Guam not knowing that the Japanese were preparing a Sake fueled Banzai charge. Two maps and 72 turns long.&#10;&#10;Into the Jungle - This scenario covers 3rd Marine Division's drive north of the beachheads to take the town of Agana and the airfield at Tiyan. One map and 27 turns long.&#10;&#10;Santa Rosa - This scenario covers 77th Infantry Division's attack to isolate the area around Mount Santa Rosa . One map and 27 turns long.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Guam &ndash; The full historical campaign from 21st July- 10th August (188 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Guam in 1944, from the first invasion at Asan, in the north, and Agat, in the south through the vicious fighting in the thick vegetation at the south end of the island and the final Japanese stand in the north.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability:8&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours&#10;&#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters&#10;&#10;Unit Scale: Companies and below&#10;&#10;Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 2-35 hours&#10;&#10;Series Designer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;Game Designer: Ross Mortell&#10;&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;Artist: Antonio Pinar Pe&ntilde;a&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;4 maps&#10;&#10;6 countersheets&#10;&#10;1 series Rulesbook&#10;&#10;1 game specific rulesbook&#10;&#10;7 player aids, charts, tables cards&#10;&#10;2 ten-sided dice&#10;&#10;1 Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;",

If you jump an opponent's piece, you capture it, flipping the piece so that it shows your color. That piece now belongs to you and can be moved by you on subsequent turns.

You can move a piece into the &quot;Sacrifice Zone&quot; &ndash; the exterior ring surrounding the playing space &ndash; in order to make a capture. Governors that do so remain out of play for the rest of the game, while an Ambassdor can be brought back into play by moving a Governor to the opponent's back line.)&#10;&#10;",

What if there were more than gold to protect?&#10;&#10;In the tile-collection game Dragon Keeper: The Dungeon, you embody these keepers and must capture the adventurers who invade the rooms of the dungeon &mdash; yet you must remain faithful to your guild by avoiding capturing its members. Once you have repelled the assaults, you give to the dragon as a tribute a part of the adventurers you caught&hellip;&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game contains tiles in five different colors and different values. These tiles represent the adventurers who want steal the plunder of the dragon. You are responsible for removing these adventurers from the dungeon. Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild. Every tile of this color brings them negative points. Players stack their collected tiles by color, and at the end of the game, the tallest stack is removed. If this stack is the player's guild color, then the player must discard the next tallest stack instead. Players then sum the values of their tiles, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wadi is situated in the heat and drought of the ancient Egypt desert. Water is scarce and you try to build your Shadoof (a sort of waterpump) as close to the Wadi as possible. A wadi, however, is a desert river. Water flows though it for only a small part of the year. The rest of the time it is dry. In the short wet period, you try to pump as much water as possible to the water reservoirs. Preferably in the vicinity of fertile land, because the more fertile the land, the better the harvest. And the better the harvest, the more points a player earns.&#10;&#10;But... other players might have noticed the same good spot, where you want to build your shadoof. And when you build your shadoof there, they won&rsquo;t help you fill the water reservoirs. But if you hesitate too long, the other players might pump dry the Wadi. Or worse, the water streams down the wadi and the land close to your shadoof remain dry and barren.&#10;&#10;There are a few scenarios for Wadi delivered with the game. They bring a lot of variety.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Players build their shadoofs on the land tiles. Each shadoof can pump water pawns from the river bed or from another land tile that lies in the vicinity of that shadoof (vicinity = water pawn lies on his own tile or on an adjacent tile). In his turn a player can carry out two actions. He can either:&#10;&middot; Build 1 shadoof first and then pump 1 water pawn (or vice versa)&#10;OR&#10;&middot; Pump 2 water pawns.&#10;&#10;Round after round players build shadoofs and/or pump water pawns. At the end of each round, the water that is still in the river bed, flows downstream. This means, that all the water pawns in the river beds are moved downstream 1 river tile.&#10;When the river bed is completely empty, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Players earn points per shadoof. Every landtile surrounding the shadoof (including its own tile) with a water pawn on it brings 1, 2 or 3 points, depending on the fertility of the land. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players &quot;fight&quot; to get water pawns near their shadoofs and for the places to build their shadoofs. They also try to profit from water pawns that other players pumped on to the land tiles. Because of the placing rules (not explained here) this is not always as easy as it looks.&#10;&#10;All in all Wadi is a quick, tactical game. With 2 players it is a bit more strategic.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ready to Rock! is the first party game set at a concert, and everyone wants to be the first rocker who reaches the stage. To maximize the concert feel, pictures taken at real concerts are used on the cards and guitar picks are the player pawns!&#10;&#10;While Ready to Rock! is a pure card game, it also uses mechanisms of placement games. The rockers play their route cards, which represent the audience, then they move in different directions through the crowd so that in each match rockers will reach the front row through different paths.&#10;&#10;Moreover to advance in every gig, rockers must obstruct other players' progress, perhaps pushing others back by using a special card or blocking their way with a wall card. What creates walls at a concert? Obviously the Mosh Pit, the Hell's Angels, and the Headbangers! A rocker once blocked should not despair as he can always change the direction of the crowd to open up new paths to move in other directions. In addition, Body Surfing might help you pass the obstacle and run toward the stage!&#10;&#10;In the game, each rocker starts with four cards and can draw one card each turn. During his turn, he can play at most two cards. Cards are divided in three types: routes and walls &ndash; which have already been explained &ndash; and instants. The latter are bonuses he can use for himself (e.g., if you get &quot;beer&quot;, then you can draw two cards, or with &quot;flashing tits&quot; a player can use three cards in a turn) or against one opponent, such as &quot;ear plug&quot; (which makes him skip a turn), and &quot;smashed beer&quot; (which makes him discard two cards). There are also &quot;Ready to Rock!&quot; card, special cards that activate one of the stage cards to generate unforeseen effects on all rockers: &quot;special guest&quot; forces every rocker to draw one card, while &quot;shitty weather&quot; makes everyone discard one card and &quot;fire explosion&quot; muddles everything up by rotating all the path cards 180&ordm;.&#10;&#10;Ready to Rock! is a game with a unique real setting and is easy to learn, although some strategy tips are essential to win the game. Given the content of some cards, the game is not suitable for children: for instance, in &quot;lots of beer&quot; there's a guy drinking two beers at once and in &quot;flashing tits&quot; a girl shows her tits to the entire stadium. It's perfect, however, by the age of 14!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lamb saddle? Tuna steak? Or maybe lobster with herb sauce?&#10;&#10;TOP Kitchen is a delightful board game about managing the kitchen and menu in a gourmet restaurant for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes the role of a Chef and competes for the greatest prestige. To achieve the goal they prepare gourmet dishes, for which they need to acquire all the necessary ingredients and seasonings in an exciting rivalry for the best prices.&#10;&#10;With all the groceries and additional helpful appliances ready Chefs must hurry to cope with incoming orders. Cooking is represented by joyful dice rolling to which you can apply certain modifiers. Thanks to the &quot;Action Deck&quot; cards each Chef can use instant bonuses to boost their own or meddle in the opponents dishes with unpleasant incidents. Some of these cards are simple improvements for your own kitchen. However you can also invest these cards for future profit. The chef who gathers the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;The game last 2 to 4 rounds, each divided into three phases. &#10;Phase 1 - Preparation - each player gets 5 randomly selected Action Cards (75 available), some guaranteed income and chooses 3 to 5 menu cards (60 available). Each menu card represents a dish which becomes part of your restaurant menu. &#10;Phase 2 - Groceries/Shopping - the players place their bids and the highest bidder gets to start the shopping. At this stage players acquire ingredients (represented by 90 colored d6 dice) necessary to prepare the dishes and special seasoning (15 cards), which are laid out on the market board. &#10;Phase 3 - the players use a small plastic frying pan as a dice rolling tray and the active player marker. One by one the players roll the dice representing different ingredients and try to achieve success. Incoming orders are being managed in the cooking table placed on the players board. If a player manages to successfully finish the dish he/she is rewarded with some money and most importantly prestige (much higher if one uses the spices).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We Were Brothers is the ultimate WWII infantry warfare board game and the first cross-over wargame. The game covers thirty historical missions for U.S., Wehrmacht, British and Italian armies from the three landings theaters in Italy: Operation Husky, Operation Avalanche and Operation Shingle.&#10;&#10;We Were Brothers is a cross-over wargame because it effectively blends elements from several game categories. From the wargame it shares historical, technical and tactical accuracy. Every wargamer, from the newbie to the expert one, will be delighted with the level of detail and all the classic elements as LOS, covers, scattering, different weapons, roles, suppressive fire, opportunity fire, off-board artillery support and Clos Air Support, etc. However, the original lean game mechanics Alea Struggle System allows does not use any table, ruler or other complicate measurement method, making the game fast, deep and easy to learn, yet challenging to master.&#10;&#10;Between each scenario the random mission generator allows recreating your own historically accurate scenarios in order to complete your personal day-by-day race to Rome: you can generate your soldiers and squad, each one with his own skills and background, put them into battle and see how they evolve in terms of skills as they survive from mission to mission.&#10;&#10;The miniatures inside the box and the whole game system is in 1:72 scale. In this way, any add-on to the game in terms of sceneries, vehicles, miniatures and props can be easily purchased by any model store, such as at www.wbsgames.com&#10;&#10;Each player leads a team of four men, including one specialist, and fights against the opponent, in cooperation with other teams to form a Squad. The Combat and movement system is very lean since you don't need rulers, tables, charts as the usual wargames, yet it is very historically, technically and physically accurate to be enjoyed by hardcore wargamers. For its mechanisms, the game concentrates on suppression fire/moving and cover to cover maneuvers, simulating the real WWII tactics as well as assaulting impulse.&#10;&#10;We Were Brothers is a game system that will be enriched by the Armoured Combat expansion and other operation theaters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You may be the greatest hero the isles have ever seen: your cunning unmatched; your ingenuity unfailing; your leadership unquestioned.  You have no equal...aside from your sibling.&#10;&#10;As half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power.&#10;&#10;From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.&#10;&#10;The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.&#10;&#10;Whispers of the Muse | Omen Game 3 is a standalone card game for two players.&#10;&#10;Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.&#10;&#10;Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City become Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).&#10;&#10;The turn structure is broken into five Steps:&#10;&#10;WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!&#10;&#10;SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.&#10;&#10;PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.&#10;&#10;WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).&#10;&#10;OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.&#10;&#10;While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Set in 1926, you are an unsuccessful gangster in a petty town. Tired of doing small jobs that only earn stress and scars, you dream of putting the hype on big time. The rumble on the street is the big guys in the big cities are pulling the big dough, and you want to be the most prestigious of them all.&#10;&#10;Crimopolis is a fast-paced strategy board game about bean-shooters, chippies, and sugar in a city where nothing counts but underground influence. Recruit criminals, explore the city, execute illicit jobs, ambush others, and take over their assets. Grow your skills and abilities, so you can counteract when reporters and enemies get in the way.&#10;&#10;Players explore a city area by moving gangsters further and further away from their headquarters. Tiles feature streets and city blocks with parks, banks, graveyards, churches, lakes, etc. Players assemble gangsters and execute jobs. The trickier the job the more prestige they earn. Taking over other players' assets also gains prestige as well as end game contributions such as city influence, body count, and hidden skills. The player with the most prestige wins.&#10;&#10;Crimopolis is a mixture of a Eurogame featuring strategy with multiple winning paths and downplaying luck, and an Amerigame allowing for an immersive 1920s gangster theme with direct player conflict and highly intuitive rules. The game length can be freely adjusted: shorter games increase luck, longer games deepen gameplays. The recommended game length balances both and allows for family game nights with players of different ages.&#10;&#10;Crimopolis was awarded Best Physical Game of 2020 by NZ Games Festival.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Horus Lupercal, Warmaster of the Emperor's armies, has turned against his gene-father and sent the Imperium spiralling into bloody civil war. Of the eighteen great Space Marine Legions, finest of all humanity's soldiers, fully half have sided with the traitorous Warmaster, while the remainder stand staunchly loyal to the Emperor.

    "Description": "In Flowers: A Mandala Game, your goal is to collect flower tiles by achieving majorities through clever card play. Skillfully build mandalas to claim the best tiles, combining and multiplying them to create exquisite flowers of your own!&#10;&#10;To set up, layout the game cloth showing three large &quot;mandala&quot; flowers. Shuffle the 36 half-flower tiles in separate decks &mdash; 18 each of black and white, with the black flowers being gray, purple, and red on the opposite side and the white ones being green, orange, and yellow &mdash; then place one black tile and one white tile face up in each flower. Each player starts with a hand of cards, with the cards coming in six colors that match the flower tile colors.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same color onto one of the flowers. (Each player keeps their played cards separate, facing toward themselves.) If that color is already present in the mandala, the player then flips the card(s) face down; if not, the player leaves them face up. If the player laid down one card, they draw two cards from the deck; if they played two or more, they don't draw any cards.&#10;&#10;After playing, if you have at least one face-up card on a flower and more cards than any other player, take that flower's &quot;claim&quot; token and place it on your cards. Then, if that flower now has all six colors face up around it, destroy the mandala. Whoever has the claim token on their cards places one of the flower tiles from this mandala in front of themselves; if they already have a flower tile of the same color, they flip this &quot;complete&quot; flower face down. Whoever has the secondmost cards on this mandala takes the second flower tile. Anyone who took a flower tile discards all of their played cards on this mandala; everyone else returns their played cards to their hand. Draw a black tile and white tile from the stack to create a new mandala.&#10;&#10;Continue play until someone completes their third flower, then everyone scores their points. Each separate flower half is worth as many points as the number of flowers on it. For each complete flower, if one of the tiles is 3x, triple the number of flowers on the other tile; if both tiles have flowers, double the number of flowers on the tile with fewer flowers. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played over a number of rounds, with each player having a chance to play as the dealer. Each round plays out as follows:&#10;&#10;&bull; Each player gets a hand of a joker and seven random cards, which come in four actor suits. The dealer then arranges the separate actor cards in order to determine the rank of the suits, while also determining whether low or high cards are best.&#10;&#10;&bull; The dealer leads to the first trick, and all players must follow suit, if possible &mdash; except that one non-lead player can play their joker instead of matching suit. When someone plays a joker, they place one of their player cards face down above one of the actor cards; their player card is a bet that they will win 1, 2, or 3 tricks, and the actor they played above is a bet that their final card will be that color. Additionally, they can either flip the High/Low card to affect which numbers are best or swap two adjacent actor cards to change the rank of the suits.&#10;&#10;&bull; Whoever played the highest/lowest card in the highest rank wins the trick, then leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;&bull; After seven tricks, players reveal their bets and score: 1 point per trick captured, 1 or 2 points for correctly bidding the number of tricks they won, and 1 point if their final card matches the actor card they chose. Alternatively, if a player's last card is their joker and they won zero tricks, they earn 5 points.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score after adding the scores from each round wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Kabuki Tricks is the second title of the Shiba Senpai game series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take your musician band to the stage, and join with the other bands, to form an orchestra!&#10;Draft the best instruments available in your game, place them in an ideal locations for their acoustics, and then, play ... the Symphony (as well as scoring more victory points)!&#10;Every instrument plays in a different way, every music sheet is different, and every games sublime!&#10;&#10;Each Symphony game is divided into two phases: Orchestra Phase and Symphony Phase.&#10;&#10;1) During the Orchestra Phase, the Orchestra is formed by placing the Instrument cards on the boards, and the players gradually take possession of the instruments they prefer. In turn order, every player play an instrument card on the board, choose an instrument and place its note discs on the choosen instrument. Each instrument plays a fixed number of notes and has two kind of abilities: an ability always-on, and another that is activated only if the instrument is placed in the proper location for its acoustics.&#10;&#10;2) During the  Symphony Phase, the so arranged orchestra plays the music score, which is modular, and therefore different in each game. The orchestra is divided into 5 columns, and each column plays in a specific part of the score (for example, column A plays in the first 2 bars, column B in the second, third and fourth, and so on). When a column of instruments has finished its notes, the next column plays, and so on. Within a column, the lower instrument start playing a note, then the instrument immediately above plays a note, and so on, upward. Once at the top, the lower instrument plays again, and so on, until all the notes of the column are played. Obviously the player who has their note disks on the instrument controls is it, and decide where to place the related disks to score VPs. In this way, the game is not subdivided in player tyrns, but rather into instrument turns.&#10;&#10;The main aim is to play better than their opponents (= score more VPs), so it is not important to play many notes, but play them properly. First, each note provides VPs according to the Voice that is placed on (1-3 VPs). Secondly, there are extra VPs for the Sheet note majorities (at the completiion of each sheet) and Voice note majorities (at the end of game). Also, different areas or notes on the music score are Scoring Areas, and grant you to advance on corresponding Scoring Tracks to score extra PV at the end of the game. Finally, some notes, as well as the placement of the initial instruments, provide yous Bonuses, that can be placed on your instruments (max 1 for Instrument) to potentiate their effects. So, to play better in such melodious context requires a careful strategy and good tactics.&#10;&#10;Type: Eurogame&#10;Target: soft gamers (Base mod.) / hard gamers (Advanced mod.)&#10;Modalities: Basic and Advanced&#10;&#10;&#10;Porta la tua compagnia sul palco, e fonditi con le altre, a formare un'Orchestra!&#10;Drafta gli strumenti migliori a disposizione in ogni partita, piazzali nella posizione ideale per la loro acustica, ed infine suona ... la Sinfonia (cos&igrave; da totalizzare pi&ugrave; Punti Vittoria)!&#10;Ogni strumento suona in un modo diverso, ogni Spartito &egrave; diverso, ogni partita sublime!&#10;&#10;Ogni partita a Symphony &eacute; divisa in 2 Fasi: la Fase Orchestra e la Fase Sonata.&#10;&#10;1) Durante la fase Orchestra, l'Orchestra viene formata disponendo le carte Strumento, ed i giocatori, gradualmente, prendono possesso degli Strumenti che preferiscono, piazzando, a turno i propri dischi nota, sullo Strumento che scelgono. Ogni Strumento suona un numero prefissato di note e dispone di due abilit&agrave;: una sempre attiva, e l'altra che &egrave; attiva solo se lo Strumento &egrave; piazzato opportunamente, in una posizione appropriata per la sua acustica.&#10;&#10;2) durante la fase Suonata, l'Orchestra cos&igrave; formata suona sullo Spartito, che &egrave; modulare, e quindi diverso in ogni partita. L'Orchestra &egrave; divisa in colonne, e ciascuna colonna, suona in una parte specifica dello spartito (ad esempio, la colonna A suona nelle prime 2 battute). Quando una colonna di Strumenti ha terminato le proprie note, suona la colonna successiva, e cos&igrave; via. All'interno di una colonna, suona prima una nota lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, poi una nota quello subito sopra, e cos&igrave; via, a salire. Arrivati in cima, riparte lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, e cos&igrave; via, fino ad esaurire le note della Colonna. Chiaramente il giocatore che ha i propri dischi su uno Strumento, lo controlla, e decide dove piazzare le relative note per ottenere i PV. In questo modo il gioco non ha una normale suddivisione di turni dei giocatori, quanto piuttosto una suddivisione in turni degli Strumenti.&#10;&#10;Dato che lo scopo &egrave; suonare meglio dei propri avversari (ovvero realizzare pi&ugrave; PV), non &egrave; importante suonare tante note, ma suonarle opportunamente. Innanzitutto ogni nota fornisce PV in base alla Voce su cui &egrave; piazzata. Secondariamente, vi sono dei PV extra per le maggioranze di Foglio (al termine di ogni Foglio) e di Voce (a fine partita). Inoltre, diverse aree dello Spartito sono Aree Punteggio, che fanno avanzare su appositi Tracciati Punteggio e forniscono PV extra a fine partita. Infine, alcune note, cos&igrave; come il piazzamento degli Strumenti iniziali, forniscono dei bonus Musicista, che possono essere piazzati sui propri Strumenti (max 1 per Strumento) per potenziarne gli effetti. A causa di tutto ci&ograve;, prevalere in un simile contesto melodioso richiede un'attenta strategia ed una buona tattica.&#10;&#10;Tipologia: Tedesco                                               Target: soft gamers (mod.

The theme is from Dreamworks&acute; movie Madagascar 3.&#10;&#10;Madagascar Catan Junior takes place on Madagascar island where 2 to 4 players build circus tents and wagons along the fields of the island. Using the appropriate side of the map either 2 or 3/4 players can join as the characters from the movie: Alex, Gloria, Marty or Melman.&#10;&#10;Each field generates a specific resource from the game theme: Wood, bags of sand, popcorn, wool or nice juice cocktails. Each player starts with two circus tents on a specific spot on the island, and they can use the resources they acquire to build tents, wagons or get help from the Pinguins. By setting up more tents, they can expand their network; the more tents they build, the more resources they may receive. Just watch out for the controlling Zoo keeper!&#10;&#10;Be the first player to set up all of your seven circus tents, and you win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Infinities: Defiance of Fate is a 4x-lite adventure game based in a cross-over setting of fantasy and science-fiction worlds connected by multiversal rifts. As these rifts open, factions from each world collide as their realities blend into one another. However, the cross-over doesn't end with the story. The game boasts a hybrid gameplay style, blending strategy card game and tactical 4x mechanics with narrative elements. A leader acts as your avatar in the game&rsquo;s worlds. Leaders are represented as a board with a set of actions, three attribute tracks, and a reaction track which holds resource tokens. The basic round structure begins with all players setting one action die matching their map tile, rolling 3 more dice (with an optional reroll), then spending dice to take actions one player at a time. Action dice allow you to play unit and action cards, attack enemies, and explore and control map tiles. Units and leaders add new twists with their own unique actions while in play. At the end of the round, all leaders reset their hands with new cards, a Rift tile morphs the worlds it is connecting, then players check for objectives and Influence.&#10;&#10;Infinities offers two primary game modes: Story and Skirmish. In Story mode, two factions use a Story Guide to follow a branching narrative campaign with varied, asymmetric actions, objectives, and win conditions. Based on the events and outcomes within a chapter, players will proceed to one of many possible chapters and make a thematic change to the game's assets for the remainder of the campaign. These changes range from removing leaders, shuffling cards into other decks, or permanently increasing action dice. Additionally, each chapter may change allegiances, leading players through free-for-all, team, one vs. all, and cooperative engagements. This makes it quite likely that players will experience both sides of the story throughout a campaign. Also included in the Story Guide are solo quests for each of the game's leaders, offering scalable challenges with multiple endings.&#10;&#10;In Skirmish mode, players strive to collect more points than their opponents from a set of objectives. Skirmish mode functions as an ideal way to learn, practice, and master the game in friendly or competitive matches.&#10;&#10;With shared or separate decks, dice-based actions, shifting turn order, a player-created game map, optional unlockable powers, a myriad of dynamic victory conditions, and session-specific actions, you&rsquo;ll find that the possibilities in this game are infinite.&#10;&#10;",

The Union forces are powerful but initially weaker than the total rebel strength, yet forced to take the offensive. The two Confederate armies are widely separated at first, but can form a decisive mass if they can link up.&#10;&#10;The game map depicts the theater of operations in the central Mississippi. It is divided into areas, stretching from Bruinsburg to Jackson. Each map area serves to regulate movement and combat and represents a fourteen mile square of terrain. The two campaign game scenarios cover the period between 29 April and 4 July 1863 using two day turns. A smaller scenario covers the key maneuvering and combat that took place at Champion Hill. Special rules cover the weather, Union gunboats and rebel shore batteries, the siege of Vicksburg, among other things.&#10;&#10;Game contents include one 17 inch by 22 inch full-color game map, 240 die-cut game counters, one standard rules book, one exclusive rules book, one battle board, one game card, two army display sheets, and one die.&#10;&#10;",

It also retains the mathematical elegance of Hex, which has nice implications such as the impossibility of draws, and the existence of seemingly very different scoring rules which are provably equivalent.

Poised on a point, the board begins level, but soon shifts as players place a variety of differently sized pieces on the board.  There are circular pits in the board, ready to accept the player's pieces - each with dots whose numbers increase as the pits radiate further from the center.  The dots act as a multiplier against the size of a column - place a three tiered column in a pit with four dots, and you score 12 points.  And so play continues until every pit has been filled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Line-it, you build an ascending or descending line of numbered cards to score points. Will you play safe and bank the points to start a new line, or will you keep trying to add to the line to claim a jackpot?&#10;&#10;The deck consists of cards in four colors numbered 1-100 and six &quot;Bet&quot; cards numbered 3-5. Shuffle the deck, then lay out cards in the market equal to two more than the number of players. Starting with the first player, each player must pick a card, then either start a line/add it to their line or place it in their hand. Your maximum hand size is two, and if you can't add the card to your hand or to your line (because it would break the ascending/descending pattern), you must score your line, then play that card to start a new line. You can add one Bet card to your line without regard for its ascending/descending status or the value of your end card.&#10;&#10;After drafting a card, you may choose to play one card from your hand into your line, then you may choose to score your line. When you score, if you have a Bet card in the line, see whether you've added a number of cards to your line after the bet that at least equals the value of the Bet; if so, take a positive number token equal to the Bet card, and if not, flip that token to its negative side instead. Next, discard three cards from the line, then flip all the remaining cards face down and place them in your scoring pile.&#10;&#10;After everyone one has drafted (and optionally played and scored), discard unchosen Bet cards, then place unchosen number cards under the jackpot token that matches their color: yellow under the star, green under the leaf, etc. If during your turn, you add the third card of a color to your line, you immediately claim the cards under the matching jackpot token and place them in your scoring pile.&#10;&#10;When you can't lay out enough cards, each player in turn plays one card from their hand, then scores their line and tallies their points. You earn 1 point for each scored card, then gain/lose points from the Bet tokens you collected. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to their home space wins!&#10;&#10;What's new with 3D Labyrinth is that the game board has a 3D element, with players needing to go up and down levels as they travel through the maze, but a player can't jump more than one level at a time, so sometimes you'll be blocked from a treasure not due to a wall, but due to it being at the wrong height &mdash; or maybe you're at the wrong height. Either way, you need to figure out how to manipulate the maze to get the two of you together.&#10;&#10;Note that 3D Labyrinth is not the same as Labyrinth, which doesn't have a height element in the gameplay and which is aimed at younger audiences.&#10;&#10;",

There is no CRT and units become progressively weaker during the battle.&#10;For Wagram 1809, Laurent Martin has used an adaptation and evolution of the system he has already used for the battle of Bull Run and Cedar Creek, which appeared in Vae Victis.&#10;&#10;",

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.&#10;&#10;The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.&#10;&#10;This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are whith areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.&#10;&#10;The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by (non???) contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible, except for Saint-Denis... Are you ready to put on the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s, the admiral of Coligny's, the constable of Montmorency's, Anne de Joyeuse's or Henri of Navarre's armours and to fight your enemies &laquo; By Shot, Shock and Faith &raquo; ?

Four of the rows are colored, and some squares have numbers in them. On a turn, the active player rolls two dice, then each player chooses the polyomino showing on one of the dice and draws this shape in their grid as if they had just dropped it into the grid from the top.&#10;&#10;Each polyomino has a circle in one position while the rest of its squares have a large X in them. The active player chooses a polyomino before all other players, and if anyone else chooses the polyomino on this die, those players must place an X on their sheet instead of a circle. This is bad since if you can place a circle in the same location as a number, you score points equal to that number at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If you're the first player to fill in all spaces in a colored horizontal row, then you score 4 points; if you complete this same row after someone else, you score only 2 points.&#10;&#10;The game ends once two players can't fit either of the current polyominoes into their grid. Players score positive points for completed rows and numbers circled, then lose 1 point for each space left uncovered, whether due to them creating gaps when &quot;dropping&quot; the polyominoes or just not being able to fit a polyomino in the top of their grid.

If you&rsquo;re  just tuning in, my name is Johnny Atom-Bomb, your humble host broadcasting live from Old Line Radio, the Tri-State Wasteland&rsquo;s only radio station, excepting derelict government civil defense broadcasts or other dubious transmissions. The wasteland may not look like much, but she&rsquo;s all we got, and I&rsquo;m here to help you see another sunset.  So load your gun, turn up that dial, and stay tuned.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Old Line Radio Opening Sign-on Announcement&#10;&#10;The rules of TNT could be used for any post-apocalyptic world, but the official setting begins in the heart of the Tri-State Wasteland, a part of the old Mid-Atlantic States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  &#10;The core rules include, from website &quot;This is Not a Test uses 10-sided dice, referred to as D10 in the rules, and occasionally standard six-sided dice, labeled D6.&#10;&#10;Two types of dice roll mechanics resolve all actions: Opposed and Stat tests.&#10;&#10;Opposed tests are used for resolving direct actions between figures, mainly close combat. Both players roll a D10 and add the appropriate stat and any applicable modifiers. The highest score wins. Ties always go to the defender.&#10;&#10;Stat tests are used when a figure is trying to accomplish an action, usually something unopposed by an enemy model.  Examples include opening a locked door or climbing a ledge. The player rolls a D10, adds the relevant stat and any applicable modifiers, and checks to see if he rolled equal to or higher than the required Target Number (TN).  The TN is specified by the type of action, as are the results of success or failure. Unless otherwise specified, all stat tests have a TN of 10. Specific types of tests are discussed further under stats.&#10;&#10;Additionally, several dice conventions are used.&#10;&#10;Critical Hit: A natural roll of 10 on the D10 indicates a lucky bonus.  Should a Critical be scored the player may roll a D6 and add the result to their original D10 roll.&#10;&#10;Fumble: A natural roll of 1 is always bad, but does not result in any penalties.  However, 1s cause additional problems, such as weapon failure or ammo depletion, which are described later in the relevant sections.&#10;&#10;D3 &ndash; Some rules require the roll of a D3.  To get a result roll a D6, where a score of 1 to 2 = 1, 3 to 4 = 2, and 5 to 6 = 3. Rolling a D3 never results in a Critical or Fumble.&#10;&#10;Scatter &ndash; Scattering means to determine a random direction, usually to represent a misplaced grenade or errant entity.  To determine this direction simply roll a scatter die, or if that is unavailable, roll D10 and use the direction the top of the die is pointing, or some other agreed upon method.&#10;&#10;Rerolling Dice &ndash; Some abilities allow players the opportunity to reroll their dice in the event they are unhappy with the first result.  The second result cannot be rerolled even if it is worse.  You may not reroll a reroll!&quot;&#10;&#10;The game will offer random encounters to give the play a different feel.&#10;&#10;&quot;In This Is Not a Test your warband&rsquo;s problems don&rsquo;t just start with your opponent, the wasteland itself can be just as danger.  TNT offers rules for both hazards of wastes as well as a bestiary of wasteland denizens.   At the beginning of each battle, players roll to determine if any hazards are present.  There roughly a 50% chance something bad will occur.  The point was to offer something a little different without over burdening the players with too much going on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hazards are natural, and unnatural, phenomena that pervade the wasteland.   Earthquake, ash storms, unexploded ordinance and other dangerous events.  Below are just two examples taken directly  from TNT.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
