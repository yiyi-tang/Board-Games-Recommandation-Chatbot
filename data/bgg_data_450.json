All the players use the same button, which is moved according to a die throw. The question is asked in the category of where the button gets to. There is also an extra category, which contains yes-no questions of all the categories.&#10;&#10;This game seems to be a Finnish version of the game called &quot;Geni!&quot; (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22289). This is written in the box cover too. However, there are some differences. For example, in the Finnish version there are 56 puzzle pieces instead of 15 in Geni!&#10;&#10;",

Each player sorts the cards that they have and then decides which suit they will try to corner.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to obtain all of the cards of one suit by trading with other players.&#10;&#10;To play you take from your hand a card or cards of similar suite and holding them up call &quot;Trade 2 or trade 3. All players do that at the same time so there is lots of yelling going on. Sorta like what happens on the New York Stock Exchange. People make trades of cards. So you could trade 2 with someone else then find that the 2 that you receive match a card or two that you already have in your hand and now you might try and trade 3 for 3. When the first player succeeds in getting all of the cards in a suit the player calls &quot;corner&quot; shows the cards to everyone else. First player to get 3  corners wins!&#10;&#10;",

The Playing Fields are divided by rows of red playing spots running toward the center of the board known as Alleys. These Alleys may be traveled from one end to another in a single move if desired. In each game there are 30 shells divided into groups of 5, each group has a different  color. There are also 6 counters numbered 5,10,15,20,25 and 50. At the beginning each player draws a counter, looks at it and then places it beneath one of his shells so that no opponent knows under which shell the counter is.  . The object of the game is to move a shell into the SHELL OUT area of an opponent. You may attempt to capture a shell of your opponent. If you are next to a opponents shell you simply jump on it. Most shells have nothing under them and simply result in your losing your shell. If you find the shell with the scoring marker under it you score it. The hand is over when someone moves a loaded shell unto the opponents SHELL OUT area.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a cheese card in a different maze material (stone, brick, wood, and metal).  The cheese card is at the bottom of each player's deck.  The rest of the cards are parts of a labyrinth made of the four materials.  Players flip over their cards and connect to the existing maze, placing their cards wherever possible.  The first player to connect his or her cheese card to the maze wins.&#10;&#10;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/rat-race&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rumble Robots was a children's collectible card game sold in starter decks and booster packs circa 2001.  The premise is based around warring factions of sci-fi robots.  There are two sides: a blue team of good guys, and a red team of bad guys, each lead by a robot king.  The blue king is King El Smasho and the red king is King Slugnut.  The cards themselves are called Power Cards and contain bar codes for interaction with Rumble Robots toys.  Each card has a &quot;power level&quot; from 1-5 which corresponds to both its rarity and relative usefulness in the game.  In addition, there are &quot;platinum&quot; cards, more powerful than level 5 cards.  One expansion set was released, &quot;Rumble Robots: Invasion&quot;, which focused on the two king characters as well as adding a further rarity level called &quot;superpower&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;",

On close examination, however, there are differences which will be discussed underneath.&#10;First of all it should be noted that the (c) from this game is 1973: two years before Tennis was released! Further, on the box it says (literal translation) &quot;The first and only cardgame on the world based on tennis&quot;. The box furthermore states that  the game was issued on occasion of the 75th year of the Dutch Tennis Association. However, a publisher cannot be found on box, or on rule sheets. Based on these data I do believe that this was the predecessor of Tennis.&#10;Differences with Tennis: a) In this game there is no 'ball' nor a pawn (you just move the stack of played cards to the correct position). b) Cards are strictly for either backhand or forehand strokes (indicated with either B or F). c) There are more rules of which card may be played on what card (eg. smash may only following a lob).&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to empty their hands of cards by playing them to a common pile, matching cards by color, number, or action.  The deck is made up of 4 sets of differently colored cards with numbers from 1 to 6.  There are also Miracle cards (wild cards), cards that cause the next player to pick up 1 or 2 cards, and Skip cards.&#10;&#10;Note: This game is different from UNO in the following ways:&#10;- Instead of &quot;Draw 4 wild cards&quot;, this game contains some &quot;Draw 1&quot; cards.  This is in addition to the &quot;Draw 2 cards&quot; both games have.&#10;- This game has only a 35-card deck.&#10;- When a person has only one card left in their hand, they are to call out &quot;Joseph&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in the Hanlin Academy.  Most students are members of the Grand Secretariat of the Hanlin Academy, the body of top-ranking graduates of the civil service examination who serve as advisers to the Wanli emperor.  Some Grand Secretaries are Confucian &quot;purists,&rdquo; who hold that tradition obliges the emperor to name his first-born son as successor; others, in support of the most senior of the Grand Secretaries, maintain that it is within the emperor&rsquo;s right to choose his successor; and still others, as they decide this matter among many issues confronting the empire, continue to scrutinize the teachings of Confucianism for guidance.  The game unfolds amidst the secrecy and intrigue within the walls of the Forbidden City, as scholars struggle to apply Confucian precepts to a dynasty in peril.&#10;&#10;",

Basically ARVN defenders backed up by air power vs. hordes of NVA with tanks and heavy artillery. This was the last stand of the South Vietnamese Army against all odds (which is why it may become an ATO issue game). The ARVN 18th division armed with M-48 Tanks and Cluster bombs conduct themselves in a heroic manner, so much so, that it becomes noticed by the outside world media press. The battle involved large amounts of aircraft and tanks. The ARVN defiant stand stunned the three NVA Divisions assigned to take the town. The two sides clashed for 10 days-it became a battle of honor! This game is a much improved version of Perry's earlier 1982 game.&#10;&#10;System is similar to Perry Moore's Nanawa: Verdun in the Chaco War, July 1933.&#10;&#10;",
