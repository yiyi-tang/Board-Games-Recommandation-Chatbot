The Thenn Warriors are different. They have forged their own bronze weapons and armor, making them the most heavily-armed troops in the Free Folk army. While their equipment might not stand up to the castle-forged steel of the southern forces, it fares better than leather and fur shirts.&#10;&#10;The Thenn Warriors unit box gives Free Folk commanders their arguably hardiest troops on the battlefield. Their increased armor has given them a sense of invulnerability, calling out Taunts to their enemies, causing charges to be targeted at them instead of other units. They also benefit from Set Defense, which means they ignore penalties from being charged, or attacked in the flank or rear. Coming with the unit is the Chosen of Styr Unit Attachment, whose Intimidating presence causes an enemy to become Weakened when they activate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They outfit their troops in heavy armor at every level and arm them with the House&rsquo;s signature warhammer. While this heavy kit does slow down troop movements, the tenacity of their defenses can usually see them through. The Baratheon Wardens are the main infantry unit that the House uses, fielding many ranks of these rough and rugged fighters.&#10;&#10;The Baratheon Wardens unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon commanders a tough, resilient set of troops for their forces. Clad in plate mail and carrying heavy shields, they have a good Defense Save stat, though all of that does slow them down. Their heavy warhammer attacks can crush the enemy&rsquo;s spirit as much as it can crush their bones. Defending against these pounding attacks can leave enemy troops gasping for air as the strength is sucked from them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Still, their resilient plate mail can turn away most attacks, while their warhammers make quick work of enemies out on the field.&#10;&#10;The Baratheon Sentinels Unit Box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon commanders a new melee unit for their forces. Simple and straightforward, the Sentinels head into battle confident in the power of their armor. On the attacking side of the coin, the Sentinel&rsquo;s double warhammers can crush enemies under the weight of their mighty blows, easily sundering enemy armor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "House Baratheon&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;heavy arms and heavier armor&rdquo; extends even to its cavalry. The Champions of the Stag are some of the heaviest armored in all of Westeros. These mounted knights head to battle in full plate, their huge destrier horses kitted with full barding. Yet, they still remain rather maneuverable during battle. These knights can be used as a flanking force, or simply plunged straight into the heart of an enemy formation.&#10;&#10;The Champions of the Stag unit for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Baratheon commanders a heavy cavalry option for their forces. With strong Defensive Save and Morale stats and multiple wounds per figure, they can withstand enemy attacks very well. They are also formidable on offense, gaining special bonuses with their Champion&rsquo;s Wrath ability, which grants Critical Blow and forces the enemy to become Weakened if they roll any 1s when making Defensive Saves against their attacks. Truly a strong unit to have on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The story is set in a parallel world of medieval Europe. In this world where swords and magic exist at the same time, one player plays the role of a dark legion headed by vampires to control the powerful dark night creatures invading the human world, and the other player plays the human guard and leads the heroic royal knights to defend the kingdom of Italia Border town.&#10;&#10;Players form a legion according to certain rules (both sides have the same number of troop recruitment points to form a legion with equal total strength), deploy troops on the map, and command them to fight. The types of troops in the game are very rich. Players need to make various adjustments according to the characteristics of the troops and combined with the terrain, and reasonably issue various instructions such as attack, active defense, retreat and rest. At the same time, each player constructs his own battle deck, and players can use these battle cards to greatly influence the battle.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;Victory conditions&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#10;1. If the Dark Legion destroys the human town within 12 rounds, the Dark Legion wins, otherwise the Human Guard wins. &#10;2. At any time, repel all opponent forces, then our camp wins.

When this happens, the player is entitled to a card which authorizes him to move one of his forwards in a given direction and specific number of spaces. A forward may only score a goal from a certain specific spaces. Each period ends when the ten &quot;penalty&quot; cards have been used.&#10;&#10;The forwards move according to a tricolor dice which plays a double role based on both numerical and value and its color. Thus, the die allows a man to advance the number of spaces corresponding tot he number thrown or, depending on its color, to send a man into the game (WHITE), win a face-off (RED) or scorer a goal (BLUE). The defensemen move one space at a time, in the dircestion determined by the players.&#10;&#10;",

They were mostly sons of Australian born convicts and became legendary during the Australian Gold Rush of the 1850s and 1860s, robbing banks and coach services. Many became folk heros, such as Ned Kelly rebelling against authority and remain popular in Australian culture&#10;&#10;The game has at least one player taking the Mail coach playing piece, starting at either end of the Mail coach road. Other players are Bushrangers beginning at the other end of the board at the Bushrangers lair.&#10;&#10;The Mail coach follows the road by rolling a dice and it's objective is to get to the other end. The Bushrangers follow the black spots by rolling the dice and try to intercept the Mail coach. If they land on the Mail coach they have held up the coach and won the come. If he overshoots the Mail coach he cannot go backwards and must follow the track to meet the coach again.&#10;&#10;The game can have two Mail coaches in play and several Bushrangers. The coaches can also carry counters representing money.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Race Royale is a fast-paced racing, party game where teams of two compete to out-race, out-wit or blast their opponents off the track! Last car on the track is the winner!&#10;&#10;Inspired by retro top-down racing video games, this board game adaptation lets teams of two take the wheel of a fast and furious, bustling bluffing bonanza. Because the theme of the race is &quot;top-down&quot; the drivers can't really see where they're going and must trust in the collective movement of the pack. Just follow the leader, but does the leader know they way or is he/she just trying to trick you into driving off the road?&#10;&#10;Out-smart your opponents, or collect power-ups, weapons to use against them. It pays to be in the lead, but as soon as you stop trusting in whoever is in front of you, you must slow down to have time to react, and before you know it, you'll fall behind!&#10;&#10;This bluff filled party game plays well with an even number of players, from 4 to 10. You can help your team mate by passing them information when they need it the most, or prevent them from crashing at a crucial moment by clever card play. As the race goes by, the road becomes more predictable and players may be tempted to take their chances in order to gain the much desired lead. Since the track is randomly generated, the finish line could come suddenly. In order for you (and your team mate) to win, you must be the first to cross the finish line, or have the last car on the track!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players set up the duelling positions, with the Samurai initially being two steps apart, and then each secretly chooses a hand card face-down.

If the Samurai move close enough together, and onto the same spot, then a strike might happen. But the Samurai switch between being in a Standing stance, and a Ready stance. So an attack can only be made when the Samurai is Ready, otherwise the player falls back to Standing.&#10;&#10;Basic attacks can be made repeatedly, the card goes back to the player's hand when used. But the Special card attacks are used only once a round, and then discarded.&#10;&#10;A round ends when a successful strike is made, and damage is shown on the attacking card. The player struck loses hit points.

    "Description": "In Speedstream, up to six pilots compete in their superfast vehicles on a hi-tech track.&#10;&#10;The main goal is, as always, to be first, but in Speedstream being first is not an easy task, but can be achieved by any means necessary. Staying first is even harder.&#10;&#10;Players have full control over their vehicles starting from statistics to behavior on track. You can go slow and safe and never roll a dice, or push your luck and attack aggressively, and put your fate on a dice roll.&#10;&#10;Take corners fast and risk losing control over speeder! Push your opponents on track wall, to slow them down or even destroy. Fight your way to the first place using extra equipment for your vehicle like shields, tractor beams, EMP discharges, or even seeking missiles. All means necessary allowed!&#10;&#10;Each player pilots one speeder, steering it through obstacles, blocking other players, and collecting boosts. Speeders are customizable, and during the progress of the game they get upgrades, and the player decides how to tune the vehicle. Board is modular, allowing players to build unique tracks for each game.&#10;&#10;There are also sponsors available, giving additional upgrades to your speeders. Lots of negative but fair play interaction between players, course-plotting, and risk-taking. Speeders can be damaged and even crashed, but even then you can still get to the end line first.&#10;&#10;This is a downloadable product, to be printed and cut on an A3 format paper or cardboard sheet. It still needs additional elements like tokens, dice, and speeders models.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&rsquo;s website&#10;&#10;",

Each card has an image and a text that represents a key point or achievement in the Catalan history, art, gastronomy or culture.&#10;The front and back of each card are identical except for the fact that the back of the card include also the year in which the event happened.&#10;&#10;Each player is given 7 cards face up so that the year is not visible to them.&#10;One card is then placed face down (so that the year is visible) on the table. &#10;Each player, in his/her turn, will place one of his/her cards face up before, after or  between the cards already in the table and then turn it faced down so that the year is visible. If the card has been correctly placed chronologically, the card remains on the table, otherwise, the card is discarded and the player takes  another card. The first player to finish the cards wins.&#10;&#10;For an additional degree of difficulty, instead of discarded an incorrectly placed cards, leave it on the table face down (with the year visible) in its correct position.&#10;&#10;This is a standalone game, but is fully compatible with similar games such as Timeline series and can be combined with them.&#10;&#10;[Catalan translation]&#10;&#10;Cronocartes: Hist&ograve;ria de Catalunya &eacute;s un joc de cartes de tem&agrave;tica hist&ograve;rica.&#10;Cada carta t&eacute; una imatge i un text que representa un esdeveniment o fita a la hist&ograve;ria, art, gastronomia o cultura catalanes.

    "Description": "During the premiere, Juliet thrusts a stage dagger into herself on stage in front of a full house. As Juliet dies, it becomes clear &ndash; Somebody must have switched the prop with a real dagger.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the exciting world of Minebury City Theater! You have all been working towards this premiere for a long time: &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; by William Shakespeare.&#10;&#10;But the production seems ill-fated. Patrick was rejected a few weeks ago when he asked Juliet&rsquo;s hand in marriage. As a result, everyone was anxious to see how it would turn out when the two lead actors appeared on stage together. At first the premiere seemed to run smoothly. At 8:00 pm, the curtain rose in front of a full house. The play lasted three hours including the intermission.&#10;&#10;At the end of the play, at 11:00 pm, the tragedy occurred: Juliet had picked up the stage dagger behind the stage from among the other props. She dramatically thrust the blade into her body. At first the audience was enthralled by her impressive performance. But when Patrick saw Juliet&rsquo;s blood and called out for a doctor, the audience realized what they had just witnessed was in fact a real tragedy: Somebody had switched the stage dagger with a real knife.&#10;&#10;Arriving shortly after, the emergency services could do nothing but pronounce Juliet dead at the scene. The question is: which of the people present is responsible for Juliet&rsquo;s gruesome death?&#10;&#10;What is a murder mystery game?&#10;&#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.&#10;&#10;You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.&#10;&#10;Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.&#10;&#10;Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website).

    "Description": "It was New Year&rsquo;s Eve at the luxurious restaurant, The Osgood, which sits majestically atop a mountain ridge above a posh ski resort town in the Rocky Mountains. It had been snowing heavily since the morning, and the three-star chef George Osgood had closed his renowned establishment, as he did every year, in order to celebrate with his family and employees in an intimate setting.&#10;&#10;At 63, George wanted to retire in the new year. That&rsquo;s why he announced that he would be revealing his successor this evening. Everyone was awaiting his decision with bated breath.&#10;&#10;The two chefs, Marcus and Henry, both vying to be George&rsquo;s successor, served an impressive four-course menu. Everyone ate and drank copious amounts. The evening promised to be an unforgettable one.&#10;&#10;To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, George did not announce his successor during dinner, but by midnight, when the New Year was due to be welcomed with a glass of champagne on the terrace, the evening has taken an unfortunate turn. As the fireworks display over Aspen Mountain started flaring up on the horizon, the renowned chef was found dead on the terrace. Judging by the position of his body, somebody had thrown him head first over the balcony.&#10;&#10;The police were informed immediately. Because of the heavy snow, they will not reach the on-mountain restaurant for another few hours. Until the authorities arrive, you are all on your own in solving the mystery. What happened this evening? How could this New Year&rsquo;s celebration have ended so tragically?&#10;&#10;What is a murder mystery game?&#10;&#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case.

    "Description": "This expedition in the Peruvian jungle uncovered a real sensation &ndash; The royal priestesses&rsquo; burial chamber. But while the excavation team were still busy celebrating their success in the evening, the famous archaeology professor Mary Stonerock was found dead.&#10;&#10;You had expected this expedition to be nothing less than an archaeological miracle. For two months, you&rsquo;ve all been in the Peruvian rainforest looking for the remains of the Moche people, an advanced South American civilization that preceded the Incas and has hardly been studied.&#10;&#10;You knew you were on the right path, as you had found countless small vases, tools and other artifacts over the past few days. Late in the afternoon, you finally found the tomb of the priestesses. This important find would have been another milestone in the career of Mary Stonerock, the US&rsquo;s youngest full professor of archaeology.&#10;&#10;Mary decided to celebrate the find with a hearty feast and an evening of drinking. You raised a toast to your joint success and speculated as to what the tomb, to be opened the next day, might contain. But the evening took a tragic turn when Christian discovered Mary&rsquo;s body at around midnight in the entrance of her tent.&#10;&#10;Director Gustavo Navarro has since notified the police using the camp&rsquo;s radio.

Max&rsquo;s wife Eleanor suddenly disappeared without a trace.&#10;&#10;Max&rsquo;s invitation to join him on a yacht trip came as a surprise. Your old circle from school hadn&rsquo;t met up for two years. Since then, your lives had slowly drifted in different directions. The reunions had been less and less frequent.&#10;&#10;Max had rented a luxurious motor yacht, with its own captain and cook, and late in the afternoon the vessel left the harbor. Antonio, the chef, served a fantastic five-course dinner in the evening. The champagne corks popped and everybody raised a glass to good times in the past. Everyone had plenty of stories to tell.&#10;&#10;But the trip took a dramatic turn in the course of the night. By the time Max went to bed at around midnight, his wife Ella had disappeared. Max alerted everyone, and you all searched the ship from stem to stern. At first everyone thought it was a prank. But when you found a pool of blood on deck, it was clear something bad must have happened.&#10;&#10;Captain Steward has notified the police and Coast Guard, but there is little hope of finding Ella alive. Until the authorities arrive, you will have to solve the mystery by yourselves. What happened this evening?

    "Description": "During the ceremonial opening of the New York Grand Hotel the actress Monique Moreau is found dead in her suite. How could the opening celebration end so tragically?&#10;&#10;New York, August 1962. Welcome to the city that never sleeps! Everybody who was anybody had come to Manhattan to celebrate the opening of the magnificent Grand Hotel &ndash; aspiring politicians, powerful industrialists and beautiful actresses. The largest luxury hotel in the United States was set on redefining the term &ldquo;five-star&rdquo;, and was also to be the crown jewel in the empire of Frederic Price. The hotel tycoon was one of the richest men in the country. Since his marriage to the actress D&oacute;ra Galor, he was now even better known than before.&#10;&#10;The opening speeches were full of praise, and the guests ate and drank copious amounts from the five-course menu. The evening had all the hallmarks of an incredible coming-together of American high society. Once the official part of the event was over, the guests gathered for an exuberant cocktail party at the longest hotel bar in the entire city. But the evening took a tragic turn when the young actress Monique Moreau was found dead in the bathtub of her hotel suite late in the evening. The idea that the young woman, described by the media as the next D&oacute;ra Galor, would take her own life is rejected by everyone as incredible.&#10;&#10;The police were informed immediately. But it will take the authorities hours to search the entire hotel and secure all the relevant evidence. You have all been requested to stay here in the lobby. Until the police have questioned everybody, you are all on your own in solving the mystery, asking the questions: what happened this evening? How could the opening celebration end so tragically?&#10;&#10;What is a murder mystery game?&#10;&#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.&#10;&#10;You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.&#10;&#10;Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.&#10;&#10;Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENT:&#10;1 Game Manual, 8 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 8 name badges, 1 support code&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Painting Parlay is an educational game meant to teach the world's greatest artists, increase visual literacy for art, and identify elements of style. Players can vote if their opponents are correct, leading to a fun exploration of the arts.&#10;&#10;Objective: Be the player or team with the most points after each player&rsquo;s or team&rsquo;s five cards have been placed with an artist. For a quick version of Painting Parlay use three cards instead of five.&#10;&#10;Set-Up:&#10;Layout the sixteen artists in a four by four grid on the table.&#10;Shuffle the large square art cards and deal 5 cards to each player or team. Be sure not to look at the back of the art cards, as the artist is revealed on the backside of the card. &#10;Place the small hint cards painting side up, next to the artist grid, players can search the hint deck for a painting. &#10;Each player or team will take a voting card, and a point card with a clip to track their points.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;On your turn, you will choose a painting in your hand, examine its style and elements, and compare it to the sixteen artists on the table. &#10;You will then place your card with whom you think painted this painting, and give a brief reason on why you came to that conclusion.&#10;&#10;Hints and Help:&#10;If you are lost and need help you can search the hint deck for your painting, you will get fewer points if you choose correctly, however it will give you its date of creation, and information about the painting or artist. &#10;Artist Information: At any time on your turn, you can flip one artist card and read a brief summary of their life.&#10;Exchanging Your Painting: Once per game you or your team can switch one of the paintings in your hand with one of the top three paintings of the art card deck. You will take your new painting and discard the painting in your hand.&#10;&#10;Once you have chosen who you think painted your painting, the other players will vote, flipping their voting card to a check or an x, on whether they think you guessed correctly or incorrectly. Then flip the art card, and reveal the artist.&#10;&#10;If you placed your painting next to the correct artist you will receive a point amount based on whether you used a hint or not. Adjust your scorecard using the sliding clip on the card. If you guessed incorrectly, you receive no points. &#10;Your turn ends and the next player seeks to match their painting with an artist.&#10;&#10;Point Values:&#10;Placed Painting Next to Correct Artist without a Hint: 5 points&#10;Placed Painting Next to Correct Artist with a Hint: 3 points&#10;If you voted correctly what the outcome would be: 2 points&#10;&#10;Players continue to place their paintings with an artist until everyone has placed five of their paintings. In the quick version of Painting Parlay, it is only three paintings that are placed with an artist for the game to end.&#10;&#10;Look at your scorecard and see who has the most points, that player or team is the winner! Congratulations on your mastery of the world&rsquo;s most famous masterpieces.&#10;&#10;Team Play:&#10;In team mode, this game can accommodate up to eight teams of six players. Each player will receive one painting card and the voting card will be switched between players on a team each turn. Players on the same team can work together to figure out who painted a teammate&rsquo;s painting and to vote, however it is up to the player whose turn it is to make the final choice. In team mode, players cannot exchange their painting cards for another. The game will end after six paintings have been placed next to an artist from each team.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Romanian strategy game for 2-6 players. You need to build as many highways as you can but be careful! Your opponents will sabotage you with unexpected incidents: a broken viaduct, an appeal to the public auction, blocking the works and see if you can repel the attack of opponents with negotiations, allocation of funds, any new builder or with some electoral promises.&#10;It is recommended for 14+ years old players.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;     Cards with cities will be shuffled and equally distributed for all players. If any cards remain undistributed, you need to put them in a separate stack on the table.&#10;     Cards with vignette will be stacked on the table.&#10;     Cards with sabotage actions will be shuffled and given 10 to every player (if there are 6 players, any of them will be given 8 cards). The rest are placed on the table.&#10;&#10;&#10;All players start from Bucharest and roll the dice. They need to move their pawn an equal number of points as corresponding on the dice (but he can't step twice on the same point in a turn). If the pawn is placed on a highway point, the player can ask for the related card, by initiating an act of sabotage against the player who owns that card.&#10;&#10;What is sabotage:&#10;Sabotage cards have a number of points (e.g.: 1 / 2 / 8 / 0.1 or -3 / -5 etc). A player who wants a card for a highway, needs to put down a sabotage card of negative value (e.g.: -3). The opponent must repel the attack with 1 or more cards with positive value until their sum is greater than the opponent's card (-1 equals +1 or overcome with +2). In case of equality, challenged player can keep his card. Otherwise, if the challenged player overcomes the attack, he can choose a card with cities from the player who initiated the attack. If the challenged player is defeated, the player who initiated the attack receives his requested card.&#10;&#10;Vignette cards: &#10;Can be used only at border crossing points in order to obtain 3 sabotage cards OR to ask for any of highway city cards.&#10;Every route has a specific number of points. The player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

There is another set of white emotion cards in the centre along with picture prompt cards. &#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn, they take one emotion card and three picture cards from the centre. They then have to tell a story that uses the picture cards to express the emotion on the white emotion card, which is to be hidden from the other players. The game is themed as if you are telling the group about a dream you had, so the picture cards contain many common dream themes like flying and teeth.&#10;Once the player has told their story involving the 3 picture cards the other players have to guess what emotion was being expressed using their own emotion cards. Those who are incorrect have their corresponding emotion cards taken away (placed in the penalty box), and those that were correct give their cards to the storyteller, the person with the most cards at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If it touches any of your opponent's cards, you may choose one and any in its set to discard from the game. You earn half the points that your opponent would have earned from scoring that set.

It must meet all of the following three conditions:&#10;1) To start a set, there must be a matching pair of numbers.&#10;2) A set can be extended +1/-1 from any pair in the set. Aces wrap.&#10;3) Sets must be touching each other in the tableau.&#10;&#10;END OF GAME&#10;When a player needs to draw but cannot, their opponent gets one final turn and the game ends.&#10;&#10;SETUP FOR SUBSEQUENT GAMES&#10;All torn cards are placed in your reserve at the start of the game.The starting player is the player with the current lower score.&#10;&#10;END OF ALL GAMES&#10;When the game ends without either player scoring any points, the game is all torn apart.

In short, the idea is to travel in time in search of forming the best team of historical personalities, bringing together figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Bruce Lee.&#10;&#10;In each turn, the player opens a card from the historic decks. She then decides whether to bring that character to her team, or to open a new card. If she opens a Rocket, she advances to the next deck. If she opens a character of the same type that she opened before, she now have to put that character on her team.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player forms a team of 5 characters, of 5 different types (Humanitarian, Military, Creative, Scientist and Explorer).

    "Description": "In Meta Olympia, you play a Martian colony 'football' club in the not-too-distant future, playing rules that resemble soccer on Earth. The objective of the game is to be the most bad-ass team on the planet by achieving the most combined point.  Player's teams are made up of athlete cards, each offensive, defensive or special abilities.&#10;&#10;There are two different stages played over 4 rounds. In the Pre-Season phases, players take turns moving their miniatures forward along modular tiles.  Each tile either helps players improve their team (via recruiting and trading athlete cards) or collecting resources that improve players tactical options.&#10;&#10;In the tournament round, players get to to go head-to-head against each other in player vs player matches. Matches are played in 3 rounds where each player uses one athlete card and a die role per round.  Players can also play tactics cards, resources earned from the pre-season phase, to buff or nerf.&#10;&#10;Each round determines goals, saves, and potential injuries; with the final match result based on the final score of all 3 rounds.&#10;As players move into the following stages, they have the resources to continually strengthen their team by adding higher-value players.&#10;&#10;In tournament in stage 4 is the final championship.  For 2 players, it is a best of 5 matches.  For 3 or more players, it is a round robin. Players go all out to either defend their lead or challenge the leaders.&#10;&#10;The final winner is determined by tallying up all the points collected, either through wins, game currency, or special resource cards.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, colonies living on the outer galactic rim are going dark and have become uncontactable.&#10;&#10;The galactic council has expended their military forces to no avail - they need to call on the best.&#10;&#10;You, the Xenohunters, have been summoned as the elite mercenary crew who live on the edge of the law to investigate the stations. You know very well: this is another outbreak of flesh-eating Xenos, creatures that harvest living flesh to birth monsters.&#10;&#10;The only way to stop this advancing tide of evil is with the liberal application of fire. The best way to do so: detonate the fusion reactors at the heart of every station. As elite mercenaries of the galaxy, your mission is clear: board the stations, destroy the reactors, and kill the aliens.&#10;&#10;Good luck.&#10;&#10;Warp ends in 3, 2, 1&hellip;&#10;&#10;Xenohunters is a thematically engrossing board game of adventure and horror.

A hidden location grid behind your player screen conceals your movements until the time is right to strike.&#10;&#10;Xenohunters collect powerful sci-fi equipment to hunt the Alien. However, rummaging around for equipment and supplies can be dangerous, as any mistake can lead to you appearing for all to see...&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, as the Alien crawl through ducts, lay eggs, command your minions to search and distract and sense the humans to lay the perfect traps. And if you kill a Xenohunter? They become their own worst enemy... hatching from one of your eggs as a horrific Hybrid Spawn.&#10;&#10;Comes with four Core Mission boards, 40 unique sci-fi gadgets, guns, explosions, and terrifying Hybrid Spawn.&#10;&#10;",

You are a ghost, and you are trying to scare the living residents of this haunted house out, by moving items spookily around their house.&#10;&#10;The other players leave the room to split up 2+ roles: 1 Occultist, 1 Goth, and 0-3 Folks.&#10;&#10;While they're gone, the Bio-Exorcist moves as many objects as the number of living players, and hides a spook (represented by a card or a coin) under each one:&#10;&#10;     One spook is the postcard, The Handbook for the Recently Deceased.&#10;     One spook (the joker or the largest coin) is Scared to Death.&#10;     The rest of the spooks are the love of the ghost couple.&#10;&#10;&#10;SPOOKING OBJECTS&#10;An object you spook must be noticeable moved from where it started. To mess with their heads, the Bio-Exorcist may also move 3 more objects without hiding any spooks under them.&#10;&#10;It's important that the Bio-Exorcist remembers where they put each card/coin. Record this info, if needed.&#10;&#10;Finally, the Bio-Exorcist calls back the living and the game can begin.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;Each living player may ask one question of the Bio-Exorcist and may peek under one object. They may do this in any order, at any time; there are no turns.&#10;&#10;The Bio-Exorcist must answer questions truthfully, but may interpret ambiguous wording as they please. They cannot speak, they answer only with knocks: once for &quot;yes&quot;, don't knock for &quot;no&quot;, in numbers knocking that many times.&#10;&#10;When a living player peeks and finds a spook, they reveal it and earn another question and another peek.&#10;&#10;WINNING AND LOSING&#10;Anyone who reveals Scared to Death loses the game immediately.&#10;&#10;If the Goth reveals the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, they get to fulfill their dream of becoming a ghost. The Goth and the Bio-Exorcist win.&#10;&#10;If the Occultist reveals the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, they exorcise the Bio-Exorcist and the ghost couple. The Occultist and the Folks win.&#10;&#10;If all of the love spooks are revealed, the ghost couple  and the living become friends, and get rid of the Bio-Exorcist. All of the living players win.&#10;&#10;If no one has any peeks left and there are love spooks unfound, the living have been driven from the house. The Bio-Exorcist wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The road to restoring your lost honor goes deeper with Chronicles, the second expansion to Vindication. Chronicles adds more narrative, immersion, and story to the existing Vindication experience, both for the island itself and for your own personal journey.&#10;&#10;Narrative-choice chronicle cards add a layer of decision and intrigue that bring your story to life. Each time you gain a card in the game (companion, relic, trait, monster, pet, etc) another player will draw and read a chronicle card, which presents you with a narrative prompt and a decision, ultimately telling the story of how you obtained that card. As you grow your tableau, so too do you chronicle your own journey.&#10;&#10;These decisions are further recorded on new, large, full color paper player sheets. Make enough decisions embodying a certain attribute and you become legendary for that attribute, gaining you a powerful new ability and a big gorgeous tarot card to place next to your wretch tile to help you feel extra good about your progress.&#10;&#10;All the while, you must confront various global events that rage across the land. At times no one may visit an inn until all the bandits have been run off. Strange mists may make traveling the edge of the map extra perilous. Dozens of unique events change the game state in some dynamic way &mdash; until someone deals with it and claims a huge reward.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Wants to provide a basic understanding of how democracy works.&#10;&#10;Each player represents each of the parties that existed in the Swedish parliament during the seventies. In turn, you roll a dice and walk so many steps along the playing field. After that, you do what is written on the box you have landed on. It may be, for example, that you may place a proposal in one of the Riksdag's committees and mark the relevant sectors of society with a marker, or move the proposals from the committees to the Riksdag's chamber pending a vote that occurs when someone lands on a box marked with a vote.&#10;&#10;As soon as there are markers in all sectors of society on the opposition part of the playing field, a government can be formed. The party that has the most markers in the sectors of society is given the task of trying to form a majority government or minority government together with another party.&#10;&#10;Every three years there is an election to the Riksdag (represented by the fastest player having reached the start after three laps). Which may lead to the formation of a new government depending on the conditions of the markers in the sectors of society.&#10;&#10;Before the game, the player decides how the winner will be chosen.

At some interval, (eg. every 5min), each participant gets to play a single card from their hand.  They can play this card on themselves, in which case they do the action.  Or, they can play it against another player, in which case that player has to do the action.&#10;&#10;The battle concludes 5 minutes after the last cards are played.

When you run out of cards, you are considered &quot;out&quot;. Last person out is the Misfit. The game is based off of a traditional card game call &quot;Sh!thead&quot;, among other names. To make it simple, we've created a 1-10 number system for the hierarchy of cards, as well as a few &quot;Power Cards&quot; that can be played on anything. To give Misfit a story and personality, we've chosen a &quot;Warriors&quot; theme for the first available edition. The beauty of Misfit Card Game is we will make many different editions tailored for any person's interests!&#10;&#10;",

Churchill wrote of his experience, &ldquo;Being in a ship in weather such as this is like being in a prison, with the extra chance of being drowned&rdquo;. Between March and September of the next year she was involved mainly in convoy escort duties, but in October was dispatched to Gibraltar to become the flagship of Task Force H.&#10;&#10;She saw little action during this period, her main role being protection of the task force&rsquo;s aircraft carriers, but nevertheless assisted the Allied invasion of North Africa. She subsequently participated in operations to divert Axis attentions away from Sicily in Operation Husky, and Operation Leander in an attempt to disrupt German merchant shipping of the coast of Norway.&#10;&#10;On December 26th 1943 HMS Duke of York encountered the German battleship Scharnhorst. Exchanging fire, HMS Duke of York suffered some hits with little effect, but for her part landed several hits upon Scharnhorst, silencing a turret and hitting a boiler room. This forced Scharnhorst on the defensive, and she was sunk by torpedoes as well as further heavy fire from Duke of York.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
