    "Description": "A Soap Opera themed board game where players interact with twelve characters (cast members) throughout the game. The players play themselves and all also considered cast members of the drama taking place in the town of Fine Valley.  The goal of the game is to reach the Laun-Dramatic and disclose the 'ugly truth' of all the players.  This is done by separating the truth from the 'vicious gossip' given by the twelve characters.&#10;&#10;Similar to Clue, players must roll the dice to move their token towards places of their choosing.  Once at a location, the player interacts with a character to get them to disclose a rumor about one of the other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Wreck&shy;-A-&shy;Mecha players build a giant robot (Mecha) from a randomly assigned Head and Core part along with arms and legs from their decks. Destroying opponent parts earns you victory&#10;points and the first to gain 10 points wins. A core will get you all 10 points, but it's hard to hit. This is because one of the actions players can perform in a turn is to use an arm to defend, forcing an attack to target it instead of anything else (until it is hit).&#10;&#10;Since you are only able to take 3 actions per turn, managing your offense and defense is key to survival. And with a weapon triangle causing weaknesses and resistances along with tons of unique special abilities for each part, you'll need to install parts strategically to get the upper hand.&#10;&#10;With designs taking inspiration from Mecha anime and video games, Wreck&shy;-A-&shy;Mecha let&rsquo;s you live out your Mecha customization fantasies in a quick 15&shy;-30 minute game. It&rsquo;s easy to learn, yet strategic. And with a second copy, the game can be expanded from a head to head brawl into a 2-&shy;on-&shy;2 team battle.&#10;&#10;",

The game board features only the illustrations and symbols for each city, not the names. Players are encouraged to read the booklet before starting the game.&#10;&#10;The stock of small red and black letter tiles is placed in a bag or opaque bowl, and players take turns drawing blind, one tile at a time until a red letter tile is drawn. The player drawing the red tile must place it as the initial letter of one of the cities. After that, the player may place as many black letters in his hand as possible that continue the spelling of any city name that has been started with a red letter.&#10;&#10;Play then passes to the left. Each player in turn first draws another tile from the stock and then places as many letters as possible. If a player draws a red letter, he must place it immediately. If he is unable to identify a suitable city, he must place the letter in front of him, after which the first player to call &quot;Halt&quot; may take and play the letter, and then continue his turn. Play then passes left from the seizing player.&#10;&#10;Players must continue to draw a letter at the beginning of each turn, even if they have no tiles left. The winner is the player who first uses up all his tiles after the last tile has been drawn from the stock.&#10;&#10;The map board includes Vienna, Graz, Prague and the major cities of occupied Poland as German, but still shows Denmark as independent, meaning it was based on the borders as they stood between October 1939 and April 1940.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Instead there is a starting &quot;Pilot Season&quot; draft in which players pick their starting TV shows. These starting Shows determine a player's starting resources, like Stars, Ads, and extra money.&#10;&#10;Fourth, you now get a Mogul Card when you get your first 5-Show Genre Bonus or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus.

The decks are tuned to represent the distinct personalities and traits of their leader characters - some are fast and hard hitting, some are sly and resourceful, others chaotic and insane.&#10;&#10;You choose two characters for you SKIRMISH and combine their decks. Then it's time to face off against your opponent.&#10;&#10;The table itself is divided into three zones - a central lane with two flanking areas - and where you deploy has a huge impact on on the success of your strategy.&#10;&#10;Flanking attacks, reinforcement blocks, long range equipment, area denial continuous effects - the varying zones give you the option to attack, retreat, consolidate, or redistribute your forces.&#10;&#10;Whereas Magic resource generation is random, and Hearthstone has a rigid scaling in place, SKIRMISH as a more flat resource system that creates brisk, deep gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each character generates REsolve that they can use to play followers, items, actions, and events. But be cautions about deploying it all at once - just like the tactical regions on the table, managing your Resolve with cold efficiency can be the key difference between victory and defeat. And if a character dies, their Resolve goes with them.&#10;&#10;",

You start your turn by drawing 2 playing cards and playing as many cards as you can or want without playing the same card twice. Once you are satisfied or cannot play anymore, you pass the turn to the next player.&#10;Remember, even though you need to destroy your opponent's Landmarks to win, playing all your cards every turn makes you an easy target!&#10;&#10;To help you eliminate your Opponents you will have access to 19 unique playing cards that will either help you attack your enemies, defend your own territories or destabilize other players.&#10;&#10;These cards are separated into 3 categories:&#10;Red cards that may only played during your turn,&#10;Yellow cards that may played anytime,&#10;and Blue cards that can only be played under certain circumstances.&#10;&#10;The rules evolve with the amount of players that play. When playing with 2 to 3 people, all other players are your enemies. You can build temporary alliances but be ready for the inevitable backstabbing. When playing with 4 to 6 players you have Allies that you may not attack, but will still need to compete with to win the game!&#10;&#10;Additional information:&#10;&#10;Algarade is a one-man project from the mind of Olivier Etienne Miller. Originally a game to be played with his family and close friends, it became quite popular in his circle of friends which eventually lead him to start a Kickstarter to spread the game to a wider audience!&#10;&#10;",

Those who answered correctly can make a move (no bid - 1 station, otherwise - according to the number on their bid). Those whose answer were wrong lose their appropriate bid tokens. Those tokens can be replenished on the specified areas of the map. For 2 moving points player can instead receive a hint about one of their sights. For each sight there are 2 hints, for the 3rd hint player receives exact location of the sight. Also there are cards with random events which are revealed at different locations.&#10;&#10;",

After the King is dead (or by the dawn of third epoch), she will mount her black horse to pursue your band of rebels with a vengeance.&#10;&#10;The Queen plays the game with unlimited resources and no movement restrictions. Any actual resources she acquires along the way count as veneration points!&#10;&#10;Can you thwart her quest for the King&rsquo;s demise, while securing your own prestige?

You want to win the headline by contributing the best card to it, so screw those other guys.&#10;&#10;In #AlternativeFacts, each card has a noun, verb, or adjective on it, plus a Clickbait Strength number and possibly a Hot-button icon. You and the other players will use the cards to construct a single headline.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, where each player takes their turn playing a single card to the headline that is forming in the middle of the table. Once the headline has 2 Hot-button icons in it, the round ends.  Read the headline out loud. The player who has the WINNING! card in front of them wins the round and takes a card from the headline and adds it to their score pile. The 1st player to collect 7 cards this way wins!&#10;&#10;",

It includes multiple peg boards where the pegs are spaced so that one ring has the potential of getting many pegs. In addition to a ring getting multiple pegs and a kingdom encompassing multiple peg boards there are also targets that can be placed on/around pegs and moved around to activate abilities for attacking and defending kingdoms.&#10;&#10;This is a game full of genres. Players choose a Kingdom with associated Kingdom Boards. The Kingdoms are one of Pirates, Zombies, Knights, Pig Cyborgs, Angels or Fairies.(With expansions Yeti, Sorceress, Treants, Reptilians, Cowboys, Sirens)&#10;Players decide if they wish to play teams or free for all. Teams can be any of 2v2, 2v2v2, 3v3. (With expansions up to 12 players for up to 6 teams of 2, 4 teams of 3, 3 teams of 4 or 2 teams of 5-6)&#10;&#10;Players have associated roles or abilities with their Kingdom of Healer, Tank or Fighter(With expansions to include the Punisher role, Engineer role and Conjurer role). The game includes the Moveable Target&trade; mechanic where players will all attack at once or without order by throwing rings at opponent's kingdom boards. Once the battle round ends, results are scored and play continues until the phase ends. There is a store or decision phase between battle rounds for players to make choices to obtain more rings and/or defensive targets and/or offensive targets and/or morale to steer their game play as they desire.&#10;&#10;The goal is to earn Victory Points by surviving and defeating your enemies. At the end of the game the player or team with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Expansions include variations of capture the flag, castling, demolition, death match, defeat the leader, and multiple types of combat phases.&#10;&#10;",

The Universal Game of Starship Combat is back, and better than ever!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Go on a jungle safari and sight wild animals. This game is just about that. You may come across animals 'endemic to' - found only in - that place as well as other wild animals found in that biosphere. The game covers vast biospheres that are spread across a few hundred square kilometres.&#10;&#10;You score points from the animals you sight on the game cards. The rare or difficult-to-find animals get you higher points. The game ends when all cards are drawn. However, we have gamers who have developed their 'own' ways to end the game. You can do it too. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is almost entirely controlled by the dice. Ideal for children aged 6 years or more.&#10;&#10;While safari-goers share their experiences eagerly with other fellow safari-goes in a 'real' one, players swap their hands in this game. Or you could be punished with a missed turn if you overspeed or make too much noise and disturb wildlife.&#10;&#10;There are basic strategy bits too. For instance, how you would make use of the special cards: the Paapa card or the Kaadoo card. You can use these cards when you need them, you do not have to play these cards immediately. Or you have the 'turnaround' card that lets you make a complete u-turn and go in the reverse direction. You can play this card if you appear to be leaving the forest in the next few rounds.&#10;&#10;The safari course is fixed and you cannot go off that. But, there are a good number of elements from the game that make it refreshing every time you play it. For example, on-board elements such as 'move to the nearest water body', bonus card pick  from an alarm call.&#10;&#10;We have tried to recreate the experience for those who are completely new to safaris as well as seasoned safari-goers. The game board tries to capture the signature of the terrain - arid, dull or lush green as the case may be.&#10;&#10;",

Superbeings features a 6-Super Team concept of playing with multiple frontline attackers and multiple backline reinforcements with the objective to win by one of three ways: (1) knocking out your opponent's entire frontline, (2) knocking out a total of 5 Supers, or (3) knocking out 15 rank points worth of Supers. The game uses a variety of D6, D12 and D20 dice-rolling mechanics for establishing turn actions, attacks, and more.&#10;&#10;The traditional two-player heads-up game is the easiest to start with and is the preferred play style &mdash; but when the opportunity for a massive four-player game is called upon, there's an entirely different feel to the game!&#10;&#10;",

Most cards depict one or three color-coded spirit icons at the top of the card, with the colors being repeated at the bottom of the card as well; a few cards picture a thunderbird, and these cards are used to top a totem or cast a spell.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two cards in hand, and on a turn first draws one card, then plays or discards one card. When they play a totem card, they can start a totem or add to a totem &mdash; but when adding to a totem at least one of the colored marks on the card being added must be placed in the same column as the card being covered, even if this means the card being placed doesn't line up exactly with the card below. If the top card shows red, yellow, blue, and you want to add a yellow, brown, blue, then you can line up the yellow marks or the blues, but not both.&#10;&#10;When a player plays a thunderbird, they can cast one of the four spells in play, after which that spell is placed face down until all four spells have been cast, after which they're all revealed once again. The spells are &quot;Wind blows left/right&quot;, &quot;Zap&quot;, and &quot;Gift&quot;. The caster of the wind spell chooses a height above the first level, then all cards at the level and above are shifted one column left or right, depending on the wind. If parts of a totem have no support, then those cards are discard. Zap removes the top card in a player's totem, and Gift requires each player to pass one card in hand left and the other right.&#10;&#10;As soon as a totem consists of at least four cards and the top card is centered with the bottom card (regardless of the positioning of the intervening cards), the player can top the totem with a thunderbird card to win the game. If the player has an earth totem on top &mdash; that is, a card showing the same spirit icon in all three spots, then the totem doesn't need to be aligned to be topped with a thunderbird.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#141; (Spirit of Totem) also includes rules for solo play, with the player needing to build totems of 7, 8, 9, and 10 cards without the use of spells in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chwedlau Cymru / Legends of Wales is a card game featuring creatures and monsters from Welsh mythology such as the Twrch Trwyth or the Red Dragon itself. Each of the cards features a different creature along with a value attribute (up to 10) and a set of attribute scores: Strength, Skill, Magic and Fear, as well as a &quot;size&quot; attribute that can either be small, medium (i.e. man sized) or large.&#10;&#10;On its simplest level, it can be played as a deck of Top Trumps cards for 2-4 players. The set however also comes with rules for playing a slightly more complex 2-player card game.&#10;&#10;In this version of the game, players take it in turns to draft a hand of 5 cards from the deck, with a maximum total value of 30. Both players will be able to see which cards their opponent is drafting. The undrafted cards form a draw deck. One of the four main values is then drawn at random by drawing the top card of the deck a, and the players decide on an order for their cards; this order cannot then be changed. The cards will then face off against their opponents in order, comparing the values drawn. The players thus need to try and second-guess which cards they think their opponent will place in which order.&#10;&#10;This initial first round is won by the player who won the most of the five faceoffs between the cards. The &quot;defeated&quot; cards are discarded and replacements are drawn randomly from the deck (back up to five cards) for the next round. The game is decided by a best-of-three of the three rounds.&#10;&#10;This initial set focuses on monsters and creatures. The publisher claims that more game modes will be added with future card sets / expansions, which may feature more individual characters.&#10;&#10;The most distinctive feature of the game is the unique artwork by cartoonist/designer Huw Aaron. The initial print run featured separate Welsh-language and English-language sets.&#10;&#10;",

They function similar to Armies except that Settlements hit on a roll of 8+ and Castles hit on a roll of 7+. Victory Tokens are gained every time you destroy a Horde Stack.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game (20 rounds), the player with the most Units (Settlements, Armies, and Castles) plus Victory Tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

For centuries now the world has been overrun with monsters, demons, and any other number of unspeakable horrors.  A team of scientists and historians have traced everything back to a single cataclysmic event in a war torn 1940's, when the axis powers tore a hole in the fabric of reality.&#10;Humanity is on the verge of extinction, and Project Spera, is its last hope...&#10;&#10;In Project Spera, players take on the role of a team of people salvaging the remains of a device that was once meant to save the world. Players will need to explore a hidden facility, arm themselves with what limited resources they can afford, and work together to defeat the creatures within.  The game is won when the final boss is defeated, and the cataclysm is averted.&#10;&#10;You are all alone, your resources limited, and the horrors within leave you on the edge of insanity.  Will you survive?  Or will you succumb to the darkness&hellip;and be lost&hellip;forever?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player controls one North American Indian Tribe.  Players use their people to gather food and to raid each other and the white men.&#10;&#10;Different types of tokens are used to undertake actions and record progress:&#10;-  Population Tokens (PT) are used to conduct actions such as raiding and hunting. Each Population Token represents about 50 People. &#10;-  Land Tokens (LT) are used to give access to food and resources. &#10;-  Food Tokens (FT) are used to feed your people.  They are gained by claiming certain cards. &#10;-  Horse Tokens (HT) give advantages to Raids.  &#10;-  Weapons Tokens(WT) give advantages to Raids. &#10;-  Spirit Tokens (ST) have a variety of uses. &#10;-  Trade Tokens (TT) represent things like furs and skins or crafted items that are used to trade with whites for things like weapons and horses. &#10;-  Craft Tokens (CT) represent an accumulation of skilled labour.&#10;&#10;Players share a common Spirit Card deck.  Cards are of 2 basic types: Resource Cards and Bonus Cards. &#10;-  Resource cards provide tokens and are then Discarded. &#10;-  Bonus Cards are placed face-up in front of the owner and provide either a continuous benefit or are discarded for a one-time benefit.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player gets 10 PT, 10 LT and 10 ST. A player mater is utilised to track the status of the tribe and indicate how the PT are being utilised throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The game is conducted over six turns with each turn comprising 9 phases as follows: &#10;1. Season Phase&#10;-  Place 7 x no. of players cards from the top of the spirit deck face up. &#10;2. Braves Phase&#10;-  Players take turns activating Population Tokens one at a time.  An activated PT can hunt (claim a face up spirit card) or go on a raid or go trading. &#10;3. Hunt Phase&#10;-  Resolve Spirit Card purchases and conversions as soon as they are claimed.  Some Spirit Cards have a purchase cost in tokens. This must be paid immediately.  If the purchase cost cannot be paid, the card cannot be claimed.  If the Spirit Card is a resource card, immediately gain the indicated type of tokens and then discard the card. &#10;4. Territory Phase&#10;-  If you have more LT than PT, gain FT equal to the difference. &#10;-  If you have less LT than PT, lose FT equal to the difference.&#10;5. Food Phase&#10;-  Each player discards FT equal to their PT. &#10;-  If they are short then roll once on a Starvation Table for each FT they are short and resolve results. &#10;6. Raid Phase&#10;-  Players take turns conducting Raids. &#10;-  Each PT held in reserve conducts its own raid. &#10;-  When making a Raid, declare the target of the Raid: &#10;Target Opponent, Non-player Tribe, or White Men. &#10;-  Roll for results on the appropriate raid table and resolve accordingly.&#10;7. Trade Phase&#10;-  Players may trade Tokens with each other or with white men (using set conversion rates) &#10;8. Encroachment Phase&#10;-  Each player rolls once on an Encroachment Table and resolves results accordingly.&#10;9. Spirit Phase&#10;-  All unclaimed face-up Spirit Cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six turns. At the end of the 6th turn scoring is conducted as follows:&#10;Player with most LT gets 10 VP&#10;Player with most PT gets 9 VP&#10;Player with most HT gets 8 VP&#10;Player with most WT gets 7 VP&#10;Player with most ST gets 6 VP&#10;Player with most CT gets 5 VP&#10;Player with most TT gets 3 VP&#10;Player with most FT gets 2 VP&#10;Player with the most Bonus Cards get 4 VP&#10;If tied in a category, all tied players get the points -1.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;If at any point during the game a player loses all his Population Tokens or Land Tokens he automatically loses.&#10;&#10;",

Green is a game for 3 players derived from The House of the Flying Blades and brother game of RED and BLUE, by the same designer, that uses a non-transitive capturing mechanism.&#10;&#10;Depending on the set, you&rsquo;d have:&#10;&#10;Basic: a 6&times;6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.&#10;&#10;Advanced: a 6&times;9 &ndash; 9&times;9 board (using one or both pads), 30 black pyramids, 45 green pyramids, 30 white pyramids.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;&#10;The board starts full of pyramids. Players in turn capture (mandatory) other pyramids or stacks of pyramids orthogonally so that:&#10;&#10;- Black can only capture Green&#10;- Green can only capture White&#10;- White can only capture Black&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the highest combined height of controlled stacks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Please refer to the rulebook for detailed rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;Greener is the second game of the Green-Greener-Greenest set. Green, Greener and Greenest are three games that use the same set of components.&#10;&#10;Greener is a capturing game for 2 players, where both must capture the same colour.&#10;&#10;Depending on the set, you&rsquo;d have:&#10;&#10;Basic: a 6&times;6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.&#10;&#10;Advanced: a 6&times;9 &ndash; 9&times;9 board (using one or both pads), 30 black pyramids, 45 green pyramids, 30 white pyramids.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;&#10;The board starts full of pyramids. Players take turns capturing pyramids or stacks of any colour orthogonally.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the most green pyramids captured (being part of stacks they control) wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest stack wins. If the tie persists, play again.&#10;&#10;Please refer to the rulebook for detailed rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;Greenest is the third game of the Green-Greener-Greenest set. Green, Greener and Greenest are three games that use the same set of components.&#10;&#10;Greenest is a solo game.&#10;&#10;Setup the board as in Green. The goal of the game is to end up with a single stack, by making captures also as in Green (Black can only capture Green and so on), but in any order. This is, you can capture several times with the same colour, or reverse the order.&#10;&#10;Whether all initial configurations are solvable or not still remains an open question. Your feedback on this will be greatly appreciated.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Set in 1948 in an Alternate History where Dragons had risen 5 years earlier during World War II to decimate most of the world's great cities. Armies made up of the remnants of world powers are making a last stand in this semi Co-operative Resource management, engine building, with area control and dice combat game. &#10;Take to the air in experimental German planes, Use submarines to avoid detection from roaming dragons.&#10;&#10;Three Dragons including the Mother are randomly placed on three major cities.&#10;&#10;Players select their army and determine start order.&#10;There is a card drafting phase where certain number of cards are drawn and the last player in turn order gets first pick of the cards and then passes to next turn ordered player and then back to them where everyone gets to keep two cards.&#10;Now it is first players turn. They have a number of actions based on the number of Generals they started with. Each general can give one order Explore/Move, Mine, Sell/Trade, Build, Attack or Draw a Card. Early emphasis is on gathering resources to develop weapons and vehicles. Players will explore the globe and mine by flipping hex tiles. The revealed mine may have gold, oil, metal, uranium or it may be a dragon cave and unleash a new dragon. The new dragon will immediately fly around the board. It's direction will be dictated by a 4 sided die. It will only stop when it reaches a city or player who will have to fight it. If too many cities are captured the game immediately ends and all players lose.&#10;&#10;As player armies start to get stronger it is advised that these players team up to start hunting dragons whose carcasses are a plethora of new resources: Scales, Blood and Hydrogen allowing very unique upgrade abilities. If the dragon had a city base, victorious players can turn over the tiles and reap the benefits.&#10;&#10;Once players become strong enough they will attempt to defeat the Mother Dragon. If they poses a hydrogen or atom bomb they can do so but by destroying city they will not reap the treasures.  The city being lost may also cost them the game if the limit is met. Once all dragons are destroyed players count their active mining territories, cities and gold to find out who is the new world super power and ultimate winner.&#10;&#10;",

The players start with an objective plus a limited amount of real seeds (included in the box) that are used as bidding coins in order to get tree cards and complete sets of tree families which give more points. In each round a single tree card is auctioned, and the player who bids the highest for it, gets the card and points associated with it. This is a simple but original game inspired by nature and tree life.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a dice-throwing gambling game with a fairly elaborate board. The board consists of a 100-space track divided into three areas.&#10;&#10;The outer ring consists of 26 squares around the edge of the board, each showing the flag of a German royal realm, princedom, grand duchy or duchy, as well as those of the free cities Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg and the (recently conquered) territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The second ring consists of small squares numbered 27-82 in a variety of colors including light and dark blue, red, green, yellow and white. The final ring is a circle numbered 83-99 which sits at the center of the board flanked on either side by soldiers on horseback and above and below by the rules. The 100 space is a coat of arms in the middle of the circle.&#10;&#10;Players each start with the same amount of money and put an agreed sum into the pot. They take turns rolling a single die to move along the track. Players need to know the ranks of the various flags: they receive 3 marks from the pot when landing on a royal or duchy space, but must put 3 marks into the pot when landing on a princedom or grand duchy. The free city squares have no effect. Landing on the same space as another player also has no effect.&#10;&#10;Landing on Alsace-Lorraine (12) or on the squares 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 means going back to square 1 and starting over. A player who runs out of money is no longer allowed to play. Whoever gets to the 100 space first collects the pot.&#10;&#10;",
