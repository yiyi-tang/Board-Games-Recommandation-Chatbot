Hidden deep within the Labyrinth for centuries, the minotaur Asteros yearns to wreck havoc on the world above. He is an unnatural beast that cannot be reasoned with. Do you dare unchain him?&#10;&#10;Asteros comes packaged with a detailed pre-painted figure of the legendary minotaur, equipped with rules, tokens, and a unique scenario. With no prior allegiances, Asteros can be used with any faction. Since Asteros is an Epic Hero, he is fielded with a smaller force than normal, replacing a hero and a trooper on account of his legendary power and sheer size&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jeffing is a traditional gambling game played by printers, using movable type as dice. In particular, the em quad (a piece of type without a letter, used to introduce a space of em width) was used as it approximated a cube and had a nick in one face (to indicate the front of the piece of type). &#10;Players cast five or seven em quads on a flat surface and count the number of nicks showing on the tops of the quads. All players agree on a stake. Players than cast the em quads the same number of times and the highest scoring player wins the stake. The remaining players then cast the quads again and the lowest scoring player has to pay the highest scoring player the stake.&#10;&#10;This description is based on a description from the early 19th century, an excerpt of which can be read here: http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/026778.php&#10;&#10;",

Bach is also an exciting game of chance and skill that introduces some basic elements of music theory without detracting from the playability of the game.  Bach is a thoughtful and cahallenging game for anyone from the age of 10 to adult, regardless of any previous knowledge of music theory.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns drawing cards and moving notes to form scales.  The first player to form the required scales wins the game.&#10;&#10;The first game may take about 1 1/2 hours.  Once you know how to play, each game will average about an hour.&#10;&#10;Game components are:&#10;&#10;1 board&#10;26 plastic chips with green and blue stickers on opposite sides.&#10;2 information cards&#10;23 key cards&#10;65 interval cards&#10;rulebook&#10;&#10;The board is placed between opponents so that each is facing one of the note rows corresponding to the color on their chips.  All notes are place on the note rows so that each note matches the letters and symbols in each square.&#10;&#10;The cards are separated into two decks of interval and key cards and placed face down beside the board.  The green player draws the top key card.  It tells you the scales that you have to form to win the game, and it must stay hidden until the end of the game.  The blue player does the same.  The rest of the key cards are put away.&#10;&#10;The green player always goes first.  He/she draws an interval card, showing it to their opponent.  The card tells how many squares you can move one &quot;note&quot; as well as the direction that can be moved.&#10;&#10;Game play continues until one of the players has formed their scales, and shouts &quot;I win&quot; or something similar.  If this is shouted and the player has not formed their correct scales, play continues and that player loses a turn.  The game is over when one player has completed the scales indicated on their interval card.&#10;&#10;",

If their total is higher than the original noted roll they take the &quot;High&quot; bets.  If their total is lower than the original noted role they take the &quot;Low&quot; bets.  On a roll that matches the original noted roll they take both piles.&#10;&#10;When players tie for high and low they must split evenly leaving the remainder in the betting pools.  If a player or players roll a match then no &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Low&quot; players win and all bets are divided equally among winners leaving remainders in their original betting pools.&#10;&#10;",

Seven other figures stood in a wide circle, each armed with an array of weaponry - a sniper, a famous action hero, a modern day samurai, a no-nonsense paid assassin, a post-apocalyptic survivor, a huge musclebound powerhouse, an anti-terrorist soldier.....All armed to the teeth and ready to fight to the death.&#10;&#10;The retired spec-ops Colonel flicked the latch of the sturdy missile launcher that was slung across his shoulders, checked the magazine of the machine gun hanging across his chest, andd fiddled one last time with the sights of the sniper rifle in his hands.&#10;&#10;Overkill was underrated.&#10;&#10;KABOOM! is a party game for all ages for 4-8 players. Each player receives one of 8 characters and, using dice, chooses weapons with which to attack their opponents, wearing away their life points until they are the last one left standing. Each round of KABOOM! can be played in a matter of minutes, especially if played at a high tempo, and so although players are eliminated, they never have to wait long for a new round to start! Players are encouraged to hold grudges, get into character, mock, cajole, beg and target the player who keeps winning!&#10;&#10;While the game is about shooting eachother, it's abstract enough that it's suitable for children, in fact much of the playtesting was carried out on children aged between 7 and 14....But is also fun and suitable for adults, especially adults who are letting their hair down!&#10;&#10;",

A players may change direction on the board after each turn.&#10;&#10;The four main categories are:&#10;Lilac: Soft and close (domestic animals) - in Danish: 'Bl&oslash;d &amp; N&aelig;r (husdyr og landburgsdyr)' &#10;Blue: Beaks and fins (birds, fishes, and sea mammals) - in Danish: 'N&aelig;b &amp; Finner (fugle, fisk og havpattedyr)'&#10;Light brown: Vild and warm (wild life mammals) - in Danish: 'Vild &amp; Varm (vildtlevende pattedyr)'&#10;Green: Creeping and crawling (insects, frogs, amphibians and reptiles) - in Danish: 'Kryb &amp; Kravl (insekter, f&oslash;er, padder og krybdyr)'&#10;&#10;The fifth additional joker category is:&#10;White: Fun and crazy (problems and challenges) - in Danish: 'Fis &amp; Ballade (opgaver og udfordringer)'&#10;&#10;The players collect paws (plastic chips with a paw imprint) in the four main colors by correctly answering questions of the respective colors. The white category cover a variety of challenges to be fulfilled in a certain time (such as naming a certain number of animals starting with a particular letter, or drawing or acting a particular animal) or simply an order to transfer a certain number of paws to or from another player or the stock.&#10;&#10;If a player land on a tile occupied by another player, the other players is returned to home and have to start out again (keeping the paws collected so far).&#10;&#10;The winner is the player or team who first collect three paws of each color and get back home.&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;Game board&#10;Rules&#10;4 animal-shaped game pieces&#10;48 paws - 12 in each main color&#10;1 die&#10;2 boxes with a total of 300 cards with 1500 questions and challenges&#10;4 pads of drawing paper&#10;4 pencils&#10;1 30-seconds hourglass&#10;&#10;",

The game is won by checkmating the opponent King.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a linear chess variant, played on a half-sized board. The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; theme of the game points up the byzantine nature of this circular chessboard. Rooklike moves are translated directly to the board. Diagonal moves are translated as jumps, moving by staying always on the same color and hopping over squares of the other color. A full set of pieces and 4 pawns each, coupled with the board's two 1-square wide avenues of approach, offer a good range of chess tactics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the author's introduction:&#10;&quot;To create the game I used an approach similar to that used by Carl Jung when he philosophized about the I Ching and the concept of synchronicity... To put myself in the right frame of mind for creating the rune game I first concentrated on Odin and Chess.  In Nordic mythology Odin is a wise god who brought the runes to mankind, something akin to Prometheus bringing fire to men.  I then thoroughly shuffled and mixed a set of rune cards and randomly selected six... I was surprised by the results...&quot;&#10;&#10;This 10x10 chess variant takes inspiration from its theme and converts some of the standard chesspieces into their Norse equivalents. All the non-royal pieces retain their moves and capturing abilities. The queen becomes a valkyrie, with the additional power of transporting a king to safety by taking its place on the board. Knights become Forest oxen, with great horns that can kill in a neighboring square. Pawns become minor pieces, giving up their promotion ability to do so. And kings must &quot;consult&quot; before doing anything. The king moves and captures like any friendly piece it starts the turn next to. Each player has 2 of each type of piece, including kings, and 10 pawns. The game is won by capturing both enemy kings.&#10;&#10;",

It is of the shogi branch of the chess family but does not involve drops. Set-up is on the back row identical to international chess [i]except[/i] that king is placed on the center left column for either player so that kings are not facing each other. Pawn however occupy the third rather than the second row.&#10;&#10;For simplicity, I'm using the international chess names of pieces rather than the traditional Japanese names. The king moves one space in any direction but castling does not exist. The queen moves one space in any direction except diagonally backwards. Bishops move either one space diagonally in any direction or one space forward. Knights move only forward in an otherwise normal knight's move so that the piece jumps to a space on either side of the space two rows ahead of its starting position. Rooks move only forward but otherwise like a standard rook. Pawns move only one space forward with no initial two-step move, and all pieces including pawns capture as they move.&#10;&#10;The promotion zone is the last three rows on the board for either player. All pieces except the king and queen promote to the queen. Promotion is optional so long as a piece still has a legal move in its non-promoted state. The promotion happens at the end of the move and the move must either begin or end in the promotion zone.&#10;&#10;The object is to check-mate the opponent's king. Both bared king and stalemate count as a win, but a bared king becomes a draw if the other player can bare one's king in the next move.&#10;&#10;",

Sho shogi has no drop mechanism. All pieces used in modern shogi are used in sho shogi and have the same movements and initial positions, but sho shogi also has one additional piece with respect to the modern game-- the drunken elephant which promotes to a crown prince and begins the game directly in front of the &quot;king&quot; (osho or gyokusho). The drunken elephant moves one space in any direction except directly backwards, and the crown prince moves exactly like a king because it is a second king. Namely both the crown prince and the king must be bared, checkmated and/or stalemated simultaneously to win. Baring counting as a draw only if one's own king can be bared the next move.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 (Drunk Elephant still present) and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi).&#10;&#10;",

The console also functions as a die, so some roll and moves are also included.

    "Description": "Signum Mortis is a game for 3 to 6 players lasting between 3 to 5 hours aimed at more mature gamers. The game - even though cynical and satirical - is based in part on the historical facts as outlines by Marcus Tullius Cicero in his famous speech in defense of Sextus Roscius. Even though you can trust Cicero - as lawyer that he was - to illuminate the 'facts' in a specific light, also according to other sources the proscriptions were every bit as bad and corrupt as shown in this game.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of Chiefs of Roman gangs from the Aventine Hill during Sulla&rsquo;s reign of terror and proscription of 82BC. On one hand the players are building a reputation for being most daring, bringing proscribed but highly influential Senators or Equites to 'justice' (by chopping of their heads). By this they gain blood money as bounty while also plundering the homes of those unfortunates. Still, some of that money should better find its way back into Crysogonus&rsquo; coffers. The freedman Chrysogonus was Sulla's right-hand man in this and his 'secretarius' meticulously notes down your name and the bounty paid. Chrysogonus does not look favorable on those lacking generosity in their presents. On the other hand, the gangs also raise money by extorting the grain merchants or the red-light district. Player&rsquo;s might also prey on each other in an attempt to rob the other gangs of their ill-gotten wealth either on the way home or by besieging or storming and plundering their lair. But beware Sulla&rsquo;s veterans patrolling the streets and your competitors as bounty hunter, Sulla&rsquo;s freedmen the Sullani. Players use their boss and his three lieutenants, all of them being specialized for different roles, and beef up their gangs by rogues lending numbers, muscles, speed or stealth. Sometimes guile succeeds where brutal force fails. The hulking brute - worth 3 normal men in a fight - might be hard-pressed to blend into the crowd if a patrol of Veterans enters the city quarter. Players might try to bribe officials to influence the Civil War, steer the patrols or 'ameliorate'their records with the 'secretarius' while influencing the proscription lists. They use prophecies by the witch (the 'Stryga') to influence and scare their superstitious opponents. The overall goal is to become the richest and most infamous of all bosses. Still, finally peace will come. Depending on the outcome of the civil war which the players might vigorously try to influence, the Chief having killed the wrong people and the Chief not having parted generously enough with his money, &quot;unfortunately&quot; will be executed.&#10;&#10;This will leave only those of the rich and infamous who survived, to finally win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Johnston at Hoke&rsquo;s Run in the Shenandoah Valley.&#10;&#10;This fictional encounter is a prelude to First Manassas.  The battle at Hoke&rsquo;s Run could have very easily taken place, because General Patterson drove the Confederates away South from Falling Waters the previous day.  The Confederates regrouped around Hoke&rsquo;s Run and camped ready for battle the following day, but Patterson failed to press the Confederates and moved to Martinsburg instead.  The Confederates waited four days for a battle that never came.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in about 1 hour; it is very tactical and can be played again and again.  It has a time limit of 16 bounds in which the Confederates must inflict a devastating defeat on the Union army.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game that gives a flavour of the American Civil War period.  A simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&#10;&#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.

    "Description": "The game consists of 50 number cards and 60 numeral cards. There are various ways to play with these, aimed at children with dyscalculia issues, but grown-ups can also play this. &#10;The main rule set requires players to just use the numeral cards. The game starts with one card on the table. Now the players take turns either adding a card from their hand or replacing a card with one or more card(s) from their hand. The only condition is that the numeral on the table has to get bigger each time. A player who cannot increase the number on the table loses a point and the cards are dealt again. The maximum number that can be achieved with the included cards is nine hundred ninety nine thousand eight hundred and ninety eight (which is one word in German).&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game consists of a whoopie cushion and a poker card deck with various names of farts on them.&#10;&#10;The farts are graded by the Fart Meter as follows:&#10;2 - Whoopie Cushion&#10;3 - Hand over Mouth&#10;4 - Hand Under Armpit&#10;5 - Hand Under Knee&#10;6 - Loud But Harmless&#10;7 - Foghorn&#10;8 - Tea Kettle&#10;9 - Loud and Odorous&#10;10 - Spotters&#10;J - Forever Fart&#10;Q - S.B.D.&#10;K - The Flamer&#10;A - Atomic Bomb&#10;&#10;The game is a Go Fish variant where the person who makes an unsuccessful request for a card, can either draw for the card they need, or they can attempt a fart that matches the card they desire.  So if the player asks for a 4 and they are told to &quot;Go Fart&quot;, they can draw from the deck or they can do a &quot;Hand Under Armpit&quot; fart, which is what the Fart Meter shows for a 4.  Other players judge the fart.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box....&#10;If you plan ahead you can really have &quot;a gas&quot; with this game.  The have a &quot;leg up&quot; on your opponents be sure to consume large quantities of beans or chili with carbonated beverages.&#10;&#10;Object: The object of the game is to be the first person to get rid of all your cards by creating three of a kind or a run of three consecutive numbers i.e. three Spotters (three 10's) or a run of J,Q,K (Forever Fart, S.B.D., The Flamer).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the website. &quot;www.pentologygames.com&quot;&#10;&#10;Pentology is an adventure card game. While the core mechanics remain constant, the cards are designed for use in any number of different games. It is most comparable to a standard fifty-two card deck of playing cards. Although it does not have suits and numbers, jacks or queens, Pentology does allow mathematically sound strategy; group, team or solo play; simplicity or complexity; all with the same deck of cards.&#10;&#10;Pentology further provides players with a backdrop fantasy theme for every game. With Pentology cards, solitaire games become a mission of saving your allies and defeating your nemesis; poker style games suggest the fun of defining the characteristics of your own hero, and then pitting her strengths against your opponent's; and blackjack feels like a quick skirmish.&#10;&#10;Standard playing cards have long been popular because of the vast number of games that can be played with a single deck. Pentology cards boast that same value. Each deck includes a rulebook with rules for five different games, and as creative enthusiasts come up with new game rules and post them on the forum, the list of available games will grow.&#10;&#10;With the support of online community, players can continually find new games, contribute their own ideas, and vote on which games to standardize.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two groups of friends meet while vacationing on a tropical island.  While relaxing at the local tiki bar, they enter into a friendly wager.  They will take to the skies, and each team of friends will race through the tropical skies, plunging by parachute back to the island.  The last group back to the tiki bar buys a round for everyone.&#10;&#10;Paradise Plunge is a game of strategy for two players who must assemble their teams in the air and reach the island and the tiki bar before their opponents.  Players begin with their teams of parachuters spread across the tiles that make up the sky over the island.  Each turn, a player may move one of their parachuters, &quot;play the wind&quot; by rearranging the tiles in a row or column according to direction of the wind as marked on the tiles, or rotate one or two tiles so that the wind on those tiles points in a different direction.  Movement is complicated by the fact one player may push an adjacent player in the direction of the wind, but may not separate groups of three or four of the opponent's parachuters.  The winner is the player to move all four of their parachuters to adjacent tiles with one of those parachuters on or adjacent to the island tile.&#10;&#10;",

They are put in the hollows on the board in such a way that they won't slip out of place. The large wooden die with extra-deep indentations comes with a board that will be appreciated also by sighted people.&#10;&#10;Frank Stark has designed a game that is fun to play with the entire family.&#10;&#10;A player who believes he is on his final spurt can still be pushed back by a 'stopper' die roll, or an opponent moves your own piece back again - this causes lots of trouble and mischievous joy, no matter whether the player can see or not.&#10;&#10;Knowing the way Frank Stark is, it is quite clear that he wouldn't think of just one game for one board - so Camino comes with an additional bonus game and two more variants to choose from.&#10;&#10;... And why shouldn't Camino be played also by people who can see but are blindfolded?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "16 Scenarios compatible with the ASL system.&#10;&#10;FE 62 Uncle Joe's Fury, July 1941: An old fashioned combined arms assault on boards 48 and 44 with a good sized Russian infantry and tank force attempting to capture buildings and kill Germans who are equipped with infantry, tanks and guns.&#10;&#10;FE 63 Out Land, August 1941: The Finns and the Russians go at it in this scenario. Finnish infantry assaults the board 10 and 42 villages attempting to capture buildings against infantry, guns and tanks.&#10;&#10;FE 64 The Iron Ring is Closed, August 1941: This is a very meaty scenario. 44 German squads, OBA, halftracks and assault guns attack on boards 40, 49, 42, 24, 22 and 23. The Russians defend with 42 squads and several guns. The victory conditions are interesting with each side attempting to control the riverbank.&#10;&#10;FE 65 Straight to the Front, September 1941: This scenario offers some good replay value. The Germans attack across boards 19 and 11 attempting to capture some buildings. The Germans get SS infantry and some AFV. The Russians start with some infantry and receive random tank support. A medium sized scenario should be popular.&#10;&#10;FE 66 Tedium, October 1941: This is a classic slogging match across boards 19 and 44. Dug-In Russian troops try to stop a combined arms German force. The Germans have infantry, tanks and halftracks against the Russians with infantry, fortifications and Guns.&#10;&#10;FE 67 A Cold Day in Hell, December 1941: The Finns and the Russians go at it in this small infantry only action. The action takes place in winter conditions on boards 8 and 42. This should make for good tourney action.&#10;&#10;FE 68 Beast of Prey, March 1942: A real and true slugfest in the woods. Once again dug-in Russian defenders on boards 32 and 36 try to hold Germans from exiting the board. The Russians get infantry, fortifications and Guns while the Germans get SS infantry and some Stugs.&#10;&#10;FE 69 Tiger Woods, August 1942: Yes! Another scenario with Tiger in its title!!! If that is not enough to get you excited then this scenario's OB should do it. The Germans get 4 Tigers up against a couple of Russian T-43's and a AA Truck. Each side gets a good number of infantry. This action takes place on boards 36 and 42.&#10;&#10;FE 70 Worker's Settlement No. 8, September 1942: This cool infantry only scenario (well the Germans get one INF gun) takes place on board 33 and 4. This scenario has a cool twist for entry conditions with the Russians entering anywhere on 3 board edges. A cool twist in the VC makes for some uncertainty on where to attack. Sure to be a favorite for the tourney crowd.&#10;&#10;FE 71 Cold Steel Rain, January 1943: This is another meaty scenario that should offer some good replay value given the variable VC. The Germans get infantry and some AT Guns and defend on boards 33 and 48 against attacking Russian infantry, OBA and some T-60 tanks. .&#10;&#10;FE 72 Manos a la Manos, February 1943: The Spanish Blue Division makes its debut in this action on boards 13 and 18. The Spanish infantry with an AT Gun and some variable additional forces must defend some terrain against a lot of Russian infantry, tanks and Flamethrower tanks. The Russians got the numbers but do they have the time to capture the victory terrain?!&#10;&#10;FE 73 Polar Star, February 1943: Another meaty old-fashioned scenario, this time on boards 17, 19 and 18. The Germans get 24 squads, fortifications, Stugs and some AT Guns and must hold off a swarm of 32 Russian squads, Assault guns and tanks from exiting and capturing some buildings. Lots of options in this one fore each side.&#10;&#10;FE 74 Fruitless Fighting, March 1943: The classic capture the village type scenario on boards 12 and 17. This scenario features 20 Russian squads supported by tanks and assault guns attacking the village against an outpost of SS infantry and some fortifications. The Germans receive reinforcements in the form of infantry and 4 Tiger tanks.&#10;&#10;FE 75 Porech'e Push, August 1943: My favorite of the scenarios in this pack. The Russians fight out of a bridgehead against a strong German force to capture the hills overlooking their bridgehead. Really get the flavor of the historic action in this one. The Russians get a bunch of infantry and an assortment of AFV against German infantry, guns and additional forces that they select from an available force pool. This scenario is set on boards 3, 8 and 49.&#10;&#10;FE 76 The Battle of Krasnogvadeisk, January 1944: This is another one of those big scenarios that capture the flavor of east front action. Set on boards 18, 49 and 22 this is a meaty scenario with 26 Russian squads and 5 AFV attacking to capture some buildings against 21 squads, 4 tanks and some fortifications.&#10;&#10;FE 77 Stalin's Revenge, June 1944: Another Finnish versus Russian scenario setup on boards 5 and 32. This is a smallish scenario featuring 9 Finnish squads and a couple of AT Guns against 15 Russian squads and 3 AFV. This is a brutal one for the Finnish as they attempt to stop the Russians from capturing some buildings.&#10;&#10;",

From the rest of the stones a playing field is built up of 10x10 pieces.&#10;The starting player rolls with the six dice. Once the die is cast, a player turns the hour glass. As long as the hourglass is running, all players have time to explore on the field a similar set of stones which are set by the dice. The goal is to identify as quickly as possible to the corresponding color as in the color field. The more stones the found color range contains, the more point a player gets.&#10;&#10;",

The game takes a lighthearted look at fairy tales, movies, and books that involve the forest and applies those story ideas to the Agricola universe. The expansion is expected to be released widely in German and English and was first released at Spiel 2010.&#10;&#10;This expansion has 24 cards that will add a new dimension to your games of Agricola, and it is incorporated into the game in a similar fashion to the X-Deck. Shuffle the cards together at the start of the game to form the Forest Deck; whenever any player claims three or more wood in a single action&mdash;whether by taking the 3 Wood/4 Wood action space or by taking wood that's accumulated on other spaces&mdash;you draw a card from the deck and use it. Many of the cards in the expansion will have an immediate effect on the game, though there are some Minor Improvements, Occupations, and new Action Spaces that may be drawn as well. There may even be other surprises lurking amongst the cards&mdash;after all, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition (nor Gisem&uuml;ck the dragon)!&#10;&#10;From the box:  &quot;When farmers are done with their daily tasks and gather around the warmth of their hearth, stories are told of revenants and werewolves, unicorns, witches, faeries, and other creatures of the wood. And those who have to go into the forest the next day to fell some trees might remember some of the old stories... and shudder.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Pod People seek to infiltrate the city and must do so by secretly assigning Influence cards from their hand to the different locations.&#10;&#10;The Humans play in the same fashion but as they will be outnumbered and seek to sabotage the invasion, they must try to assigning as low Influence as they possibly can without raising too much suspicion on their part. If they're not detected and manage to hinder the aliens from influencing more than half of the city within one week they have succeeded. But if the city has been overrun by then the world shall never wake up again.&#10;&#10;&quot;The seed is planted... now terror grows.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A  print-and-play dice (and resource management) game of making wine. All that is required is a lot of 6-sided dice, and a score sheet for each player.&#10;&#10;Players roll a bunch of dice to create a central communal pool, and then take turns pulling out groups of dice from the center pool of dice to buy supplies. Eventually, a player will have enough supplies to make a barrel of wine and score points.&#10;&#10;However, the trick is that since the center pool of dice is constantly dwindling, a player has to plan accordingly, since on future turns the dice pool may not have the correct kinds of dice that a player needs to get the desired supply he wants.&#10;&#10;A new addition in the market board, which makes the timing of selling your wine all the more important.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is up to version 7 or something, but the game is now strong enough that I refuse to call it a beta anymore.

    "Description": "Ecalper is a 2-player abstract game about negotiation for territory conquest. It was invented in 2010, while the designer were reflecting about the pie rule.&#10;&#10;The game begins with an empty 7x7x7 hex-hex board. The game is scalable, so a beginner can start with 5x5x5 and. Expert players should play on 8x8x8 board or bigger.&#10;&#10;One of the players uses black stones and the other player uses white stones. Players move alternately, starting with black player.&#10;&#10;In the first turn, the black player places just 3 stones.  For each turn afterwards, players replace 1 of their opponent's stones placed in the last turn (not the replaced one) by their own, and continues placing 3 more of his stones.  In the last turn, black replaces just one of the last white stones and the game is over.&#10;&#10;The pie rule can be used.&#10;&#10;When at the end of the white turn the board has just 1 empty cell, the last turn starts. The game ends with an unoccupied cell. When the game is finished, the player with the largest group of stones wins. If both players have the same score, the winner is the player with less number of groups. Of course a player may resign at time if the situation looks hopeless, this causes his immediate defeat.&#10;&#10;For making the gameplay easier, without memorizing the last three opposite placements each turn, it's possible to mark those stones in some way.

The game is based on a year in time. Just like in real life, growers have to withstand the elements of winter, spring planting, growing season and harvest to hold onto as much yield as they can. Hopefully with the help of their local agronomist and by attending the Winter Grower Meeting and the Answer Plot Knowledge Events, growers can plan well and gain enough insight to protect and increase their yield. The player with more yield than other players (the neighbors) at the end of the game (the grain elevator), wins!&#10;&#10;",

The action takes place into two different worlds: the celestial world, represented by a Taiji (Yin Yang); and the terrestrial world, represented by a map of Japan. The players represent kami and their mission is to give life to the earth. To achieve this, they will play counters, which represent vital energy (ki), in the two different worlds.&#10;&#10;Each player can play one counter par turn, but they have cards which represent shintai, that is to say temporary incarnations. With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.&#10;&#10;By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.&#10;&#10;By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before. The ki thus changes into kigetsu, &quot;moon energy&quot;, which allows to start a cosmic-scale battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;The Thousand Bomber Raid is a participation game based on a Lancaster Bomber raid on Hanover on 14 October 1943. It is intended to be played with about 10 players and 1 or 2 Umpires, in less than 1 hour. Each player is intended to fly one bomber; however it is quite possible to have 2 or even 3 players for each bomber. The maximum number of bombers a single Umpire can handle is about 10.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;For a small rules set, this has some intriguing and innovative features. Physical tasks are required to make certain checks during the game. For example... pilots are required to toss a prop joystick up in the air and catch it in order to perform tasks and engineers must assemble small Lego patterns under time pressure to repair components. The Umpire shines a powerful flashlight in the eyes of pilots while they are performing tasks if they are &quot;caught in search the searchlights.&quot;&#10;&#10;Navigation is an especially important feature of the game, both for purposes of finding the target, and for staying with other bombers so as not to make easy prey for German night fighters.&#10;&#10;Each bomber needs to be represented by a miniature. Game requires d6s, copies of various printed charts and maps, a dartboard along with distinctive darts for each player, a flashlight, a thick dowel (or other prop joystick), and some Lego (or similar) building blocks.&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #91 (April 1995)&#10;&#10;",

However, being an awkward sort, I'm not happy with the rules currently available. The main  reason for this is the scale at which commercial rules operate. They're all designed for squadrons of boats with relatively little attention being paid to detail in terms of individual vessels. These rules are intended to fill in the gap left by commercial sets, and enable you to fight actions in which each vessel is an 'individual.' They're best suited to games with no more than one or three boats per player, as any more tends to result in the game being too slow, and measurements are given in inches.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;Rules set covers Movement, Gunfire, Damage, Fires, Sick-Berth Attendants, Depth-Charges, Torpedoes, Damage Cards, and the use of the Models/Miniatures.&#10;&#10;Required for play: Ship Models (1:72 scale or similar), charts from the rules, a playing surface with a map or terrain, a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100), string, and a simple set of damage cards (instructions to create these are include in the rules).&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #94 (July 1995)&#10;&#10;",

I've only seen this game in a toy museum.&#10;&#10;Each player gets four marbles and a mouse. A marble is put onto the mouse and then you have to carry that marble to the top, using a cord that acts as a lever and pulley. If you drop the marble, then you must go back to the base of the cheese and try again on your next turn. The first player to get 4 marbles to the top, wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;This set of rules allows you and a few mates to go rummaging around in old ruins looking for sacred texts, the Hair Lip of St. Ravell, treasures of a lost age or just about anything else you fancy. Most of all, it gives you a set of simple, fast and enjoyable skirmish rules for the late medieval or renaissance period. There is also, dare I say it, an additional section which allows for more horrifying encounters in the ruins. Not for everyone, I know, but we enjoyed them and I hope that you do too.&#10;&#10;To play, you will need 2d10 and 2d6, a ruler marked in inches, two or more sets of around 8-10 figures and some sort of ruin or building model.&quot;&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;These relatively simple rules cover both combat and searching for items in the ruins. Rules set includes melee and ranged attacks, armor values, morale, etc. Each side gets a pool of points with which to buy a small skirmishing force. Each unit gets outfitted with armor and weaponry (with more effective items costing more). Set also comes with an appendix for Horror/Fantasy game play, which introduces undead creatures, spell casting, etc.&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #161 (February 2001)&#10;&#10;",

When battle starts, the more powerful unit will defeat the other. The first to reach, and destroy their opponents castle will win the game!&#10;&#10;The gameplay is simple. Each player has a castle and a 20-sided die. The die is used as a counter to represent the amount of damage the castle can take before it's destroyed. In order to protect the castle, each player will draw cards. Players will draw creatures with powers of 1 through 5. The higher the number, the more powerful the creature. The creatures are strategically placed in lines using one of 4 horizontal positions in front of the castle. If at any point an &quot;Attack&quot; card is played, the front line of each players army will attack each other in a head to head battle. The creature with higher power will destroy the other. Unused power will be applied to the creature behind the defeated creature. If a player is eventually able to successfully deal damage to another player's castle, the castle takes damage. If a castle is brought to zero, that owner of that castle loses and the game is over.&#10;&#10;",
