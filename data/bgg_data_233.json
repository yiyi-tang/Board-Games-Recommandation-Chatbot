    "Description": "Devils &amp; Black Sheep  is a tabletop nanogame: small, light, quick, and easy. Turns last about 1 minute, and a game lasts 30-45 minutes. It is designed as a two-player experience, but it scales well and could be played with 3-4 players if you combine two games.&#10;&#10;Players control outlaw crews zooming from battle site to battle site in deep space. The goal is to be the first to arrive, pick through the flotsam and derelicts to find the salvageable wreckage, and escape back to the nearest planet. There are shady deals and scams to be run on the side, too.&#10;&#10;Navy patrols wander the area, intent on keeping pirates, bandits, and smugglers in line. The patrols monitor each player's &quot;wanted level.&quot; When a player has a high enough bounty or is caught with contraband too many times, the patrols will chase them down and exact revenge. Sometimes a ship's own activities will make them more wanted; sometimes a reliable tip off from a rival crew will do the trick.&#10;&#10;This game consists of three components:&#10;&#10;Cover &amp; Rules - 80# text paper;&#10;Board - 16 pt cover stock;&#10;Counter Sheets - 38 pt die cut chipboard.&#10;&#10;Devils &amp; Black Sheep has a simple 3-part turn sequence.&#10;&#10;1. Place New Wrecks: This is accomplished by rolling the die and following a placement matrix to determine where rumors of wreckage will lead you.&#10;&#10;2. Navy Patrols Act: This will be a tame part of the game early on, but as your Wanted Levels increase from all your shady activities, it could get nasty.&#10;&#10;3. Players Act: Choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;Bribe: donate to an election campaign in exchange for a reduction in wanted level&#10;Bounty: place a bounty on a ship to increase its wanted level&#10;Fence: sell some of your loot to the local chop shop&#10;Raid: attack an opponent and steal some of their stuff&#10;Salvage: explore nearby flotsam for something of value&#10;Move: pretty self explanatory&#10;Smuggle: sell dark energy on the black market ... VERY illegal stuff&#10;&#10;Degrees of Success - After choosing an action, players roll to see how well their action succeeded. The roll determines how successful your action was. This game specifically avoids the polarized success/failure result that commonly turns choices into all-or-nothing deals, and instead replaces it with a gambling mechanic.&#10;&#10;Players roll the dice at the beginning of each turn to determine whether new reports of a recent battle reach the rumor mill of the local cantina. The rolls determine how much wreckage is rumored (some battles are larger than others, of course ... just as some rumors are more outlandish than others), and the sector and distance from the planet. These wrecks are derelict ships abandoned or destroyed in a recent battle. Every wreck has the potential to be salvaged for valuable (ish) flotsam, but the actual amount of salvageable junk won't be known until you arrive and check it out.&#10;&#10;The local Navy Patrols then roll to see whether they are ordered to bring any of the outlaw crews to justice. Sometimes the patrols will simply move around and harass players. Sometimes they will bring the full might of their patrol to bear.&#10;&#10;The higher the player's &quot;wanted level,&quot; the more likely a patrol will take notice and give chase. Wanted levels can increase by getting caught in your illegal activity, and can also be increased by other players placing bounties on your ship. Your wanted level decreases by either being attacked by the local patrol, or by bribing officials to reduce it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Presidential is a game of strategy played with dice and chance cards on a beautifully designed map of the U.S. showing the Electoral College votes of each state.  Two teams, Democrats and Republicans, fight for control of state delegations to ultimately win more than 270 electoral votes.  The Presidential is an entertaining and educational family game -- fun for both students (13+) and adults.  You may not know how the Electoral College works, but you'll enjoy the excitement of playing for the most powerful job in the world!&#10;&#10;The Play of the Game&#10;&#10;The 2 teams decide which side will be the Republicans and which side will be the Democrats.  The Republicans take the 150 red votes (chips) and the 3 red dice.  The Democrats take the 150 blue votes (chips) and the 3 blue dice. The teams then decide how much time there is until election day by selecting a number of weeks until the election.  One each turn, each team must decide whether they will go Fundraising or Campaigning.&#10;&#10;Fundraising&#10;There are 4 states where a candidate can fund raise (California, New York, Florida and Texas).  The team decides which state they would like to fund raise in and then rolls 2 dice.&#10;&#10;If a team rolls a 9, they have 9 votes to distribute.  At least 1/2 the votes must stay in the fundraising state.&#10;&#10;The team then draws a Politics Card, follows the instructions, and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.  The Politics Cards offer many rewards and a few penalties to the teams.  They are similar to rolling another die.&#10;&#10;Politics Cards&#10;Here are a few examples of the Politics Cards:&#10;&#10;     Silicon Valley tycoons host a successful fundraiser for you. Add 6 votes to California.&#10;     You receive a 100% approval rating from the NRA.  Win 5 votes in Texas.&#10;     A popular blogger unveils pictures of your opponent&rsquo;s wife buying a brand new Bentley.  Add 3 votes to Michigan.&#10;     You are spotted wearing a Red Sox hat while prepping for a debate.  Your opponent adds 3 votes to New York.&#10;&#10;&#10;Campaigning&#10;If a team chooses to campaign, the team selects and announces the 3 states they will campaign in on that turn.  Each state may only be visited once each turn.  The team then rolls 3 dice.  The team then decides which die corresponds to each state and contributes those votes to that state.&#10;&#10;Votes&#10;Each chip equals 1 vote.   Votes are gained through the roll of the dice and the Politics Cards.  At any one time, each state is Republican (Red), Democrat (Blue) or neutral.   The votes in a state represent the net amount of chips that have been allocated by both parties.&#10;&#10;End of the Game &#10;When time is up (the number of weeks that was selected have passed), there may be several states that are undecided (still neutral) either because they are in a tie or no team has campaigned in them or allocated them fund raising money.  At that point, a neutral state is selected and each team rolls a die.  The highest die wins the state and the electoral votes go to that team.  If there is a tie roll, the teams roll again.  The team with the highest number of electoral votes after all the neutral states have been awarded to either team wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Cards order tanks to move, turn, fire weapons, or use special equipment, creating a variety of strategies.&#10;&#10;Will you use a simple frontal assault with cannons and mortar? A careful advance, using targeting programs to give more autonomy? A confusing diversion with viruses and scanners? Your tanks will keep doing the same thing until you reprogram them, so choose wisely....&#10;&#10;The original game included mounted maps and plastic tanks.  When FMG issued a limited revised edition, they went to cut-out standup card tanks and paper maps in a &quot;no frills&quot; white box.  Cards and gameplay are the same between the two versions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bitwy II wojny &#197;&#155;wiatowej (B-35) (Battles of World War II) is a system designed for representing World War II medium battles.&#10;&#10;Counters represent battalions and companies, one hex represents about 2000m (depending on specific game), one turn represents 8, 12 or 24 hours.&#10;&#10;B-35 has a high level of complexity. Rules include airborne/sea landings, fire combat (long distance combat between armoured units), air force, engineers, special units etc. &#10;Another distinctive feature of this system is the way of determining strength of unit. Each unit has a chart with its strength; when unit suffers loses, player has to mark it on chart.&#10;Classical activation system (&quot;I go, you go&quot;) and simplified command rules drives the game.&#10;&#10;The game contains fiction map and scenarios but historical units (German, American, Polish and British).&#10;&#10;Bitwy II wojny &#197;&#155;wiatowej (B-35) debuted in 1993 in the 3rd issue of the Magia i Miecz magazine. Some small boards and counters, along with rules were published there in the Klan Mi&#197;&#130;o&#197;&#155;nik&oacute;w Gier Strategicznych part of the magazine. Later system moved to the Strategia i Taktyka and Dragon magazines. Dragoncompany published first boxed edition of the system along with some other games using it (Szczury Pustyni, Kaserine 1943). Rules evolved and were published in the Dragon Hobby magazine in the 90's. In the same time additional rules for the Pacific War Theatre, along with the new boards, were published in the Dragon Hobby magazine as well.&#10;&#10;After the end of the Dragon company, Taktyka i Strategia company took care of the system, publishing new editions (currently 4th), with new boards, scenarios and the games. As for now (2018) Bitwy II wojny &#197;&#155;wiatowej (B-35) is the most complex WW II Polish system with biggest number of games, scenarios and expansions, published frequenntly in the Taktyka i Strategia magazine.&#10;&#10;Board's publication history:&#10;Dania - Dragon Hobby 1/98&#10;Drezno - Taktyka i Strategia 3/2002&#10;Fiordy - Taktyka i Strategia 15/2005&#10;Finlandia - Taktyka i Strategia 20/2006&#10;Map nr. 5 - Taktyka i Strategia 31/2010&#10;&#10;",

Second, none of the character models are possible murderers in the game, instead they have been replaced by six random characters from the series on cardboard tokens. Third, there&rsquo;s an added Contraption Card pile that you can get by landing on a &ldquo;?&rdquo; spot. Lastly, all of the characters have a Personality Card that gives them an added ability in the game like the ability to travel to a different part of the board without rolling dice, or getting the chance to see the same card someone just revealed to someone else.&#10;&#10;Contraption cards will do things such as adding an extra six to your dice, taking an extra turn, or asking a bonus question.&#10;&#10;",

Plays a lot like Trivial Pursuit but with some differences. Players move on the board and answer questions in ten different topics. On the board are ten `topic rooms&acute; where players receive a plastic `book&acute; if they answer the question correctly. The winner is the first player to collect all ten books and return to the spot in the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;To spice things up a little players may use cards. These come in three types: One gives you a clue for your current question, one lets you steal a book from another player, and the third kind lets you choose which book to get when you answer correctly in a topic room. Thus, if you know that History is not for you, than you may win two books in the Biology room and exchange one of them for a History book.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 8,000 questions on 800 cards.&#10;&#10;This game is related to Det store norske spillet.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Kunskapsjakten.&#10;&#10;",

Since then, the first action for every player will be to withdraw a card from the deck. This card should have five different gifts represented and, as you already deduced, it is our Gift List.&#10;&#10;To acquire different presents from the table, every player should roll the die. When the present is collected, the players could perform different actions with their gifts (open &amp; keep them, exchange them with other players or even steal gifts from another player's reserve). Some gifts will also let you perform extra actions during your turn.&#10;&#10;Every player should make an effort to collect the gifts represented in their Gift List, since only the gifts that appeared in this card will push them closer to the victory. They will try to hide which ones are part of their list and, at the same time, they need to ditch all the gifts that there are worthless, according to their list.&#10;&#10;Once there are no more presents on the table, every player will count how many of their gifts match the ones represented in their Gift List.

    "Description": "Ten assassins gathered in one resort. Only one gets to be called the Number One Killer. Enough said.&#10;&#10;Hitman Holiday is game of deduction and strategy where as many as up to ten players take on the roles of ten of the deadliest assassins mankind has ever known. Gathered at the world's most beautiful resort, otherwise known as Paradise, they are out to play a game of death in a bid to eliminate competition in business as well as claim the much coveted title of Number One.&#10;&#10;A truly unique game, one may say it is what happens when Cluedo meets Battlestar Galactica meets Werewolf. The game begins with each player having a secret target to assassinate. The fun part is that the targets do not know yet which player is targeting them. This means that while you are trying to find a way to secretly kill off your assigned target, somewhere out there among the players is also someone trying to kill you, and it is up to you to find out who before it is too late! This is all done at the resort, which provides a ton of ways to kill someone, such as shoving them off a balcony, or dropping that accidental flower pot from three stories above. The game also takes on a different angle from the generic James Bond killer image, presenting its killers from all walks of life, even including old women and innocent looking young ladies. Instead of purely guns, they also use almost anything around the resort, turning innocent objects into lethal weapons.&#10;&#10;There are hidden actions, and the need to deduce who is killing who based on clues that drop now and then. Observing how each player behaves on the board also gives away clues sometimes as to whether or not they are your assigned killer. This is and will always remain the very FIRST game from Medieval Lords, and one that has taught the studio a ton in terms of experience and execution.&#10;&#10;WARNING: Due to the large number of players the game can go up to, you might have to expect a longer downtime than the average game!&#10;&#10;",

A play round consists of the two phases &quot;army buildup&quot; and &quot;movements and fighting&quot;. In the army phase the players receive new army and hero cards as well as useful action cards. Then, each player in turn moves their units to adjacent spaces.  If enemy units are on the space they do battle.  If you win, you gain points and can continue the battle.  If you lose, the next player continues the fight.  Play ends if the player armies can breach the Black Gate which gives the most points.   Alternatively, the players win if Frodo and SAM reach the last field of the mount doom. But if Gollum gets there before SAM and Frodo, all players lose.&#10;&#10;Like the previous 2 big box games in this series, it will likely be released only in Germany.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Release! is a light card game about software and the people who  make it. The game is simple: manage cooperation and competition with other players across five releases to score the most points. Each round of Release! is played the same way, but the scoring rules change as you reveal new tools and methods. Your team needs to continuously respond to these strategic shifts in order to produce the best release possible.&#10;&#10;Release's core mechanics are modeled after classic trick trump games. Rounds, or releases, are played by each player contributing a card to a trick, generally the highest card thrown takes the trick. This continues until the players are out of cards, at which point in time they score the release.&#10;&#10;Scoring rules are where it gets tricky.  Every release the players will reveal a new scoring methodology. These scoring rules award or subtract points for taking; various combinations of cards, lump sums of suits, or a specific number of tricks.  This means that some rounds you want may want to lose as many tricks as possible, win as many as possible, or fish for specific cards.&#10;&#10;The face cards lend further complexity, these cards all have special bonus powers that do things like: affect their rank, steal previously won cards, award instant points, and much more.&#10;&#10;The game itself is themed to evoke certain trends of software development. Themeing elements include naming conventions, fun copy, and the face cards are all modeled after famous 'faces' of the development community.&#10;&#10;",

None of you are successful enough to buy your own seaplane, so you all pitched in and bought one together, which means that each day you all have to use the same plane to make all of the day's deliveries &ndash; and some of you aren't going to get paid. To make matters worse, the plane is in such disrepair that the instrumentation is broken, the compass demagnetized, and the windshield is covered in cracks, duct tape, and the remains of a few unfortunate seagulls, so the pilot might as well be flying blind...&#10;&#10;Each day in Island Hopper, players auction off the Captain's seat; the player who becomes the Captain is in charge of flying the plane for the day, but cannot make any deliveries of their own. To make their deliveries, the other players bribe the Captain to fly to the islands to which they need to go, thereby earning themselves cash. When it's time for the Captain to fly, the Captain must close his eyes, pick up their goods tokens, and attempt to land them in an island's harbor. A successful landing means that players can fulfill their contracts and the captain collects his bribe &mdash; but if the goods splash into the sea, you might find yourself under water...&#10;&#10;",

You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).&#10;&#10;",

Players begin with weapons and equipment cards used to help fight enemies and find clues. Cards can be lost in fights or gained at landmark spaces. Turn in matching clue cards at the corresponding location to rescue the president or his important tape. To escape, you still need to find a glider or a map to the mine fields.&#10;&#10;Fans of the movie will enjoy the chance to encounter Slag, Brain, Cabbie, Maggie, the Duke, and Romero with the opporutnity to gain them as allies during the game. Players win by obtaining the Tape first and foremost, failing that - the President himself. The game is very faithful to the movie and players will find that they can mirror many scenes of the movie in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Movement of the players is die driven. There are slightly different rules if you are a defending team than if you are an attacking team, because the attacking team is currently in possession of the ball, the defending team's objective is to 'steal' the ball and become the attacking team now.&#10;The game ends when one player runs out of action cards and a certain number is rolled on a die.

Matching Ticket Cards allow players to play a mini-game, and Random Event Cards can be played when drawn - and are marked now/once/permanent. There are more detailed rules for all of these actions.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who gains 5,000 NeoPoints points - or 4,000 points for a shorter game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game of Lawless Empire transports you to the seedy underworld, where you walk in the shoes of a Mafioso, vices and all. Using the unique dice mechanics of the game, you will scheme, bribe, extort, recruit, and command syndicates in order to fulfil your persona agenda, winning only if you meet more conditions stated on your hidden Mafioso card than other players by the end of 5 rounds. There are many paths to victory; strategise by building your empire with filthy lucre, or recruit&nbsp;various soldati to carry out your dirty jobs and dominate the syndicates early. To emerge triumphant, you must learn to negotiate and manipulate your opponents ruthlessly.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player is dealt a hidden mafioso identity (E.g. Godfather, Don, Informant) at the start of the game. Scoring conditions are specific to each identity, and the score for each player will be tallied after 5 rounds of gameplay.&#10;&#10;Much of Lawless Empire revolves around dice placements. Dice are tactically allocated to the various plans in the fight for bribery tokens, lucre tokens, new soldati, and control of syndicates. Players can ask for assistance from other players after they gain control of a syndicate. Controlling or assisting a syndicate will allow players to give hidden orders to the syndicate. There are 2 types of orders with varying strengths: to secure or to sabotage. Orders given to syndicates will be revealed at the end of 5 rounds to determine if each syndicate is secured or sabotaged. Depending on your mafioso, you will score based on how many syndicates are secured or sabotaged, and/or whether you control or assist the syndicates.&#10;&#10;The distinctive feature of Lawless Empire shines through its workings of dice control and interactions, abetted by soldati power and scheme cards. Concealed scheme cards are played on each plan by the players, sneakily altering how each individual plan is won. For&nbsp;example, a plan is normally won by the player with the highest total value of dice allocated to it, but the &ldquo;Underhand Attacks&rdquo; scheme card dictates that the player with the lowest total value wins instead. On the other hand, your soldati will grant you the ability to control the dice (including your opponent&rsquo;s) after their placement (e.g. to move or exchange dice around plans, or even rotate a dice to any value). This combination of allocation, scheme cards, and soldato abilities presents a fresh take on the otherwise luck-dependent dice mechanics, thus ensuring a thrilling and compelling game without repetition. The hidden elements in the game (mafioso, scheme cards, syndicate orders) provide a good setting for players to bluff, negotiate, persuade, and trash talk. However, players who are intimidated by such interactions can be assured that the game can be won by outwitting everyone.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kombat Kittens Game Rules&#10;&#10;THE GOAL&#10;Collect the most treasure by battling your kitten compadres and taking their treasure. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure wins!&#10; THE DECK&#10;80 Kitten Cards: Ten each of ranks 1-7 and ten of rank 9 (There is no rank 8 in Kombat Kittens.) Each card has treasure value from 1 to 4.&#10;Five Dog Cards: Each Dog card has a treasure value of 5. Dogs do not have a rank.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Remove all Dog cards from the deck and deal each player five Kitten cards.&#10; For two players: Deal out three Kitten cards face up in the center of the table - these are the Recruit cards. Add three Dog cards to the remaining deck, each &#226;&#133;&#147; of the way through the deck, with the last on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.&#10; For three to five Players: Deal out one Kitten card face up in the center of the table - this is the Recruit card. Add two Dog cards to the remaining deck, one at the center, and one on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.&#10; The player with the most realistic &ldquo;meow&rdquo; goes first.&#10;&#10;TAKING TURNS&#10;On each turn, the player can either:&#10;1) Draw a card from the Draw pile. (If they have less than seven cards in their hand.)&#10;or&#10;2) Take a Recruit card and replace it with a card from their hand.&#10;or&#10;3) Battle another player: do this by declaring which player you wish to battle.&#10; We recommend passing a turn token (coin, salt shaker, stuffed mouse, etc.) around the table as you play this game. It is always okay to ask how many cards another player has.&#10;&#10;Battles&#10;In a battle, both players attempt to make the best three card set from the cards in their hand.  &#10; To indicate they are ready to battle, each player holds their first card face down over the table. When both players are ready, they reveal their cards simultaneously. They repeat this process until three cards have been played (unless a player forfeits, as described below.) After the third card, the best hand is determined and the winner chooses their treasure (see below).&#10;&#10;DETERMINING THE WINNER OF A BATTLE&#10;The winner is the player with the best hand based on the hierarchy below, from high to low. If two hands of the same type are played, the one with the highest rank wins.&#10;Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 4,4,4 beats 2,2,2 and all straights, pairs and high card hands.&#10;Three Card Straight: Three cards of adjacent rank. Example: 4,5,6 beats 2,3,4 and all pairs and high card hands.&#10;Pair: Two cards of matching rank, plus one other card. For matching pairs, the one with the highest 3rd card wins. Example: 6,6,5 beats 6,6,3 or 4,4,7 and any high card hand.&#10;High Card Hand: A hand without a straight and no pairs. Example: 7,4,3 beats 6,5,2.&#10;&#10;TIES&#10;If there is a tie, all players involved in the tied battle discard the played cards and take the number of cards they played from the draw pile instead of drawing up to five cards. No treasure is taken in a tied battle.&#10;&#10;CAPTURING TREASURE&#10;At the end of battle, the winning player captures Treasure from the losing player(s) as follows:&#10; Three to Five Player Game: The winner may now take either one card from the losing player&rsquo;s played cards or the lowest value treasure from the losing player&rsquo;s captured treasure. If there are multiple lowest value cards, the winner chooses whichever of these they want.&#10; Two Player Game: The winner takes one of the loser&rsquo;s played cards - they cannot take captured treasure.&#10;&#10;AFTER A BATTLE&#10;Once battle is resolved, all uncaptured cards that were played are put into a discard pile, which we call the Litter Box. Then,  all players who participated who have fewer than five cards left, draw new cards until they have a total of five in their hand.&#10; All captured cards are placed face up in front of the player who captured them, so that their treasure value and suit are visible to all. Additionally, if a player forfeited (see below), they draw an extra card now. If a battle ended in a tie, then each of the players in the battle (primary and helper) draw the number of cards they played (three or one).&#10;&#10;HELPING&#10;Once a battle has been announced, but before the first card is played, each player involved in the battle may ask for help. If Player B agrees to help Player A, then Player B will play a single card at the end of the battle, after Player A has played their three cards. In a four or five person game, each side in a battle may ask for and receive help. If both sides have a helper, then each helper reveals their card simultaneously after the two main combatants have shown all three cards.&#10;&#10;After all cards are played, each side makes their best three card hand out of the four cards available.&#10;&#10;Taking treasure: In a helper battle, two cards are taken from the loser. The main combatant on the winning side chooses one card from the played cards (all four cards, if the losing side had a helper) and one card from the main losing combatant&rsquo;s captured treasure. If the main combatant on the losing side has no captured treasure, then the winning side takes two cards from the cards played. Once they&rsquo;ve taken treasure, the winner can choose to give one of those cards to the player who helped them.&#10; Example: Kim announces she will battle Josh. Josh and Kim both ask for help. Mike agrees to help Kim, and Vivian agrees to help Josh. Kim and Josh then simultaneously reveal three cards from their hand in sequence. Mike and Vivian then both reveal a card from their hand. Kim&rsquo;s side ends up with 5,5,5,7 and Josh&rsquo;s side ends with 4,5,6,7. Kim&rsquo;s side wins, because she has three 5&rsquo;s which beats Josh&rsquo;s hand of 5,6,7.&#10; Kim then takes one card from Josh&rsquo;s captured treasure, and one of the four cards played (one of the 4,5, 6 or 7).  Although she could add both cards to her own treasure, she gives Mike one of the two as a reward for helping her.&#10;&#10;FORFEITING&#10;Either of the main combatants in a battle may forfeit after playing their first or second card. Players who are receiving help can forfeit as well, but even if they do, the helper must play a card. Cards played by the forfeiting player or their helper are subject to being taken by the winner, just as in any other battle.&#10; If a player forfeits, they are allowed to take an additional card from the Draw Pile after the battle. If they are left with fewer than five cards at the end of battle, they first draw until they have five cards then take their additional card. Helpers on the forfeiting side may not take an additional card. They only take new cards if they have less than five in their hand at the end of battle.&#10;&#10;DOGFIGHTS&#10;If at any point during play a player draws a Dog card from the deck, they immediately place it face up in the center of the table and a Dogfight commences. (Before the Dogfight, the player who drew the Dog draws a new card and any other players who were in mid-draw should finish drawing.)&#10; Players must play at least one card in the Dogfight, but they may forfeit after playing their first or second card. The winner of the Dogfight takes the Dog card and places it face up in front of them in their captured treasure. As in normal battle, all players select a card and hold it face down over the table, then reveal their cards at once. Unlike a normal battle, players may not ask for help.&#10; The Dogfight ends when either a) all players but one have forfeited, or b) all players who are still in the Dogfight have played three cards. In the case of Ties, the Dog is discarded, and all players who played three cards take three cards from the draw pile.&#10; As with normal battle, any players who forfeit the Dogfight battle draw an extra card at the end of the battle and all players who have fewer than five cards draw until they have five.&#10;&#10;REACHING THE END OF THE DECK&#10;Two Players: At the end of the first deck, there will be a single Dogfight (the bottom card is always a Dog) and then the game is over.&#10; Three to Five Players: At the end of the first deck, after the Dogfight, take all the discarded cards from the Litter Box and reshuffle them. Then add the last three Dogs to this deck, each card roughly &#226;&#133;&#147; of the way through the deck with the last Dog on the bottom of the deck. When you reach the end of the second deck there will be one final Dogfight and then the game is over.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;Two players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the first deck.&#10;Three to Five players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the second deck.&#10; Note: If any player has fewer than five cards or needs to draw cards due to a previous battle, then shuffle the discards from the Litter Box and draw cards before the final Dogfight.&#10;&#10;DETERMINING A WINNER&#10;At the end of the game, each player adds up the treasure value of all cards in their captured treasure (the ones face up in front of them) and adds any Suit Bonuses (as described below). The player with the highest total wins! They should be patted on the head and given a treat.&#10;&#10;SUIT BONUSES&#10;A player who has four or more treasure cards of the same suit receives a 10 point bonus at the end of the game. Players receive this bonus once per suit of which they have four or more cards.&#10; Example: If a player has four captured Samurai kittens, they get 10 bonus points. If they have eight captured Samurai, they still get just 10 bonus points. However, if they have four captured Samurai and four captured Mechs, they get a 20 point bonus (10 for each suit).&#10; If two or more players tie for the the highest treasure score, the tied players play a three-card hand after first drawing to make sure have at least five cards in their hands. The player with the best hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The War Law system simulates mass combat in a fantasy setting. The Standard Game is provided for a quick way of resolving large scale combats between two opposing forces in a minimum amount of time. The Standard Game doesn't require a Gamemaster or Referee; instead, the rules provide a set of guidelines that make a GM unnecessary for resolving movement and combat. The Standard Game is an abstracted method for simulating large scale battles without a GM. In that sense, it is more like a military simulation board game than a role playing game.&quot;&#10;&#10;War Law covers morale rules, maneuver rules, ferocity rules, leaders, formations, siege weapons, and historical and tactical considerations. The scale is 50-100 combatants per unit. Each unit has an Offensive Bonus, a Defensive Bonus, an Armor Type, a level, and a shield bonus. In addition, units also have a movement point total and a morale rating. Combat is resolved using percentile dice and an extensive collections of charts. Counters and hexmaps (5/8&quot; hex = 100ft.) are provided, but miniatures can also be used. The turn length is 120 seconds per turn.&#10;&#10;",

Precise laster arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life--oxygen, heat, and fuel--into the hard vacuum.  That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse.  Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space--cold, dark, silent.  Keep your thrust burns to a minimum--they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect.  Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself--give nothing away.  Keep your weapons ready, in case&hellip; There!  A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a meneuver drive.  Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution.  The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: &quot;Have they seen us?&quot; It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are?  You might never know the answer.  If you beat him, maybe you'll find out.  But what if you hadn't seen him first?  Some questions must remain unasnwered when death, unbidden, comes scorching toward you as silent, brilliant lances.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;Brilliant Lances - Traveller Starship Combat&#10;Brilliant Lances includes:&#10;-Vector-based movement&#10;-Detailed hit location and damage resolution&#10;-Lasers, particle accelerators, meson guns, detonation laser missiles, and the systems that defend against them&#10;-Extensive ship ratings, including New Era and pre-Collapse warships, from the swift Rampart fighter up to large naval and merchant vessels&#10;-Complete starship design rules, usable both with this game and with Traveller: The New Era roleplaying game&#10;&#10;",

Players cut cards to determine the first dealer and the trump suit. In the four-player version of the game all the cards are dealt. (There are rule variations for two and three players.) The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card and the others, in turn, must follow suit of they can. The highest card wins the trick and advances one&rsquo;s pawn down the track. The color of the card on which the lead pawn rests is always trump. No players may share the same space. If the next space is occupied, the player advances to the next unoccupied space.&#10;&#10;In addition, the deck contains two Suit Yourself cards and four Sidetracked cards. The Suit Yourself cards are ubertrump and the players must follow trump if any trick is lead with it. Any player who takes a trick containing a Sidetracked card must move off the track and but that player comes back to the track on the next trick that player wins.&#10;&#10;The first player to get one&rsquo;s pawn to the Finish card is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spies are conducting business on all of the continents. Everyone wants to employ as many spies as possible of course. Six cards are lying in the middle of the table, each representing a continent, as well as six cards depicting typical spy tools. Before the start of the game, a spy-chip is placed beside each card.&#10;&#10;Each player holds three cards in his hand and places one openly in front of him during each round. The cards always show two symbols: a continent and a tool. Players can &ldquo;report&rdquo; two or more cards with the same symbol when it is their turn. For this purpose, he or she can use hand cards, those in front of him or both. One may then lay down the difference of one&rsquo;s cards and the already displayed chips as spy chips. If a player lays down three South America cards for instance, and there is only one spy attached to that continent card, he may lay down the difference (2 spies) out of his supply.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to lay down spies. For example, if there are already 4 spies at the &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo;, a player needs to report at least 5 cards with &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo; in order to get rid of a spy. One also has to catch the right moment for reporting, because reporting too early means one might only get rid of very few spies. If one waits too long, others might be quicker. The player who gets rid of his spies first wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each Muse that you encounter will gain you inspiration points and assistance in encountering her sisters. You may also call upon hints gleaned from the works of classical authors.&#10;&#10;It is a very quick, solitaire dice and card game. It is comprised of nine cards and three tokens and requires two standard D6s. There is no setup required and you can play through a full game in under five minutes. There is a significant element of luck in the game but players must make the right tactical choices to capitalise on that luck.&#10;&#10;Each of the nine cards represents one of the Muses. On the card is a point value and - in most cases - a dice manipulation power, to be gained by encountering that Muse. Around the edge of the cards are between one and four conditions that you must meet on the two dice in order to encounter that Muse. Each turn the player draws a new card, turns any unclaimed cards 90 degrees clockwise and rolls the two dice. Using any powers they have acquired, the player then tries to claim (encounter) one of the active cards by matching the condition currently showing at the top of the card. Cards which are not encountered before they run out of claim conditions are discarded.&#10;&#10;&#10;        Update. A new edition of Muses is now available at www.goodlittlegames.co.uk&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If only...&#10;&#10;Everyone has something about their past they desperately wish they could change: a terrible loss, that missed opportunity, the greatest of mistakes. If only you had known that that one tiny detail would make all the difference. If only you could do it again, everything would be different now. But if you WERE given the chance to rewrite history, would be brave enough to take it? Could you face the unknown and its unforeseen consequences? Could you fight fate to create the perfect moment?&#10;&#10;In The Perfect Moment, players race to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum, and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn, players activate up to two revealed cards, which each have special effects. After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it. The first player to 16 points wins. It takes careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different.&#10;&#10;This time...&#10;&#10;&#10;Includes the first 3 sets of the series, and the solo mode rule set:&#10;&#10;     1994: A Relationship Gone Wrong&#10;     1981: A Bank Robbery Gone Wrong&#10;     2005: A Big Event Gone Wrong&#10;     The Perfect Moment: Echoes (1st version)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is the first of a series of games which uses a dreidel in lieu of a d4. Like the traditional game Dreidel, it is themed for the Jewish holiday of Chanuka. Each move taken and cards added to or taken from a common pool for any spin are related to the traditional dreidel game. Movement can be modified by use of cards. That movement is round the six points of a star or magen David, and an action is associated with each space on the board.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to fill the eight slots of a menorah with candles. Certain actions can gain a player one or more candles. One can even try to take candles from another player, but if the attempt fails, one may lose candles to the player targeted instead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A very simple game in which players compete to reproduce as many Snits as possible, while smashing the other players' Snits with the Bolotomus.&#10;&#10;Each player plays both a tribe (21 chits of his colour, of which 4 are randomly selected for each run) of Snits, emerging from the sea (one end of the map), racing (each counter is marked with a speed in hexes) to the cover of the Snandergrab (a big counter/tile covering 7 hexes), and a Bolotomus (a large bored creature represented only by the Smash! counter denoting the hexes where it hopes to crush Snits).&#10;&#10;Movement of Snits, and location on the Bolotomus' Smash! are secretly written down, and simultaneously revealed. Once under the Snandergrab (Snits who survive 9 game turns but didn't make it there are placed under anyway), Snits reproduce (3 more counters are added per survivor), and they all race back to the sea, imperiled by the Bolotomus again. A second reproductive run follows, then the winner is judged by the greatest number of surviving Snits.&#10;&#10;Published in The Dragon Magazine #10. Errata published in The Dragon Magazine #11.&#10;&#10;A revised version of the game was published in Snits!.&#10;&#10;",
