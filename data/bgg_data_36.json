Your job as a member of the League of Librarians is to save the world's books &mdash; one word at a time.&#10;&#10;Illiterati is a real-time, co-operative word game in which players work together to form words and bind books. Each player starts the game with five letter tiles and a red torched book that shows a condition that player must achieve to restore that book, e.g. using 8+ tiles with at least 3 green symbols, create words that are all animals. A library of three random tiles is placed in the center of the table. The game takes place in three-minute rounds, and before the round begins each player draw seven letter tiles from the draw bag.&#10;&#10;Once the countdown begins, players can talk and trade letters as much as they want with one another and the library to try to achieve their goal. Once time ends, if the library contains too many letters &mdash; and this threshold is based on your difficulty level &mdash; then you trigger a burn event. Flip all of these letters face down, then remove one of them from the game, then discard excess letters to the discard bag. If you burn too many letters, you lose the game. If you didn't burn any letters and you've completed your goal, flip your red book face down and draw a blue waterlogged book to give yourself a new goal.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, draw an illiterati villain card and resolve its effect. If you've drawn this villain previously &mdash; and the deck contains five copies of five villains &mdash; then all of the previous effects from this villain also resolve in a chain attack from newest to oldest. Villain attacks often strip letters from words, which means you'll need to create new words with what's left during the next round to avoid burning another letter.&#10;&#10;Once all players have completed two books &mdash; or three or four depending on your difficulty level &mdash; draw one more book, the Final Chapter, with all players needing to complete this challenge in the same round, e.g., using 12+ tiles, create words in which all of your vowels are the same color. If all players meet this goal during the same round, you win; if even one person fails, another villain attacks, then you draw new tiles to start another round. You can discard and redraw up to seven tiles at the start of a round, but you must draw a second illiterati villain card that round &mdash; and if the villain deck runs out, you lose.&#10;&#10;",

Then everyone chooses one gift card in hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whoever plays the lowest gift card wins that round's holiday card; in the event of a tie for lowest, with the Clauses counting as zero, then the next lowest card wins. Each player then draws one card to bring their hand back to twelve cards.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, players score points for each holiday card they've collected. In addition, whoever holds the most gift cards for each rank scores as many points as that rank, with all tied players scoring in the event of a tie. Whoever has the most points wins.

Each turn the sorcerer rolls a symbol die that shows which character moves first that turn; the Robin players take turns rolling a number die, which has values for both Robin and the sorcerer.

    "Description": "On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.&#10;During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.&#10;&#10;&#10;[1st edition]&#10;&#10;Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves.&#10; Game Features:&#10;&#10;        German Panzer Corps/Russian Tank Army capabilities&#10;        Soviet massed artillery&#10;        German tactical proficiency&#10;        German Tiger tanks&#10;        Soviet sappers&#10;        air power&#10;        differing capabilities for Marshal Zhukov and General Manstein&#10;        Zone of Control Bonds &#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS (1st edition)&#10;&#10;    280 1/2&quot; full-color counters&#10;    One One 22x29&quot; full-color mapsheet and one 5x29&quot; full-color mapsheet which form a 26.75 x 29&rdquo; map&#10;    32-page Rule Book&#10;    2 full-color 11x17 Player Aid Cards&#10;    1 8.5x11 Sequence of Play Card (w/ Historical Setup on the reverse side!)&#10;    Three 6-sided dice &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;[2nd Edition]The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France '40 and Normandy '44.

Each game is different because you build the playing deck with seven types of cards (+110.000 combinations!).&#10;&#10;Each player has a private hand with two cards and there is a public row of five cards available for all the players on the board. This is the structure of the turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Choose between &quot;Enter the Battle with a Mole&quot; (playing one card is mandatory) or &quot;Move Moles in the Battlefield&quot; (playing a card is optional for each mole).&#10;    Score the lines of sight between your moles.&#10;    Refill the cards in your hand and the public row.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the &quot;Peace&quot; card (hidden at the bottom part of the deck) is drawn, the game ends. The players now score extra badges for majorities and sets of the categories of the cards they used during the battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1917. Russia&rsquo;s Tsar Nicholas II has abdicated and Russia slides toward an ever deepening internal crisis. On the western edge of the vast Russian Empire, the uncertainty in Russia is giving rise to a power vacuum in the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. For many across the Finnish political spectrum, the turmoil in Russia looks like an opportunity to fulfill the dream of Finnish national independence. Yet the competing factions are unable to agree on a common political vision for the country. By January 1918, a bloody civil war will have broken out in Finland.&#10;&#10;All Bridges Burning recreates the political and military affairs of the Finnish civil war in a new COIN System volume for three players. The Reds seek to stage a working class revolt and then hold onto their gains, while the White Senate forces seek to reassert control. A third, non-violent Social Democratic faction fights for the survival of moderate leftism and political reform. All three factions must keep the national sentiment conciliatory enough for a post-conflict settlement and national independence. In addition, the non-player powers of Germany and Russia offer military assistance to the Senate and the Reds, respectively. Excessive foreign involvement, however, could quash the dream of Finnish independence and prompt a collective loss of all three player factions. Historical events, asymmetrical action menus, as well as extensive historical design notes familiarize the players with the historical period.&#10;&#10;A unique sequence of play for three factions poses players &ndash;whether veteran or new to the COIN Series&ndash; fresh challenges in selecting from the asymmetric commands and special activities. The Reds will find themselves needing to split time and resources between competing tasks of solidifying the Red revolt by creating working organs of civilian administration on the one hand, and fighting an increasingly desperate war against a far more powerful enemy on the other. The White Senate faction, in contrast, has a more traditional war to fight. The Senate will want to enhance their military performance by capabilities such as armored trains, cannons, as well as the Finnish, German-trained 27th Jaeger Battalion. Meanwhile the Social Democrats will be focused on building and maintaining underground networks of information, distributing news across the fronts, and advancing a stagnating political process while fending off retributions from the two warring factions.&#10;&#10;A simple but effective card-driven non-player system enables the game to be played solitaire as well as in a two-player mode. The structure of the sequence of play, the character of the commands and special activities in the game, the smaller number of players, and compact size combine to enable All Bridges Burning to play fast. The solitaire system has been designed to preserve that speed and fluidity of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For the 2009 Z-Man Games version, go to Tales of the Arabian Nights&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Tales of the Arabian Nights is actually several games in one.&#10;&#10;In the standard game, the players are characters living in the 1001 Nights universe, wandering about the map and having adventures. These adventures are designed in a sort of paragraph system, with the player to your left reading what happens to you and exposing the choices you have - choices that then lead to other paragraphs or outcomes. The characters evolve during their adventures, acquiring skills of various degrees of advancement to open up new options and various &quot;statuses&quot; (such as married, despondent, cursed, etc) which also affect play.  The object is to become rich and come back to Baghdad.&#10;&#10;Other variants of the standard game include the Quest game, which forces you to roam the map looking for quests to fulfill.  There's also a Merchant game, where your adventures give you arrow tokens which are used on a little separate board to simulate the progress of your caravans.&#10;&#10;The German edition, Geschichten aus 1001 Nacht, was published in 2000 and contained a revised Book of Tales along with some extra adventures.&#10;&#10;",

The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely.&#10;&#10;The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die.&#10;&#10;-description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview.&#10;&#10;This game is #10 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;",

It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies' supply lines and their forces will surrender! You control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces. Each major power has a unique set of cards with which to marshal its forces of army and navy pieces on a map. After twenty rounds  the team with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;From the publisher,&#10;&quot;WW2 Quartermaster General Second Edition completely revamps the award-winning title originally released in 2014 by micro-publisher Griggling Games.&quot;&#10;&#10;Major rule changes from the first edition:&#10;&#10;     Win condition: You cannot win by occupying territory, you now win by being ahead by 30 points or by having the most points after 20 rounds.&#10;     Card texts are rules in this game, and many card texts have changed significantly. An additional four cards (rules) have been added.&#10;     Some map areas have new borders, altering the map and strategic situation.&#10;     Discard and deck depletion rules are changed and now incur VP loss. &#10;     The new Resource Allocation rule allow players to search the draw deck, fundamentally changing the tactics of the game.&#10;     The United States faction have additional map units.&#10;&#10;&#10;Other changes to the second version according to the publisher:&#10;&#10;     The play balance has been fixed to ensure both teams now have an equal chance at victory. &#10;     Updated rules to ensure smoother game play and avoid early knockouts due to economic warfare.&#10;     Cards have been edited, changed, or completely replaced. &#10;     The card balance has been altered, so that players will find some of the worst cards have been up-powered, and the decks changed to ensure that no specific cards seem necessary for victory.&#10;     More cards will are added to the mix&#10;     One more United States Navy piece to help them pursue a war in both the Atlantic and Pacific.&#10;&#10;&#10;Quartermaster General WW2, released in 2019, is a second edition of the game revised to improve its ease of play, clarity, and play balance.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the award-winning, best-selling creators of Exploding Kittens and Throw Throw Burrito, A Little Wordy is a fresh and ridiculously clever take on the genre of tile-based word-unscrambling games.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s how it works: You&rsquo;re each given a pile of letters. Rearrange your letters until you come up with a word. Be sneaky and choose a word that your opponent won&rsquo;t easily guess.&#10;&#10;Write it down, keep it a secret. Rescramble your tiles, pass them to your opponent. The goal is to examine your opponent&rsquo;s tiles and try to figure out their word. You do this with Clue Cards. These tell you things such as: what&rsquo;s the first letter, how long&rsquo;s the word, or what does it rhyme with? You win by using as FEW of these clue cards as possible to figure out what word your opponent wrote down.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s thoughtful, strategic, highly-replayable, and built specifically for two players. It&rsquo;s not a game about having the mightiest vocabulary - it&rsquo;s a game about making clever choices.&#10;&#10;The longest, most complicated word isn&rsquo;t always the best choice. Sometimes, picking a smaller, common word is better because your brainiac opponent will overthink things and blaze right past it. Trying to figure out your opponent&rsquo;s secret word can be both hilarious and (delightfully) maddening. A Little Wordy levels the playing field against veteran word wizards.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

To achieve your goals and to gain honor, you will have to overcome your adversaries in terrifying bloody battles, by holding in respect the other clans grace, honoring hostages or alliances.&#10;&#10;Every turn of the game is divided into three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Diplomatic Phase, where you will be able to exchange military advantages (which make it possible to decrease the randomness of the engagements), to trade and acquire hostages (thanks to whom you will be able to pressure  your adversaries at the time of the engagements).&#10;     Order Phase, where you will place orders on the territories which you occupy. There are three types of orders:  movement, production and raising troops.&#10;     Action Phase, where the honor is of utmost importance. The player with the most honor hosts the Emperor.&#10;&#10;&#10;And that enables him to choose in which order the territories and corresponding orders will be processed.&#10;&#10;You may well imagine, that combats are frequent. One player then rolls 9 dice (whose faces are decorated with the symbols of each clan) whose results are then modified by the  bonus acquired during the diplomatic phase. Only the attacker (and only when victorious obviously) can acquire Prestige (points of honor) due to the engagements. This honor is proportional to the troops vanquished at the time of the conflict.

    "Description": "The land of Cardis has been ruled for many years by King Rhodrig. Cardis is a rich and powerful kingdom controlling all neighboring provinces, which provide valuable resources. All this wealth attracts warlords and raiding parties who more than often launch attacks against the kingdom. So far Cardis has stood against such attacks but with heavy casualties. Thanks to the support of wealthy Archons, the kingdom gets rebuilt so that Science and Arts can flourish once again. At the same time new soldiers are recruited and the army prepares for the inevitable moment when the kingdom will need to be defended once again.&#10;&#10;In Archon: Glory &amp; Machination, players are powerful Archons who support Cardis in order to win King's favor. Players use their influence on their Courtiers and on various figures of authority (Magisters).&#10;&#10;Each game consists of three Seasons. For each of these Seasons, the King issues different demands that players must fulfill in order to score Victory Points. Each season consists of 3 rounds during which players use a card-driven worker placement mechanism to perform various actions that will allow them to gather resources and income, recruit soldiers and, rebuild the city, and acquire scoring cards (Science &amp; Arts). They will also have the chance to train Elite Warriors to assist in the city's defense. After nine rounds, the game ends and the player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's still rummy at heart, with multiple suits of 5 cards each, with the twist being that the suits are designated J for Jekyll, H for Hyde, or J/H for suits that count as both Jekyll and Hyde. The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&#10;&#10;Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.&#10;&#10;This is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.&#10;&#10;",

The combat takes place on derelict, alien infested space vessels know as space hulks.&#10;&#10;Combat is action point driven and resolved through the use of dice.  The marines have a finite number of figures to use in combat against endless hoards of Genestealers.  The object is to accomplish given missions within their parameters or die trying.&#10;&#10;There were significant differences between the 1st edition and this one.  The first being that this version or revision was by Dean Bass and Chris Colston and based on the original game by Richard Halliwell and Paul Murphy.  The most significant difference in this version was the removal of the sand timer and thus the requirement for the marines to accomplish their turn in a limited real-time period. Also the rules of the 2nd edition did not allow the player of the Space Marines to perform actions by using command points in the turn of the Genestealer player.  Another change was the addition of combat specific dice to resolve weapons fire and a special die to resolve gun jams.  A few other minor changes were made to the rules and board graphics as well.&#10;&#10;This version contains the initial six missions found in the first edition and adds an additional 12 missions which were different than those in the 1st edition of the Deathwing and Genestealer expansions.&#10;&#10;Digitally redeveloped into Alien Assault&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Salerno &lsquo;43: The Allied Invasion of Italy, September 1943 is a regiment/brigade-level game on the Allied invasion of mainland Italy in September 1943. Two British and two American divisions land in the Bay of Salerno defended by the full strength 16th Panzer Division, which is soon reinforced by five other German mechanized divisions. For 8 days the survival of the beachhead is in doubt, and emergency measures are taken to reinforce the beachhead with the 82nd Airborne Division. With their counter-attack stopped and the British Eighth Army approaching from the south, the Germans withdraw their left flank to avoid being trapped. However, their right flank stubbornly holds back the British from pushing north to Naples.&#10;&#10;Salerno &rsquo;43 uses the exact same map, unit, and time scales as Normandy &rsquo;44, providing an excellent way to compare these two invasions. Salerno &rsquo;43 uses a modified Normandy '44 game system. With a smaller size, the game is easier to learn and play than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Salerno &rsquo;43 includes two scenarios: an 8-turn Invasion Scenario and a 24-turn Campaign Game. In the Campaign Game, the Allies must exit the north map edge by the end of September 1943. The Germans must delay the Allies to give time for the construction of the Gustav Line further north. The 8-turn scenario can be finished in an afternoon.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2.3 miles / 3.8 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade (mostly Regiments)&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22x25.5&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet of 192 9/16&quot; counters (includes 6 blank counters)&#10;One 32-page rulebook&#10;Two 4 page Player Aid Charts&#10;Two Set-up Charts&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 6 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Schwarzer Freitag is a stock trading game with a built-in bubble to explode. The players are buying shares on a growing stock market, but at one time in the game the prices will crash. The players try to find out the right time to sell their shares and buy gold and silver (these are the victory points), before the market crashes.&#10;&#10;The actions of all players change the probability of the crash. When they start selling, the probability of the crash will get higher. If they only buy shares then the crash will come later.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you have to have a close look at what the others do to be in the position to sell the highest share at the right time, to get the most money. But the silver/gold price will rise too, and you can also win by buying silver/gold early in the game.&#10;&#10;This game is the first game in the Freitag-Projekt:&#10;&#10;Freitag(Friday)  is a game project started on Friday 24th of October in Essen. I, Friedemann Friese, will work on that project for the next Five years on every Friday. I will work Five, Fifteen,... minutes (In German twenty-five, thirty-five,.. starts with an F, too) up to Fifteen hours on that project, but only Fridays.&#10;&#10;The game will be published in Five years on the Friday of Spiel '13 in Essen. It will not be shown on Wednesday or Thursday.&#10;&#10;I have a blog (by now only in German) on my website, where I show my work on that project.&#10;&#10;By now I really don't know what will happen, but I have a lot of time......&#10;&#10;Now it happened that the first game is ready and I found a company for publishing (the company is very interested, but it is not totally sure by now)&#10;&#10;I will add the new second game to the database.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of N&uuml;rnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.  Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

Everything depends on where you play them from, which is the game's main strategic element. You could play a project card straight from your hand and trigger its effect instantly or turn it into a module and play it from your preparation zone. This will let you add it to one of the five buildings in your settlement, trigger an action sequence and transport your colonists to Mars &ndash; a sure way to put a spanner in the works of your competition.&#10;Each card's set of various actions combined with the buildings' unique properties leaves you with a number of small but substantial decisions:&#10;&#10;&minus; Where to put your card.&#10;&minus; Where to play your card from.&#10;&minus; What action sequence will give you the most possibilities within a given turn.&#10;&#10;What's more, anyone can activate an action from a module placed in one of the buildings by another player and share its effects.&#10;&#10;Pocket Mars may be a small game but Micha&#197;&#130; Jagodzi&#197;&#132;ski sure stuffed it with a lot of options that will have an impact on the survival of our civilization! :)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Travel back to Greece in 370 BCE on the island of Kos. Hippocrates has just passed away and that leads to a lot of doubt regarding the durability of his medical activities. As one of his successors, you lead a team of doctors with the goal of perpetuating the treatment of patients in the temple of Asclepios, later known as the first hospital in history. Be the right successor of Hippocrates and increase your reputation, so that patients from all around the Mediterranean will come with the hope of receiving the best treatment ever.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, with each round divided into five phases:&#10;&#10;1. Kalosorisma &mdash; Each player welcomes up to three patients in their hospital. You need to select your patients carefully as all patients need urgent help, and some may be easier to treat than others, but make sure to help the most in need or you will lose reputation as a doctor.&#10;2. Pliromi &mdash; You have to remunerate your doctors or risk their departure.&#10;3. Stratologisi &mdash; In this phase, players try to hire new doctors and purchase medicine kits. If a player obtains both, they receive a bonus.&#10;4. Therapeia &mdash; Now is the time to treat patients. Players have to carefully puzzle and link the right patients to the right doctors to maximize their assets.&#10;5. Exis &mdash; Players count victory and reputation points, and prepare the board for the next round.&#10;&#10;Hippocrates combines auction bidding, tile placement, resource management, and more to create an exciting mix that will challenge each player to best manage their patients and try to become Hippocrates' worthy successor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pairs is the name of the game, and pairs of cards are what players want to avoid.&#10;&#10;The game uses a 55-card deck that contains one 1, two 2s, three 3s, and so on up to ten 10s. At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the lowest card is the first active player. She decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; &mdash; that is, be dealt another card &mdash; or forfeit the round. If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.&#10;&#10;If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)&#10;&#10;There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games. The base game play is identical, but the artwork (and artist) vary across the versions. Some include special game rules relevant to the theme of the deck. In general, you can find new/experimental/user-submitted rules at the Cheapass website, and many non-English versions of Pairs also include rules for additional games to play with this deck.&#10;&#10;",

Don&rsquo;t forget to rent a canal and you can heave anchor.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, beginning with a randomly selected player and continuing around the table clockwise.

On the player's next turn, they will move that Action Card ahead of all the others and choose a different action.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a ship on their turn (ships consists of little cards depicting bows, sterns, and (preferably several) middle pieces with several options to add equipment or crew), it is taken out for a shakedown cruise in a canal, during which they may score points for speed, crew, equipment, or safety.&#10;&#10;As players take their turns, the line of Action Cards will advance around the Action Track. When the lead Action Card reaches the Starting Space again, the countdown marker moves down one space, and play continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the countdown marker reaches the finish space. (It can also end early if the players run out of Ship Cards.) Bonus points are scored for Government Contracts, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game lasts about 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Although it is, in fact, a children's game, it is great fun when played by adults as well.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to accumulate the most points. First a player rolls the red die. Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lignum is a game about the logging industry in the 19th century. As a woodcutter, your task is to prevail against your competitors and collect the most money after two years. Lignum (Latin for &quot;wood&quot;) is a game for lovers of complex strategy games. After cutting and transporting your wood, don't think your job is finished. You'll still have to optimize your entire processing chain - and have fun doing it!&#10;&#10;Each of the eight rounds always begins with the cutting of trees. If your supply lines are set up and the timber has been approved for felling, then the players claim an area using secretly selected cards. Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.&#10;&#10;The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood. Because in the end, this business is all about money, and whoever can make the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With the right roll of the dice in LAMA Dice, you can rid yourself of number cards &mdash; but you'll need to quit at the right time before you possibly bomb out and collect a lot of minus points. You can possibly ditch these points later, but you'll need the perfect number roll or triple llama luck.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts a number of rounds, and at the start of each round you lay out the seven &quot;black-backed&quot; cards that show a llama and the numbers 1-6 in a &quot;llama row&quot;. You're dealt six cards from the deck &mdash; which consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6 &mdash; and you lay those cards in front of you. On a turn, you roll the three dice or quit the round; if you roll the dice, then:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one or more of the dice match the cards in front of you, you can discard one card for each matching die.&#10;    If you roll three llamas, you can discard one point token that you've collected.&#10;    If none of the dice match cards in your row, then you must take one of the llama row cards that does match and add it to your display.&#10;    If none of the dice match either cards in your row or cards in the llama row, then you must take all remaining cards in the llama row, ending the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you quit the round, you turn your remaining cards face down and skip any subsequent turns. The round ends when the llama row is empty, when someone discards their final card, or when all players have quit. (When all but one player have quit, the final player can keep taking turns as long as they like, but if none of the dice match cards in their row, then they automatically bust and take all cards in the llama row.) You then look at the cards remaining in front of you and collect points: 10 points if you have one or more llama cards, and points equal to the card value, with each number card counting only once. If you discarded all of your cards, you can discard a previously collected point token. (Tokens are worth either 1 or 10 points, and you can always swap ten 1s for a 10 token.)&#10;&#10;You play multiple rounds until one player has collected 40 or more points, at which time the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT webpage:)&#10;&#10;Napoleonic 20 Multi-Pack, Volume I&#10;&#10;Fading Glory is the second game (No Retreat - The Russian Front Deluxe Edition is the first) we (GMT Games) are producing as part of our strategic friendship/partnership with Victory Point Games, and the first game we are producing from their popular Napoleonic 20 series. The idea for this and future volumes is that we will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and GMT production.&#10;&#10;The Napoleonic 20 game system from Victory Point Games features lower-level wargame complexity on maps where, generally, 20 pieces or fewer are in play at one time (total, for both sides).  This creates tense, dramatic and fast-playing situations on the board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. Subscribers to C3i have recently enjoyed Jena 20, a game in this series which features eight pages of Standard rules and one-to-two pages of exclusive rules per title.&#10; Veteran game designer Joe Miranda, with developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, have created and refined a highly popular game series that is growing all the time. (Based on Joe's series rules, Alan, Lance, and Steve Carey have each designed one of the games in this multi-pack - in addition to Joe's Waterloo game.) A hallmark feature is the use of narrative random event cards that help &ldquo;tell the stories&rdquo; unique to each battle and small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuvers, combat, and even lulls, provide players a fun exercise in the Napoleonic parry-and-thrust of grand battles as armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first.&#10;&#10;This edition includes the latest version (3.0) of the Standard series rules.&#10; Morale plays an vital role, as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to a key attack or defense. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game!&#10;&#10;Included in this Multi-Pack are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Salamanca 20 (Wellington vs. Marmont, 1812)&#10;    Smolensk 20 (Napoleon vs. Barclay de Tolly in the near-battle to decide the Russian Campaign, 1812)&#10;    Borodino 20 (Napoleon vs. Kutusov before Moscow, 1812)&#10;    Waterloo 20 (Napoleon vs. Blucher and Wellington, 1815) &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps (2 boards, backprinted)&#10;    117  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)&#10;    48 Event cards (12 for each game)&#10;    One 8-page Standard Rules booklet&#10;    4 Exclusive Rules sheets&#10;    One Player&rsquo;s Aid mat&#10;    Two Player Aid charts&#10;    2 six-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGN: Joe Miranda&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Lance McMillan&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

    "Description": "Explore places, combine items, and experience stories in Adventure Games, a series of cooperative games from German publisher KOSMOS. In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In Adventure Games: Grand Hotel Abaddon, you want to discover what strange events are happening in the old building, slipping into your role on the team to follow tracks and decide how the adventure game should proceed.&#10;&#10;",

Will you risk losing everything?&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Roll the player's goal is to collect the most experience points by defeating monsters, battling the dragon, and amassing treasure. Each player selects a Hero avatar, such as a Mercenary, Half-Goblin, or Enchantress, which provides them with unique powers. Then players take turns being the Adventurer, who boldly enters the dungeon seeking glory.&#10;&#10;The Adventurer assembles their party by rolling seven Party Dice, while another player serves as the Dungeon Lord and rolls a number of Dungeon Dice based on how far the Adventurer has progressed through the dungeon. The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.&#10;&#10;All this fighting in the dungeon is certain to attract the attention of the boss: The Dragon!&#10;&#10;When three or more Dragon faces appear on the Dungeon Dice, the Adventurer must battle the Dragon. Defeating the dragon is a team effort, requiring three different companion types. After three rounds, the players add up their experience points and retire to the inn to celebrate their exploits and to plan their next foray into the next deadly dungeon!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the cooperative, press-your-luck game Hotshots, crews of 1 to 4 players take on the roles of wildfire fighters &mdash; crew boss, spotter, swamper, and sawyer &mdash; with special abilities, then roll dice on burning terrain tiles to match the combinations shown on those tiles. The more faces they roll, the better they fight the fire. Players can choose to cut firebreaks, which protect tiles from embers blown by wind gusts, or push their luck to reduce flames and possibly even generate reward tokens. If players bust and fail to match at least three of the six symbols on the tile, the fire grows. Another option is to maneuver vehicles &mdash; air tanker, helicopter, and brush rig &mdash; to save the forest.&#10;&#10;Flame tokens are added at the end of each player's turn by the draw of a fire card, which can bring about light or strong wind gusts, increase the strength of the flames on certain tiles, and start fires. Too many flame tokens will cause a tile to scorch and be lost. Losing a terrain tile could also affect the game play. Some tiles are tied to crewmembers' special abilities, while others help the firefighters, and still others cause the fire to spread in unique ways. If eight tiles scorch or the fire camp scorches, the game is over and the forest is lost &mdash; but if the intrepid crew can extinguish the fire, the team wins together.&#10;&#10;The press-your-luck mechanism with ratcheting rewards creates tension, and the variety of ways to fight the fire makes for interesting choices. The modular tile layout and fire cards bring high replayability to the game, and the acrylic flame tokens provide an enticing table presence.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, you will be acquiring Painting cards and exhibiting them into your Museum, represented by your player board, to create Collections. These Collection can be based either on the painting&rsquo;s Period (ranging from the Renaissance period all the way to Impressionism), or its Domain (Historical, Landscape, Mythological&hellip;). The Collections you create will earn you Prestige points, and the player with the most Prestige at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During play, you will have to deal with the changing trends of the art world, acquiring and exhibiting Paintings depending on what is currently in highest demand. Exhibiting Paintings of the types that are currently in fashion will gain you additional points!&#10;&#10;As your Collections grow, you will be able to open them briefly to the public with a Temporary Exhibition, which allows you to immediately score that Collection&rsquo;s value and obtain special bonuses for the rest of the game. But beware, your visitors will quickly grow tired of seeing the same types of Collection again and again, so timing your exhibitions correctly is essential!&#10;&#10;Museum: Pictura brings exciting new mechanisms and strategies to the table, while maintaining a strong family connection to its predecessor.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You are willing to assist each other and share your discoveries, but in the end, only one of you will become famous enough to be remembered throughout history.&#10;&#10;Astra is a clever mix of tactics and strategy, with a streamlined and intuitive rule set that makes it easy to pick up and quick to play. A game of Astra consists of continuous player turns until a certain number of Constellation cards are taken, when, after an endgame scoring, the player with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;On your player turn, you may choose to either Observe or Rest.&#10;&#10;The Observe action allows you to spend Stardust to discover stars on the Constellation cards using your dry erase marker. You may only mark stars in a straight continuous line, but you may spend Telescope tokens to start new observations. As soon as you mark the last star in a Constellation, you take the card from the Night Sky, granting you a powerful reusable ability for the rest of the game. But other players also benefit from the discovery: based on how many stars they marked, they may choose one of the card&rsquo;s instant benefits (Boons) at the time it is discovered.&#10;&#10;The Rest action allows you to not only refill your Stardust up to your capacity, but also to reactivate all of your card abilities that match the currently active Sphere. Your card abilities are very powerful and strategy-enabling, so a well-timed Rest action can give you a huge advantage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Spies must be clever and quiet, while the villains must deduce and hunt.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 4x4 grid. Both teams have their own copy of the map, separated by a divider. Four dice are rolled each round, and all players program their moves simultaneously by spending those dice. The villains execute their programmed moves first, followed by the spies. When spies take a move action, they must announce some information about their location to the villains, who use this to deduce and track the spies. Both sides have the ability to unlock new tools and get access to more dice each round.&#10;&#10;To win, the spies must hack eight times before the villains hit them five times with their weapons.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

You recruit troops and deploy them on the battlefield. You issue orders to those creatures, outfit them with spells and equipment, and direct their tactics to break the morale of your enemies and drive them from the field.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins includes twelve miniatures, such as a horned devil, a troll, a bugbear, hobgoblins, and goblins. While each Dungeon Command faction is meant to be played by a single player, quick-start rules allow two players to engage in a shortened version of the game using only one box.

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Risk: Game of Thrones, based on the epic HBO series, features two ways to play, including factions of noble Houses vying for control of Westeros during the time of The War of the Five Kings, as well as Daenerys Targaryen's rise to power in Essos.&#10;&#10;War and chaos have descended upon the realms of Men. In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&#10;&#10;1. SKIRMISH&#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&#10;&#10;2. DOMINION&#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&#10;&#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&#10;&#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Union Stockyards is a mid-weight economic euro game with unique features:&#10;&#10;     A supply/demand driven market that is central to game play, not a sidebar. &#10;     Low randomness -- market changes due to player decisions.&#10;     A worker-placement game where your workers may go on strike.&#10;     Extensively-researched historical theme about one of the great industrial wonders of U.S. Gilded Age.&#10;&#10;&#10;Opening in 1865, the Union Stockyards became Chicago&rsquo;s largest industry and one of the city&rsquo;s top tourist attractions with a half million visitors annually in the early 1900&rsquo;s. From the Civil War through the 1920&rsquo;s, more meat was processed here than anywhere in the world. During its height, 40,000 mostly immigrant workers labored in &ldquo;the busiest square mile on earth&rdquo;, where over one million livestock passed monthly, supplying 80% of all U.S. meat. There were over 2,300 livestock pens and 130 miles of railroad within the &ldquo;yards&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;You play one the &ldquo;Big Five&rdquo; meat packers, developing technologies to use every part of the animal while battling labor unions and manipulating the market to your advantage. Union Stockyards is played over six years (rounds), each beginning with an historical event affecting game conditions or adding an additional action. You select your actions through worker placement; however, if you don&rsquo;t pay your workers enough, they may go on &ldquo;strike&rdquo;. You earn cash based on your profit margins when you slaughter cattle, hogs, or sheep. Your profit margin is your meat value minus the livestock cost. The livestock cost is the same for all players, but your meat values will differ due to your engine-building decisions of constructing buildings, establishing branch houses in eastern cities, and improving your brand reputation. At the end of each year, livestock costs (cattle, hogs, sheep) will be adjusted up or down depending on the demand that you created. Sometimes you may choose to slaughter certain livestock just to manipulate the market in your favor. Whichever packer accumulates the most wealth wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures.  The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.&#10;&#10;About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are &quot;adventure&quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a &quot;camp&quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.&#10;&#10;Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.&#10;&#10;Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.&#10;&#10;",
