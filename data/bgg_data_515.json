Points are awarded for your stones on the field at the end of the game along with the stones you have captured.&#10;&#10;Complete rules can be found at the Icehouse Games Wiki.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;&#10;    Icehouse Pieces&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A science fiction miniatures wargame with very streamlined rules to enable large scale battles to be played in reasonable periods of time.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for a whole range of unit types from basic flak-jacket and assault rifle infantry, up through power-armoured infantry, tracked/wheeled/hover AFVs, WIGE (ground effect) units, enormous OGRE-style nuclear powered cybertanks and all kinds of mech (akin to Battletech, Robotech etc.) units - two, three four and six-legged are all accounted for.&#10;&#10;The rules are for 1/300th scale units, enabling players to easily assemble an army from a variety of sources and manufacturers including Battletech figures, Epic WH40K figures, Ground Zero and a plethora of small white-metal figure manufacturers.&#10;&#10;Included are outlines of the eight major power-blocs in the future world of OHMU, each with their own particular &quot;flavour&quot;  - from the ultra high-tech Pacific Rim Coalition to the more direct approach of the Russian Commonwealth; however all the army lists are very well balanced having been extensively playtested.&#10;&#10;Although nominally a 2-player wargame the mechanics do easily permit more players to participate either as sub-commanders on two opposing sides, or even as a three-way (or more if you're ambitious) battle.&#10;&#10;A very effective command &amp; control framework is a key element of the game mechanics.  Another innovative concept, far ahead of its time, is the inclusion of scenarios that players bid on, attempting to undercut each other's force values.  The scenarios (if one opts to use them) themselves provide variety to the battles thus avoiding the typical &quot;line up two equal armies and attack&quot; situation.&#10;&#10;96 page softcover A4 rulebook.  Black &amp; white illustrations throughout, with 8 colour plates.&#10;&#10;(And in case you were wondering, OHMU stands for Oversized Heavy Mechanized Unit...!)&#10;&#10;",

It can be described as a mixture between Salta from 1899, since the pieces of each player have to cross the board to the other side, and Chess, for the pieces have different value and represent General, Horse, Soldier etc.&#10;&#10;Unlike Chess, captured pieces are of a certain value (between 1 and 40!), and pieces all move in the same way (one step along the lines) crossing a grid of diagonally linked points in alternating dark and light rows. To start, pieces can jump from the &quot;encampment&quot; onto each of the points in the first row. Only pieces on dark points can be captured - obviously only by pieces on light points. After crossing the &quot;battlefield&quot;, they &quot;jump off&quot; into the opponent`s encampment, where they are safe.&#10;The game ends, if one player cannot do a legal move anymore. The player with less lost points wins the game. But aware: Not only captured pieces score negative, also the pieces still in your own half (now the opponents`) are considered &quot;captured&quot;.&#10;&#10;There were different editions of the game, a more expensive one with 3-dimensional figures and a cheaper one with flat stones instead.&#10;&#10;In 1902 there was a second edition with simpler rules.&#10;&#10;",

At the corners it had side routes which you could choose to go on instead of the main route. These would have slightly longer detours around the corners. You would roll one die and advance that many spaces. On each space were opportunities to earn money, spend money, find ancestors and locate ancestors. If you found an ancestor, you obtained a blue (boys) or pink (girls) card representing that ancestor which you then put on your own board (which you had in front of you) which represented you and all your ancestors. The idea was to collect all these ancestors (such as brother, mother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, etc.) and put their cards in their respective portions of this board. Once you had them all, the next goal was to seal/unite them all together. You did this mainly on those side routes, which was where you could get sealing cards. You would put these cards (one per link between each ancestor) to connect the ancestors together. The first person to connect all their family/ancestors together won the game.&#10;&#10;",

The pieces are set up identically to normal chess.  A ninth diameter (file) is added, but with unplayable spaces in the first two circles (ranks).  This prevents the pieces in the first rank from directly attacking each other.  The rules also include castling and capturing en passant.&#10;&#10;This game is distinctly different from Byzantine Chess and Circular Chess (the latter developed by David Reynolds), using a different board layout, set-up, and rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This chess variant was developed by David Reynolds after reading a reference to chess being played on a circular board in medieval times.  Imagining how it might have played, he developed such a version.&#10;&#10;His board consists of four rings (files) and sixteen radii (ranks) with a large, unplayable center circle.  Mr. Reynolds would often adorn the center with the crest of the city of Lincoln, U.K., thus the design is often referred to as a &quot;Lincoln board&quot;.&#10;&#10;A standard set of chess pieces is used.  However, each player gets two ranks of pieces surrounded by two ranks of pawns.  The king and queen are placed on the innermost file (ring).  Movement mimics standard chess, allowing the rooks and queen to move fully around a ring.  Castling and en passant capturing are not allowed.&#10;&#10;This variant is distinctly different from the Circular Chess variant designed by Alan and Martin Mattlage, in board layout, starting set-up, and rules.&#10;&#10;This variant does use the same board as Byzantine Chess, but there are rule differences.&#10;&#10;",

Any player can object to another players sentence, on either grammatical grounds, or the fact that the sentence just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The defending player and the objecting player get to argue their points to the rest of the players, who form a jury. The jury gets to vote on whether or not the sentence is acceptable.

There are many pitfalls along the way! Opponents can freeze you in place with a FILLIBUSTER! card, or steal your Votes  with a REDISTRICTING card! But you can fend off their attacks with SPIN CONTROL! cards! Ten different Politics cards; thousands of scenarios!&#10;&#10;ELECTION! The Election Game combines skill, luck and strategy in a simplified and non-partisan game that makes light of the hijinx that characterize American politics and the election process.

    "Description": "Dodgem is a simple abstract strategy game invented by Colin Vout and described in the book Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays. It is played on an n&times;n board with n-1 cars for each player&mdash;two cars each on a 3&times;3 board is enough for an interesting game, but larger sizes are also possible.&#10;&#10;The board is initially set up with n-1 blue cars along the left edge and n-1 red cars along the bottom edge, the bottom left square remaining empty. Turns alternate: player 1 (&quot;Left&quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the blue cars one space forwards (right) or sideways (up or down). Player 2 (&quot;Right&quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the red cars one space forwards (up) or sideways (left or right).&#10;&#10;Cars may not move onto occupied spaces. They may leave the board, but only by a forward move. A car which leaves the board is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who first has no legal move on their turn because all their cars are either off the board or blocked in by their opponent.&#10;&#10;[From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgem]&#10;&#10;",

In addition, the locations are grouped so that like locations are in the same color-group.

Chance and Community Chest are replaced with Spells and Potions, and Houses and Hotels are recolored teal and purple, and are called Cottages and Castles.  Also includes special bank notes which feature the heroes on the face.

Play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;After all players have drawn and played cards, a &quot;battle&quot; round begins where all fighters enter into a battle for supremacy.  The total number of fighters for each player is determined by the lowest number that player controls.  After fighters have been selected the first player may choose to activate an ability or play an ambush card from his or her hand affecting the battle.  This continues until all players have decided to pass.  All players total their attack value for all fighters involved in battle the highest total earns that player a victory point (6 are needed to win).  Then all players roll a die to determine casualties.  If a die roll matches an opponent's fighter, that fighter is discarded from play and the die roller earns a victory point.&#10;&#10;After battle, a draw phase starts again.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to collect all six wins the round, and is awarded bonus points.&#10;&#10;In the deck, there are cards that represent red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Players can only have one of each color in their collection. In addition, there are action cards that allow you to steal colors from other players. Some of these take cards allow you to continue your turn, taking as many color cards as you can, but with a downside- the more cards you play in a turn, the fewer cards you have left in your hand, limiting your options in future turns. Since bonus points are awarded to the winner for the number of cards in their hand, using play again cards also reduces your potential bonus score.&#10;&#10;There are a limited number of blocking cards that you can use to prevent an opponent from stealing one of your colors.&#10;&#10;There are a number of other cards, such as a the Prism Wild Card, zap cards to permanently destroy an opponent's color card, and cards that allow you to replenish your hand with additional draws from the deck on your turn.&#10;&#10;Prism is ideal for Ages 8 and up. The game is normally played in multiple rounds until one player scores a certain number of points, but each round is enjoyable as a game by itself.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1936, as the Spanish Civil War heated up, representatives of Spanish Republicans began hiring American pilots to fight in the war.  The Yankee Squadron, led by Bert Acosta, fought Franco&rsquo;s White planes. Each pilot was paid $1,500 a month and a bonus of $1,000 for each enemy plane shot down.&#10;&#10;In MAS-WWII:MTO, we take that idea and run with it.  You can form a squadron at anytime from just before the start of World War II to the end of 1943 and see if you can prosper from the chaos.&#10;&#10;We begin by focusing on the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.  With access to Commonwealth, French, German, and Italian aircraft, players can get their MAS up and running by fighting in one of the most turbulent theaters of action.&#10;&#10;&#10;MAS-WWII:MTO is the first product in a series that takes the fun and excitement of Mercenary Air Squadron and transplants into the era of World War II.  Ownership of Mercenary Air Squadron is required to fully utilize MAS-WWII:MTO&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Mercenary Air Squadron&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player is given several playing pieces representing Apostles, early leaders in the Christian church. He moves these around the board winning converts and establishing churches as quickly as possible. Unlike most games, players do not compete against each other. They cooperate as the early Apostles did to spread Christianity throughout the world. Competition is provided by the game itself, through two sets of cards, many of which inflict persecution or misfortune upon the various churches and Apostles. An intelligent group of players, cooperating with each other, can overcome this opposition and successfully spread Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, thus winning the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gospel Explosion: the Acts of the Apostles has been awarded U.S. Patent Number 4441718.&#10;&#10;",

The sizes are such that the rings will nest.&#10;&#10;The object is to complete &quot;a line of four&quot; 4 rings of same color to win the game. Three kinds of alignments on a &quot;line of four&quot; are possible: same size of rings across 4 spaces, 4 different progressive sizes across 4 spaces, or 4 concentric rings on the same square.&#10;&#10;Interestingly enough with this set you can also play Four Score. To play Four Score, you must play from smallest to largest ring in a particular playing space (or visa versa). The object again is to make a &quot;line&quot; of four.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you play a card from your hand, score points based on its location relative to other cards, add that play's score to your cumulative score, and then draw a card.  One by one, the table is filled with a contorted maze of pipes.  The game ends when all players pass or when somebody reaches a set amount of points. and the player with the highest running score wins.  But if you earn three Golden Wrenches first, you win automatically!&#10;&#10;Complete rules and revision history is available at:&#10;http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/hydropolis.htm&#10;&#10;",
