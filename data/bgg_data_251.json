In each round the players attempt to cover one of the ten rows on their scoreboard with tiles, trying to score the maximum number of points as they do so. The board is established by laying the tiles face down on the table in a rectangular grid.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they turn over any three tiles. The player then picks one of the 10 rows (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) on their scoreboard and places one, two, or three of the tiles on their scoreboard, provided they fit. Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).&#10;&#10;Game ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The emotions that the game releases must go hand in hand with the best of your analytical thinking skills.&#10;&#10;In Astro Jam players operate on a modular game board by playing action cards from their hands and arranging them in sequences. Using the cards, the players move their or the opponents&rsquo; astronaut tokens, use the assistance of common robots, transport crates in narrow space of the orbital station, and send themselves or other astronauts on spacesuit duty. The central computer orders tasks for the players to deliver the objects located at the station into one of three active sites crucial for the operation of the facility. In this way, the players earn points that may ensure the victory. The first player who scores 5 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1944: SECOND FRONT begins with the Allies well established in France following the D-Day invasions. The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements). Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;        One 32 page rule book&#10;        One full color map&#10;        400 die cut counters&#10;        Five chart sheets&#10;        One 10-sided die&#10;        One plastic tray&#10;        Players: two or more&#10;        Playing Time: 3 to 15 hours&#10;        Complexity: medium to high&#10;        Solitaire Suitability: medium&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the same time all players (except the reader) have to guess what percentage of people who were polled on the question card said &quot;Yes&quot; and place one of their tokens on the percentage circles in the middle of the board that they feel is correct. Starting with the player whose turn it is, reveal your answer and score the points, one for each correct guess for each player and two for each correct guess in the percentage area.&#10;&#10;During the game, players have one opportunity to &quot;Double Down&quot;, (i.e. place 2 tokens on one of the percentage circles in the middle of the board).

Collect 9 mares/foals and be the first to Green River Valley.&#10;&#10;Game2: You're a rancher out to round up horses that have broken free. Make it to Green River valley with a one of each type of horse (eight types)&#10;&#10;Game 3: Same as game 2, but the goal is to arrive at Green River Valley with three pairs of horses that each have attributes in common (same color, etc.)&#10;&#10;All three are simple games and follow the basic: &quot;Roll dice, move piece, read card&quot; type, with a little variation. The map has some interesting choices - different routes converge at some areas forcing players to choose which way to go, since landing on another player's token allows you to &quot;steal&quot; a horse.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the best part of the game is the artwork and background. The horse cards are beautifully drawn and the descriptions on the back of each include detail on the color, markings, and some interesting horse facts. Best for the kids of horse enthusiasts, or kids who are horse enthusiasts.&#10;&#10;",

You must clear your hand of 10 cards, by placing successive cards face down on the deck, bluffing as necessary. So the deck is started by a player laying 1s, the next player lays 2s, one by one and so on. At some point, your bluff is called. If you were false, draw more cards. If you were true, your opponent draws. There are action cards, including a sack of lies which has no value and so you must lie when playing it.&#10;&#10;Playing Scheinheilig your goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand.&#10;In total, there are 70 cards numbered evenly from 1 to 10, 26 Angels (Jokers), 8 Devils (don&acute;t want those) and 8 &quot;skip a turn&quot;-cards. Every player starts the game with 10 cards and play proceeds clockwise.&#10;The youngest player starts and has to discard cards with the number &quot;1&quot; face down. At least he has to pretend to discarded 1&acute;s. A player can put down any number of cards. The next player can then either accept whatever was just discarded and discard 2&acute;s on his own or he can question one of the cards just discarded and turn it face up. If he was right and card does not show the correct number, the player who tried to discard a wrong card has to take back the questioned card and all cards on top of it. On top of that he has to roll the die and draw that many cards from the deck. If the questioned card had the correct number, the questioning player has to roll the die and draw that many cards. Angels are always considered the correct number, Devils never. Whenever it is your turn, you can also just draw a card and end your turn. Whoever gets rid of all cards first, wins.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, you receive a hand of nine cards. Look at those cards, then arrange them in a face-down row on the table in the order of your choice, then reveal as many cards as you wish. These cards are now out of play, but you can (ideally) use them to convey information about what remains hidden in your row.&#10;&#10;As a group, you are trying to form alien teams that consist of five cards of all five numbers or five cards of only one number. On a turn, all players but one collectively decide &mdash; without saying anything, but using any gestures they wish &mdash; which face-down card to reveal in the row of the player who is not taking part in the debate. Once this card is revealed, place it in the center of the table. Then the next player in clockwise order sits out while all other players decide which one of their cards to reveal and add to the team currently being formed.&#10;&#10;If a card is added to a team that would break that team &mdash; e.g., adding a 3 when the face-up cards are 1 and 1, or adding a 2 when the face-up cards are 1, 2 and 4 &mdash; then you remove all face-up cards from play. X cards don't have a locked-in value, so you can consider them whatever value is needed to maintain the validity of a team. If you create a valid team of five cards, great! Put it aside, then start a new team. If you manage to create as many teams as the number of players at the table, you win; if you run out of cards and can't create enough teams, you lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rondo is a German card game where players must construct words from drawn cards.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Earning the most points by constructing words from letter cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The 110 cards are shuffled. Most of them show a single letter and a point value, which is the higher the more rarely that letter is used in the German language. There are also joker cards (can be used as any letter), and delete cards (can cover up letters at the start or end of a word).&#10;Each player gets 7 cards.&#10;The expandable card holder, in which the letter cards are placed to form words, is set to three slots (maximum length is 9).&#10;To determine a start player, each player tries to form a three-letter word from his/her cards. The player whose word has the highest point value puts a three-letter word into the card holder, his/her points are written down and he/she refills his/her hand to 7. Players then take turns building words from their letter cards. Turn length is determined by a sand timer.&#10;&#10;Rules for building words:&#10;&#10;     A new word is constructed by putting cards over the previous word, or by adding an additional letter.&#10;     The new word must be at least three letters long.&#10;     The new word can be up to one letter longer than the previous word.&#10;     At least one letter from the previous word must be re-used.&#10;     Creating a new word by adding only a delete or joker card is a valid move.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player can exchange cards from his/her hand for cards from the draw deck at a cost of -2 points per card.&#10;If a player manages to create a new word before the timer runs out, he/she gets the corresponding points. Bonus points are given for using three or more new cards.&#10;A player who couldn't create a new word gets an additional card. At the end of his/her turn, a player always refills his/her hand to 7.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted and &#10;&#10;     a player has no cards left, or&#10;     all players have passed once.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players add up their points from all rounds. Remaining hand cards count negative points, according to their point value.&#10;The player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Moscow is one of the four original Crime Scene Games. It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:&#10;1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.&#10;Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.&#10;The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;&#10;The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.&#10;&#10;Challenge Level 4/5&#10;&#10;",

And as if it was not enough, the neighboring Fiefs have been granted to your worst adversaries, who will not hesitate to try to kill you! Maybe it is not a reward, but a punishment?&#10;&#10;Medievalia is a strategic game where each player represents a Feudal Lord trying to prevail over his neighbors. &#10;During the first phases of the game the players develop their Fief by increasing the number of cultivated fields and the population. Subsequently, they will begin constructing buildings, specializing the population in several professions and abilities, and then they will start creating their army. All these operations are performed in the same way: the player puts in the cards from his own hand. Every card that comes in play costs a certain amount of resources and it can produce a certain amount of resources. Producing more resources during the game allows playing more and more powerful cards and provides more maneuverability.&#10;&#10;Home Page: https://www.giochix.it/scheda.php?item=1417&amp;crowd=0&amp;lingua=0&#10;&#10;",

Then you draw exactly three butt groups from the butt bag. Once you have drawn all the butts from the butt bag, you choose which one butt group you want to score. Not only you yourself though but everybody will get butt points for each of their butts in the butt group that you are scoring. The next player will then add a random special butt to the butt bag before they, too, draw all the butts. These change the game up a little but, more importantly, each player butt is also worth an additional butt point for each special butt that is in play.&#10;&#10;Once you reach at least 28 butt points, the game ends with the next reset. A reset happens either because a player decides against adding another special butt to the bag or because there happens to be one or more special butts in each of the three butt groups that a player draws. Just because you are the first player who reaches 28 butt points does not necessarily mean that you will actually win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the center of the action lies an open Quidditch Chest, with a Quaffle, two Bludgers, and the all-important Golden Snitch. When you lay down certain cards, these magical items come out to play! A pair of Chaser cards lets you steal another player&rsquo;s set, but if you&rsquo;ve earned the Quaffle, you&rsquo;re safe.

The action moves faster than a Nimbus 2000 as cards change hands, sets hit the table, and Bludgers hit their mark. When the Golden Snitch launches from the chest and into the air, grab it &ndash; it&rsquo;s worth extra points! The game ends when the Golden Snitch is in hand; the player with the most points wins.

At the start of a player's turn, he or she draws cards to form a four-card hand and uses numbered cards to move their playing pieces.&#10;&#10;A player can also declare to play Chicken cards, which can cause other players' chickens on the road to move back to the starting point if their color matches the card.  The other players can respond by playing Goose and Safe cards, Chicken Out backwards to the road shoulder, or stay their pieces on the road and chance the result of the Chicken card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has both his or her chickens reach the finishing point, making him or her the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:&#10;1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.&#10;Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.&#10;The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;&#10;The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.&#10;&#10;Challenge Level 3/5&#10;&#10;",

Players have to make a stack 15 chips, while not spending more than a set amount of Clout on the stack. Players take turns throwing the chips into the play area, and depending on how they hit the table, the individual effects of each chip occur. Chips have stats, abilities, and powers that affect game play. Some of the powers and abilities include protection, poison, weaken, and the strengthening of other chips within a radius of where the chip lands. After the chips land on the table, players can decide to attack other player's chips. Further chip effects can come into play in these situations. For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips. Whoever has the most Clout points wins.&#10;&#10;Some chips are common, while others are unique, adding to the collectability factor. In addition, there are various &quot;types&quot; of chips including effects, characters, and bases, to name just a few. Where chips land on the table and how players throw will have a significant effect on how the game will play out. The chips are approximately the same weight and style as casino poker chips, not cardboard. Physical skill will be a factor in game play, so gamers can start practicing their chip tossing now with the poker chips they already own.&#10;&#10;This is the first set in the Clout series of games.&#10;&#10;",

Then turn those systems against your opponent!&#10;&#10;Space Base Mutiny is a fast-paced game with a sci-fi theme. The goal is simple; a player wins when he or she has used up all of her tokens. On your turn, you can use a unit to invade an enemy space OR remove a unit from a system you control to use that system's power. You then check to see which systems (if any) you gained control of.&#10;&#10;The game features Area Collection Powers. When you occupy 3 spaces of the same color, you gain control of that color system. Each system gives you a special power that you can use on future turns. You can use the Weapons System to attack 2 adjacent units, the Air Lock System to jettison 2 enemy units into the vacum of space, the Gravity System to tumble units around the base, and the Command System to negotiate disarmament.&#10;&#10;In addition to these system powers, each token has one of 6 unique race powers. Each time you place a token to invade a space, you trigger that tokens's race power. Cyborgs hack into the systems, Parasites infect enemy tokens, Telepaths use mind control to attack adjacent tokens, Space Worms breach the hull to attack outer tokens, Humans negotiate disarmament, and Blobs copy the race powers of the tokens they attack.&#10;&#10;",

Gamble with Round-o-Loot of course!&#10;&#10;Round-o-Loot is a fast, risk based card game, where cards are played fast and plays disrupted by selective hand management. Players try to play the most points they can while gathering cards to get combos to disrupt other player&rsquo;s play. The deck consists of 61 cards: 5 different cards and the captain card. Most of the cards are point cards, and then there is the rum card. Cards are played one type at a time, and when possible, 3 or more cards can be played in conjunction with rum card to create combos to disrupt other player&rsquo;s game. After dealing their hand cards, players play one type at a time. With careful card drawing and hand management, players can also collect 3 or more of the same card type, and when played with the rum card, players get a combo. These combos affect other players and gives the player an edge.&#10;&#10;The goal is to get the most points possible until someone draws the captain card. After someone draws the captain, the round ends immediately and points are calculated. The player with the most points win the round and gets a token card. Then cards are shuffled again and a new hand is dealt. When any player gets their 3rd token card, they win the game.&#10;&#10;",

A Rebus is a word or sentence where a symbol replaces part of the word or sentence. For example: if you laid a tile with a picture of a letter &quot;S&quot; followed by a tile with a picture of an &quot;oar&quot; (from a rowboat) the the Rebus would read: &quot;sore&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rule book comes with a description of each tile (in case you didn't know just what the picture is) as well as an example of use for each tile. These descriptions come in very handy when playing the game both for stopping player arguments as well as helping out stumped players.&#10;&#10;Players score three points for each tile used. Premium squares give players bonuses. Using all eight tiles held scores a fifty point bonus.  Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.&#10;   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.&#10;&#10;",

The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (which was based on a Gibson story), and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;&#10;&#10;Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.&#10;&#10;2013 Edition released in December, 2003 as a limited edition; 2020 Edition released February, 2004&#10;&#10;",

If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;",

The drawer can't make any noise, and part of the string has to remain touching the table while they animate their drawing. Otherwise, the drawer can get crazy with it.&#10;&#10;The other players call out their ideas, and when a player guesses the word correctly, they receive the card, then the drawer quickly moves on to their next drawing. When time is up, the drawer scores 1 point for each word that was guessed correctly, and each player scores 1 point for each correct guess they made.&#10; The game contains three types of challenge words that are harder to draw, but worth 2 points if guessed:&#10;&#10;&#10;    2-Player: Make the drawing in the air with another player.&#10;    Don't Look: Draw with your eyes closed.&#10;    Forbidden Word: Guessing a certain word costs a card.&#10;&#10;&#10;After everyone has had two turns as the drawer (or one turn in a game with seven or more players), the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the treasure tiles, then place them in a face-up stack on the table.&#10;&#10;To start a turn, the player rolls both dice, then moves either Pirate Joe or the monkey one or two spaces clockwise (to a new island) depending on whether the pirate die shows 1-2 sabres or 1-2 bananas. She then moves Coco Capitano a number of spaces equal to the number of pips. If the captain shares a space with one of the other figures, she ends her turn empty-handed; if the captain is alone, she collects the top treasure from the stack and places it in front of her.&#10;&#10;She then has the option of stopping and keeping the treasure, or of rolling the dice again. If the captain lands on an occupied space, she loses all the treasure gained this turn, placing it on the bottom of the treasure stack. She keeps taking turns until she stops or runs out of luck.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure tiles have been claimed, the game ends and players tally their scores, earning 1 point for a treasure chest, 2 for barrels, and 3 for bags. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Variants: For younger players, ignore the points and instead see who collected the most tokens. For older players, use only six islands instead of seven.&#10;&#10;",

The players keep scooping and replacing tiles until one player calls out &quot;Yummy!&quot; when they believe they have spelled the word.

Another difference from traditional Werewolf games is that it requires no moderator and if your character dies, you can still participate in the discussion &mdash; and possibly even win!&#10;&#10;In the game, players are divided into two camps: Manlike and Werewolf. During the game, players accuse one another through confidential markers, which send others to death through family trial. When the number of surviving players drops to a predetermined threshold, which is based on the number of players, the camp with more survivors wins.&#10;&#10;",
