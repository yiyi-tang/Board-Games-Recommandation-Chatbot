    "Description": "In the Irish myth cycles, the land of T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g is the realm of the Otherworld, the place where the Fairies lived and heroes visited on quests. It was a place just outside the realm of man, off to the west, where there was no illness or death or time, but only happiness and beauty.&#10;&#10;The golden path to T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g is open once more, and the greatest Celtic storytellers have gathered for a once-in-a-lifetime journey. When they return, they'll bring with them tales of the creatures they met and the adventures they lived. Over time those stories will become a saga &mdash; and the most epic saga will live on forever.&#10;&#10;Journey to the Otherworld in T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g by placing storytellers between story cards in the shared grid. When all storytellers have been placed, in reverse player order draft cards and add them to your hand. From your hand, you'll then add cards to your personal tableau: one card to hand, one card played. At the end of five rounds, score each row according to the rules on its corresponding goal card, and earn points for having the most connected story cards of each color. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Volume XI of the Series: Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (Avalon Hill/MMP) (GCACW) series, Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North covers some of the most famous campaigns of the Civil War in a single module that represents the largest collection of content ever produced for the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series.  Based on previously published materials, each of the three campaigns included in Roads to Gettysburg II has been revised, repackaged, and rebalanced for improved play:&#10;&#10;    Here Come the Rebels Here Come the Rebels (which covers the 1862 Antietam Campaign) has had each Basic Game scenario rebalanced, one new scenario added, and a full reworking of the victory conditions for the two Advanced Game scenarios.&#10;    Roads to Gettysburg Roads to Gettysburg (which covers the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign) includes five new scenarios, four rebalanced existing scenarios, and a significantly revised Advanced Game that covers the full scope of Lee&rsquo;s invasion of Pennsylvania.&#10;    Rebels in the White House Rebels in the White House (which covers Early&rsquo;s 1864 Raid on Washington) is a quick-playing module that was originally included in the Skirmisher II magazine and has now been fully brought up to current publication standards.&#10;&#10;&#10;The four maps included are painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler and have been significantly revised to include all the latest GCACW terrain types including hills, swamps, dams, trails and landings.

The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other. This package contains a massive collection of eighteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, divided as shown between the three modules:&#10;&#10;Here Come the Rebels II includes one new Basic Game scenario, the five original Basic Scenarios redesigned and rebalanced, and the two original Advanced Game campaign scenarios extensively revised:&#10;&#10;    South Mountain (1 turn, September 14, 1862)&#10;    Harpers Ferry-Crampton&rsquo;s Gap (4 turns, September 12 &ndash; September 15, 1862)&#10;    McClellan&rsquo;s Opportunity (3 turns, September 15 &ndash; September 17, 1862)&#10;    Three Cigars (6 turns, September 13 &ndash; September 18, 1862; new scenario)&#10;    The Baltimore Raid (7 turns, September 10 &ndash; September 16, 1862)&#10;    The Battle for Washington (3 turns, September 12 &ndash; September 14, 1862)&#10;    From Frederick to Sharpsburg (9 turns, September 10 &ndash; September 18, 1862; Advanced Game scenario)&#10;    The Maryland Campaign (18 turns, September 4 &ndash; September 21, 1862; Advanced Game scenario)&#10;&#10;&#10;Roads to Gettysburg II includes five new Basic Game scenarios, the four original Basic Scenarios redesigned and rebalanced, and the original Advanced Game campaign extensively revamped for better playability and play balance:&#10;&#10;    Meade Moves North (5 turns, June 29 &ndash; July 3, 1863; revised)&#10;    Stuart Rides North (4 turns, June 29 &ndash; July 2, 1863; new cavalry scenario)&#10;    Confederate High Tide (3 turns, June 29 &ndash; July 1, 1863; solitaire scenario)&#10;    First Day at Gettysburg (1 turn, July 1, 1863; revised)&#10;    Battle of Gettysburg (3 turns, July 1-3, 1863; new battle scenario)&#10;    The Pipe Creek Plan (6 turns, July 1-6, 1863; new maneuver &amp; battle scenario)&#10;    The Battle Continues (2 turns, July 4-5, 1863; new, from Skirmisher I)&#10;    The Wagoneer&rsquo;s Fight (3 turns, July 4-6, 1863; new cavalry scenario)&#10;    The Battle that Never Happened (8 turns, July 5-12, 1863; revised)&#10;    The Gettysburg Campaign (18 turns, June 22-July 9, 1863; Advanced Game scenario, revised)&#10;&#10;&#10;Rebels in the White House includes three Basic Game scenarios and two Advanced Game scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Monocacy (1 turn, July 9, 1864)&#10;    Fort Stevens (2 turns, July 11 &ndash; July 12, 1864)&#10;    The Retreat from Washington (6 turns, July 13 &ndash; July 18, 1864)&#10;    From Winchester to Washington (13 turns, July 3 &ndash; July 15, 1864; Advanced Game scenario)&#10;    Early&rsquo;s Raid (20 turns, July 1 &ndash; July 20, 1864; Advanced Game scenario)&#10;&#10;&#10;[The third and fifth scenarios require use of the Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s Way II north map (Volume IX in the GCACW series) which is not included.]&#10;&#10;Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North contains:&#10;&#10;    GCACW Series Rules Booklet (24 pgs in color) &#10;    RTGII Specific Rules Booklet 120 pgs in color including scenarios, the game as history, map gazetteer, etc) &#10;    Four 22&quot;x 32&quot; full-color map sheets&#10;    Four 280-piece counter sheets&#10;    One Terrain Effects Chart&#10;    Two full-color Force Displays &#10;    Two 4-page color Charts and Tables &#10;    Two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North credits:&#10;&#10;    Design &amp; Development: Ed Beach, Mike Belles, and Chris Withers&#10;    Original series design by Joe Balkoski &#10;    Map Artwork by Charlie Kibler&#10;    Counter Graphics by Charlie Kibler and Nicolas Eskubi&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Rockwell company wants to develop drilling activities, but does not have the necessary teams in-house. Rockwell has decided to buy into specialized companies. In order to determine which one it will put on the most advanced and most profitable projects in the future, Rockwell has elected to make them work together on a single important project: drilling through the depths of the earth&rsquo;s crust to the core. The company who demonstrates the greatest expertise in the technical and financial management of this contract will ensure a bright future with Rockwell.&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game...&#10;&#10;Acquire the most Renown points at the end of the game. There are three ways to achieve this:&#10;&#10;&#10;     accomplish achievements (nine in total),&#10;     make investments,&#10;     get majorities after the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay...&#10;Acquire more prestige than your opponents by the end of the game. The prestige is acquired through Production and Delivery tiles, as well as in the final scoring, which will award prestige points for different majorities.&#10;The game is divided into three phases that are repeated as many times as necessary until one of two conditions endgame is met:&#10;a majority of the players have reached the center of the earth with a drill crew&#10;a player has completed the nine Achievements.&#10;Then the current round is completed before determining the winner.&#10;Each player has two vice presidents he will deploy to act in Phase 1, 2, or 3, in order to perform actions. The order in which the players&rsquo; vice presidents are deployed is determined by a closed-fist auction.&#10;This is the main phase. Players will move their drill crews are at a rate of one per round (there are four rounds before Phase 2). Depending on the position of your vice president, if you deployed him to act in this phase, you can corrupt opposing drill crews (in order to attract them to the same tile as your active drill crew) or hire a subcontractor (to increase your drilling power).&#10;Each tile of the earth's crust has a value indicating its resistance to drilling. If the sum of the drill crews who are present equals or exceeds this value, the tile is excavated and turned over; then draw an Extraction card to see what resources you discovered, which is evenly split between the players who participated in the drilling. The indivisible remainder goes to one of those players (prioritized by whoever has a mine on the tile, then the player who has the greater drilling power, then the one who ttriggered the drilling).&#10;Finally, after the four rounds, the mines laid on drilled tiles provide the resources printed on the back of the tile.&#10;Players with a vice president here can perform market transactions, which is to say that they can buy or sell resources.&#10;In this phase, players can make investments to get renown points and improve their drilling conditions in different ways&hellip;&#10;augment the drill crews&rsquo; power (maximum = 4),&#10;place mines in the game &#226;&#128;&#168;(maximum three mines),&#10;improve mine safety (in order to avoid wasting resources at extraction time),&#10;improve the movement of drill crews.&#10;&#10;",

One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get their team to say the word or phrase on the screen. If they are successful, they hand the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!&#10;&#10;The primary differences of this game from its progenitor is the implementation of the electronic device, timer, and substantial word lists. The electronic edition has also spawned several spin-offs and sequels. As of 2013, &quot;Electronic&quot; was dropped from the name, leaving it as simply Catch Phrase, effectively replacing the original.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Catch Phrase!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is for players to be the first to play all of their cards to the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player may play one, two, or three cards to a single, central meld. Playable meld-types are:&#10;&#10;-Single: Any one card. (1 &lt; 7 &lt; 14)&#10;-Set: Any two or more cards of equal rank. (1,1,1 &lt; 14,14,14)&#10;-Run: Any two or more cards of consecutive rank. (1,2,3 &gt; 11,12,13)&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player chooses to do one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;-Overwrite: Play a higher ranked meld, which matches the meld-type and size of the central meld.&#10;-Add: Attach a card or cards to the central meld, making sets/runs longer.&#10;-Pass: A player who can not or chooses not to play into the central meld may pass. Once a player passes, they are out for the trick.&#10;&#10;A trick ends once 1 of 4 things happens:&#10;&#10;-All but one player passes. &#10;-A player adds the fourth card to an active set of a like-numbered meld (or fifth in a 5+ player game).&#10;-A player adds the fifth card of a run.&#10;-A player plays a meld that follows the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; (See Below).&#10;&#10;The last player to have played a card to the meld in any of these situations above clears the trick and leads the next. A lead player must always play one, two, or three cards and may never &quot;Pass&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once one player has played their final card(s) to the table, the round ends immediately. The other players then score the points indicated on the cards left in their hands. Rounds are played until one player has 20 or more points, leaving the player(s) with the least points the winner(s).&#10;&#10;Rule of 8&rsquo;s:&#10;All cards of rank 8 in the deck are worth the most points in the game. However, these cards have a special function. When a rank 8 card is played to a trick (ie. A single 8, a set of 8&rsquo;s, a run of either 7,8 or 7,8,9) the trick is immediately cleared and the player who played the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; clears the trick and leads the next. The only time the Rule of 8&rsquo;s will not function is when an 8 is included in the opening meld of any trick.&#10;&#10;",

Direct your tribe through the waters of the Pacific in search of a new home, safe from the impending eruption of the volcano. Explore new sea routes that lead to unvisited islands, collect resources on those islands to offer to other tribes in exchange for their knowledge, and continue sailing in search of a safe place &mdash; all this being done to save as many of your tribe members as possible and lead them to new lands where they can prosper. The most successful individual through this difficult mission will be appointed the supreme chief of the Polynesian tribal group.&#10;&#10;In Polynesia, players must save their tribe members from the dangers of the volcano by taking them to the islands that will give them the most points. At the same time, players must try to reach the objectives set by the tide cards, which will vary from one game to another. To succeed, players must collect resources in the form of fish and shells that will allow them to explore new sea routes, use the routes of other players, and sail from one island to another.&#10;&#10;Polynesia is played in rounds, and each round is divided into two phases. In the action phase, each player has three turns in which they can perform one of three actions: sail, explore, or populate and fish. In the maintenance phase, the volcano activity is checked for activity, and each player can collect resources depending on the islands where they have tribe members.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player, armed with a fistful of dice, starts his turn by rolling 5 dice and placing as many of them as possible on a card, though you must always place at least one if you can.  Each card has 6 rows, with from 1 to six dice pictured in each row.  These are in various combinations, and dice must be placed in order in each row.  As long as you place at least one die, and you have not used all of your 5 dice, you can then choose to roll again.  If you choose to stop, or you roll dice with no legal placement available, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;Scoring is achieved by placing the last die in a row and scoring can be a negative.  When the last row of a card is scored it is removed and a new card replaces it.  Play until a predetermined number of cards are scored.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1995.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as &quot;Royal Casino&quot; by Ravensburger&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The second stand-alone big box Keltis game, Keltis - Das Orakel plays on a single track spiraled gameboard, on which lay differently colored stones. This re-development has new rules that open entirely new options of strategy: big leaps with the aid of golden colored clover tiles, repositioning a pawn any distance backwards with the aid of spiral tiles, thus being able to gather more wishing stones, and also the new leaf clover tiles, and Oracle tiles, which allow for more point bonuses.&#10;&#10;A player now has the ability to move back and forth, when on specific fields. There are new bonuses, for instance when the three pawns of a player form a specific formation, or when a new figurine, the oracle lady, is moved. Because a player can choose to move any of his three pawns in a turn, the game offers more flexibility - but this also requires more planning.&#10;&#10;",

As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 57 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may play a skill card from your hand only when it matches the color of the challenge card, e.g., if you're facing a red challenge card, then you may play only a red skill card. Some cards have two colors, and some are white, that is, wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so.&#10;&#10;Other seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an exhaustion card before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.&#10;&#10;Defeating a challenge provides you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Callous himself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork and persistence as the wells of Atios are unpredictable and quite dangerous.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of twenty-seven alien species comes equipped with its own unique abilities that play with the game mechanisms in some way, offering you an edge in the fight, e.g., the Cheater, who can reserve an additional tactic that they can put toward any fight in the game &mdash; as long as their opponent doesn't call out how they're trying to &quot;cheat&quot;. How your game of Cosmic Encounter Duel plays out will inevitably be affected by which powers each dueling species has and how they play off of one another.&#10;&#10;In addition to your unique species and its ability, you have twenty spaceships to traverse the cosmos and maintain control over the five planets you need to become a Certified Civilization. As long as you have a ship on a planet, you have control of it, even if your opponent also has ships there and you must share control. You can deploy these ships to fight in duels, use them to act as reinforcements, or draw them back for a tactful retreat. Just don't lose them to the Warp or let them be claimed by the black void between the stars and end up lost in space forever!&#10;&#10;To play, players draw and resolve Destiny cards, which come in three types: Discovery cards, Event cards, and Refresh cards. Discovery cards have you and your opponent discover a planet and duel for control, while Event cards ask you both to test your mettle against a variety of challenges and cosmic calamities, and Refresh cards offer a respite in which you can recover ships, gather allies, and ultimately prepare for another clash.&#10;&#10;At the start of a duel, you and your opponent secretly decide how many ships to send to the planet, and once they have been deployed, you can call upon any befriended envoys. To plan your attack, you secretly choose a card from your hand and a standing tactic from your collection to either guard your ships or blast your opponent's ships, then you fight, sending ships to face-off for control of the planet until the winner claims their prize while the loser retreats. After you and your opponent resolve a Destiny card, you check the icon on the bottom of the card to determine which deck to draw from next, then the race continues.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Trouble is, you can't SPEND the stack on a ship until your next turn, by which time somebody else may have taken it away from you by the same process.&#10;&#10;Scoring in Die Safeknacker was very streamlined and elegant:  You scored the value of the card when you took it and paid off the other players the values of their chips in your stack.  In this new version there are complications (tokens to collect, a consolation prize for the player next to the top in the stack) which give you a little more to think about.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Safeknacker&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "STORY&#10;The future:&#10;Slowly but steadily, the Moon has been approaching the Earth. It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...&#10;&#10;In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.&#10;&#10;TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.&#10;&#10;FACTIONS&#10;THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.&#10;&#10;THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.&#10;&#10;THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.&#10;&#10;THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win.&#10;After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.&#10;&#10;According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.&#10;Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of the following phases:&#10;White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.&#10;Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.&#10;Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.&#10;Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.&#10;&#10;END&#10;The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds&#10;&#10;MICROBADGES&#10; Tsukuyumi fan - logo&#10; Tsukuyumi fan - moon&#10; Tsukuyumi - Boarlords fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Cybersamurai fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Dark Seed fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Nomads fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Oni fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Kampfgruppe 03 fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Lords of the Lost Sea fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Fireborn fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Children of the Lion fan&#10;&#10;",

Sounds simple, but it's not. With strict rules governing island size and bridge placement, Ponte del Diavolo becomes a tight game of positioning. Much like Randolph's Twixt, the need to think several moves ahead is critical to out-maneuvering your opponent.&#10;In honour of the late Alex Randolph (1922 - 2004), who passed away in Venice, there is a picture of him on the box of the game.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Board Game Arena real-time or turn based&#10;     Boardspace.net real time or turn based, AI option&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;     http://www.brettspielnetz.de (German: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12) direct link&#10;     Jijbent.nl (Dutch: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12)&#10;     YourTurnMyTurn.com (English: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

However, the player with the most hazard symbols is reprimanded for their chaotic conduct and is awarded no extra end-game prestige.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is immediately triggered when a player has 3 crew of the same faction or a crew of each faction on their ship.

Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.&#10;&#10;",

However, when collecting income you draw cards from 4 different mines (card stacks) with each having its own distribution! The number of gems you earn depends on the upgrade level of your dwarves. Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.&#10;&#10;On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to. There are shorter and longer paths to the Coronation Chamber, where the game ends. The game lasts between 10 to 12 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'War of the Ring'. On a large map of Middle Earth, armies are mustering and heroes are readying to fight the shadow spreading out of Mordor. The game is played on two levels. Both sides (or three if someone wants to play Saruman) have great armies that battle in a typical wargame style while another game is going on at the same time with individual characters around the fate of the One Ring. In the Campaign game Sauron's forces are the more powerful but the free peoples get the edge in the Character game.&#10;&#10;Highly sought after as a collectors item. It could be purchased with either a paper map or a full mounted map, and was also sold in a three-game set with the folio games Gondor: The Siege of Minas Tirith and Sauron.  That trilogy set is called The Games of Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a reversal of roles, all players in Munchkin Zombies start out as zombies, and the &quot;monsters&quot; are the normal people trying to stop the zombie invasion (such as the Action Hero, Soccer Mom, Fireman, etc.). Unlike most Munchkin games, there are no classes or races; instead, you can have a mojo: Atomic Zombie, Plague Zombie, and Voodoo Zombie. As with Munchkin Bites! and Super Munchkin, Munchkin Zombies includes powers &ndash; special abilities that you can play as you gain levels.&#10;&#10;Guest artist is Alex Fernandez, who drew the Meals on Wheels card.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zombicide: Gear Up is a co-operative flip-and-write game set in the world of Zombicide.&#10;&#10;To set up, each player takes a survivor card, which shows four weapons, along with damage, armor, and ammo tracks. Determine the level of play (easy to nightmare), then give each player the appropriate number of random regular and special zombie cards to place next to the &quot;third street level&quot; of their card. Shuffle the ten turn cards, then lay out nine in a row, placing seven spawn cards by the last seven of these cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, reveal the next turn card, which shows which color weapon each player activates. Each weapon has a &quot;hit shape&quot; (typically a polyomino), and you must fit the hit shape into the outline of a zombie to use it, with no overlaps to any damage you've dealt previously. Some zombies might then advance toward players, moving from their third street to their second one. If a zombie is on your &quot;first street&quot; and would advance, you take damage equal to the unmarked red stars on that card. If you mark off ammo or armor on a zombie, you circle those symbols on your survivor card; you can spend one ammo to mark off a single zombie space, and you can spend armor instead of taking damage.&#10;&#10;After the third turn, you reveal the first spawn card, which will put more zombies in play, with players collectively deciding how to add those cards to their third streets. Whenever you mark off the final space on a zombie card, remove it from play, then upgrade one of your weapons, perhaps gaining the ability to use it multiple times or gain armor when you cover red stars. After nine turns, reshuffle the ten turn cards, then lay out nine of them, along with the level 1 and 2 boss cards under the final seven turn cards. Place the boss in front of one player. During a turn, if the boss is in front of you or if you have an activated long-range weapon, you can attack the boss instead of zombies close to you. If you defeat the boss before the ninth turn ends in the second round, you win; if not &mdash; or if any player is killed by damage &mdash; then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;For the solitaire mode of Zombicide: Gear Up, take companion cards for three survivors not in play and place them next to your survivor card. When a turn card has a smiley face on it, you can activate the power of one of your companions, in addition to your own weapon. Each companion can be used only once in a round.&#10;&#10;",

The houses were both branches of the royal family, therefore the Wars were originally known as &quot;The Cousins' War&quot;. Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.&#10;&#10;The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.&#10;&#10;In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.&#10;&#10;You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.&#10;&#10;Two promo cards are included in each copy of The Cousins' War: Guilds of London: The Secret Guild of Guildsmen and Snowdonia: Supply Wagon/Cannon&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, these vibrant underwater cities are dying. Climate change and its effect of rising sea temperatures is devastating the colorful algae that give coral reefs their brilliant hues, resulting in coral bleaching. Furthermore, other threats like pollution&mdash;in its various insidious forms&mdash;and overfishing are disrupting the delicate balance of reef ecosystems.&#10;&#10;And so, scientists from various fields, along with the researchers studying the ecological complexity and significance of the reefs, are collaborating to address the myriad challenges facing these ecosystems. Your assignment is to take command of a scientific vessel and embark on a journey of reef conservation. Hire the best crew, clean the ocean, and restore the reefs to their former glory.&#10;&#10;During the game, players take on the role of researchers and saviors of the oceans. You will sail the seas, hire crew, explore the coral reef, clean the ocean sectors of any pollution, and try to accomplish as many missions as possible.&#10;&#10;On their turn players may choose to RECHARGE or TRAVEL. If they RECHARGE, they gain the rewards from the VP track. If they TRAVEL, they may deploy Reef Balls, move their Ship, play Mission cards, and perform various actions. The game is played for a variable number of rounds. When a player has crossed the 45 VP threshold, the end of the game is triggered. After an additional round the final scoring takes place and the player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.&#10;&#10;(Note that Kosmos lists this game with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60 minutes.)&#10;&#10;Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beowulf: The Movie Board Game is a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's Cosmolancer. It's also not to be confused with the same author's Beowulf: The Legend. It's an abstract strategy clothed in a theme based on the movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The players' goal is to score the most victory points by clever tile and figurine placement on the board, composed of squares arranged in a grid. Its layout is changed, as the game is divided into three chapters that feature slightly different sets of tiles that can be drawn. Clever hand management (of tiles and figurines) is also important in the game, as some of them can be used only once throughout the entire game. Gameplay is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. On his or her turn, a player may either place a tile (which can be a negative or a positive number, feature a special power or not) or a figurine on the board. If the player wishes to place a tile, he/she can add one to his/her hand of two and place one of the three tiles. Special powers of these tiles may be: displace a figurine, swap a tile from the board from the one from a player's hand, block other tiles, increase the power of figurines in the same row/column, cancel positive numbers on tiles, swap two tiles on the board.&#10;&#10;2. By placing tiles and figurines, players will form rows and columns. After the board is full, the value of each figurine is calculated. Each figurine has a value of 1-4. This value is multiplied by the sum of values of all tiles from tiles that are in its row and column. Special powers of tiles may apply here (like the increasing of figurines' power or blocking). Players evaluate all their figurines on the board and gain points equal to their value.&#10;&#10;This game differs considerably from its predecessor (not all of these may apply to the third English edition by Fantasy Flight Games released in 2012):&#10;&#10;1. In Kingdoms, all three acts took place on the same board. Here, the board is two-sided, with three varying grids.&#10;2. There are more positive tiles than negative ones in this game, therefore situations when players lose points for their figurines are much less frequent.&#10;3. Here, a player manages a hand of three tiles. In Kingdoms, the players had no hand. Instead, he/she drew a single tile which had to be placed on the board.&#10;4. There are more tiles with special powers. More tiles can be swapped, even figurines can change their position, which didn't happen in Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

Often, they were not able to repay him in cash, so they awarded him special privileges, such as trade rights and offices.&#10;&#10;2 to 5 players ages 12 and up assume the role of the merchants from Augsburg and try to get what they can -- by means of auctions -- from the nobility, thus increasing their wealth and particularly their social status.&#10;&#10;The game play uses a simple bidding mechanism. Each round, players offer cards of varying values in a series of five auctions. Once a bid is made, players either raise the bid, call, or drop. The winning player may choose from a set of possible actions that increase abilities (and more importantly, points).  After a number of rounds (dependent on the number of players), scores are tallied. It's that simple.&#10;&#10;This is a game by Karsten Hartwig, whose other game &ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo; was already published by Alea. Game length varies -- depending on the number of players -- between 25 to 90 minutes. The difficulty level is a 4 on the Alea 1-10 scale (the same as Ra).&#10;&#10;Besides the players&rsquo; tableaus and a game board, there are 90 game cards and various game chits.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea medium box series.&#10;&#10;",

With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!&#10;&#10;Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!&#10;&#10;During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.&#10;&#10;Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.&#10;&#10;Gravwell: 2nd Edition features the same gameplay as earlier editions of the game, but now 40 fuel cards are included, which allows up to six players in the game at the same time. (Earlier editions maxed out at four players.) Additionally, ship ability cards are included that can give a unique power to each ship's captain trying to find their way home.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of heroes trying to assemble an arsenal of equipment in order to vanquish a series of monsters that they will encounter.&#10;&#10;The game begins with all players choosing one of five heroes each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each player fights their own monster; this is not a cooperative game. The monster each hero will likely face is revealed to them before players draft cards for their equipment.  An interesting aspect in this game is you may, if the conditions are right, evade a monster in front of you, and pass it to the hero next to you. But be aware if you do this you have to fight the monster you draw next!&#10;&#10;Players then select an equipment card drafted from a hand of cards, and pass the remainder of the hand to your left to prepare for battle with the monster in front of them. The equipment draft continues in this manner until only one card is left in each hand, which is discarded.  Players then compare their drafted equipment to their monster to determine the result of the battle!  The game consists of 3 levels filled with monsters to slay and new equipment to pick up.&#10;&#10;Players need Legend Points to win the game! These come in the form of trophies awarded for most monsters as well as sets of monsters slain. Can you defeat the monsters thrown in your path to glory and become the most Legendary?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spheres of Influence: Struggle for Global Supremacy is a 2-8 player free-for-all light wargame, set on a modern world map. Players will take control of one of the games 8 mighty factions as they compete over the world's spheres of influence, capitals and oil reserves. Will a mighty caliphate rise to power? Will the communist curtain once again fall? Or will western democracy sweep the world?&#10;&#10;In games with fewer than 5 players, each player will control 1-4 factions simultaneously, coordinating their efforts against the other players' coalitions. Each faction will begin the game with only a single, semi-randomly determined territory under its control. From this one space, factions will aggressively expand.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Spheres of Influence is divided into a set number of rounds, with each round being split into 2 phases: the mobilization phase and the turn phase. During the mobilization phase, factions take turns placing units based on how powerful they are. During this phase, the global turn deck is also formed. This deck will be used to determine the turn order and frequency of action for each faction during the upcoming turn phase. To form it, each faction contributes a number of their turn cards (based on the number of oil fields they control) to a single, shared deck of turn cards. This deck is then shuffled and place down on the table.&#10;&#10;During the turn phase, one at a time the top card of the turn deck is revealed. Whichever faction's card was just flipped, that faction takes a turn, performing a single action with its units on a single space (moving, attacking, annexing or passing). Once that action is complete, that turn ends and the next turn card is revealed, with the process repeating itself. This makes turns both fast (with many turns lasting only a couple of seconds) and suspenseful, since none of the factions know precisely when their turns will be. It also ensures more incremental game developments - factions cannot sweep across all of Asia in a single turn and players can respond to attacks or betrayals much sooner. Once the last turn card in the global turn deck has been revealed, a round ends and another round begins.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by a simple dice mechanic fused with a &quot;situational&quot; modifier that loosely simulates the increased difficulty of attacking a defended coastline, breaking a naval blockade, or striking a fortified position. Along the way, powerful special cards can be played, allowing players to strike with submarines, deploy heavy armor, paradrop troops around enemy defenses, and launch devastating nuclear attacks.&#10;&#10;Games have either 5 or 6 rounds depending on the number of factions. Once the final round is complete, the faction who controls the most spheres of influence wins the game for its owner. Games typically last about an hour and a half, and experienced players can sometimes finish in just a single hour.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a cloned clan of lemmings that have been specially trained to compete with the other lemming clans, all trying to scurry down a canyon and hurl themselves over a cliff. Distance and style points are important. One lemming diving with style and &eacute;lan is worth as many as five of the more mundane divers. But beware the hungry eagles circling overhead or your lemmings might not even make the cliff edge!&#10;&#10;Objective: The player with the most victory points wins the game. To earn victory points, players dive their lemmings over the cliff edge and/or collect Lemming Chow Pellets.&#10;&#10;The game board is a hex-based map representing the canyon down which up to six separate lemming clans will travel. The canyon ends with the cliff edge hexes, which are the lemmings' ultimate goal. Between the lemmings and their goal there are two eagles circling overhead hoping for multiple lemming snacks.&#10;&#10;Each turn a movement card is revealed which will allow for 2-5 lemming movement points. Card luck is mitigated in that all players use the same card to move that turn. Only the top lemming in each stack is allowed to move, so covering your opponents' lemmings is one tactic that is used to slow them down. The down side is that the top lemming in each stack is the only one in danger of becoming eagle chow.&#10;&#10;Special Actions allow players to briefly alter the normal rules of the game to their advantage or to their opponents' detriment. There are 16 different Special Actions in the game.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.gmtgames.com/p-143-leaping-lemmings.aspx&#10;&#10;",

The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.&#10;&#10;In the Philippines Version (called Sungka locally) the game is often played with small shells, there are 7 pits on each side as well as the Home and the game is started with 7 shells in each pit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).&#10;&#10;(from MMP's web site:)&#10;&#10;It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.&#10;&#10;Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.&#10;&#10;This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.&#10;&#10;Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.&#10;&#10;",

The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition? And, if they can, will they be able to break out from the bridgeheads and advance across the map while threatened by Allied reinforcements pouring in from the north and south?&#10;&#10;Dynamo: Retreat to Victory&#10;&#10;This game covers the British withdrawal to Dunkirk and the evacuation. The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?&#10; The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale. Special rules include: Allied Heavy Tanks, DeGaulle, Rommel, Hitler's Halt Order, and French Command Paralysis.

    "Description": "Ice Flow is a strategic family game, interesting enough for gamers, as there are many tactical decisions to make.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Karl Bushby's 1998 Goliath Expedition, players race their explorers across the Bering Strait from Alaska to Siberia - riding ice floes, dodging polar bears, and collecting useful items on the way.  Thus, at its heart, Ice Flow is a resource management game coupled with a traveling salesman type problem where the ground (or ice) is constantly moving.&#10;&#10;Each player has three explorers and rucksack card (to store a limited amount of rope and fish in).  The board consists of an array of hexagonal spaces with ice floes (hexagonal plastic tiles) that are introduced at the top and can be moved down the board by players with rates dependent on where they are on the board.  On their turn players must first move, rotate or introduce a new ice floe, then they can move one of their explorer as far as they can (or want) before collecting an item from the tile they finished on.  When moving, explorers are limited by the obstacles they must overcome and the tools they have available.  For example, the ice floes have smooth sides and rough side: the rough sides depict &quot;pack ice&quot; which is hard to cross, and costs a rope.  Similarly, explorers can swim up to one space, but that costs a fish as swimming through arctic waters is energy sapping.  Polar bears are also a hazard that must be avoided or lured away with fish; beware they can be lured away from one player straight into the path of another!&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to negotiate all the hazards and arrive in Siberia with his three explorers intact.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:  IceFloe&#10;&#10;",

In the first round, each player lays down a card, drafts one of the available cards, then moves one of her ships to the right on the ocean. Players then repeat this process, possibly starting a new journey &mdash; a.k.a., new row of played cards &mdash; or adding to the journey already begun by playing a higher-valued card that what was last played. In the latter case, if the color of the card matches the color of the card previously played, the ship moves directly to the right; otherwise the ship moves both down and right.&#10;&#10;When a player can't add to a journey any more and must start a new one, she scores that voyage, possibly claiming one of the ship tiles on display based on the length of the voyage. (Each space on the game board's ocean has values on it, and the more times you move both down and right, the higher your score overall &mdash; doing this is more difficult than you'd hope for, however, since you must consistently have cards that are both of higher value and different color.) Each ship bears some combination of gems, and those are worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If you have certain symbols on a voyage, you can claim bonus action cards that let you steal gems or cards from opponents, take cards from the discard pile, insert cards in a voyage, and so on. Get the right symbols, and you can claim the Madame Ching vessel, ending the game. Players then tally their points for destinations, gems, and so forth, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gin Rummy is a popular two-player &quot;draw and discard&quot; standard deck playing card game derived from Rummy in which players follow basic Rummy rules for forming &quot;melds&quot; of three or more cards of the same suit, or 3 or 4 cards of the same rank. Each turn players draw a single card, either from the top of the discard pile or from the top of the draw deck, and then discard a card from their hand.&#10;&#10;Melds are formed in a player's 10-card hand and kept there until a deal is ended by one player &quot;knocking&quot; when he has few enough non-melded &quot;deadwood&quot; cards to &quot;go out&quot;: generally cards whose values total 10 or less (with face cards valued at 10 and aces low), though some variants value differently. The player that did not go out then has the opportunity to place his melds and &quot;lay off&quot; any of his cards that he can add to his opponent's melds. The values of the remaining deadwood are compared and the player with the smallest total scores the difference.&#10;&#10;If the player that did not go out's deadwood is the same or less than his opponent, he gets a 20 point (Variant: 25 points) bonus for &quot;undercutting&quot;; if the player that went out with &quot;Gin&quot; by emptying his hand without deadwood, he scores a 25 point bonus (and cannot be undercut, and the opponent cannot lay off deadwood to his Gin meld). The game continues with subsequent deals until one player's total score reaches at least 100. At that point, the winning player is awarded an additional 100 points (he also doubles this score if his opponent has not won a hand).  Each player then scores an additional 25 points for each hand won. The winner is the player with the most points. (Numerous variants and much regional variation occurs in the values assigned to these scores, and many bonuses and additional variations in scoring exist.)&#10;&#10;Gin Rummy is distinguished from Rummy in general in being a &quot;knocking&quot; game in which melds are retained in the hand until the end of a deal, and in which it is possible to &quot;go out&quot; without completely emptying one's hand. It is distinguished from games like &quot;500 Rum&quot; in that only deadwood scores.&#10;&#10;In Spanish-speaking countries, the game is played with the Spanish deck and it's typically called &quot;Chinch&oacute;n&quot; or &quot;Txintxon&quot; (in Spain) and &quot;Conga&quot; or &quot;Golpeado&quot; in Uruguay and Peru, respectively.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Hooky. Of the 26 children who should be in classes today, three are off playing hooky. It is morning before school starts, and in the chaos, your job as a homeroom teacher is to figure out which three are missing. There are some children off in the playground who are late getting to their homerooms, and you will learn their identities as they straggle in.&#10;&#10;The three missing students are represented by three hooky cards. You earn points by correctly deducing the identity of the three hooky cards and thereby finding the three missing students. You can also earn points by learning which students are in the other players' classrooms (i.e., hands of cards). The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Let the search begin!&#10;&#10;More on the mechanics: Hooky is a deduction game with a little sprinkle of push-your-luck if you want. Each student is represented by a letter of the alphabet. All players are dealt a few cards and therefore have some knowledge of which students are definitely not missing. To solve the mystery, you will ask for and give clues using five-letter words of your choice. The person asked gives a number as an answer, communicating how many of the letters in the words they have in hand, but not which. By learning which players have which letters (students), you will begin to suspect which students are off playing Hooky and which players have what information.&#10;&#10;",

Ride the train! I'll be wandering about the park, and if you're the first one to find me, you win! Won't that be delightful?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rattlebones is a game about transforming dice. You start with standard six-sided dice, and throughout the course of the game you can remove sides and replace them with other sides that let you do all sorts of wonderful things. Every time you score points, you get closer to finding Rattlebones and, er, winning the game. Yes, winning! It's an experience to six-sided-die for!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup&#10;- Place the Rattlebones meeple at 55, 60, or 65 VP space (for 2-4 players). Players each get 3 d6 (black, white, gray) -- basic d6 but the '1' is replaced by Rattlebones.&#10;- Place random tiles on the empty spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;Your Turn&#10;Roll a die. May spend 1-2 gold to roll an extra 1-2 dice. Then, use each die one at a time:&#10;- if Rattlebones shows, move Rattlebones back one space; game ends immediately if it hits a player score marker and most points wins.&#10;- if pips or Rattlebones showing, move one of your pawns clockwise that many spaces (RB=1) and use the space you land on. Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).&#10;- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.&#10;&#10;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, a player can spend his or her dice to purchase contracts, construct rail links, build switching stations, purchase improvements and deliver one cargo of passengers or freight. Unused dice can be converted into stockpile markers for future use. By purchasing improvements, players can gain more dice with special abilities, become more efficient at laying rail or stockpiling dice, or increase the points they receive when other players deliver cargo over their rails. Bonus points are awarded for delivering passengers quickly or delivering freight over long distances.&#10;&#10;The large, two-sided, colorful board has two maps. The western U.S. map, from the California gold rush era, is designed for 2 &ndash; 4 players. With many double-track routes, this map allows newer players to effectively plan their networks and maximize deliveries. The southeastern U.S. map, depicting the late Nineteenth Century, has only single-track routes that are significantly interwoven. This provides more advanced strategic options and is intended for 3 &ndash; 5 experienced players.&#10;&#10;",
