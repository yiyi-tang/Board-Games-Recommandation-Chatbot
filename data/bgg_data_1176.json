This Blink is the first &quot;Spinomino&quot; in play.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;One at a time, remove a Spinomino from the unplayed pile and connect it to a Spinomino in play. Connecting faces must be the same color, and at least one must be blinking. This rule applies to any faces that are connected, which means placing Spinominoes in a cluster is impossible. If you cannot place a Spinomino, you may respin it.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The game ends when all Spinominoes have been connected legally. The first player to complete the game with the fewest possible respin wins.&#10;&#10;Note: Spinominoes is best with a larger set of Blinks (12+) but is playable with as few as 6.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The French Navy has a history of highs and lows, both in terms of successes in battle and in the number and quality of its ships. In the mid-1700s, after the defeats of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the French Navy was at a nadir. However, due to the efforts of Louis XV and later Louis XVI, France rebuilt and reinforced its fleets with well-designed and well-built ships.&#10;&#10;Why sail the French Navy?&#10;&#10;Though French gunnery and training had formally equalled that of its Spanish and British counterparts prior to the French revolution, those events severely weakened the French Navy. High ranking officers had been removed or even guillotined, and inexperienced crewmen through necessity had been promoted.&#10;&#10;French ships, however, were generally well built, and quick. This is reflected in the national special rules for the French Navy. They are able to purchase both the 'sturdy' and 'streamlined' upgrades for a discounted cost. French crews were also trained to shoot high, in order to capture enemy ships rather than destroy them. As such, they do not suffer the same penalties to hit when aiming high as the other navies do.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By the late 1700s, Great Britain had established itself as the most prominent and powerful navy of the time. This was mostly due to the discipline and commitment of its sailors, and the quality of the training for its leadership positions. The only way to rise through the ranks of the Royal Navy was to prove your mettle in action and bypassing gruelling exams. This was coupled with a very well managed gunnery programme that trained the men to shoot rapidly and accurately.&#10;&#10;Why sail the Royal Navy?&#10;&#10;The Royal Navy's national special rules demonstrate the power of a Royal Navy fleet. Indeed, they'll have a great bearing on how you select the components of your fleet. The quality of the Royal Navy's training is represented by their 'Drilled' special rule, which confers a bonus to shooting, and the 'Admiralty' rule confers an extra level of reliability to each of your ships.&#10;&#10;As such you may find yourself fielding a smaller number of ships than other fleets, though you'll be able to deck these ships out with upgrades. Each will have a staying power and reliability both in sailing power and in unleashing their weaponry. The Royal Navy is poised to dominate the Black Seas.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Naval Act of 1794 established a permanent standing navy on 27 March 1794, in the US. Prior to this, a US Naval military presence had been left wanting for 10 years. By October 1797, the first three of six frigates launched; the USS United States, USS Constellation, and USS Constitution. Between 1798 and 99, several engagements took place between the US and France - though this was not a declared war. The First Barbary War of 1801-1805 saw actions against the Barbary pirates.&#10;&#10;The fleet would then see substantial action in the War of 1812 - achieving victory in 11 single ship engagements against the Royal Navy. British forces were forced off Lake Erie and Lake Champlain, effectively preventing the invasion of New York State. The fleet was, however, unable to prevent British blockades of US ports, the British Navy being significantly larger.&#10;&#10;Why sail the US Navy?&#10;&#10;The largest ships of the US Navy may pail in size in comparison to other nations, especially when using the National Special Rules (being unable to field any large or extra-large vessels). However, their frigates were exceptionally reinforced with many guns. To represent this, US fleets gain discounts to both the Over Gunned and Sturdy upgrades. They are both able to better weather punishment whilst dealing out a substantial portion themselves.&#10;&#10;Additionally, in a similar vein to British crews, US crews were routinely drilled and always receive the +1 bonus to hit rolls. This makes US frigates, the core of your fleet exceptionally dependable, though remember if you do purchase both upgrades on all your ships (even at a discount), you may find yourself outnumbered.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Spanish Navy was beset by mixed fortunes in the Age of Sail, achieving great victories and major defeats in an interesting balance. Particularly during the Napoleonic era, Spanish allegiances were subject to fluctuations, oftentimes at odds with the British, yet allying with them when the situation suited (such as their rejection of Napoleon in 1808 - even in the wake of Trafalgar in which a quarter of the Spanish Navy had been lost).&#10;&#10;The Spanish Navy was the largest in the world at the outset of the 1700s, though this diminished to third-largest as the century wore on. Not only fighting close to home, the Spanish Navy fought engagements as far away as the Carribean and South America, where they achieved similarly mixed results.&#10;&#10;Why sail the Spanish Navy?&#10;&#10;When using the National Special Rules, the Spanish Navy allows you to bring a huge level of firepower in your fleets. Spanish 1st Rates are allowed to take the Over Gunned upgrade for free adding a heavy and a light cannon to each broadside. This is not without compromise, however, as these vessels need to successfully pass a test to travel at full sails, and can never be crewed by veterans. Additionally, veterans for other ships cost more in Spanish fleets.&#10;&#10;This means that a Spanish Admiral will need to use extra cunning in the selection of vessels for their fleet, carefully selecting upgrades for the extremely powerful Over Gunned vessels, to offset the decreased manoeuvrability and penalty to hit. At the same time, enemy fleets will need to be extremely wary of exposing themselves to the initial broadside of a fully tooled-up Spanish 1st Rate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Munich War: World War II in Europe 1938 is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries aligned with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. It is an operational level simulation of a hypothetical World War II in Europe that began in the fall of 1938. The assumption is that the British and French governments did not back down at the September 1938 Munich conference when Hitler demanded the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and instead went to war with the Third Reich. The ensuing conflict finds the powers partially prepared for war. In Munich War, alliances are determined at the start of the game, representing the wider political-military situation. Each turns represents one week of operations. The game covers the first two months of the war, since beyond that time the onset of winter and logistical shortages would have brought an end to operations. The objective is for each alliance to seize a position from which it can then dominate Europe in the ensuing war. Each hex on the map represents 65 kilometers or 40 miles from side to opposite side. Units are at the corps and army level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Published in World at War magazine Nr.74 (Oct-Nov 2020)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Centrifugal Offensive: The Japanese Campaign in the Pacific, 1941-42 is a solitaire, strategic level wargame of the initial Imperial Japanese campaigns in the Pacific War, 1941 to 1942. The player commands the Japanese forces, with the Allies are controlled by the game system. The player's objective is to accomplish campaign objectives ahead of the original schedule, thereby forestalling the inevitable US-led Allied offensive. A critical factor in the game is victory fever. The more the Japanese are winning, the greater the chance they will have to attain additional objectives to win the game. Another factor is the game ends before the Allied counteroffensive in the Solomons, so there are no Allied amphibious operations. Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades and regiments. Aircraft units represent one to three air groups or regiments (three to nine squadrons). Distances between each space on the map vary depending on location and strategic importance, with the distance varying from 1,000 to a few hundred kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Published in &quot;World At War&quot; magazine, issue #75&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Winter War: Finland vs the Soviet Union 1939&quot; is an operational level two player wargame. It covers the Soviet invasion of Finland over the Winter of 1939-40. The Soviets initially expected a quick victory. However, the Finns, under the leadership of Carl Gustav Mannerheim, resisted and outmaneuvered the more ponderous Red Army forces. It was not until Marshal Timoshenko was appointed to lead the campaign, that the Soviets gained the initiative. They captured sufficient territory to bring the war to a negotiated end. The Soviet historical objectives were to seize key geographical areas and inflict sufficient Finnish casualties to force the Finns to negotiate a pro-Soviet Union peace treaty. The Finns were attempting to prevent this or prolong the war to where outside intervention would come to their aid. Each hex on the map represents circa 21 miles. Each turn of play represents ten days. Ground units represent detachments, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions and corps. Aircraft units represent a number of sorties to accomplish a mission.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Suez Solo: Rommel Drives Deep is a solitaire game where the player takes command of the German-Italian Panzer Armee Afrika (PAA) during the 1942 campaign in Egypt as Rommel drives on the Suez Canal. The game begins immediately following the PAA capture of Tobruk in June 1942 and continues through to the August battle of Alam el Halfa where Rommel was finally stopped. Your goal is to seize strategic objectives such as major cities in the Nile Delta and the Suez Canal. In the game, you control the PAA. The game system plays the Allied Middle East Command (MEC). You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce counterattacks to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Suez! The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, that gives the player a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, that give more realism at the expense of more complexity. The time span of turns 1 to 7 is from the last week of June 1942 to the first week of September; turns 8 to 10 cover the rest of September to mid-October. Each turn can represent any amount of time from two days of intense combat to two weeks of refitting and reorganizing. The map scale is approximately 45 km to the inch. Ground combat units represent everything from battalions to divisions. Air units represent two to six groups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These campaigns revolved around the regions of Manchukuo (Manchuria) and Menjiang (Inner Mongolia), and culminated in the Japanese invasion of China proper, taking the capital at Peiping (Peking). There was also the possibility of Soviet intervention. The game has two players: the Japanese Empire and the Republic of China. The Japanese objective is to gain control of northern China to provide a strategic advantage for the ensuing Sino-Japanese War which commenced in July 1937. The Chinese objective is to retain control of strategic regions of northern China, thereby forestalling a larger Japanese invasion. Each hex on the map represents 75 kilometers across. Each turn of play represents one year of operations. Japanese ground units are divisions and brigades. Allied Japanese, as well as most Chinese units, are at the army and corps level, representing shifting arrays of forces. Air units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In doing so, players will plunder islands for valuable loot, pillage loot from other captains using a unique sea battle mechanic, and complete objectives to write shanties that will become their legacy once Davy Jones takes his toll.&#10;&#10;Sea Shanties' environmentally friendly design utilizes dynamic board tiles printed on canvas. There are over a duodecillion different configurations of the board, meaning you will never play on the same board twice!&#10;&#10;Players start with 15 crew and a ship token on a starting island, selected by a draft. Players have 5 additional crew tokens in Hunter's Tavern.&#10;&#10;Every captain's turn has three phases - Actions, then Bury, then Collect (ABC). During the action phase, captains may take up to 5 actions. The five available actions are Sail (Move their ship token to an adjacent square on the board, utilizing wind arrows), Plunder (place crew tokens from your player board onto an island that your ship token occupies), Abandon (remove all of your tokens from an island that your ship token does not occupy and place them in Hunter's Tavern), Recruit (place one crew token from Hunters Tavern onto your player board), and Sea Battle (initiate a battle with another captain's if their ship is in an adjacent square).&#10;&#10;After the action phase, captains may Bury their loot that they had on their ship. Buried loot cannot be pillaged in sea battles. Once that phase is done, players may then Collect 1 loot per loot-producing island they control, collect any Ballads if they have buried the most of a particular type of loot, and collect one verse if they completed the specified objective on it.&#10;&#10;Sea Battles are an augmented Prisoner's Dilemmah. Captains will secretly select a number on the battle dial between 0 and the number of crew tokens they have on their captain's placards (not on in the tavern or on islands). They will simultaneously reveal their selected numbers. The highest number wins and may pillage loot tokens from the loser equal to the difference of the two selected numbers. The winner will also have to surrender crew to the tavern equal to the difference. Lastly, the winner gets a Fear loot chit. Do you send all of your crew to battle, knowing that the opposer might select a low number and you lose most of your crew?&#10;&#10;Once all of the shanties have been sung, the player with the most Renown Points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is based on Churchill, the superb, award-winning Mark Herman design, and was well received during GMT&rsquo;s Spring 2019 Weekend at the Warehouse and June&rsquo;s CSW Expo in Tempe, Arizona. It is the third game after Churchill and Pericles in GMT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Statesmen&rdquo; series.&#10;&#10;CoV creates an enthralling gaming arena. It allows players to become the main characters of the dramatic, titanic struggle between the struggling Napoleonic Empire and the coalition of Russia, Austria, and Great Britain (with their Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish allies).&#10;&#10;The game starts after Napoleon&rsquo;s disastrous 1812 retreat from Moscow, covering the decisive years of 1813 and 1814. The abstract game map involves a strategic theatre portraying Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the boundaries of Poland and Prussia. It also includes the secondary front of Italy, an area for depicting maritime warfare and the British/American War of 1812. This game by designer Frank Esparrago and developer Dick Sauer (with much appreciated input from Mark Herman) has been created to be played as both a diplomatic and strategic military conflict without losing the taste of the Napoleonic era&rsquo;s great battles.&#10;&#10;All tables necessary for gameplay are printed on the game board. Congress of Vienna reproduces the spirit of Churchill in the mechanics and organization of its rules, diplomatic display, and its military map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Hybrid Fantasy Civilization RPG that plays 1-10 players. Verrago combines traditional board game mechanics, light legacy mechanics with Table Top Role Playing Games.  You will be using magnetic pieces on a globe that acts as a new form of game board, called Vaeya, A mysterious planet layered in stories and magic.  Play as any level of political unit : Characters, Families, Guilds, Roles, Kingdoms, Empires)on a world where everything hangs in a dynamic Balance.  Should this Balance be disrupted by you and your fellow players (and it surely will), the planet will try to end your (usually) evil ways by uniquely trying to exterminate everyone, starting with the worst perpetrators. This is a world where nothing stays the same, mysteries deepen as you explore the Veridian and attempt to master it and you can choose to band together to fight the apocalypse, or become it.&#10;With 5 main paths to victory(Epic Story, Strongest Lineage, Veridian Imprint, Strategic Survivor and Richest Delve) you choose how and where your victories can occur over your opponents.  Victories, over many plays of Verrago, create a historical record of your globe that becomes unique to your gaming group. The globe itself acts as your &quot;save file&quot; so that your playthrough's matter, your time playing the game works more for you. This allows you to create a long term dialogue with your board game group and weave ever more elaborate stories that add value to your group and add additional meaning to your friendships&#10;&#10;Designed also as a fully developed TTRPG, this game will have many familiar TTRPG themes and structures.  Dungeon Masters, this game will help you relieve your creative burdens and allow you to get immediate player investment into your game when doing your session zero game! Players, this will give you a TTRPG experience like no other, a true blend of concepts at a deep level with extensive options for pushing your own narratives. Verrago uses a co-created history mechanic for telling epic, memorable stories that can also be used for your Table Top Role Playing Games. Vaeya, the planet of our setting, is an INTERACTIVE SETTING, the cards allow for a dynamic storytelling experience that also gives you(and your characters) direct control over a range of theme/lore heavy game mechanics.  Verrago also has an event system that helps you generate a world spanning, geopolitical and Veridian situation EACH GAME, with care to minimize the burdens of recording the history during the game.  A more detailed record is possible, yet this will be at your own discretion.  Verrago also has a Campaign Book that works with the card generation system so that you get the best of both worlds, the strength of linear storytelling AND the strength of the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style of storytelling. There is nothing that approaches the scope and scale of Verrago on the board game market.  There's something special about creating a world with others...&#10;&#10;The game has 3 main parts, of which the first is optional and the third won't always occur.  Here is a rough overview of how it will play(subject to change as the game is currently in development):&#10;&#10;1. The Pre-Game(Optional): You play with your friends to set the precise magical conditions you want to play and feel out and fine tune the game so that you aren't limited to randomization. This pre-game is about generating the world you will play next and takes about 30-60min.  There are 25 preset scenarios that allow you to skip this pre-game and are recommended for your first few times playing the game.&#10;&#10;2. Verrago: You will us 5x game mechanics (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Experiment and Exterminate) to overcome your opponents(should you have any), sometimes needing to create temporary/permanent alliances to survive the more dangerous events that occur randomly(or by player action).  As you acquire power in the world, the planet fights back as you are disrupting the careful magical balance of the world.  &#10;Once you've disrupted the balance enough, through your own actions or that of the planetary response, the apocalypse will begin.&#10;  &#10;3. Sudden Death Apocalypse: Featuring 125 different ways to destroy the world, each apocalypse will demonstrate something new about Veridian and the world.  The Apocalypse has 5 randomly drawn event cards at the beginning of the game that slowly get turned over revealing the apocalypse code that players look up in the event book.  Players take their most empowered character(s), their Verrago, and attempt to maneuver them so that the apocalypse affects other players more than themselves.  Whatever remains is yours to keep for the next game.  At the end of the apocalypse, the game will be recorded using pen and paper and you can choose to continue your play and build upon the remains of the previous age. You win when you survive and no one else does, or you survive better than everyone else.  You can also win by creating the strongest legacy and other forms of victory.  Victory is more of a long term goal, with challenges like &quot;survive the 25 preset scenarios in different configurations&quot;.&#10;&#10;Verrago is a multi-layered game, with 5 expansions already designed to work with the existing game, so that you will only ever need to purchase 1 globe to play it.  Each expansion will provide the scope of a full game, using cards and add an in depth focus to the game, changing it into many different forms of popular game mechanics like: Warfare, Trade, Technology, More Veridian(Magic), Culture, and Survival/CO-OP. The game is designed to fundamentally change into your preferred style of game by purchasing an expansion.  Or play all expansions together, they are interchangeable and don't have dependencies on each other.  Future expansions WILL have dependencies on the core expansions. Bring whichever expansion you like to the table to try to shift the focus of the game &quot;your&quot; way as you unlock the option to play your expansion by your in game actions.&#10;&#10;About this project and the designer:&#10;&#10;This unique Role Playing Game(RPG) setting has undergone rigorous craft, research and extreme care in it's composition as a passion project beginning in 2003. S.A. Heinichen was trained at Navy Nuclear Power Training Command and then at Submarine Base Groton in the U.S. Navy, in addition to having held a Top Secret security clearance.  S.A. Heinichen's extensive training in multiple applied engineering fields has allowed him to incorporate many scientific disciplines into the magic system, represented simply by the rune system.  The Cloak and Dagger excitement of the intelligence community is a theme throughout Verrago.  Verrago strikes a balance between science fiction and high fantasy and you can actively change this balance during the course of the game as part of your strategic storytelling goals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The number of actions is determined by the dice, but there is little difference. However, if the numbers are biased continuously, it can make a big difference. Enjoy your luck!&#10;&#10;The game system on the adventurer's side is a mix of whack-a-mole, which defeats so many wizards, and treasure hunt looking for weapons. I want to search for weapons quickly, but I can't get used to it because there are so many wizards.&#10;&#10;The wizard will win if 4 witches appear, trap the adventurers in the mirror labyrinth! But wizards are so weak that an adventurer can be killed just by passing. Get up again and again!&#10;&#10;Adventurers can flip the labyrinth tiles upside down like a mirror. Adventurers can make a path by flipping the labyrinth tiles, even if the road you want to go is blocked. Ofcourse you can flip the labyrinth tiles to keep the dragon away. The wizard will win if all the labyrinth tiles change the mirror world, so let's turn it over.&#10;&#10;Dragons that are a threat to adventurers and wizards move randomly according to the cards. The plan can be ruined by the dragon. However, adventurers can restart from the magic square even if they are attacked by dragons, so don't give up until the end!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "IGB&Oacute; is an abstract strategy board game that teaches sustainable thinking. IGB&Oacute; translates to 'forest' in Yoruba.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player gets 36 &quot;seeds&quot; and 4 &quot;desert&quot; pieces. The game starts by flipping the IGB&Oacute; piece. If IGB&Oacute; lands face-up then the youngest player starts. The IGB&Oacute; piece can be used as a neutral seed by both players, but neither player can stack on top of it.&#10;&#10;Next, players now take turns to place pieces on the board. Desert pieces prevent growth and can be used defensively/offensively during the game. The seed pieces are used to form IGB&Oacute;s.&#10;&#10;An IGB&Oacute; is formed in the following ways:&#10;&#10;Plant 5 seeds in a row, the center seed becomes the IGB&Oacute; trunk AND/OR:&#10;Plant two intersecting rows of 3 seeds, the center seed becomes the IGB&Oacute; trunk.&#10;&#10;Methods of scoring a single IGBO:&#10;&#10;The center of each shape gains another seed and becomes the stacked trunk of the IGB&Oacute;. Once an IGB&Oacute; is stacked and formed, the other seeds in the formation are turned over to signify that they have become roots. Players add more symmetric root branches to their IGB&Oacute; to take it to be a Double, Triple and Quadruple IGB&Oacute;.&#10;&#10;The scoring is simple and works as follows:&#10;&#10;Single IGB&Oacute; gives you 2 points &#10;Double IGB&Oacute; gives you 4 points &#10;Triple IGB&Oacute; gives you 8 points &#10;Quadruple IGB&Oacute; gives you 16 points&#10;&#10;Another strategic element is the wind. Seeds that are not &quot;rooted&quot; can be blown in the wind and travel a maximum of 5 spaces on the board moving horizontally and vertically. This can be used to disguise your strategy to your opponent. On your turn, you may either plant a new seed or move two existing seeds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cthulhu 1968: Black Sun 28mm Miniatures and Rulebook&#10;&#10;Black Sun is a game of ground combat that accompanies our 28mm Black Sun range of models. It is set in another dimension that is known as Black Sun, located somewhere in an alternate jungles of Cambodia in the year 1968. The rules are designed to give you an authentic feel for warfare in the Viet Nam War and could certainly be used for this purpose. However, the game also includes some fantastic events from the alternate dimension of the Black Sun. These rules include unpredictable events &ndash; sudden rushes, explosions, ambushes, and malfunctioning weapons along with more far flung environmental and strange atmospheric manifestations &ndash; that will challenge your strategy and tactics as a tabletop general. The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (jungle, trees, jungle, rocks, downed helicopters, ancient buildings and yet more jungle). The playing area can represent anything from an ancient city to an alien jungle canopy to a Bug-infested tunnel complex! &#10;Each player controls a Force about the size of a small squad (6-15 models). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled troops (like NVA militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or weird alien Fury Bugs whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for Viet Nam era warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Black Sun should take an hour or less to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Twelve of these conflicts ended in Burmese victory. The 1767 siege of Ayutthaya ended in the great capital&rsquo;s total destruction. The Fall of Siam attempts to give players the opportunity to face each other with historically similar armies under similar circumstances. The Fall of Siam  is a two-player, hex and counter game lasting approximately two hours.

    "Description": "Centuria is a wargame for two players or more that lets you simulate battles set in the Ancient Period. The game uses our well-known Action/Reaction mechanism but now includes exciting new rules to better simulate the dynamics of these battles and will allow you make many strategic and tactical decisions that will help you on your way to victory. Closing ranks at the right time, charging the enemy when he&rsquo;s disordered and making the most of his hesitation to break his lines, these are just some of the new ways of fighting that you&rsquo;ll find in these pages. The system allows you to play with any scale of miniature and keeps the base sizes fixed while just changing the number of miniatures that are on them. As well as a points system to help you balance your games, each unit also has a Training Value, a value that shows its prowess in Melee, an Armour Value and a number of losses that it can take. The rules also contain three classic scenarios, Vanguard, Ambush and Sacking the Camp which will test your command skills. The game is easy to learn and a normal game will last a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are more and varied troop types; rules governing Foreign Volunteers and Mercenaries, and a new way of looking at the countryside, enabling players to lay a groundwork of operations before the game begins through &quot;Affiliation Points&quot;.&#10;&#10;Like Tinker Fox, players take the role of Governor or Generalissimo of a region. They must plot their campaign to grab key towns and districts to create a strong  base, while keeping their enemies from doing the same. Scenarios can vary victory conditions, like having to raise troops for the main army far away or to knock out a specific town. How to do it is up to you.... slipping a garrison commander some cash to lower a rope over the walls, or blow through them suddenly with a petard when everyone's asleep. Cut a swath through enemy territory, burning and pillaging, or lay siege to his capitol!&#10;&#10;Build your own campaign for anything going in Western Europe! Scenarios could easily be made for any of the local fighting between Huguenots and Royalists, or when Henry of Navarre  becomes King, between the Royalists and the League. Other fertile areas would be the Netherlands between Spanish and Dutch forces, or after the Pacification of Ghent, Spanish versus Flemings and Walloons. With some slight backdating you could wow your friends with a campaign from the Schmalkaldic Wars! I can also see how this would work for  border warfare in the Balkans between Imperial and Turkish forces, or in Livonia between Swedes and Poles! Supplements are fun and easy to produce...&#10;&#10;Includes THREE HISTORICAL SCENARIOS, three separate campaign games, one set in the Netherlands and two in France, each with the actual leaders present, one including the King of Navarre himself, Henry IV.&#10;&#10;Engagements are resolved using 'Spanish Fury, Actions!' rules or 'Duel' for when your two favorite officers meet on the field.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To fix a potential impasse is to place a stone of its majority color on its empty point.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point, then fix all resulting potential impasses. If this creates further potential impasses, fix those as well, and so on.&#10;&#10;You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",
