Players buy seeds, sow and harvest them and sell the crop paying also taxes. The most successful farmer in terms of capital wins.&#10;&#10;A round of the square game board represents one year, each side roughly representing one season: in winter players decide which seeds to buy and to what extent, in spring the seeds are sown, in summer (and partly autumn) it is the harvest time.&#10;&#10;Advancing on the board happens by rolling a die. Each square represents one week and has special instructions on it: paying random expenses, drawing a surprise card, getting income out of the forest etc.&#10;&#10;The harvest times of different plants are sequential and differ in length. The die roll the player lands on one of the harvest squares of certain plant also determines the hectare price of that crop (lookup table used). It is possible to miss the harvest season of any plant resulting in a crop failure for which the state pays a small compensation.&#10;&#10;Harvesting machinery may be bought to increase the crop price and a tractor decreases the sowing expenses. More land can be rented or bought as well. At the end of the year the taxes are paid, the accounts balanced and a new year may begin.&#10;&#10;The game includes two sets of rules: in the simplified set e.g. everyone grows one hectare of each plant, there is no machinery or, obviously, no option to rent or buy more land.&#10;&#10;",

The Player will command the Japanese submarine force by playing the role of Vice Adm. Komatsu Teruhisa , who, between August and September 1942, prepared and ordered the I-boats offensive from his headquarters in Truk. By contrast, the Allied escort groups will operate in accordance with a strictly defined set of rules. The specific game scenario will allow the Player to simulate the crucial moments which led on 15th September to sink the carrier U.S.S. Wasp and to hit some units of another carrier group built around the U.S.S. Hornet. As a consequence, the Player will be able to understand the logic of a submarine force whose potential was underestimated even by the High Japanese Command, and perceive the tension of Japanese sub-commanders in their ultimate search for high estimated preys, personal glory and, most of all, respect.&#10;    Specific rules for random events, like intelligence resources or air raids, will add to the realism of the game. Concurrently, these elements will also offer the opportunity to examine through a different perspective, limits and contradictions to the Imperial Japanese Navy management of its &lsquo;silent service&rsquo; during one of the most intense (and largely unknown) phases of submarine warfare of the entire War in the Pacific.&#10;&#10;",

However this was, in fact, the third battle fought at the Alamein position over a period of five months. The second battle, sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;Battle of Alam Halfa&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rommel&rsquo;s last dash&rsquo;, is seen as a necessary holding action which blunted the offensive capability of the Axis forces. The &lsquo;First Battle of Alamein&rsquo; or &lsquo;July Battles&rsquo; which concerns us presently has been given a comparatively negligent amount of historical attention; at times referenced as a hideously complex standstill or fatuously dismissed as insignificant. However, it was this battle which put a stop to Rommel&rsquo;s gallop to Alexandria and began the change in Eighth Army&rsquo;s fortunes that would eventually lead it to victory in November 1942.&#10;&#10;The game map is a simple reproduction of the battle field of El Alamein in North Africa, from the Mediterranean Sea in the North to the impassable Qattara Depression in the South.&#10;&#10;The Commonwealth player controls the units on the board which are Light Blue.&#10;German Units are represented in Grey, and Italian units are represented in Green.&#10;&#10;",

It took place around the village of Suomussalmi and along the road leading to this village from the hamlet of Raate. The battle was fought between the 163rd and 44th divisions of the Red Army, the latter being a motorized division, against a composite Finnish division which was eventually called the 9th and had only a few artillery units and nothing else in support of its infantry battalions. The battle was fought from early December until early January and resulted in the complete destruction of the Soviet divisions.&#10;&#10;The map covers the area around Suomussalmi and Haapavaara. It is divided into hexagons (hexes) each approximately 2.6 km across. &#10;The counters for the two armies are slightly different in the information they contain as well as in the color. Soviet units are red and Finnish units grey. The unit size designations and arm-of-service designations are the standard NATO designations with two possible exceptions. Two lines at the top of the unit marks a battalion and three a regiment.&#10;&#10;",

One of the most important aspects of war at sea is the difficulty of bringing an opponent to decisive battle, it took Nelson nearly two years to bring the French fleet to battle at Trafalgar, and in an era before radar or secure communication it remained as difficult.  Therefore this simulation uses a double blind system to simulate these difficulties.&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENTS&#10;&#10;2 Search Charts &ndash; One British, One German&#10;1 Turn Chart&#10;100 Counters:&#10;- 64 Ship Counters&#10;- 4 Fleet Counters&#10;- 16 Contact Counters&#10;- 6 Light Cruiser Search Counters (2 Red, 4 Black)&#10;- 3 Engadine Float Plane Searches&#10;- 2 Radio Intercept Counters&#10;- 2 Submarine Contact Counters&#10;- 1 Zeppelin Search Counter&#10;- 1 Turn Counter&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What's Wild?! is a rummy-based card game for 2-7 players Ages 7 and up. Instead of cards featuring suits, the game's cards are made up of four different animal skins&mdash;alligator, cheetah, peacock, and zebra. And to further the &quot;Wild&quot; theme of the game, when a player's hand allows him or her to end a round of play, he or she must declare, &quot;I'm going wild!&quot;&#10;&#10;A complete game of What's Wild?! includes 10 rounds. Each player receives three cards to begin the first round, and by the final round, each player is holding 12 cards in his or her hand. Players collect appropriately-named &quot;herds&quot; and &quot;caravans&quot;&mdash;called &quot;books&quot; and &quot;runs&quot; in traditional rummy games&mdash; throughout each round, until they are able to &quot;Go Wild,&quot; or end the round.&#10;&#10;Four cards - called &quot;Chameleon Cards&quot; change the Wild Card when played throughout the game. The four Chameleon Cards give the game a sort of &quot;Old Maid&quot; feel, in that if the card is in a player's hand when another player &quot;Goes Wild,&quot; the player holding the Chameleon Card is awarded the maximum amount of points. In a game in which the low score wins, players must carefully weigh their options for playing Chameleon Cards when holding one. Playing the card too early may allow the Wild Card to be changed in later turns, but holding on to it too long may lead to an stampede of points. The Chameleon Card makes each round of every game of What's Wild?! new, exciting, and completely unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.whatswildcardgame.com/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is on the market.  Anyone attenting RECON in Orlando is welcome to stop by the Flaming Monkey Games booth for a quick demo.  :)&#10;&#10;OPORD is a game designed specifically to allow players to experience the sensation of launching a coordinated combined arms attack.  The game challenges a player with modern land warfare based upon existing tactical doctrine at the battalion level, but condensed in such a way as to make the make exiting and playable.  Players develop and execute operations to affect a coordinated tactical victory over their opponent.  To win, a player will have to successfully execute the instructions on his Mission Card while keeping the opponent from doing likewise.&#10;&#10;In modern warfare, there is no shoot, maneuver sequence, as all shooting and maneuvering is simultaneous.  This is a key difference between modern warfare and that of WWII, and thus a main component of OPORD.  Movement is continuous, and shooting is sustained.  This is a key concept built into the OPORD game engine.  The variable turn sequence forces tactical forethought beyond the old &ldquo;my turn, your turn&rdquo; design mentality, and as a result players get a sense of fluidity of motion throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Another key aspect of OPORD is the mission card driven objectives.  Players are not playing to slay each other&rsquo;s armies, since this is akin to senseless banzai charges with no real aim other than to roll dice.  Rather, the game is set around typical &ldquo;real world&rdquo; sorts of missions that soldiers are given to accomplish.  Seize this hill, secure this route, recon in force here, set up a defense there&mdash;all of these are typical missions you&rsquo;ll see in your mission cards.  And like the real world, you job is to use your troops and support elements to accomplish the mission.&#10;&#10;In short, OPORD is a game that very closely relates the gaming experience to that of a real life Battalion Commander but in a fun way.  Receive your orders, allocate your troops and resources, design your plan, execute your plan, and complete the mission.&#10;&#10;A typical turn.  Both players dice for initiative and turn sequence.  Initiative is obvious, winner goes first.  Sequencing dice determines the player's turn sequence.  Sequencing can be shoot/move/fight or move/shoot/fight.  the initiative winner goes first in the first two phases, while in the third phase &quot;fight&quot; all combat is simultaneous.  Movement variables are factored into the terrain boards, so there is no worry about modifiers for moving.  In combat, units shoot/fight collectively if in the same sector, or individually if in separate sectors.  Essentially both players dice (attack dice for phasing player, defend dice for non-phasing).  The interactive nature of every phase of every turn means no players are passive, which gives both a sense of fluidity.  Results are based upon combat dicing.  Units can be depleted, eliminated, or forced to withdraw.  The object of the game is to accomplish your mission and deny the enemy his.  While there are some mission cards that are all out attacks, most of the missions require you to combat in support of your own mission or to deny the other's.&#10;&#10;Terrain boards are modular, so there is no limit to the size map one can create.  But a game comes with six maps.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Raid in Mogadishu on 3 October 1993 was the seventh in a series of raids mounted by US SOF (Special Operations Forces) Task Force Ranger (TFR). It was an attempt to immediately and dramatically seize the leadership of General Mohammad Farrah Aideed&rsquo;s Habr Gidr, which was in conflict with UN forces being supported by the US. What was planned as a lightning raid soon escalated into a decisive, bitter and costly two-day battle. The aftermath led to the withdrawal of US and UN forces in Somalia and the consolidation of Aideed and Habr Gidr power. It was the most intense fighting the US military had seen since Vietnam. The course of the events has become familiar through the film based on Mark Bowden&rsquo;s Black Hawk Down. For the Somalis the battle is remembered as &ldquo;Malinki Ranger&rdquo; which translates into English as &ldquo;Day of the Ranger&rdquo;. As has usually been the case Post Cold-War the fighting in Somalia was not about ideology but about Aideed and his Habr Gidr faction. In a war about an individual, seizure raids by SOF become strategic operations. Fittingly, it was also a conflict that pitted Aideed&rsquo;s strategy of attrition against SOF tactics of raiding.&#10;&#10;This is a very simple two player simulation of the October 3, 1993 firefight between Task Force Ranger and the Habr Gidr Clan in Mogadishu, Somalia. Each player controls either Task Force Ranger or the Habr Gidr Clan. The use of the title Day of the Rangers refers to the Somali name for the fight-&rsquo;Malinki Ranger.&rsquo; The object of the game is to amass as many victory points as possible, the winner gains the most points, however the victory conditions set up to provide a balanced scenario outcome.&#10;&#10;Game Files Direct Download: LINK&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;When Hell Froze Over&quot; is an operational level wargame simulation of the Soviet counter-offensive around the city of Stalingrad in November 1942. Codenamed Operation Uranus, this offensive saw massive thrusts both to the North and South the city itself. Utilizing vast reserves of men and armor that the Germans where unaware of, these two thrusts penetrated deep behind Axis lines causing the German 6th Army to become pinched off, encircled and ultimately doomed. This simulation offers players two scenarios; Firstly the initial stages of Operation Uranus demonstrating the first chaotic days of the Soviet assault, Secondly there is a scenario simulating the ensuing efforts of the Germans to relieve the pocket whilst the Soviets strive to collapse it.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;- Map board &#10;- Sheet of Counters &#10;- Game Markers&#10;- Rules Booklet&#10;- Scenario Leaflet&#10;- Player Aid Sheet&#10;- One 6 sided die&#10;&#10;",

One person is the GM (or &quot;Pattern Master&quot;) and describes what the other players in the room see. Everyone else in the room cooperates as the group explores a dungeon and earns keys by solving riddles together.&#10;&#10;The riddles are usually of the form &quot;You enter the next room and see these few objects.&quot; Players then suggest things to do to investigate the objects and their interactions. The GM tells them what happens as they explore. Eventualy the players regonize the software development pattern for which these objects are a metaphor.&#10;&#10;The game was created for a conference attended by software developers and presumably has limited appeal outside that group, as few others would ever be able to identify the metaphor, having never read about software development patterns.&#10;&#10;",

The design of the best miniatures in the old range have been retained, the others improved and, to top it all off, everything will come pre-painted, saving you the trouble of creating forces from scratch, and allowing you to get straight into the game itself.&#10;&#10;Replaced&#10;&#10;    Starship Troopers Miniatures Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To move your rabbit playing piece from &quot;start&quot; to &quot;home&quot; over 49 steps, using the roll of the dice. You are helped on your way by taking short-cut paths if they are landed on, but you are also hindered if you land on a burrow, and you take a short-cut backwards!&#10;&#10;The game is designed as if it was Beatrix Potter herself who had created it. All the parts and pieces used are made in materials that would have been available to her. The box is small and compact to take the well thought out pieces and is in keeping with the small book itself.&#10;&#10;Snakes and Ladders is a Victorian game brought back from India and has the concept of good and bad, just right for Peter Rabbit. The illustrations used in the board design show Peter being naughty at one end of the burrow and then the result of being naughty at the other after he goes down. On the Path when he is good he goes up and the illustrations at either end depict this.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple and can be played by three year old's upward. It should take no longer than five minutes to play, the concentration span of children of that age and perfect before bedtime. Hence the simple Paths and Burrows on the board and there being only 49 squares. If you want to spend longer then play more times, best of three etc.&#10;&#10;The large wooden die has large numbers to help a child learn the numbers from 1 to 6. Each number is also decorated with the same number of rabbits. So there is one on the 1 and two on the 2 etc. Children will love counting these to see what number they have thrown. You can then move this number on the board. This will help them understand the relationship with the board numbers and the dice at an early age.&#10;&#10;The pieces are Peter and the three Flopsy bunnies in stone resin and with painted jackets. They will bring Peter alive on the board to a young persons mind.&#10;&#10;It is a gift item not a toy. By spending time with the game and taking care of it a child will come to appreciate it as they grow old. The textures and shapes and illustrations all blending to create an experience they will always remember.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a Bible trivia version of Bingo. But instead of the letters of &quot;bingo&quot; for the columns, the columns of this game are A, M, E, N and !. According to the rules of the game: the exclamation point column is to be identified as the &quot;Halleluiah&quot; column. Another difference is that the moderator does not simply call out squares to be covered on the player's card, but will indicate a column and read a question from one of five question cards. If you know the answer and have the answer on your card, then you cover that square. For instance, the moderator might say: &quot;Column A. Who killed Goliath?&quot; If you have David in your card's Column A, you would cover it. The free square is known in this game as &quot;Free Salvation by Jesus.&quot; The first player to complete a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row calls out &quot;Amen!&quot; and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
