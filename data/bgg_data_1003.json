To start the 36 tiles are placed, face-up on the middle 36 spaces of the Board.  Once completed the central 4 tiles are removed an placed, randomly, on the four corners of the board.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to move tiles around the board in order to make a recognized mathematical pattern of 4 tiles - a Trope.  &#10;A Trope can be orthogonal or diagonal and the tiles within a Trope must form a connected line of adjacent tiles.  In an orthogonal Trope tiles will share a side. In a diagonal Trope tiles will share a corner.&#10;&#10;The numbers within a Trope must be in line in ascending or descending Order so for instance you could have 1, 2, 3, 4 or 4, 3, 2, 1 but not 2, 3, 1, 4 or 4, 2, 1, 3&#10;&#10;Types of Trope are:&#10;Consecutive Run --- (Four Consecutive Numbers) - Example: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8, 9, 10, 11&#10;Multiples Run --- Example: 3, 6, 9, 12 or 8, 12, 16,20&#10;Irregular Repeating Run--- Example: 4, 7, 10, 13 or 13, 17, 21,2 5&#10;Plus 1 Plus 2 Plus 3 Run--- Example: 16, 17, 19, 22&#10;Prime Number Run--- (Must be consecutive Primes) - Example: 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7, 11, 13, 17 or 23, 29, 31, 33&#10;Power Run--- Example: 1, 2, 4, 8 or 4, 8, 16, 32 or 1, 3, 9, 27&#10;Squares Run--- Example: 1, 4, 9, 16 or 9, 16, 25, 36&#10;Triangular Run--- Example: 1, 3, 6, 10 or 6, 10, 15, 21 or 15, 21, 28, 36&#10;Fibonacci Run--- Example: 1, 2, 3, 5 or 3, 5, 8, 13 or 8, 13, 21, 34&#10;&#10;Players take turns to play. &#10;On your turn you may move 1 tile.

The suits dictate an action: run involves drawing cards, jump involves returning a card to their deck, and box forces their opponent to discard a card.  The numbers dictate a penalty number of cards to draw if the player cannot follow the previous play.&#10;&#10;Game play focuses on managing the number of cards in your hand and in your deck so that you always have an option for your next turn.  If you ever get into a situation where you are unable to complete an action, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

This player will evenly deal out all phrase cards face down in a pile, in front of each player.  &#10;The storyteller will then begin reading the narrative provided in the pamphlet.  &#10;During the story, the reader pauses at each blank line shown in the tale.  On this pause, players take turns quickly filling in the blanks by reading a phrase from their cards.  The game is over when the story is completed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The SHOT &amp; SHELL BATTLE SERIES recreates battles fought during the mid-nineteenth century at the brigade level. Each brigade is represented by an ID counter and several Step Counters so as to model the gradual attrition of combat strength over the course of a day's fighting. Divisions are Activated in alternating impulses, with each Activation (or Elimination) degrading its ability to activate and coordinate with your other Divisions. The game is of moderate complexity, with five kinds of combat and three kinds of Intrenchments, but play is quick and relatively streamlined.&#10;&#10;The first game in the series, SEVEN PINES; OR, FAIR OAKS, recreates the actions fought on May 31 and June 1 of 1862 during the American Civil War. A complex Confederate battle plan hatched by Joseph E. Johnston that called for coordinated flank attacks devolved into an unsupported frontal assault, resulting in the largest battle of the war up until that time, and one of the bloodiest. Beyond the historical scenario, there are scenarios which allow players to explore the feasibility of Johnston's actual plan, as well as what might have resulted had he been opposed by a more aggressive Union general than George B. McClellan.&#10;&#10;There are special rules for crossing a swollen river over a soon-to-be-collapsed bridge, the strange case of General Casey's Division (whose conduct was either heroic or disgraceful, depending on who you were talking to), and the command confusion that beset both sides. But at its heart, it is a simple and straightforward game that provides an excellent opportunity to explore this exciting new system.&#10;&#10;The 22x17in hex map is set to a 250-300 yards per hex scale, with turns taking half an hour each.&#10;&#10;",

Their combo play comes from layering AOEs and generating huge areas of danger across the pitch.&#10;&#10;They are quick on their feet and capable with the ball, but not as resilient in combat as other teams. They excel in the early to mid-game due to their ability to cover a good amount of space.&#10;&#10;Alchemists will reward players who can anticipate their opponent&rsquo;s plans and block them through good placement and positioning of models and effects. On offense, Alchemists can use their AOEs almost as additional models in order to restrict the counter play options of their opponent. No one wants to charge the Alchemist with the ball if you have to go through an acid cloud!&#10;&#10;What nature provides, man can improve. The Alchemists know this well and it is reflected in the scientific marvels they bring to the Guild Ball pitch. Watching the Alchemists play is part carnival, part fireworks, part illusion. The crowds cheer in awe at the visual spectacle as fireballs, smoke clouds, and slick oils dominate the field of play, delighting the children, decimating the opposition.&#10;&#10;Flexibility is the watchword of an Alchemist's Guild coach. In Midas, Calculus, and Mercury you have all the ingredients for the purest of alloys, a team that can be much greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you are blinding the enemy with oil or turning them into little more than human candles, the Alchemists will always have a response to any play; their vast knowledge putting them one step ahead of the rest of the pack with every kick of the ball.&#10;&#10;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Alchemist's Guild.&#10;&#10;",

They excel in the mid-game, once all the pieces are in place they can control the pitch while pinging the ball around their opponent.&#10;&#10;In the Engineer's Guild you witness first-hand the evolution of Guild Ball. Bringing a whole new definition to &quot;technical play,&quot; the Engineers are not afraid to push the boundaries, using new mechanica to give them the edge on the pitch. Some consider the ranged weaponry of the Guild to be an affront to the grand traditions of the game; other more knowledgeable observers realize they bear witness to the future of Guild Ball.&#10;&#10;Mastering the Engineers is an exercise in synergy; comfortable on the ball, they are the consummate masters of possession play. Opponents will find themselves held at arms' length; trying to pick their way through Ballista's deadly minefield and Salvo's rain of crossbow bolts just to watch Velocity accelerate away with the precision and power only a machine can achieve.&#10;&#10;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Engineer's Guild.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Fisherman play style is all about movement and raw goal-scoring potential. They are dominant in the early game and can easily draw one or two goals ahead very quickly. However, mid to late game they need to be wary, especially if they lose a player or two.&#10;&#10;They excel at movement and kicking the ball - they are practically all about offense. Their combo play revolves around (re)positioning and exploitation of space.&#10;&#10;Whilst not entirely equipped with raw damage soaking defence, they instead have far subtler defensive options that focus much more on space control.&#10;&#10;They call it the beautiful game for a reason. When the Fishermen take to the pitch, the crowd holds its breath, waiting for that sublime moment of skill; the perfectly measured pass, the volley that ricochets off the goal, the poetry in motion that is a team operating in perfect harmony.&#10;&#10;Playing with the Fishermen's Guild is like mastering the use of a surgical tool. With lightening speed and a penchant for subterfuge, the opposition are left baffled by the wide range of tricks available to a Fishermen's Guild team. With a superstar captain in Shark, a striker beyond compare in Angel, and the mysterious machinations of Siren, Fishermen players can leave their lumbering opponents grasping at air.&#10;&#10;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Fisherman&rsquo;s Guild.&#10;&#10;",

The Morticians may not have a lot of class but it feels like they have been peddling their peculiar mix of malice and tradition forever.

The outer loop also has spaces where players take either &quot;Circumstance&quot; cards or &quot;Cruel, Cruel World&quot; cards, as well as Transaction Post spaces where players can trade points with each other. Both sets of cards have good and bad outcomes, and most result in &quot;universal&quot; point gains or losses, where the player may choose which value to change.&#10;&#10;Each player has a thick scoreboard with pegs that all start at zero for each Value. The pegs move +/-1 for blue and red spaces on the outer ring, and +/-2 in the loops. The winner is the first player to achieve a balanced life by having the pegs in all eight values on his board line up vertically on the plus side of the scoreboard (all at +1, all at +2 or all at +3).&#10;&#10;",

Players set up freely on their side of the board and than move them one at a time to attack opposing pieces and eventually capture the enemy flag piece.&#10;&#10;Each side has 33 pieces, ranging in value from 11 (Scharfshutze or Sharpshooter) to 1 (Feldmarschall or Field Marshal). In general, the lower value beats the higher value, with equal values causing mutual destruction. However, the Scharfshutze kills the Feldmarschall while losing to everything else, and Mines kill anything that attacks them, but cannot move or attack.&#10;&#10;",

He knows how to use his sword, that&rsquo;s for certain, especially in carving a mighty exit. He earned his sword and spurs in a peaceful time, and was content to sit guard at his Lord&rsquo;s castle, making sure no errant peasants wandered through the long-since-rusted-open gates. But then the zombies came. And Brave Sir Montalban fought his way all the way through a retreat. He&rsquo;s a good man to have at your back in a fight &ndash; especially to carve your escape.&#10;&#10;Bob is a wizard of limited magical skills and great theatricality. He learned when he was young that sleight-of-hand and misdirection would go a great distance when scholarly learning and magical talent failed. As such, he has dressed the role and carried on in the manner of a great magician, while much of what he does is not magic at all. On the other hand, he&rsquo;s quite good at small fire spells, and, if you make sure the zombies aren&rsquo;t shambling towards anything important (like the church, or a haymow), fire does a world of good against the creatures.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lying forgotten in the Desert of Bones, the ruins of the spectacular ancient city Shadespire are brimming with untold riches and power, ripe for the taking. Though it is now a mere skeleton after being put to the torch by Nagash, the city's treasures remain, a morbid hint at the splendour that existed before Shadespire&rsquo;s soul was torn away&hellip;&#10;&#10;Take command of a small warband of warriors and put your skill, wit and determination to the test with Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Skirmish: a book containing the information and rules needed to fight Skirmish battles &ndash; including a hard-fought campaign amidst the ruins of Shadespire! Assemble a small warband of single models and take to the gaming table, building renown and adding to your warband with every glorious victory.&#10;&#10;Within this 40-page softback book, you&rsquo;ll find:&#10;&#10;Skirmish Rules&#10;&#10;- A set of simple modifications for the core rules of Warhammer Age of Sigmar that introduce skirmish battles &ndash; small-scale, intense fights between anything from a trio of models to a marauding band of fifteen models and upwards;&#10;- Details of battling in skirmish formation &ndash; models fight as individuals, rather than groups, meaning each model is treated as a single unit. This alters the way certain effects and abilities work in a subtle way, and emphasises fast, aggressive, tactical gameplay;&#10;- The General: each player chooses a general from the Heroes in their warband, who can use a command ability, artefact of power, and three new wizard spells from the tables supplied in the Skirmish rules;&#10;- Battleshock: again, tweaked from the core Warhammer Age of Sigmar rules to encourage fast, brutal gaming, Battleshock can turn the tide of war in a single dice roll &ndash; you better hope your general is stoic in the face of slaughter!&#10;- All-new command abilities, artefacts of power and mysterious terrain rules;&#10;- Clarification regarding summoning and generation of extra attacks and hit rolls in Skirmish games.&#10;&#10;The Shadespire Campaign&#10;&#10;Included in the book is a linear narrative campaign, pitting two - or with some judicious tweaking, more &ndash; players against each other in a series of brutal skirmishes as your warbands fight bitterly over the incredible treasures of Shadespire. This campaign comprises six Battleplans representing a story from the murky dawn of your warbands&rsquo; first day on the outskirts of Shadespire, through to the climactic battle that decides the outcome of the whole campaign.&#10;&#10;Between games, your warbands can earn and spend renown &ndash; the more renown earned, the more glory-seekers will join your general on his quest for treasure &ndash; and discover Rewards of Battle: charms, glyphs and relics that enhance the abilities of your warband in new and interesting ways.&#10;&#10;Skirmish Matched Play&#10;&#10;The true test of a general&rsquo;s mettle is the meeting of equally-matched warbands, where tactics and strategy outweigh sheer numbers when deciding how the battle ends. This book contains a guide to putting together your own Matched Play Skirmish battles, with included points values allowing you to assemble matched warbands from models representing each of the four Grand Alliances. Any Battleplan from the General&rsquo;s Handbook can be used in a Skirmish Matched Play game.&#10;&#10;Please note, you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the Warhammer Age of Sigmar core rules (available as a free download) to use this book.&#10;&#10;",

Bhaloidam is a modern expression of three timeless cultural forces: bha to tell, loid to play, and dam the tribe. In other words, Bhaloidam is where Story, Play, and Community come together.&#10;&#10;Bhaloidam is an indie tabletop game from Zakelro! that is an open and accessible storytelling platform. With it you'll spin character-driven stories and weave them together with the stories of your friends. You'll exert your influence upon the storyworlds you create together, shaping its future and controlling your characters' destinies as you perform their successes and their failures.&#10;&#10;Story&#10;&#10;Bhaloidam can be used to build any type of storyworld you and your friends want to explore. Sail the high seas as vicious pirates, uncover inter-dimensional conspiracies as government agents, solve murder mysteries as retired librarians, or scheme for power as members of the Elizabethan court.&#10;&#10;Bhaloidam&rsquo;s rules free you from context-specific actions, so your stories don&rsquo;t need to revolve around combat, or even conflict. You can find yourself rolling the dice and using the rules to determine the outcome of a conversation, the impact of a musical performance, the success of a cunning plan, or any other action you wish to perform. This works because Bhaloidam provides you with thematic ways of Influencing the world and characters around you, and these Influences can be interpreted differently depending on the needs of the story and of your character.&#10;&#10;This empowers a Skein (group of storytellers) to explore deeply personal stories together. And because each Spinner (storyteller) is in complete control of their character, they are encouraged to interpret their failures in ways that advance the story and provide opportunities for character growth.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;The rules of Bhaloidam are powerful and flexible, but they are also intuitive enough that new players--young or old--can learn them and start spinning stories within 45 minutes. Through the use of iconic visuals we are even able to represent every game rule you need to remember on the Lifewheel itself. Each storyteller uses one of these colorful gameboards to keep track of their characters&rsquo; influence upon the storyworld, and the storyworld&rsquo;s influence upon their character.&#10;&#10;Community&#10;&#10;Bhaloidam can serve as a Spinner-only platform, meaning everyone has equal influence upon the story. But it can also serve a more traditional approach, wherein one person takes on the responsibility of creating the storyworld, writing the plot, and acting as final authority on the interpretation of the rules. We call this role the Weaver and encourage you to see this role as a support position rather than an authoritative one, helping the Skein spin the best possible story threads they can and weaving them into a compelling tapestry.&#10;&#10;Bhaloidam is also a flexible and scalable platform you can build on. The clear and consistent rules serve as a solid base that you can add to as needed for your storyworld.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Objective of the game&#10;&#10;This  is a game to practice languages while a story is created among the players.&#10;&#10;Vocabulary Cards&#10;&#10;There are vocabulary cards of different colours with words in one foreign language. The cards are classified as pronouns, nouns, adjectives, infinitive verbs, adverbs, and prepositions + conjunctions (in the same group). In each cards there are 6 words numbered from 1 to 6. (There are two possibilities: a game of 900 words (150 vocabulary cards) and a game of 1500 (250 vocabulary cards) words) &#10;There are also TWO dice with six faces&#10;Each player must take one card from each group. Then he rolls the dice for to determinate the number of cards that he can substitute by the word he chose. Then for the others cards, he rolls again the dice and take the word that correspond at number given by the dice. &#10;There is the possibility of using both dices for two determinate the verbal tense used in the sentence. From 1 to 12, each number correspond at one of the most used verbal tens.&#10; Using all these words the player must make one or several sentences in a foreign language, say it out loud and write it in a notebook. You can also leave the sentences sketchy so that the next player finishes them in turn. The cards that have not been used remain for the next turn. The cards used return to the deck.&#10;You can use the words that are already written in the the notebook&#10;If a player has made mistakes, it can be corrected by another player. As a penalty, he will receive from the player that corrected him, one vocabulary card for each mistakes made.&#10;If a player does not understand some words he has picked up or a phrase constructed by another player, he should ask. The answer will be given with gestures or an explanation in the foreign language. The one giving the explanation will give to the other player two vocabulary cards.&#10;Vocabulary cards can be exchanged between players. The player says &quot;exchange&quot; and the cards are placed face up on the table.&#10;Ways to discard vocabulary cards&#10;If an error is made by a player, he receive one card for each mistake.&#10;If an explanation is given, two cards are given&#10;If you sing a song or recite a poem of at least four verses without making a mistake, the player can discard three vocabulary cards. For every mistake, a card is retained.&#10;If the player tells a story, gives a lesson, or a talk, he gets rid of a number of cards equivalent to the minutes that the oral presentation lasted. The other players give him a score between 1 to 10. The player  is allowed to discard the score multiplied by the number of minutes spoken divided by ten.&#10;When a player has  discarded  all his vocabulary cards he moves to the second level.&#10;Text cards&#10;In the second level you play with the text cards. There are 45. In the cards there are indications of the type: &#10;&#10;    introduce a fantastic character &#10;    introduce a key discovery&#10;    enter an internal dialogue &#10;    a leap in time&#10;    describe a house &#10;    describe a city &#10;&#10;&#10; *Introduce a metaphor &#10;&#10;    Introduce a comparison &#10;&#10;&#10;*Introduce a hyperbole ... &#10;There is also a letter that says:&quot; the manuscript has been lost, you must rewrite the story &quot;. And another that says: &quot;write the ending&quot;. When this card comes out, the story is finish and the game is over.&#10;There are 9 wildcards to write paragraphs of text freely.&#10;If the player make mistakes, he will retake vocabulary cards, one for each mistake, and he will  return to the first level where the sentences are constructed.&#10;Who wins&#10;The player that has used all the cards or has less than the others.&#10;There must be among the players a native speaker or teacher of the language, in order to correct the mistakes.&#10;You can consult books of grammar and conjugation&#10;You can choose a winner in creativity&#10;The one who wins has to read the story.&#10;&#10;Of course you can practice your own language and use the game just to make up stories&#10; The game is appropriate for player ages 8 to 90.&#10;You can make two different games; one with the vocabulary cards and the other with the text cards. If you play only with the vocabulary cards, then the winner will be the one who gets rid of the cards first. If you play with the text cards, the winner is the one who makes the least mistakes. For each mistake five points are subtracted and 20 are added if there are no mistakes.&#10;&#10;",

Utilize state of the art technology and powerful spells to establish dominance over all who oppose you.  3rd Edict is designed for 3-6 players and takes around 30-60 minutes per game. Players draw from a central deck and use unique abilities to shape their play style.&#10;&#10;Throw a fireball to Scorch your enemies or Redirect and turn their attacks back on them.  Take what you desire with Pickpocket.  Barrier protects a player from all sources, including themselves.  Equipment like Drone Guardian forces your opponents to deal with it before they can attack you.  The Bag of Many Things means you will have more options than everyone else.&#10;&#10;With eight game types, players will find a battle that works for them.  In First Blood the first player to get a kill wins the game, just make sure you don't overextend.  Recruitment has you destroy each other but instead of being eliminated that player joins your team instead.  Secret Win Conditions is just that.  Each player draws a mission at random and whoever completes it first wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chasing Eden is a custom scenario for the Time Stories boardgame.&#10;&#10;&quot;Times were very different before The Great Peace and the founding of The Time Agency. A powerful government hierarchy wrestled with outlaws and criminal gangs that refused to be quashed. The law was unrelenting and the streets were heavily policed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Will your team survive this cyberpunk adventure? Chasing Eden is driven by its simple storytelling and evocative artwork set during the founding of the Time Agency. Good luck solving this mystery, and please send through any feedback you might have!&#10;&#10;EDIT: Thanks to all who have played the game and left their feedback!&#10;&#10;For those interested, I should have given some greater detail in the original upload. A large part of the inspiration was the movie &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, where the character is forced to repeat the same day (learning something new each time) until he finds the path forward. Admittedly, when I've played other Time Stories scenarios my aim has always been to finish while hopefully not having to repeat the mission, but that is largely because Bob is so cranky :P&#10;&#10;I wanted my story to have things that you need to pay attention to on the first run (e.g. how to make money, how to save/gain time, how to become badass enough to win the boss-fight, and what receptacle characters are integral to the story). And for the keen of eye, there are various clues around for the various &quot;vital&quot; decisions. The scenario only has a couple of smaller &quot;puzzles&quot; - the greatest puzzle I wanted to make was the actual progression of the story!&#10;&#10;",
