The main objective is to make it to the bottom of the Event deck with everyone mostly intact. (The GinGee Gang Gang friends are here to have a good time at this concert after all)&#10;&#10;Gameplay (In Brief):&#10;After determining who amongst the players is the &quot;Angry Friend&quot;, it is their responsibility to keep track of time/rounds and the number of explosions. Once Meeting Time is decided amongst the group, and the Travel Time is set to be an hour prior (Travel Time is flexible depending on play group). Players are then assigned one of six GinGee Gang Gang friends to play as and collects the necessary items for their hand (ex: Character Board, Character ID card and stand, 3 Snack Tokens unless the player plays as Brie, they get 4 Snack tokens, and 3 Disruption Cards).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to reach the bottom of the Event Deck without Travel Time catching to Meeting Time, and/or hitting 10 cumulative explosions.&#10;&#10;Players have 3 actions where they:&#10;&#10;     Draw an event then react accordingly (ex: Lose/Gain # of Rage, Gain a Snack Token, Add 5 minutes to Travel Time, etc.)&#10;     Draw a Chat card, roll a dice, then apply effects to the group or individuals specified (ex: Lose/Gain # of Rage)&#10;     A choice between eating 1 Snack (which helps diminish Rage) or Do Nothing&#10;&#10;&#10;Teamwork, planning, looking out for one another, and a little bit of luck will help reaching the bottom of the Event deck with everyone mostly intact. Players should try their best to prevent themselves and each other from raging and exploding!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

No jumping!&#10;&#10;Things can change quickly; think ahead to your next move because your opponent may just slide into a winning position right under your nose!

    "Description": "1,000,000,000 years ago&hellip;&#10;Mars was a flourishing planet teaming with life and vast seas. As the magnetic field over Mars was weakened, radiation began to dry up the seas and solar winds caused the atmosphere to deplete. As the atmosphere depleted, the planet&rsquo;s ability to maintain heat decreased as well. As the millennia passed and the natural resources began to run low, the dwindling civilizations of Mars were forced to follow the rapidly shrinking seas. &#10;There is just one natural water source left, and not enough of it for everyone. In an increasingly harsh environment, the few remaining races of Mars struggle for survival.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Players will each represent a leader of one of the six remaining races of ancient Mars. Their goal is to claim the only remaining fertile land as their own and preserve it for as long as possible. At the start of the game players can take one action in each of three categories (political, civil, and military). As the game progresses, players will expand their influence, allowing additional actions of each type. Players will use their actions to gather resources, build atmosphere factories to slow the depletion of oxygen, and train armies to fend off the other races. Each race is equipped with unique abilities allowing for various approaches to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Manipulate fashion trends in Trend Color to come out on top!&#10;&#10;In the game, you secretly start with two colors (out of eight), and you want those colors to end up trending or (alternatively) be rare and hard to find so that you can score the most points with them. At the start of the game, you'll set up a trend board with 1-8 different color tokens, with spaces for those colors being paired in lines. If you end up with five tokens on the board, for example, two of those colors will be paired, while the other three will be next to blank spaces; those three colors might be paired with something over the five rounds of the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, you fill up the shop card display so that it contains five cards; each card has room for 2-5 color tokens. On a turn, you draw a color token from the bag, then place it on one of the available shop cards. If you fill the final space, you claim the card, place 1-3 of these tokens on the trend board (placing an unrepresented color in a new row and matching other tokens that already have their color present), keeping the remaining tokens as your earnings, then exiting the round. If you're the first player out in a round, you score bonus points.&#10;&#10;If you place the fifth token of a color on the trend board, you decide whether to remove all tokens of that color or keep them where they are. If you remove them, a player can add that color to the trend board again in the future, possibly in a different row.&#10;&#10;Once all players have a shop card, the round ends, then you refill the shop card area (leaving the lone card there in place with any tokens on it) and begin a new round. After the fifth round, the game ends and players score points: Tokens of the two colors that appear in the longest line on the trend board are worth 3 points each; tokens of the two colors in the second-longest line are worth 2 points each, in the third-longest line 1 point each, and in the shortest line 0 points each. If a color isn't present on the trend board, those tokens are worth 2 points each. Tokens of the same color as your two secret color cards are worth twice as many points as they would be otherwise. Add points for your token earnings to any bonus points you received. Whoever has the highest score has dominated the trends and wins!&#10;&#10;",

These you can play in any order, controlling your bounces.  Once you are out of chips, you then start drawing a chip at a time from the bag, making your bounces unpredictable.

Drawing inspiration from Mahou Shoujo and other anime, you get to take on the role of a teenager forced to balance school, living your normal life, and saving the world from destruction at the hands of the Dark Knights and their monstrous allies.&#10;&#10;Each game you generate a character from an Ability and a Source of your power. You can then even coordinate with others to get a costume that synergizes to give you that extra edge in combat. Each of you needs to balance your Grades, Skill, and Fun, with bonuses for getting them high and terrible ramifications of them getting too low. You're going to need teamwork and friendship to have a chance!&#10;&#10;Each week you start your plan of what you'll be doing, only for Events to arise partway through planning, potentially interrupting your plans. Manage your resources, plan for the unexpected, and prepare yourself to do battle against the dreaded enemies.&#10;&#10;The Monsters, Events, Magical Girl Abilities and Sources, and the Dark Knights are randomized every time you play, allowing for countless possibilities!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Train availability, tile&#10;availability, and game end work on a fixed schedule, similar to 18CZ except the round also determines train/tile as well as when stock/operating rounds/end game occur.&#10;&#10;For the first 3 rounds there is one city available per player to start a company in. It works a lot like the minor companies in 1822 where you can see that cities 4, 8, 12 are available in the first round (for a 3 player game), 1, 11, 20 are available in round 2, and 9, 14, 18 are available in round 3. The starting locations are auctioned by highest bid with the bid being discarded to the bank and then the player chooses the starting share price after winning the bid. Players can only start one company each in each of the first 3 rounds, so once you win a bid for a starting location you cannot compete in the other auctions this round. Thus the last player gets the final starting location for $0 without an auction. After the first 3 stock rounds, new companies can be started in any city with an open station circle (after winning the auction for the starting location) and players can start more than one company in a given stock round.&#10;&#10;There is also one randomly picked private company available per player for the first 3 rounds. The private companies are auctioned and count as capital toward starting a company like in 1817. Unlike the starting city locations, players can win more than one bid for the private companies. Some of the private companies produce revenue each round (unlike 1817) so it sometimes make sense to hold a private company for a few rounds before using it to start a company.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple train types each in limited supply. You can buy hex trains (which are good for running to multiple cities right by each other), freight trains (which pick up coal and can run to the off map areas), passenger trains (+10 revenue into the company per city), plus trains (get to run one extra time before rusting), or advanced trains (run the turn they are purchased). The price of the older trains drop each round (you can buy a 2 freight train for $120 in the first operating round, $90 in round 2, or $60 in round 3).&#10;&#10;You have the 2/5/10 share system similar to 1817, including mergers. Companies can take loans similar to 1817 except the loan market is not shared, instead the loan interest rate is driven based on which operating round it is. You have the option when doing 5 share mergers to add share values together instead of averaging as in 1817 (receiving 3 shares instead of 6) to recapitalize a company.&#10;&#10;President shares can be sold to the market and companies then liquidate at the end of the stock round if no other player buys the president share. Trains can only be purchased between companies for full price for a current phase train of 1/2 price for a non current train. The shorting features from 1817 were not included in 1888 for obvious reasons as well as to simply the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes in the 4 to 5 hour range and is intended to be a fun &amp; easy game to play. The goal is simply to maximize your net worth at the end by running trains for as much as possible, driving up their share price, and then dumping the companies right before their trains rust. Players can't go bankrupt because they can just dump companies in bad financial health and companies which cannot buy a train will just die (no presidential liability).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ignite is a fast-paced game where you race to destroy opposing forges by commanding your minions to ignite, attack, and combo your way to victory!&#10;&#10;As the Forgemaster, your task is to construct a powerful lineup to destroy the enemy's Forge. When your Forge takes damage, remove that many cards from the top of your Forge, placing them into your Scrapheap. Once an empty Forge takes damage, it's destroyed and that player loses the game.&#10;&#10;Your Forge consists of 30 Minion cards, which behave like most monsters in games in the TCG/CCG genre: they have cost, attack, and health values, and can attack each other or a &quot;life total&quot; (an opposing forge). The playboard features a place for the players deck (Forge), destroyed minions (Scrapheap), Energy used to summon minions, and summoned minions (Lineup). The core mechanic of the game is Ignite: all Bot cards Ignite. When a Bot Ignites, players roll the two Ignite Dice (d6) to determine which target is hit and for how much. The Bot has Ignite Values, displayed on the bottom in three flames, which display how much damage is caused by the explosion.&#10;&#10;There are two parts of the turn: Attacking and Building. During Attacking, players can attack with any number of their Minions against any opposing Minion or Forge. If there is a Forge Guardian (minion on slot 1), that Minion must be attacked and destroyed first. The second part of the turn is Building, where players can spend Energy to summon Minions, or draw cards. Players start their turns with 4 Energy, with the first turn of the game starting with only 2 (2 player only), and players start the game with 5 cards in their hands. Minions typically have one of two abilities: Summon or Scrap abilities, which occur when the minion is Summoned or Destroyed respectively. The deck is full of Bots which Ignite, and Forgelings, which can be combined with them to Ignite more often or power up Ignite abilities. For 3+ player games, player sit in a circle, play proceeds clockwise, you can only attack adjacent players, and Ignites hit both adjacent players! To start, simply place your shuffled Forge on your game board, along with 4 energy, then draw 5 cards.&#10;&#10;For more you can find the website at https://ignite.cards/ and the rules at rules.ignite.cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You play an IT project manager responsible for a project team. You recruit and train project members, assign them to development and test tasks, and deliver against time, cost and quality budgets. The game can be used to teach project management but also works without its theme as an economic engine game.&#10;&#10;Your tasks earn you victory points. The more you comply with the specific project budgets and priorities, the higher the multiplier. When a number of projects equal to the number of players have been delivered, the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of a tableau of project cards and a tableau of steering group cards. The players take turns to perform one of the following tasks:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Recruit: Take one project member card.&#10;     Train: Flip one project member card to its senior face.&#10;     Assign: Assign a project member to a project.&#10;         The project member gets an &rdquo;achievement&rdquo; depending on the contribution to the project (time, cost or quality).&#10;        The project gets a &rdquo;budget post&rdquo; (time or cost).&#10;    &#10;     Report status: Return all assigned project members. Then place a &rdquo;seat&quot; between two steering group cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once all seats around a steering group card are full, the player may call for a go/nogo meeting at a project. If approved, the project is scored and the player with achievements in it earn victory points depending on three factors:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The quality of the project (the number of bug free tasks).&#10;     The budget compliance (actuals vs budgets for time, cost and quality).&#10;     The steering group priorities (multipliers for time, cost and quality).&#10;&#10;&#10;The challenge of Find the Bug! - Project is to build a team that is best suited for the tasks while also manipulate the steering group priorities to earn the most victory points.&#10;&#10;The unique mechanism of Find the Bug! - Project is the tight interaction between all players. They all operate on the same projects and steering groups where one player&rsquo;s achievement may ruin another player&rsquo;s budget, and where even the right achievement may be ignored by the wrong steering group.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Pure whiskies (blue, red and yellow) can be bought for 1-3 pounds, mixed into blended whiskies (green, orange, purple, and black) and sold for 4-6 pounds. The whisky is sold and bought by whisky barons. Each whisky baron has a random line of dies, telling their preferred colors and prices.&#10;&#10;The city of Dyce contains 5x5 spaces. Take turns to place up to two items in any empty spaces.&#10;&#10;&#10;     An empty shop for the cost of 1 pound.&#10;     A colored cube, telling what you want to buy/sell in your shop.&#10;     A white cube for the cost of 1 pound, making your shop more attractive to the whisky barons.&#10;&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&#10;When all players have passed, each whisky baron moves 1 space closer to the shop that buys or sells a preferred whisky (or, in case of a tie, the shop with the most white cubes). When a whisky baron reaches a shop, the owner buys or sells according to the current die value and the whisky baron draws and rolls a new die.&#10;&#10;The game ends after six rounds, in which at least 1 blended whisky was sold.&#10;&#10;The die lines simulates a random yet predictable market for the players to engage in. This adds both a time element and a spatial element to the game.

    "Description": "The fate of Ancient China is at stake as several dynasties struggle for supremacy. As a leader of a dynasty, you must position your forces at the right time at the right state to claim it for yourself.&#10;&#10;The Ancient China consists of 12 states, each of them surrounded by six grid points where armies may be placed. Some grid points border several states, hence making their armies more powerful. You claim a state if you have the most armies at the end of a round. You win if you claim 3/4/5 states (5/4/3 players).&#10;&#10;Each round you compete for a state You do so by playing cards representing either two tactics (light) or one tactics (dark). Each card also represents one strategy. One light card may be played each turn together with none or one dark card. Each card played must match either a tactics or a strategy of your previously played light card.&#10;&#10;When you pass you take the battle field of all tactics and strategies where you have a majority. Tactical battle field cards let you place new armies while strategic cards let you manipulate already placed armies. Also, an early pass gives you an early pick of new cards from a drawing row. However, it makes the remaining battle field cards easier to get for the other players.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;When the round ends, you claim the state if you have the most armies around it. Also, all previous states are reassessed to see if the majority has changed. (Remember that an army may reach more states.) One of the battle field cards allows you to decide the next state to battle for to take advantage of well positioned armies.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of playing the right cards and placing the armies right creates a double majority game where you must manage both cards and board to get the upper hand. Also, the fact that armies may reach more states may turn tactical losses at one state to a strategic victory as other states are claimed instead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Failure to do both steps in a turn means defeat. If all pieces are used up, the extremes of the lines of play are used to compute scores which will determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Players start with a hand of seven pieces; in each turn they draw one piece and play out two, so that the number of available pieces for each turn shrinks during the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players stack dice chosen by one of them and score points when the tower holds... or lose points if it collapses. The difficulty depends of course on the size of the die, but especially on the order in which it is placed and the tower on which it is placed. And these two conditions are dictated to the player by the face value of his die.&#10;&#10;The first player rolls the dice and chooses, following a few simple rules, which ones they will give to their opponents and to whom. The player who rolls first becomes the first player and, in turn, will try to score points and cause his opponents to fall by forcing them to try risky balances.&#10;&#10;",
