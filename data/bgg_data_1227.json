    "Description": "This game has been designed after extensive research on the Brexit process for my PhD. It aims at simulating as closely as possible while remaining a rather simple (yet big) boardgame the various power shifts that we saw in 2019. (A playtest held a few days before the 2019 general elections saw the Tories win an absolute majority and getting rid of their coalition with the DUP... just sayin')&#10;&#10;This is a political game focused on player interactions with half the game revolving around card play inspired by the Sun Tzu boardgame and the other half centered on players negotiating between them how they will vote on the Draft Bills proposed to the floor. It is a long and difficult game that requires a minimum of role playing as players take on specific parties' leadership with specific objectives. It is an asymetrical game where each player has a specific way of winning in order to show the various strategies deployed during 2019 by the real life parties.&#10;The first one is the campaign map. Players compete each turn to gain popularity in 21 constituencies by playing cards and comparing their values. (Similar to the Sun Tzu game's mechanic.) Having more popularity than others gives players a chance to increase their number of Members of Parliament once an election is held. But only the Prime Minister can call for an election, with a little push from the opposition if needed...&#10;&#10;The second battleground is parliament. Players propose Draft Bills to vote into the Brexit Deal. Those bills are policies that tackle Brexit-specific issues. Depending on how the issue is tackled and who proposed the bill, the Brexit Deal gets filled up with policies that grant Victory Points to players, or removes some. For that phase, players vote with all the might of their MPs in Parliament. This is why having an election at the right time can completely change the balance of power in the Westminster House of Commons, and change the face of Brexit as a whole !&#10;&#10;The final competition takes place around those two phases as players get to play Spin Cards, showing how their political teams spin events and control the political landscape.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Penny Dreadfun (Second Edition) is the new game set in Penny Dreadfun universe - made with new and exciting mechanics and art!&#10;&#10;Queen Victoria disappeared. Armed with a sword, two axes, throwing knives, and a pistol, she jumped out of the Buckingham&rsquo;s Palace window, straight into the darkness of the night. The rumours say that the queen was bored and decided to conquer a new colony &ndash; Hell itself. There must be something going on because London is getting quite&hellip; hot. And there are more and more infernal hounds around and no one to clean after them. And more infernal chasms&hellip; and portals&hellip; Whew!&#10;&#10;It sounds like a true adventure.&#10;&#10;Penny Dreadfun: Second Edition will take you to the year 1888, to Victorian England, full of occultism, British humour, and more or less historical characters. You play as one of many unusual heroes, who &ndash; driven by various motives &ndash; set off to the city to find the source of disaster and save the world,  which is becoming more and more taken over by forces of hell.&#10;&#10;Join The Adventure&#10;&#10;Action-packed adventure with British humour: Penny 2nd Edition offers various game modes &ndash; story driven campaign, co-op boss rush mode and an open world experience. All this takes place in the world of Penny Dreadfun &ndash; Victorian England full of geek jokes and crazy historical gags.&#10;But there&rsquo;s more &ndash; Joke&rsquo;s on You mechanic will blast you with humour&hellip; literally. This game will mess with you, or mess you up.&#10;&#10;Unique Game System&#10;&#10;Penny Dreadfun 2nd Edition is an adventure game where everything is based on your decisions thanks to the unique game system &ndash; create your custom hero class deck during the playthrough and use it well to move through London streets, fulfill quests, collect items and plot with encountered characters. Also the fights driven by the PD card system are simple, dynamic and they plays just like rolling dices but without randomness!&#10;&#10;New approach to move and board mechanics&#10;&#10;With each round the world known to us (or at least to those who are well over 120 years old) is getting more and more infernal. This will be reflected in the constantly changing board with playable 3D elements. That&rsquo;s a completely new take on the point-to-point move system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Well all that&rsquo;s about to change, as the &ldquo;Mighty&rdquo; Crud Creek Nosepickers have blasted down the barriers to bravely (or foolishly) pave the way for their diminutive kin. They're ready to flood the gridiron with a squirming, stinking wave of pint-sized players, along with all the zany contraptions and silly tricks they could dream up in their mushroom-addled brains.&#10;&#10;While Snotlings may make Halfling teams look downright athletic, and Goblins seem burly in comparison, what these little blighters have in spades is, well, lots more of themselves! They're so small and energetic, the refs can never keep count of how many are on the field at once! Their numerical advantage, combined with a willingness to bend and break the rules, makes them very unpredictable indeed. In short, Snotlings are all about the sort of wild shenanigans that make Blood Bowl an absolute pleasure to play. Not only are they fun, but they have some devious tricks that can actually win a game from time to time, quite literally keeping your opponent on their toes.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you'll need to build the Crud Creek Nosepickers, a Snotling team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 12 Snotlings, 2 Snotling Fungus Flingas, 2 Snotling Fun-Hoppas, 2 Snotling Stilty Runnas, and 2 Snotling Pump Wagons! You'll also find 2 turn counters, 2 coins, 4 Snotling-themed balls, 20x 25mm bases, and 2x 32mm bases with holes.&#10;&#10;-Key Features-&#10;Flood the field with scrappy underdogs&#10;Rush the pitch with Pump Wagons!&#10;Cheat to win, and have an absolute blas&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Air Forces help the players to defend Armies and Navies in the same space, or to attack adjacent Air Forces in battle.&#10;&#10;Another new key feature is the presence of new forces: Chinese and French forces, that enlarge and change the opening setup, introducing many new strategies. A new tactical point is introduced into the game through Bolster cards, a new type of cards that are played directly from the hand as reactions to game play. &ldquo;Last but not least&rdquo;, the introduction of new alternate &ldquo;what if&rdquo; cards, that represent historical strategies that were considered but never executed, as Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of Britain.&#10;&#10;With these important changes the game is still simple to learn and quick to setup, but these new tactical moves at player&rsquo;s disposal in this expansion set increase the fun and ensure a further and greater replayability!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mimigawa is a battle fought on 10 December 1578 between the &#197;&#140;tomo clan and Shimazu clans. It ended in a decisive Shimazu victory.&#10;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mimigawa&#10;&#10;In 1578, Sorin Otomo, who was the largest Sengoku Daimyo in Kyushu, protected Asahi Ito, who had lost Hyuga after the Shimazu invasion. In an attempt to recapture Hyuga and expand the power of Christianity, he attacked. Shimazu forces pushed forward the army of Otomo's army and crossed the Ogawa.&#10;&#10;Battle of Mimikawa is a wargame on the Shimazu vs. Otomo battle, also known as the Battle of Takashirogawa.&#10;&#10;This game adopts the chit driven system in which &quot;activating chits&quot; are assigned to each unit of both sides.

The French commander, General Jean-Baptiste Girard, was commanding the Magdeburg Garrison and had been asked to support Marshal Oudinot in his drive towards Berlin. He was faced by a mainly Landwehr force commanded by Prussian General Karl Friedrich von Hirschfeld and supported by the Cossack General Alexandr Chernyshev. The Prussians and the Russians were given the task of stopping Girard&rsquo;s French from joining Oudinot&rsquo;s army.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Hagelberg was a bitter battle, held on the same day as the Battle of Dresden. Though the casualties were high on both sides, the Coalition prevailed and stopped Girard from affecting a union of the French forces approaching Berlin.&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;1. Use the Premier Rules, with combat and fire charts, and markers from previous ME releases.&#10;2. First available on Marshal enterprise website as Print and Play.

You will find it's not easy to progress at times because of your opponent's movement and re-location of your pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player has three colored pieces with reversible faces to show their goal sign. Each player sets their three pieces, plain color up, on their three starting spaces. A turn is made by moving one of your pieces. Passing your turn isn't allowed.&#10;&#10;You can move any one of your pieces to an unoccupied space in any of eight directions (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). You may move a piece by jumping over any number of adjacent pieces, whether your own or an opponent's, onto a vacant space. When jumped, your pieces stay where they are, but opposing pieces must be relocated to a vacant space.&#10;&#10;Once a piece reaches the goal, you flip it over, and that piece is now immobile. You can't move it, and opposing players can't jump over it because it can't be relocated.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you haven't won and all of your starting spaces are occupied with pieces &mdash; whether yours or others &mdash; you are out of the game. If more than one player remains in the game, remove all of your pieces from the board. Continue the game to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;The first player to move their three pieces to the opposite side of the board or the last active player still in the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Cultists may be defeated by corresponding numerical combinations of dice. Horrors must be resolved first and require special dice combinations. An additional card is drawn for each Planetary Alignment that comes into play. Defeated cards serve as trophies that may be traded for artifacts and spells that improve the chances of success.&#10;&#10;The game ends if five Cultists of any suit come into play at the same time to summon an Elder God or you successfully play all cards in the deck while preventing this from happening.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has five flys, but only one of them in play at any time. If a fly gets eaten or catched the player starts with the next one. If a player gets a fly on the nose of the human figure in the center of the game board,he wins the game. Movement is determinet with a special fling die, a handle with three numbered discs (1-3 on the front side and a blank back) on a string.&#10;&#10;If a fly gets on a space with a frog it gets eaten. On a blue space the fly is caught by the human. If a fly gets on a red space it at once advances along the arrow to the next yellow space.&#10;&#10;If a player flings a 6 he shouts &quot;Quak Quak&quot;, flings again and moves a frog of his choice. If the frog lands on a fly, the fly gets eaten.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Saddam Moves South (SMS) is an operational level two player wargame covering a hypothetical Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia in 1990. The assumption here is that after the Iraqi army overran Kuwait in the first week of August 1990, Saddam Hussein continued the offensive to grab the vital oilfields of Saudi Arabia. In response, the United States leads a coalition of states to stop the Iraqis and then retake lost territories.&#10;&#10;The game system is based on that of Desert One War, which models ground, air and amphibious operations. For the Coalition, the central game system is Air Transport Points (ATP) which represent strategic airlift capability. The assumption is that the scenarios cover the opening stage of an intervention, before the US can mobilize full-scale sealift. Therefore, airlift will become the primary means for moving units into the theater and providing logistical support.&#10;&#10;The Iraqis are closer to their lines of communications, but their ability to conduct sustained offensives is restricted by planning and logistical considerations, modeled in the game by making the capture of certain objectives a prerequisite for sustaining their offensive. Another factor is that the decisive mobile campaign which the Coalition conducted in 1991 was in part the result of extensive preparation of the theater of operations via logistical buildup, intelligence and in-theater training during the period August 1990 to January 1991. The campaign in the game models the situation where the Coalition must build up in the face of a continuing Iraqi offensive.&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #339 Mar-Apr 2023&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3-10 days&#10;Hex: 21.75 miles / 35 kilometers&#10;Units: Group to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (228 9/16&quot; counters - with 4 blank counters included)&#10;One 16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;",
