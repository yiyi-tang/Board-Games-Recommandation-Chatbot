    "Description": "Stonewall Uprising is a two-player asymmetric deck-building game in which you play as either The Man or Pride, fighting for or against equal rights.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can either play a card from your hand or fold. Playing cards moves one of three tracks in the game; Systemic Support, Public Opinion, and Individual Support. Getting to the end of these tracks gives the side it lands on an immediate effect, and then resets it to the middle of the track. Folding allows you to take the value of your hand at the end of the round and gain new cards from your market, but be warned - once you have folded your opponent's cards are doubled in value! You will however get to draw a card for each card they play while you are folded, but will that be worth it?&#10;&#10;As the decades progress from the 1960s, to the 1970s, and finally to the 1980s, watch as your strategy and tactics stretch and morph based on the changing tides. Events can sway certain strategies, and the cards you're able to buy shift as the decades pass.&#10;&#10;The Man's goal is to detain and demoralize 10 people from Pride's deck to take the wind out of Pride's movement. Pride's goal is to shift the Overton Window and to organize protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins to sway the public, represented by their dice pool, to keep their movement's momentum going well past the 80s. The game ends immediately when either of these conditions have been met.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.&#10;&#10;Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Pawns must be placed beside another pawn, and all other figures must be placed behind a pawn.

As the last field battle of that campaign, however, it deserves closer study. Volume 10 in GMT&rsquo;s award-winning Battles of the American Revolution series by designer Mark Miklos provides such a much-needed analysis.&#10;&#10;The game includes three scenarios: the historical fight for Chatterton Hill, an October 31 scenario that explores what might have occurred if Howe had pressed his grand assault that day as planned, and a full four-day campaign game spanning 42 game turns beginning with the arrival of the British army on the field on the morning of October 28 and culminating at 5:00 pm on October 31.&#10;&#10;Each player has 26 Opportunity Cards subdivided into three decks to enhance play and add elements of variability and historical flavor. As with previous games in the series, some special rules represent the unique circumstances of this battle. Among these are rules governing American sortie restrictions and tactical doctrine, rain game turns, restoring army morale, scorched earth, and additional handicaps for American militia, American fieldwork construction, and an off-board movement mechanism for Tarrytown on the Hudson River, seven miles away where British ships lay at anchor. Even Washington&rsquo;s own combat prowess at this early stage of the war is randomized.&#10;&#10;In Volume 10 of the Battles of the American Revolution series, players command two titanic armies: Washington, desperate to salvage something from the otherwise disastrous defense of New York, and Howe seeking a coup de gr&acirc;ce against the &ldquo;Old Fox.&rdquo; You will have to manage your forces over the span of four days with lots of inclement weather to contend with. Can you, as General Howe, break through the American line to deliver a decisive blow and end the rebellion? Can you, as General Washington, hold your own on superior ground, hampered as you will be with some 6,700 militia of dubious quality&mdash;fully 46% of the total American force?&#10;&#10;",

During the game, you take over other Group cards. They are added to your Power Structure as your puppets - unless a rival takes them from you. You can use Plot cards to advance your own position or harass your opponents. You may win by controlling enough groups, or by fulfilling the special goal of your own Illuminati, or by meeting the objectives on a Goal card, or, of course, by crushing all of your rivals! Thus, you prove that YOU are the True Church, and the others are deluded posers. This is not a collectible card game. It is a stand-alone game that may be added to INWO or vice versa.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The English Civil Wars were actually a series of wars fought between the year 1642 and 1651 by the Parliamentarians and the Royalists. Battles of the English Civil War presents some of the key battles from the period 1642 to 1646, commonly known as the First English Civil War. In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds of men each, seeking to achieve various Objectives. The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 15 Battles can be played in around 20 to 40 minutes, and each one should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces.&#10;&#10;This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need at least 8, but preferably 10, standard six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This division, however, doesn't happen fairly, but according to the rules of the far west: The best armed (or the smartest) takes most of the booty.&#10;&#10;A player's turn takes place as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    You MAY change your caravan cards.&#10;    You MUST play one caravan card on a destination.&#10;    You MAY play a character card if you didn't before on this destination.&#10;    You MAY apply the effect of the caravan card.&#10;    You MAY buy one weapon.&#10;    You MAY assign weapons to one character.&#10;    You MUST draw cards to refill your hand of three caravan cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a destination is full, the sale takes place and the players get proceeds from the caravan cards based on the effects and values of the characters they've played, a value that could be increased by weapons. Then character cards are split as well.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the fourth sale triggers the end. At that point, the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tal der Abenteuer gives us a two-sided gameboard with an adventure on each side.  There are pawns in four colors, but players do not lay claim to them.  Instead, the players play cards capable of moving one of the pawns forward along the paths.  The paths diverge often, giving players a chance to send pawns on longer routes or to get them back onto shorter routes.  Getting a pawn to certain spaces rewards the player who moved it with gold, diamonds or additional cards (randomly assigned by face-down &quot;stepping-stone&quot; markers).&#10;&#10;Once a player moves a pawn onto the temple, the end-zone of the path, the first round ends.  That player gets 1 diamond.&#10;&#10;Next, the players are rewarded and/or penalized for the cards left in their hands, based on the zone the pawns have ended in.  A card for the pawn in the end zone (the one that ended the round) earns +3 gold, +2 for pawns in the second zone, +1 for those in the third, 0 for those in the fourth and -1 for those in the fifth.&#10;&#10;Now the board is flipped to the second side and a similar adventure embarked upon.  This second side has an additional feature: bridges that are destroyed after crossing, further complicating the choices about divergent paths.  At the end of the second side, when a pawn reaches the goal, diamonds are counted and the player with the most diamonds gets 12 gold and second-most gets 6 gold.  Cards remaining in hand are again paid off according to the zone the pawn of that color finished in.  The game ends after this final scoring, and the player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;Winner of Austrian Spiel der Spiele 2006.&#10;&#10;",

The focus is on the southern part of the South American continent: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, from the Wars of Independence starting in 1810 through the last naval war fought completely under sail between Argentina and Uruguay in 1841. These wars attracted naval officers recently unemployed&nbsp;by the end of the Napoleonic Wars as well as providing a proving ground for the first generation of naval heroes native to&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;America.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Updated rules introduce river and tidal currents, modified grounding rules for operations in the Rio de la Plata and Uruguay rivers, and the use of ship&rsquo;s boats to tow stranded or becalmed ships.&nbsp;In all, over&nbsp;two dozen&nbsp;battle scenarios ranging in size from a handful of ships per side, to full-blown fleet actions are presented. Also included is the return of the popular ship duel map and activation cards&nbsp;originally found in&nbsp;Serpents of the Seas&nbsp;(Flying Colors volume II),&nbsp;along&nbsp;with 18 ship duel scenarios.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Like the preceding volumes in the series,&nbsp;Under the Southern Cross&nbsp;is completely&nbsp;independent of, while being fully compatible with, the other volumes in the series.

The first cube of a company can be placed on any hex, while each subsequent cube for that company must be placed adjacent to another of the same color. Hexes (other than Atlanta) can have 1-3 cubes placed on them, and when a cube is placed in a city &mdash; with cities coming in four colors &mdash; that railroad's revenue increases by $1-4 depending on the color of the city.&#10;&#10;When the tenth cube of a company is placed, railroads earn points based on certain criteria &mdash; highest revenue, fewest shares owned, most cubes on the map, and most cities of a color in its network &mdash; with ties resulting in no points being awarded for a category. (If, for example, both the purple and black railroads have the most red cities in their networks, then no railroad scores the points for having the most red cities in its network.) Each player then scores points equal to the points scored by the railroads in which they have stock.&#10;&#10;Player order is then reassigned, and players get to select an additional stock after which they again take turns placing cubes on the board. After the fourth scoring round, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;GIVE US VICTORIES&quot; is a wargame about the Chancellorsville campaign, fought during the American Civil War, when 130,000 soldiers of the Union Northern Army clashed with the much smaller Northern Virginia Army, led by General Robert E. Lee.&#10;&#10;General Joseph Hooker, newly appointed by President Lincoln, was in command of the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln&rsquo;s engagement letter ended with the words &quot;Give Us Victories&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The game begins on April 30, 1863, with the Army of the Potomac now beyond the Rappahannock and Rapidan, marching toward Chancellorsville. The game is of intermediate complexity and has simple and intuitive rules. The command system is the heart of the game: you simply check how many points you have in a turn, choose the formations to activate (divisions for the Confederates and corps for the Union), and put them in a cup. Your opponent does the same; then mix and pull&hellip;! Formations may move, attack, entrench, bombard and so on. Special rules cover the use of skirmishers, trench building, and bridge building. Players perform actions alternately with a random activation system always engaging and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.&#10;&#10;Four games included&#10;&#10;    Main game - 2 standard maps, 2 counter sets (figure and Nato style, so players can choose), medium difficulty, 6-8 hours for the campaign, 4 scenarios, 2 variations.&#10;    Strategic game - 1 A3 map, 1 counters set, 1 hour of gameplay, low difficulty.&#10;    Solo game - AI simulates Army of the Potomac, 1 counters set; uses the same maps of the main game.&#10;    Skirmish game - set of paper toy soldiers, landscape elements and counters; low difficulty, playing time 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the box:&#10;&#10;    2 standard maps (86x54 cm)&#10;    1 A3 map (strategic game)&#10;    1 12x10 (cm) map (variant for main game)&#10;    4 counters set, 17 mm side &#10;    Set up charts&#10;    Rules aid, tables, solo game display, solo game booklet&#10;    Paper soldiers (cardboard)&#10;    Rules booklet (Main game, scenarios, strategic, solo system, skirmish)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game theme is the Portuguese Discoveries in the 15th and 16th century, and their contribution to Portuguese wealth, symbolized in the Jer&oacute;nimos Monastery. It is an historic fact that the spices trade, brought by the Caravelles, had to pay a tax of 5% in Lisbon, and this tax was used to pay for the monastery construction.&#10;&#10;The goal is to achieve the highest possible number of victory points (VPs). The game ends when the last piece of Jeronimos is bought by any player.&#10;&#10;The boardgame is the world map with 32 ports / destinations marked around the world (Americas, Africa, Asia and Indic Islands). In 8 of them you can collect the respective merchandise from that port. The board has also marked the real sea currents that the Caravelles followed at the time. It is surprising that often the fastest way is not the shortest, and the game reveals that perfectly.&#10;&#10;Each player has a card representing 3 ships, and indicating the player's ability to travel (translated into 9 navigation discs) and the cargo capacity (translated into 6 different merchandise spaces).&#10;&#10;The players place their wood ship piece in the board in Lisbon and start navigating. If they follow the sea currents marked in the board, they can do it &quot;free of charge&quot; and endlessly. But they wouldn't go very far. Every time a player wants to go in a different direction than the one indicated by the sea current, he has to use a navigation disc from his player card. When all the navigation discs are used, the player turn stops. So, in each turn, a player can go against the currents at most 9 times, thus determining how far he can go.&#10;&#10;During navigation, players arrive in ports. If they are the first to get there, that is, if they are the ones that discover that local, they can place their coloured marker in that port and register the number of VPs marked for that port. If the port is a &quot;trade port&quot; (there are 8), the player can also collect the respective merchandise and place it in his player card.&#10;&#10;But there are also some possible surprises. When navigate, players can pass by special marked cells which force them some kind of effect:&#10;&#10;- &quot;Event&quot; cells: for each round, players have 5 &quot;Event&quot; cards in their hand; when they pass over these cells, they must choose a card from their hand. These cards can be of 3 types: &quot;Storm Card&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm Sea Cards&quot; and &quot;Good Wind Cards&quot;, thus having negative or positive effects in their navigation. But they also have an effect on other players, but for these the effect is always positive. This creates interest during players downtime. &#10;- &quot;Pirate Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players lose immediately 1 of their navigation discs. they can only enter the cell if they have the necessary disc available to pay.&#10;- &quot;Sinking Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players must take their chance with a 50/50 dice - worse can happen is they lose 1 of the 3 ships they have (or 4 - see below), and the corresponding cargo space. They will only get it back when they arrive in Lisbon.&#10;&#10;After some time of navigation, of discovering new ports and collecting one each of the possible 6 merchandises that his player card can carry, the player returns to Lisbon.&#10;&#10;In Lisbon the player can:&#10;- trade merchandises per VPs (5 each)&#10;- specifically, the merchandise &quot;pepper&quot; can be traded for 1 piece of the Jeronimos Monastery which worths 10 VPs, which are immediately registered&#10;- the player can also trade 15 VPs for a 4th ship - this 4th ship gives him 3 more navigation discs (increasing it's navigation autonomy from 9 to 12) and 2 more merchandise space cargo.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a number of Objective Cards with specific Ports. If they are the first player to get to that port, they will receive 5 extra VPs per each at the end of the game. These VPs can be decisive in the victory decision.&#10;&#10;",

Then each player plays another card - whoever played the lowest card may choose one of the cards from the previous rounds first, then second lowest player, etc. After everyone has taken a card, the cards from the current round are placed in the center. A player who plays their 13 takes all cards from the center. Cards you take count their point value as negative points, but if you get two of the same cards, you may discard them. The game ends when all cards have been taken. Lowest number of cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, dice may only be placed in the column of the corresponding color and they have to be placed in ascending order (e.g. the 3 may only be placed when the 1 and 2 are already in place). At any time, a player may reroll ALL his unplaced dice.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player gets rid of all his dice, play stops. For each of his unplaced dice, each player gets minus one point. In addition, the player who finished first positively scores the sum of all unplaced dice. The game is played in several rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay includes four simple steps: reveal two tiles; choose one of the revealed tiles and place it in front of you; add a new tile to the board; lock one of the tiles with the hiker token. Gameplay passes from person to person until one player or team has collected three sets of matching park tiles in front of them.&#10;&#10;Memories captures a depth of strategy in player abilities which can be activated by finding matches of PARKS resource icons when you reveal tiles. There are a variety of ways to enjoy the game. Play a head to head game, or on teams. Expand the grid size for a bigger challenge, or simplify the game to a memory game without player abilities for younger gamers.&#10;&#10;PARKS Memories: Coast to Coast is one of three editions of PARKS Memories, highlighting the national parks in the United States with exceptional bodies of water in them. It features a unique set of player abilities. Collectively all three editions showcase every US national park.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game presents the escape of the submarine ORP Eagle from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea in the first weeks of World War II.&#10;&#10;After the outbreak of war in September 1939, ORP Orze&#197;&#130; left its base in the Bay of Gda&#197;&#132;sk. Its commander, complaining about health problems, directed the ship to the Talinn, the capital of Estonia. There, on September 15, the unit was interned by Estonians. But the Polish crew decided to flee, to reach Great Britain and continue the fight against Germany. At this point, the game begins.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is different for each player. The Polish Navy player wants the submarine ORP Orze&#197;&#130; to escape from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea. He must carefully plan his movement to avoid detection by the German air force and attacks by Kriegsmarine torpedo boats. The German Kriegsmarine player wants to sink the ship before it leaves the Baltic.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player rolls dice, and the results enable various activities: moving, attacking, placing mines, and more. The Polish moves are partly hidden from the German player, which makes the game very suspenseful.&#10;&#10;Box contents:&#10;A game board presenting a map of the Baltic Sea, a figurine of the submarine ORP Orze&#197;&#130;, 8 wooden dice, 24 cardboard tokens, 2 player screens, two booklets with game rules and a historical article (one booklet is in Polish, and second in English).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game&rsquo;s dynamic turn sequence captures the turmoil of the modern city fight and integrated fog of war keeps things chaotic and unpredictable!&#10;&#10;Ambush Alley contains complete rules for all the key elements of modern counter-insurgency and street-fighting, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Civilians on the Battlefield &#10;     Full Vehicle Rules &#10;     Special Assets and Off-Board Support &#10;     Night Combat&#10;     UAVs &#10;     IEDs and VBIEDs &#10;     Building Clearing &#10;     And much more! &#10;&#10;&#10;Ambush Alley includes five scenarios and sample organizational charts for US, British, and Australian forces.&#10;&#10;The game can be played at any scale from 15mm up. 15mm scenarios call for a 2&rsquo;x2&rsquo; table, while 28mm games only require a 4&rsquo;x4&rsquo; table.&#10;&#10;Ambush Alley is easy on the pocketbook where miniatures are concerned. Few scenarios require more than ten figures for the Regular force and a dozen or so for the Insurgents.&#10;&#10;Ambush Alley also offers full solo-play rules, so players can still have fun pushing their figures around the table even when a flesh and blood opponent isn&rsquo;t available!&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Day of the Rangers (2008)&#10;     Ambush Alley: Motor Pool (2007)&#10;     INVALID OBJECT ID=33973, type=thing (2007)&#10;     The Three Block War: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2008)&#10;     Art of War: Ambush Alley Mini Campaign (2008)&#10;     Operation: Darkstar &#226;&#128;&#147; an Ambush Alley Scenario Pack (2008)&#10;     Under the Black Flag: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2008)&#10;     Lawyers, Guns & Money: an Ambush Alley Scenario Pack (2008)&#10;     Indian Country: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2009)&#10;     The Wasteland: SOG Exclusive Supplement &#226;&#128;&#147; 2010 (2010)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Blind Swords system game on the American Civil War battle of Perryville (Kentucky) in 1862. The Blind Swords system uses chit pulls and activation rolls to simulate the command confusion and difficulty of coordinating 19th century armies. Additionally, each turn a number of events can impact the ability of armies to carry out their plans. The basic units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and batteries of artillery which are rated for size, armament, and cohesion/morale.&#10;&#10;Perryville was a short fierce battle between Buell's Army of the Ohio and Bragg's Army of the Tennessee. While Bragg thought he was facing only a small portion of the Army of the Ohio, he was in fact confronting almost its entirety. Buell thought he was facing all of Bragg's Army and possibly even Kirby Smith's Army of Kentucky. Instead Buell was facing only about 2/3 of Bragg's army.&#10;&#10;After an early morning skirmish, both armies assembled on the battlefield just northwest of the crossroads of Perryville. What had been planned as a flanking attack against the Union II Corps instead turned into a frontal assault on the newly arrived Union I Corps, half of which consisted of new recruits. Despite a ferocious battle raging about two miles from his headquarters, Buell was unaware of the Confederate attack and was astonished that one of his corps had been smashed by the vicious assault. Only a few brigades were sent to assist the beleaguered I Corps and the Confederates claimed a tactical victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Classic Knizia betting and racing game. Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse. Points are awarded to 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd home, and one of your bets is a doubler.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Winner&#039;s Circle / Royal Turf &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to steal an ancient relic from a massive structure floating in space. The players compete against each other, all trying to bring home the Relic. The game has a capture-the-flag system.&#10;&#10;The gameplay mechanics are based around a maze made up out of primary coloured doorways (red, blue and yellow), two doorways touching each other make a combination of colours that can (or not if the two colours are the same) form a secondary colour. The aliens you play with are made up out of these secondary colours, each player has three aliens: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple. Aliens can only pass through doorways that form their secondary colour.&#10;&#10;While moving through the maze the players will continuously have to change the maze to get the right colour combinations. And while everybody is getting closer together, players will start to be in each others way, eventually changing the maze in ways others will not be too happy about. Especially not when you prevent them from grabbing the relic!&#10;&#10;This is a game where you plan ahead for a perfect round, just to see it all being completely overthrown by some odd move your opponent is making (providing all other players with some cheap laughs). Most of the time spreading your chances will be the best way to go, but you can always rush for it and hope for the best...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Last Gamble, Designer Signature Edition is Danny Parker's final effort to create a memorable game on the Battle of the Bulge. The scale is conventional: 2 miles per hex, battalions and regimental units; two turns per day. However, the game has many innovations never before seen. Day and night turns differ dramatically both with respect to movement and the likelihood of decisive combat. All units are rated for Morale which can often be more important than combat strength. Forced marches and fluid zones of control at night are a major German offensive weapon while the Allied air effort influences German movement. The game has many previously unseen influences: V-1 weapons attacks, weather impacts on combat (and even zones of control) and bridge discovery.&#10;&#10;As you would expect from a Danny Parker game the Order of Battle for both sides has been exhaustively researched (evaluated in a detailed numerical fashion) and several new units and many changes to others. Besides the new morale rules, armor superiority from the original has been retained although combined arms is enhanced and artillery influences are significantly changed. There are many changes to movement based on weather conditions.&#10;&#10;The map in the original game included all of the villages in the Ardennes. The new map now includes not only those villages but also all the hamlets and castles. A study of the 1940 census has resulted in some towns being downgraded to villages and some village upgraded to towns. The contour lines in the original game are now gone and severe terrain has been added based on detailed evaluation using Google Earth. The map has been expanded to include more area in both the north and south. There are three maps with one smaller one devoted to the Battle Before the Meuse scenario&#10;The Game Booklet includes scenarios, Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Game Variants, Examples of Play and the Game as History. Also included is a Historical Background Booklet with Historical Analysis and Summary, Detailed Orders of Battle, Evaluation of Combat Strengths in the Ardennes and Design Bibliography. With more detailed historical background than any game to ever see print, TLG will also be a great reference tool.&#10;&#10;More than just a reworking of the original game, this version is really a brand new game that has seen constant work for nearly five years by a dedicated team. The research on every aspect of the game has been truly monumental.&#10;&#10;Of course there never will be a 'last word' in Bulge games, the subject is far too popular. But this game pushes the envelope far forward.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As you create gaps in the row, you can squish the stacks closer to one another to create a shorter snake. Instead of moving a piece or a stack of two pieces, you can choose two stacks that you control and swap them. (You cannot swap stacks if the opponent swapped stacks on their previous turn.) The neutral piece can be landed on, and it becomes part of a stack.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone creates a stack of seven pieces, they win!&#10;&#10;",

Then, either steal one item card from another player&rsquo;s display case and add it to your display, or salvage the top card from the face-up discard pile and add it face up to your display.&#10;3.

    "Description": "&quot;DEATH IN THE TRENCHES&quot; is a strategic-level World War I wargame covering the entire war, from the opening shots in Serbia and Belgium to the final defeat -- or victory! -- of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918. The game includes a map illustrated by Jonathan Carnehl, stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies&#10;&#10;The game also features 520 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).&#10;&#10;DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a 28-page rulebook (and an additional 20 pages of setups and random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.&#10;&#10;Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.&#10;&#10;For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... history is overflowing. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!&#10;&#10;It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.&#10;&#10;The original edition of Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition takes this WW1 classic to new heights, and features a revised and expanded combat system that preserves the charm of the original but is much more faithful to actual WWI battle numbers and provides much more detail on individual countries' distinctive military strengths and weaknesses. Each individual battle now takes place on an off-map display that simulates a real WWI battle, each battle opening with a &quot;spearhead&quot; force that drives into a &quot;target area&quot;. The system of entrenchment remains simple and easy to play, but takes into account the role of time and manpower in creating different levels of trench effectiveness.&#10;&#10;Added detail includes the Hindenburg Line, German siege guns, and the possible flight of the French government. Instability in the Balkans, and the allegiance of the Roumanian and Bulgarian governments, may lead to unexpected political reversals in Europe's turbulent &quot;backyard&quot;. The impact of the Russian Revolution is expanded, with several possible directions for Russia to travel including the rise of a better Czar, or even the takeover of Soviet Russia by Trotsky, which could bring Russia back into the war!&#10;&#10;The system of military reinforcements has been transformed, with greater reliance on historical unit production and manpower. Great Power support and sponsorship for minor country forces has been made a vital part of the game, and the &quot;major minors&quot; like Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria now have their own Army Reserves which give each country a more distinctive role.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The player will manage a small force of roughly a dozen units as he tries to complete some specific mission assigned to him, such as &ldquo;Hold the village and our bridgehead at all costs!&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Drive the French from Plancenoit!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Lasalle is ideal for a small gaming table, and it plays in real-time with most battles lasting 2-3 hours. It is perfect for pick-up games or tournament play. It therefore includes sample army lists enabling players to collect and paint typical small forces from a large number of possible nationalities.&#10;&#10;If you have a club, or a larger collection and gaming area, Lasalle can also be used to simulate historical battles of the Napoleonic Wars, such as Quatre Bras, Albuera, Saalfeld, or Eggm&uuml;hl. In these cases, multiple players with multiple forces and a larger table will allow your group to simulate the excitement of a significant battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In early 1918, the trench warfare stalemate between the Germans and Allies was on the verge of ending. New small unit tactics developed by the Germans, and the advent of the Royal Tank Corps for the Allies, promised a new set of doctrines that would rule warfare for decades. The question was: who would beat whom to the punch?&#10;&#10;The Germans were fresh from a decisive military victory in the East against Tsarist Russia. The Allies were celebrating the arrival of fresh U.S. troops. Either side could claim victory if it could break the national will of the other.&#10;&#10;All Quiet on the Western Front is another Ted Raicer design focusing on this often neglected war. For many years, wargame designers shunned World War I for a variety of reasons: too dull, too static, too hard to reproduce the suicidal wave attacks waged by both sides. Ted Raicer almost single-handedly put WWI back on the wargaming map with a number of designs, including Paths of Glory, Clash of Giants, and &quot;All Quiet...&quot;.&#10;&#10;A traditional hex wargame, &quot;All Quiet...&quot; elegantly tackles a number of the key issues that help determine the outcome of the war, including German Stosstruppen and national morale, as well as more traditional elements like supply and command/control.&#10;&#10;The game includes four scenarios: &quot;Operation Michael&quot; (an Introductory Scenario), &quot;Ludendorff Attacks&quot;, &quot;Allied Counteroffensive&quot;, and finally, the 30-hour campaign game, &quot;1918&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arctic Convoy is the newest boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series. It covers the Allied attempts to push convoys through the Norwegian and Barents Seas while German aircraft, submarines and surface ships try to stop them. Famous convoy operations like those of PQ12 and PQ17, British carrier raids, German-Soviet destroyer skirmishes along the Arctic coast &mdash; all of these and more are included. Like all games in the series, this one come stuffed with scenarios and variations on them.&#10;&#10;Most scenarios are very straightforward &mdash; each side knows what the other must do. The Allied player has large convoys of vital merchant shipping that must reach their destination. The German player has bases in Norway well-placed to intercept them, with submarines and aircraft that can hit them almost continuously. As in Bomb Alley, aircraft are drawn in a semi-random fashion so neither player has perfect intelligence about their numbers and location. German surface ships are few in number, but there's a lot of open sea in which they can hide and strike the convoys at vulnerable moments. And with war raging simultaneously on many other fronts, the convoy escort forces are stretched very, very thin.&#10;&#10;There are two maps, covering the Norwegian and Barents Seas from Iceland in the southwest to Novaya Zemlya in the northeast, from the Norwegian coast to the Arctic pack ice. It's one of the larger play areas in the Second World War at Sea series, and unlike Leyte Gulf's three maps, both of these are in use in almost every scenario. Players quickly get a sense of the huge and desolate oceans in which they must operate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lionheart is a simple wargame that is like chess but with dice rolls that determine the success or failure of a capture move.  There are seven different units: King, Knight, Archer, Heavy Infantry, Infantry, Mercenary, and Peasant.  Each turn players can perform any 2 actions: move, turn, or attack.  Foot units move one square forward per action.  Mounted units move as many unblocked squares in front of them as they like.  Units attack the square they are facing (archers attack an area of squares in front of them).  Attacks are resolved by rolling the combat dice.  Each appropriate symbol rolled (axes or arrows) counts as a &quot;hit&quot;.  Scoring more hits than the target has hit points removes some of the units (miniatures) from the target army.  The winner is the player who eliminates his opponent's King or eliminates every other warrior in his opponent's army leaving the King standing alone on the field of battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Compass Games website:)&#10;&#10;Storming the Reich is a game about the World War II Allied campaign to liberate Northwest Europe from Nazi occupation. It is a game of brutal attrition and slashing advances. Opening on the evening of D-Day, with the Allies on the beaches and the Germans reacting (albeit belatedly) to the landings, the game covers the full campaign through to the battle of the Ruhr Pocket in April of 1945.&#10;&#10;With plenty of armor, paratroop divisions, naval gunfire, air superiority and even the 79th Funnies, the Allies will break out from the beaches and race across France toward the Seine River. To keep pace with operations they will face difficult logistical decisions including the grounding of units and Red Ball Express in favor of other operations, a surprisingly thin infantry leash, and whether to give Monty the lead in offensive operations over Patton (or vice-versa)&hellip; For the Allies there&rsquo;s a chance at an early auto-victory for breaking out of the landing areas ahead of schedule, but they can quickly lose the game if they don&rsquo;t cross the Seine on schedule.&#10;&#10;The German player will need to counter the Allied push with a healthy dose of reinforcements (admittedly of low quality), but with very limited replacements. They will need to take advantage of opportunities to thwart the Allies such as when Monty looks the other way at Antwerp, and they can even win the game, although not the war, by launching a successful Counteroffensive (aka. The Bulge). Careful use of Panzer Brigades and Tiger Battalions in offense and defense will play a key role in stopping the Allies.&#10;&#10;Storming the Reich is a two-map game with units portrayed mostly at division level (with some armored brigades and battalions). Each hex is about 8 miles across (or about 13km). Each turn represents a month of operations except during summer where each turn is 2 weeks. For players of Red Storm over the Reich, there are many similarities such as the variable movement allowances for both sides (a key feature for fog of war, variability, replay value, and solitaire play) and the same basic combat engine. A key difference is the elimination of the Redeployment Phase.&#10;&#10;There are 3 scenarios included. Scenario one is the full 15-turn campaign using both maps, beginning on D-Day and ending in April of 1945. The second is a one-map &ldquo;Normandy Breakout&rdquo; scenario &ndash; at only 4 turns it is a perfect learning scenario covering the initial desperate fighting following the landings. Lastly is a one-map &ldquo;Bulge to Victory&rdquo; scenario where both players really get to flex their gaming muscles.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ted Raicer's game on the campaign for Northwest Europe, using a variation of his Red Storm Over the Reich system. &#10;It does not link up with Red Storm Over the Reich.&#10;&#10;",

One player is the guesser for the round, and they step away from the table or hide their eyes while everyone else draws a word or phrase. To choose what to draw, roll the twelve-sided die, then consult the appropriate number on the card that you drew. (The box has 46 double-sided cards, with twelve words/phrases on each side, or 1104 total answers.) Show everyone but the guesser the word to be drawn.&#10;&#10;Everyone then draws their own image on their dry-erase board, but you can use only straight lines and circles in your drawing! Nothing else! No wiggly lines, half-circles, or anything else other than straight lines and circles. If you want to draw a triangle, you must draw three straight lines and connect them. After you complete your drawing, count how many objects you drew, write that number in the lower-right corner of your board, then set your board face down on the table.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has finished, everyone announces their numbers, and whoever has the lowest number is the first player to reveal their board to the guesser. (In the event of a tie, whichever tied player finished their drawing first wins the tie.) If the guesser identifies the image, the guesser scores two points and the drawer one point; if the guesser is wrong, then the drawer with the next-lowest number reveals their image, now giving the guesser two images with which to identify the secret word. This process continues until the guesser has said the secret word or all drawers have revealed their images.&#10;&#10;After everyone has been guesser one or two times, depending on the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

During the game, you try to collect cards with the highest possible values in your lodge &mdash; but the lower-value cards are nothing to sneeze at either because having the same card multiple times gives you bonus points. Of course, it's not easy to keep the best cards. Cards can be swapped in the blink of an eye, so no card ever stays where it is for long! Once the first player has added five cards to their lodge, all the other players get to take one final turn. After the crazy card swap, the players add up the points in their beaver lodges. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the &quot;beaver boss&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

These updates include 4 immune system cards (4 copies of each) that are more consistently damaging than before as well as updated antibody tokens that have an attack value of their own.  The adaptive immune system response is now less volatile and even more dangerous than before!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the words of Nomic's author, Peter Suber:&#10;&#10;&#10;        &quot;Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, and gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.&#10;&#10;Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the addition of a new mutable rule&#10;     an amendment to a mutable rule&#10;     the repeal of a mutable rule&#10;     the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable&#10;     or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable&#10;&#10;&#10;The game can be played around a table with written notes, or online through mailing lists or forums. Alternative starting rulesets exist, particularly for online and postal games which don't suit the usual clockwise turn order. Several games have been running online for over a decade.&#10;&#10;",

A huge mass of people goes across it trying to occupy the most important spots: from embassies to the TV Station, from the government palace to the court, from the prison to the most fashionable shops.&#10;&#10;Counters have traditional movement and combat scores. The Demonstration player has a lot of slow units plus some quicker and deadlier ones (from anarchists to marxist-leninists); the Power player has policemen and &quot;Carabinieri&quot; with heavy vehicles (some of them shooting gas) plus a few lousy city council policemen.&#10;&#10;The huge city is finely depicted (graphics by Piergiorgio Maoloni, that later became one of the best well-known art directors of Italian newspapers and magazines) and it has funny names on streets and squares. A hex grid is of course impressed on it to rule movement and combat. A humorous &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; booklet is included to help finding the best places to score points around.&#10;&#10;There are several scenarios, including a totally different &quot;Black Out&quot; scenario inspired by a New York black-out: up to 6 players go around sacking the city, while up to two players try to stop them with policemen and Carabinieri. Those two can fight each other to get the goods they seized to the pillagers, but only if it is a &quot;dark&quot; turn so they can pretend not to recognize each other.&#10;&#10;This is the first boardgame published by C.UnS.A. when they were still &quot;Comitato Un Sacco Alternativo&quot;, before becoming a company and a successful team of game designer (for boardgames, radio and TV games, advertising games, training games, magazine games and so on). At that time, C.UnS.A. was composed by Massimo Casa, Giulio De Petra, Alvaro Lojacono, Piergiorgio Maoloni and Sergio Zoffoli.&#10;&#10;In 1980 Mondadori Giochi made a second edition with a heavier map and counters, but without the &quot;Black Out&quot; variant: there was rumor that it could become a separate game, but this never happened.&#10;&#10;",

To solve this problem, the Mad Science Foundation was created. Now these &quot;misunderstood geniuses&quot; can finally get the access they need to the four vital building blocks of mad science: Lasers, Dark Matter, Cryptomium, and Sharks.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, for each mad scientist who seeks &quot;funding&quot; from the Mad Science Foundation, there remains the unfortunate fact of life that mad scientists do not play well with others. In the quest for infamy, directors will be bribed, resources will be reallocated, spies will be dispatched, inventions will be sabotaged, and big, ominous buttons will be pressed with catastrophic results. Welcome to the Mad Science Foundation, where everyone is ready to stab you in the back with overly-elaborate backstabbing machines.&#10;&#10;At heart, Mad Science Foundation is a drafting game. You draft resources to craft wacky inventions and dispatch minions to help with your diabolical plans. Each round, one player controls the Crooked Director for that round. They then separate the available commodities into piles to be drafted. It's up to the scientist controlling the Director to determine the value of whatever resources are available and separate them into piles. Not all piles are created equal! Players then take turns selecting which pile of goodies to grab, with the Director's controller choosing last. Sizing up your competition is key! You know what they need; don't let them have it. Or give them two choices of equal terrible-ness! But each player also has a secret side objective that you may not figure out until it's too late...&#10;&#10;By crafting new inventions, you might be able to put together an engine of cards that eventually fuel themselves. Perpetual motion in our lifetime! Or perhaps you might stockpile valuable resources for later exploitation. It's all done with the altruistic goals of megalomania and personal glory in mind.
