Watch out for rolling lava balls and an irascible T-Rex that&rsquo;s ready to block your moves.&#10;(back of box copy)&#10;&#10;A game for young children based off of the volcano scene in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. It plays similarly to Parcheesi. The goal is to get all four of your dinosaur pawns off the island and onto your boat before the other players.&#10;&#10;There is a custom die that features the numbers 1-5, and a picture of a t-rex. On your turn, you roll the die, and if you get a number, you either move the number of spaces indicated or choose to use the turn to instead put the rolled number of lava balls into play in the volcano. The volcano piece will randomly shoot the balls out to different parts of the board, and pieces hit by the lava balls must go back to start.&#10;&#10;If you roll the t-rex, you may move the non-player t-rex pawn to part of the board. Players can't pass by the t-rex and get two turns to try to move the t-rex. If you don't roll and move the t-rex in these two turns, that pawn must go back to start.&#10;&#10;-user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players roll two dice and combine the results of the roll into a two digit number (red = tens , black = ones). So red 1 and black 6 combines into 16. This would allow the player to buy commodity 16 if no one else has already done this. If another player already owns the commodity the player has to pay a fee. There are 3 different commodities: shops (black letters), restaurants (red letters) and a cinema (Filmpalast).&#10;&#10;A player owning a shop may make further investments to increase the fees he gets from the other players if it's number is rolled again. The fees for restaurants are increased if a player owns 2 or 3 restaurants in adjacent buildings. Fees for the cinema are only payed if a player owns both halves (space 63 and 64). If a player owns only one half, another player may still buy the other half or even the half already in possession. When a player owns the whole cinema it is opened and the fees increase automatically every time it's number is rolled, without the player having to invest any money.&#10;&#10;If a double is rolled, an event occurs that causes the player to lose or gain money.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a fixed playing time or if all players but one go bankrupt. The last remaining player or the player with the most money and the most valuable commodities wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The very moment people believe that they know everything there is to know about them, the most bizarre things happen... things that are unexplainable...&#10;&#10;The main advantage of this army is its ability to turn off the fundamental board space during the Battle with the use of Sandstorm. Some Sand Runner Warriors have Features like Modules which helps them support each other during Battles. Additionally, the HQ is double-sided, which allows it to eliminate a single, slower threat before it attacks. Their disadvantage is their low starting initiative, and the fact that an unfortunate change of the HQ side may result in the inability to kill adjacent units during the Battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once a player receives their 2nd indictment, they have to do the &quot;Perp Walk&quot; around the table while other players heckle them.  The player who first banks $150 million ($150M) in Assets in their Offshore Account before receiving their 3rd indictment - wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each card features unique, hand-drawn caricatures and art by Rick Parker.  Rick&rsquo;s probably best known as the artist of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head Comic Book, and was on the staff at Marvel Comics for many years. Rick was the perfect man for job - supremely talented comic artist, and a really shady character.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a CEO business card as their identity and gets a score pad to keep track of banked Assets and Liabilities in their Offshore Account ($150M wins the game) and indictments (3 strikes and you&rsquo;re out).&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player.  The remaining cards are placed face down in the Draw pile.  Played cards are discarded into a Discard pile, which can be shuffled and reused when the Draw pile gets low.&#10;&#10;In any given turn, a player has 1 of 5 options: &#10;&#10;     Bank an Asset Card in their Offshore Account.&#10;     Securitize Liability Cards and if successful, bank those as assets in their Offshore Account on the following turn.&#10;     Attack another player with a Fraud Card and if successful, bank 1 Asset Card from you opponent while opponent also gets 1 indictment. Attacks are defended with Defense Cards.&#10;     Discard an unwanted card and draw back to 6.&#10;     Audit another player &ndash; each player can do this only once per game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Fraud has been thoroughly play-tested, improved and refined over 10 years from initial beta launch in 2010 until this final game release. Fraud uses some of the similar game mechanics of Mille Bornes, the attacking, defending style card game that is listed in the GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame.  Fraud is fun, simple to learn, and takes only 30 minutes to play.   The game combines strategy and luck and satirizes corporate greed and white-collar crime.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game based on the anime TV series Lulu the angel among the flowers (original name Hana no Ko Runrun 1979).&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to wander from one country to another collecting seeds and then collect the flowers from them. The game will end when the first player who collects all the flowers in his garden, including those that border the other (the other players), and will have discovered the Magic flower (with the colors of the Rainbow).&#10;&#10;On his turn, the three cubes are rolled and his marker is moved by how many colors correspond to the base of their triangular markers, received at the beginning of the game. When you happen on a city, you take the corresponding counter from the deck (seeds).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, you will collect several seeds that are placed on their right outside the game plan. Sowing can be attempted when stopping or passing over the Celi box. We turn the record of how many seeds we own at that time. If the character in the slot of the disk is green then you can sow in your garden (friend of Lul&ugrave;), if it is red (Enemy), you will have to resitituire all seeds collected so far.&#10;&#10;When the player has finished sowing on his own garden or passes on the Paris box, he can collect his own flowers.&#10;&#10;Game content: a game plan, 4 LuLu&ugrave; counters of four colors,50 double-sided scented cards,1 cardboard rotating disc,3 cubes with colored faces (dice),9 triangular markers (3 per player).&#10;&#10;The cards depicting the flowers on one side and the seeds on the other ... rubbing the part of the seed gives off the scent of the corresponding flower.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Summary&#10;1. Board game , inspired by Trevi Fountain, is a good game for family which uses simple calculation. &#10;2. You have to play &lsquo;fountain cards&rsquo; to reach specific &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; and get &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.&#10;3. Recommendations: Ages 8+ (Simple addition and subtraction ability is required.), 2~5 Players, 20~30 Min. to play.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1. Fountain cards: 80 Cards&#10;2. Starting cards: 4 Cards&#10;3. Round cards: 15 Cards&#10;4. Lucky token: 40 Tokens&#10;5. Highest combo card: 1 Card&#10;&#10;Preparations&#10;1. Put 4 starting cards on the board side by side. Number &lsquo;7&rsquo; is written on starting cards. &#10;2. Shuffle fountain cards well and distribute 7 cards to each player. You should NOT show off your own cards to others.&#10;3. Make a deck with remaining cards. &#10;4. Gather all lucky tokens in one place.&#10;5. Shuffle 15 round cards and select random 5 cards to build round deck. Only 5 chosen cards will be used in this game.&#10;6. Show off the top card of round deck. Check the written number of token and place lucky tokens of that number next to round card.&#10;7. Start the game. The person who see fountain most recently is the first player.&#10;&#10;There has ONLY 2 options! Play or Draw!&#10;On your turn, there has 2 options. &#10;Play the cards to earn points or Draw the cards to fill your hands. After that, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;Action #1. Play the card(s). (Color match or Number match)&#10;Play the card(s) of your hand on the board.&#10;To do so, you must match color or number with current base card.&#10;Every time you play a card, current base card will be replaced to the last card you play. &#10;(In other words, base card will be changed every time you play a card.)&#10;You can play card again and again if color or number is same with replaced base card. Regardless of sign, number is matter. (&lsquo;-4&rsquo; and &lsquo;4&rsquo; are &lsquo;number matched&rsquo; in this game.)&#10;You cannot play cards on multiple area. You can only play ONE sequence of cards.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;Current base card changes every time someone plays a card to last played card. You can play cards again and again if color or number is matched.&#10;Because starting cards is &lsquo;7&rsquo; and there has no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in fountain cards, the first play must be &lsquo;color match&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Action #2. Draw the cards. (Draw 2 cards from deck)&#10;You don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t play card(s), draw 2 cards form deck to hand. &#10;All player can hold cards up to 7. If you are holding more cards, discard any card(s) to make 7 cards in your hand. Discarded card(s) will not be used in this game.&#10;&#10;To get &lsquo;Lucky Token&rsquo;&hellip;!?&#10;Round card shows 2 information, &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo;. &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; is goal of this round.&#10;&lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo; is reward of this round. &#10;After player finishes card playing, add all number from base card to last card. If result is same with &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; of this round, that player can earn &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card that he (or she) plays.&#10;Even though player plays more cards than remaining token, player can earn remaining &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; only.&#10;Before end of turn, put together all cards that player plays and put the last card on the top of pile to notice what is current base card. &#10;When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; is distributed of this round, show off next top card of round deck and place written number of &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;Strategically, play as many cards as possible to earn more and give as less earning chance as possible to others.&#10;&#10;The end of game&#10;When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; of 5 rounds is distributed, the game ends immediately. &#10;If you are holding cards at the end of the game, that gives you a penalty.&#10;Discard your &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card you have. &#10;Who has token most is the winner of this game.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;You have to manage your fountain cards if you think end is coming!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cruel Seas is a fast-paced tabletop game recreating the swirling naval dogfights taking place on the seas during the dark days of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Powerful, well-armed boats manned by skilled crews stalk enemy shipping lanes, lying in wait for an unsuspecting target to present itself. With a roar of engines the motor torpedo boats would surge forward, opening up with tracer fire from an arsenal of machine guns and autocannons. If the enemy vessel was a large enough target, torpedoes would also be loosed to deal a devastating blow to their prey.&#10;&#10;The game covers six major nationalities - the British Royal Navy, German Kriegsmarine, US Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy, Soviet Navy, and Italian Regia Marina - each having their own character and play style. This rulebook explains how to organize your chosen fleet and take the fight to your opponent as you seek to rule the waves. The vessels vary in size and shape - from fast, sleek killers to slower but more heavily armed ships. Do you prefer a swarm of small but fast boats, fewer larger ships with heavy weaponry to bring to bear, or a combination of these two categories? Cruel Seas provides a multitude of ship and aircraft options and plenty of options to customize your boats' weaponry, making each game different.&#10;&#10;Cruel Seas is scenario-driven providing a strong narrative element to your games. From easy-to-play introductory scenarios to more demanding operations that will provide a test of both your skills and nerves!&#10;&#10;",

But Gnomish airships, Dwarven &quot;Grease Tunnels&quot; and the ever improving field of teleportation magic has left gryphon-run delivery services hustling for work. Coordinate your last few couriers on the most profitable run possible, contending with unpredictable winds, mischevious fairies, and coniving goblins, and maybe you won't have to close your doors.&#10;&#10;Gryphon Delivery Service is a solitaire roll-and-write game where players attempt to move three characters -- gryphon couriers -- along a track from start to finish, while picking up and dropping off various items to turn a profit. Each space either yields an item, allows an item to be sold, or represents an encounter with one of the Dsyx world's various races that can offer players a windfall... or catastrophe. Instead of being sold outright, items can also be used instead to influence various markets, raising prices for (hopeful) future sales. Players must manage each of their characters, their special abilities, and their inventories well, because as soon as the first character reaches the end of the track, the game is over, and any items that were left undelivered represent lost opportunities to make precious gold.&#10;&#10;The easy part is getting to the end of the game. The hard part is having anything to show for it. Succeed, and the courier service will live to see another day; fail, and hard-working gryphons will blame YOU for their unemployment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the July 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

We here at Nasty Malevolent and Evil Incorporate (N.M.E. INC.) are looking for a few up and coming villains to try their hand at taking over this Illustrious city. We will provide you with a hideout and a steady flow of expendable henchmen for you to work with. So come forth and create a little chaos and mayhem on your path to notoriety. Good luck out there and be on the look out for them pesky heroes.&#10;&#10;Megacity is a worker management, make your own luck game where you play as a comic villain who is trying to take over Megacity. You will use your villain and your henchmen to pull heists, fight heroes and, attack other villains to rake in the loot and Villainy Points on your way to victory.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will receive a henchman and are able to acquire more up to their current level. They will then manage their hideout and/or acquire the upgrade &quot;Tools of Villainy&quot; cards to become a stronger villain. Finally, they will assign their henchmen and villain to go out and attack the city/other villains to bring in loot and Villainy Points(VP).&#10;&#10;Attacks are done by rolling dice. The amount of dice a villain rolls is determined by the amount of henchmen and whether the villain is part of the attack. They roll against the city who have a number of dice they roll depending on its difficulty level. Sometimes heroes will appear and they only roll against the villain not the henchmen. A player can attack another villain's hideout to which the defender rolls an amount of dice equal to their defense.&#10;&#10;When a villain reaches 25 VP, every other villain takes one more turn to get to 25 VP. If no one else does, the villain that did wins. If multiple villains do, they have a villain on villain fight to determine the big boss of Megacity.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Inspired by retro adventure video games, Launch the Dragonslayer! will challenge your hero to brave ever-changing wilds, ration limited resources, leverage unique class abilities, and withstand the temptation of cool cheat codes, all in a noble quest to find and slay a monstrous dragon!&#10;&#10;Gameplay progresses through a cycle of turns, which involve rolling for randomized time- and region-dependent encounters, deciding to either travel or recover resources, and moving Time forward one unit. If an encounter occurs, then a system of hit values and encounter effects determines the encounter's ebb and flow. Play is meant to be divided into several sessions, with the general progress of each turn saved between plays. The game ends when your hero resolves the Dragon encounter to slay their sworn foe.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players can choose one of six classes for their hero, each of which has a unique ability that encourages a different style of play. Four stats act as resources that are expended to withstand damage, increase the power of a launch's effect, make it easier to hit a target, or level up to increase your hero's maximum stat amount.&#10;&#10;As the hero draws closer to their goal, they will face different effects in each region they visit, challenging you to optimize your hero's path and assess the rewards of various risks. But all the careful planning in the world will only take you so far. In the end, what will make or break your hero's future is how well you can Launch the Dragonslayer!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a boat that they move to the selected action they want to do on their turn. If both players take the same action whomever arrived at that spot second gets a weaker action they can take. Also, you may not take the same action twice in a row.&#10;&#10;Actions you can take:&#10;&#10;Trade - You may trade with the available cards that are in the market or draw one card from the deck. The amount of cards you may trade are equal to the number on the card, (which moves up and down during the game like a mini stock market) If you are the second boat to arrive on this spot you can trade one less card.&#10;&#10;Fish - You may draw cards equal to the number on your fisherman card that you have leveled up to. If you are the second boat to arrive you draw one less card from the deck.&#10;&#10;Sell - If you move your boat to this space the seagull switches to the player it is currently not with. (Seagull forces you to pay one extra when selling) &#10;On this space you may sell to the fancy man. On his card is a row of numbers that slowly grows each time he's sold to and is also the amount you must sell to him. There is a small 5 card deck next to him with the top card revealed that shows what sardine can the fancy man is wanting to be sold. When a fancy man sale is made you raise the trade market number up one, your fisherman up one, and the fancy man up one on their respective trackers. After selling to the fancy man you flip over the sardine can to show it has been sold to you and you gain points based on how many you acquire by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game you are collecting sets of cans or a variety pack which is all 5 brands of cans. These cans can be sold, and count as points. Once the fancy man has been sold 5 cans the game ends and the player who did not trigger the end game gets one last turn.&#10;&#10;Player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goals are achieved by wisely using the set of actions available.&#10;&#10;In his turn, a player plays one of his Action card and does the action described on the card. These actions consist of moving one or more spaces on the board, closer to planet (Card+), further from planet (cards-) or by switching two spaces(Switch cards).&#10;&#10;A round can end either when a spaceship reaches the planet or when all players have played all their Action cards.&#10;&#10;Each player then reveals his two Mission cards and scores the number of points corresponding to the spaceships on each of his Mission cards.&#10;&#10;This reimplemtation of J'ai mon voyage introduces two variants to the game: family and advanced. Family variant does not use more complicated &ldquo;Swap&rdquo;, &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reverse&rdquo; cards. Advanced variant allows players to use special abilities of the planets and limits their hands at the beginning of the mission, to make game more challenging.&#10;&#10;",

Between two of the bridges that span the river, there stands the Unvisited Isle. The foggy shores are barren and unwelcoming, and as you row closer, you try to remain silent, as if to keep the river itself from noticing. Not a soul greets you as you draw closer to the island, save for the judging gaze of ghostly birds that observe you from the trees. In the distance, a pillar of spectral energy is rising into the clouds, a vortex of otherworldly mist spiraling about it.&#10;&#10;As you explore the island, you will find braziers scattered at various locations, that you can either light or douse with the new Circle action ability. Lighting these braziers may help push back the heavy mist, allowing you to further explore the island, but it may also be the key step in completing the ritual that has already begun. How far can you push Arkham to the brink of chaos without surrendering the city to the dark forces battling for control of it?&#10;&#10;",

Other cards show ways to help resolve these ailments. But our lifetime is limited. At some point, the last hour will come! Do we go with a heart full or with sorrow that could not be resolved?&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, help is not always readily available, not everything is visible. Unforeseen events change the situation in a flash, and without mutual support, we are lost...&#10;&#10;The game is won when all players are freed of their Suffering cards before they have to discard the last Vitality card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;&#10;In diesem Spiel spielt man gemeinsam, nicht gegeneinander. Es gewinnen alle zusammen oder alle verlieren.&#10;&#10;Der Grundgedanke des Spiels ist dabei, dass jeder Mensch auf seine Weise im Leben nach Gl&uuml;ck und Zufriedenheit strebt. Zu &uuml;berwinden sind auf diesem Weg grundlegende Schwierigkeiten des Lebens, abgebildet in den Karten und Regeln des Spiels. Einige Karten zeigen Dinge, an denen Menschen leiden. Andere Karten zeigen M&ouml;glichkeiten der Hilfe, um diese Leiden aufzul&ouml;sen. Doch unsere Lebenszeit ist begrenzt. Irgendwann schl&auml;gt die letzte Stunde! Gehen wir mit einem erf&uuml;llten Herzen oder voller Leid, das sich nicht aufl&ouml;sen lie&szlig;?&#10;&#10;Hilfe ist leider nicht immer passend zur Hand, nicht alles ist sichtbar, unvorhergesehene Ereignisse ver&auml;ndern die Lage blitzartig und ohne gegenseitige Unterst&uuml;tzung sind wir verloren...&#10;&#10;Das Spiel ist gewonnen, wenn alle Spieler/innen von ihren Karten des Leidens befreit wurden, bevor sie die letzte Karte Lebenskraft abgeben m&uuml;ssen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Concept&#10;   In the game, players will be commanding their robots using the cards given. The game starts with Instruction cards where we introduce basic commands in simple code. Slowly game moves to resource cards on which bigger code with generic syntax is written. Robots will be executing these codes sequentially just in the way computers execute programs. The cards are written in Java but readable as simple English.&#10;&#10;Anyone who can read and understand English can easily read and follow these codes, thus making it easy for kids and adults to learn programming. There are complicated code cards which will be used in strategy level, which are explained well in the rule book.&#10;&#10;The Story &#10;   C.E.L.E.B (Command Executing Laser Equipped Bot) was developed by S.A.I.L (Secret Artificial Intelligence Lab) for military for war purposes. As the name says he can execute his human partner's commands and shoot enemies with the laser from his chest.&#10;&#10;As a part of S.A.I.L's training program to choose the Commanding Officers for the bots, players are being tested against their logic and strategy in the artificial war zone. Shoot Cards will be distributed equally to all the players. First player starts the game by picking up the top card of Instructions deck and moves his robot according to the command on his Instruction card. If he gets to move to a new grid on the board using this card, he can collect the top card of Resources deck. When it is first players turn again he can choose between playing his resource and picking up a new instruction. As the game goes on, you will collect more resources and strategize your game better. As the robot moves on war zone it will collect important resource codes for it's partner which will help him strategize in the war. The player who reaches the middle of war zone first will be promoted as Commanding Officer. But you need to shoot at least one enemy robot before getting there.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;  The game box contains&#10;&#10;- 1 Game board (AKA) War zone&#10;    - A deck of Instruction Cards(codes)&#10;    - A deck of Resource Cards&#10;    - A deck of Shoot Cards&#10;    - A rule book&#10;    - 4 C.E.L.E.B game markers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dominus is a tile-laying game where players compete to build the most prestigious medieval monastery. The game features very simple rules, lots of interaction between players (in the form of a shared resource market) and clever tile-laying where players try to match the sides of the tile they are building with the sides of previously built tiles (dominoes style) in order to maximize their score and get access to extra resources. DOMINVS is a fast-paced tile-laying game where a clever placement of your workers on the market will not only grant you access to more resources but may occasionally help you win coins when other players harvest, thus saving you from spending one of your turns harvesting. The market manipulation provides a lot of interaction between players, but not the destructive type of interaction because, even when somebody messes with your plans, new possibilities open in the market for you.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player places one resource tile together with one of their workers into the market (formed by a 3x3 grid of resource tiles). The tile is either placed on the leftmost space of a row or in the topmost space of a column, thus pushing out one other resource tile from the market that the player then collects. If there is a worker on the expelled tile, it's owner recovers it and gains a Prestige Point. Then the player activates the row or the column of the market where the tile and the worker were placed (each resource tile specifies if activates a column or a row).&#10;When activating a row or a column, the player performs one of two possible actions: harvest or build:&#10;&#10;The end game is triggered when a player reaches 50 Prestige points. Then, a final round is played and the player with most Prestige Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;During playtest, 4 player games would take no longer than 30 minutes, making DOMINVS a fast playing game, with an interesting engine building mechanism integrated, with simple rules but with lots of interesting decisions each turn.&#10;&#10;DOMINVS was also designed from the beginning with an integrated and fully functional solo variant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You place a farmer card from your hand onto the discard pile to build a hut in the corresponding area on the village board. Then place 1, 2 or 3 sacrifice cards of your choice from your hand back into the supply to determine on which field in that area you can place your hut. After placing your hut, you immediately receive the bonus of that area: Ganesha figure, stones, or a banana plantation tiles for scoring bonus points.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there will be a wooden &quot;Ganesha meeple&quot; which delivers more points when scoring Priests.&#10;&#10;Finally, extra victory point tokens helps make score-keeping a little easier.&#10;&#10;Important: If a player still has any unbuilt huts at the end of the game then that player does not participate in the end scoring and automatically loses the game. So, you must build all the huts you received at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The old king has no heirs to the throne, and has decreed that he will pass his crown to the one who has acquired the greatest amount of mystical power (represented in pentacles) between:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the Knight/Dame who kills the last dragons, and &#10;     the Knight/Dame who kills the greatest number of dragons.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Pentacles are awarded in specific amounts to players according to their choices, when they simultaneously choose, without knowing the other player's choice, to form or not to form alliances upon encountering each other along the game path.&#10; Pentacle color combinations of 15 pentacles, selected from 9 different colors, are offered to obtain 1 of 3 Amulets of different capabilities to kill the dragons, according to the pentacle combinations offered.&#10; In the meantime, the players must prevent the dragons from destroying any of the towns in the 9 shires, as a 13th attack on any town renders it destroyed, which forfeits the game to the dragons.&#10;&#10;Each time the dice are thrown by any player to advance on the game path in the course of regular play, the dice score numbers also indicate which of the 9 numbered shires has its towns attacked by the dragons, and any undefended towns in those shires receive a damage disc, which must not accumulate to 13 for any town.&#10;&#10;So, from the outset, an intense race begins to meet a rapid unrelenting onslaught of attacks by the dragons, which attack somewhere on every throw of the dice. A town (18 towns total) can receive a defender when landed on in the course of regular play, which prevents any further damage to that town. A player is knighted when he/she becomes defender of both of the 2 towns in a shire. Once Knighted the play becomes eligible to fight the dragons with an Amulet upon obtaining one.&#10;&#10;The object for the players is to kill the 6 dragons in a contest against each other according to the above mentioned criteria with the use of the 3 Amulet types (a player can only possess 1 Amulet at a time), but are quickly drawn into a perilous concerted drive to preclude the dragons from thwarting their opportunity with a 13th attack on an undefended town.&#10;&#10;In a dragon fight each of the 3 Amulet types ensures the defeat of any one of 4 of the 6 dragons, so each of the 3 Amulet types ensures the defeat of a different set of 4 of the 6 dragons. Therefore, an Amulet gives the player a 2 to 1 advantage over the dragon, which could kill the player if it is not one of the 4 listed on the Amulet. Players can prevent being killed if they have an escape card.&#10;&#10;Amulet features a fascinating paradox where players are compelled to cooperate and form alliances to set up an end game where they can seek to defeat each other. Failure to do so, could brings the game swiftly to and end with victory going to the dragons.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fun for everyone!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Game play: If there is no own Popeye on the board, one is placed on the tee-off field. The active player rolls with both dice.  Each rolled double (2x equal number) now causes the checkered flag to be moved. The rolled number shows where (new target field).&#10;&#10;The active player always rolls again after a double. Both rolled results can be used for the movement of figures. At least 1 movement has to be done on a player&rsquo;s turn. A figure movement takes place with your own Popeye, Olivia, or Brutus.&#10;&#10;The rolled numbers 1 to 6 show the possible range of movement on the board. The player will always have 3 possible results after rolling both dice.&#10;&#10;Popeye (-balls) are immediately holed when 1 Popeye moves to the checkered flag field with the last step of his current movement (the target field of a movement).&#10;&#10;Oliva helps / Repositions Popeye: The coaster on which the Oliva token is currently lying is relevant here. Land a Popeye as the target field of a movement on a free field of this coaster (no matter where, 1 out of 9 possible fields), the player can reposition this Popeye on any field of this coaster.&#10;&#10;Brutus prevents / Blocking Popeye(s): The coaster on which the Brutus token is currently lying or being moved is relevant here. All the Popeyes lying there or those, which should be moved on this coaster, cannot move until Brutus is moved down from this coaster again.&#10;&#10;Once a player has holed his 3 Popeyes at the end of a full round, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Schlagkraftig!

Die erw&uuml;rfelte Zahl zeigt wohin (neues Zielfeld). Der aktive Spieler w&uuml;rfelt nach einem Pasch immer erneut.&#10;Beide erw&uuml;rfelte Ergebnisse k&ouml;nnen f&uuml;r die Bewegung von Figuren genutzt werden. Mindestens 1 Bewegung muss pro Runde vom Spieler ausgef&uuml;hrt werden. Eine Figuren-Bewegung erfolgt mit dem eigenen Popeye, Oliva oder Brutus. Die erw&uuml;rfelten Zahlen 1 bis 6 zeigen dabei die m&ouml;glichen Bewegungsweiten auf dem Spielplan. Dem Spieler stehen nach dem W&uuml;rfeln beider W&uuml;rfel immer 3 m&ouml;gliche Ergebnisse zur Verf&uuml;gung.&#10;Popeye (-B&auml;lle) werden sofort eingelocht (kommen dann aus dem Spiel), wenn 1 Popeye als Zielfeld einer Bewegung auf das Feld mit der Zielflagge kommt.&#10;Oliva hilft / Neu-Positionierung von Popeye: Der Deckel, auf dem der Oliva-Marker gerade liegt, ist hier relevant. Landet ein Popeye als Zielfeld einer Bewegung auf ein freies Feld dieses Deckels (egal wo, 1 von 9 m&ouml;glichen Feldern), kann der Spieler diesen Popeye auf ein beliebiges Feld dieses Deckels neu positionieren. &#10;Brutus behindert / Blockieren von Popeye(s): Der Deckel, auf dem der Brutus-Marker gerade liegt oder gezogen wird, ist hier relevant. Alle dort liegenden Popeyes oder welche, die auf diesen Deckel gezogen werden sollen, k&ouml;nnen sich nicht bewegen, bis Brutus von diesem Deckel wieder runtergezogen wird.&#10;Sobald ein Spieler am Ende einer kompletten Runde seine 3 Popeyes eingelocht hat, gewinnt dieser Spieler das Spiel.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Land in sight! H&auml;gar the Horrible &amp; wavering ships in search of the treasure islands. The way is the goal and the way is not so easy. Roll and navigate your way through the oceans and find the hidden treasures first of all!&#10;&#10;A entertaining quick game with coasters. Fun for everyone!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Game play: At the beginning of the player&rsquo;s turn, the player navigates over the map (board) and tries to get a good navigation point to find good treasures.&#10;&#10;The active player initially rolls both dice and then optionally has another roll with one or both dice. After that, counts the result. He now hit exactly 1 field of the board through the specified navigation lines (intersection).&#10;&#10;If a player hits an island field directly or indirectly (across a neighbored sea field), all treasure tokens lying on this island can be revealed immediately. The player now has the chance to win the treasures of this island. With a direct hit the player has up to 3 rolls, with an indirect hit (across neighbored sea field) only 1 roll with the dice.&#10;&#10;For the winning of treasure tokens of islands being hit (directly or indirectly) the following applies:&#10;&#10;Number tokens: If a dice shows the number of a certain number token, the treasure is discovered and can be picked up by the player.&#10;&#10;Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz or H&auml;gar tokens: A double (2x same number, no matter which one) wins one of these outlying tokens.&#10;&#10;Lucky-7 (sum): A dice combination with the sum = 7 (1/6 or 2/5 or 3/4) can also be used as a wild card. The player can choose any outlying token of the island.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately, once all number tokens (total of 6 pieces) are discovered. The player with the fewest victory points in total loses the game. In case of a tie, several lose.&#10;&#10;Each won number token counts victory points based on its numerical value. In addition there are (for one player) double victory points for a treasure token on the x2 field.&#10;&#10;For the H&auml;gar token, the number of all won number tokens count as additional victory points for the player (in addition to the normal number values).&#10;&#10;For each Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz token the player rolls both dice exactly once. The difference between the two results (higher minus smaller number) shows the victory points achieved for this. The player gets nothing with a rolled double.&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Land in Sicht! H&auml;gar der Schreckliche &amp; schwankende &#10;Schiffe, auf der Suche nach den Schatzinseln ..

Spa&szlig; f&uuml;r jedermann!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (German)&#10;&#10;Spielablauf: Am Anfang des Spielerzuges navigiert der Spieler &uuml;ber die ausliegende Karte (Spielplan) und versucht einen guten Navigationspunkt zu erspielen, um von dort gute Sch&auml;tze zu finden.&#10;Der aktive Spieler w&uuml;rfelt anf&auml;nglich beide W&uuml;rfel und hat danach optional einen weiteren Wurf mit einem oder beiden W&uuml;rfeln. Danach z&auml;hlt das erw&uuml;rfelte Ergebnis. Er hat jetzt durch die festgelegten Navigationsreihen genau 1 Spielfeld des Planes direkt getroffen (Schnittpunkt). &#10;Falls ein Spieler ein Inselfeld direkt oder indirekt (&uuml;ber ein angrenzendes Seefeld) trifft, k&ouml;nnen alle auf dieser Insel liegenden Schatzmarker sofort aufgedeckt werden. Der Spieler hat jetzt die Chance die Sch&auml;tze dieser Insel zu erspielen. Der Spieler hat hier bei einem direkten Inseltreffer bis bis zu 3 W&uuml;rfe, bei einem indirekten Treffer (&uuml;ber angrenzendes Seefeld) immer nur 1 Wurf mit den W&uuml;rfeln.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;r das Erspielen von Schatzmarkern getroffener Inseln (direkt oder indirekt) gilt:&#10;Zahlenmarker: Erzielt ein W&uuml;rfel dabei die Zahl eines ausliegenden Zahlenmarkers, ist der Schatz geborgen und kann vom Spieler aufgenommen werden.&#10;Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz- oder H&auml;gar-Marker: Ein Pasch (2x gleiche Zahl, egal welche) erspielt einen dieser ausliegenden Marker.&#10;Lucky-7 (Summe): Eine W&uuml;rfelkombination mit der Summe = 7 (1/6 oder 2/5 oder 3/4) kann als Joker genutzt werden. Der Spieler kann sich einen beliebigen ausliegenden Marker der Insel aussuchen.&#10;&#10;Das Spiel endet sofort, sobald alle Zahlenmarker (gesamt 6 St&uuml;ck) geborgen sind. Der Spieler mit den wenigsten Siegpunkten insgesamt verliert das Spiel. Bei Gleichstand verlieren auch mehrere.&#10;Jeder erspielte Zahlenmarker z&auml;hlt anhand seines Zahlenwertes Siegpunkte. Dazu gibt es (f&uuml;r einen Spieler) ggf. doppelte Siegpunkte f&uuml;r einen Schatzmarker auf dem x2-Feld. &#10;Der H&auml;gar-Marker bringt die Anzahl aller erspielter Zahlenmarker als zus&auml;tzliche Siegpunkte f&uuml;r den Spieler (neben den eigentlichen Zahlenwerten). &#10;F&uuml;r jeden Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz-Marker w&uuml;rfelt der entsprechende Spieler beide W&uuml;rfel genau 1x. Die Differenz der beiden Ergebnisse (h&ouml;here minus kleinere Zahl) zeigt die hierf&uuml;r erzielten Siegpunkte. Bei einem Pasch gibt es also nichts.&#10;&#10;",

This is a playing card game based on Travel, Culture, Geography, Society and much more focused game that you can take with you anywhere.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with several cards, which means each player starts with different cities of the world. In order to win the game, you must be the first one to place all your cards correctly on the table. Every time a player positions correctly one of their cities on the table, the comparison gets more complicated and interesting for the next player as the options increase.&#10;&#10;To beat your opponents you don&acute;t need to know the exact answer. Instead, you need to be the best player comparing cities according to the 6 categories of the game.  Each of them will make you think about the cities in a completely different way.  If you love game strategies, you can decide to activate a different category for the game or even challenge other players, you can check all the details in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

The game features a dynamic play area that changes with each player interaction. Your goal is to harvest ingredients and work with the magical animal gardeners to make the most fantastic table of recipes!&#10;&#10;Players all start the game with two recipe cards, two skill cards and a unique menu card. Additional recipes and skill cards can be acquired during play. However, your menu card stays with you throughout play, giving you a special end-of-game scoring multiplier if you achieve certain combinations. Up to three recipe cards can be placed in your kitchen area while you collect ingredients. Once you've gathered the necessary ingredients for a recipe, you can present it to a gardener (more about that below). Skill cards are played directly from your hand, giving you extra actions, bonus ingredients or can add to your points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Four (or five) garden patch tiles make up the board. Each garden patch grows different ingredients, vegetables, fruit, fungus and grains/nuts. Each turn ingredients randomly grow in these garden patches dictated by a roll of the garden dice. Four (or five) magical gardener animals tend the garden, though each has one particular patch that they are partial to. These animal figures are placed on the board in their preferred garden patch to start the game. Players take turns moving their token to different garden patches, harvesting the ingredients and interacting with the gardeners. You can present your completed recipe to the gardener on your patch or call a different gardener to your patch to use their special ability. You can't do both.&#10;&#10;As the gardener animals are called to different patches and different ingredients grow or are harvested, players have unique options every turn! You'll constantly be guessing where the gardeners will land and hoping there will be enough ingredients available to complete another recipe. Strategy, clever resource management and a bit of luck is needed to ensure you maximize each turn!&#10;&#10;Recipe cards, toppings, combos and your unique menu card all contribute to your victory points! After one player finishes their sixth recipe, the other players have one last turn to create a final masterpiece. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Concept by Ruthie Jones. Mechanisms and art by Darryl T. Jones.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Shortly after, everyone became cursed and a giant fire ravaged everyone&rsquo;s homes.&#10;&#10;In Lucky Cat, 1-5 friends play as ambitious merchant cats competing to lead the once-thriving kingdom. &#10;Take turns rolling chunky dice that can help or hinder the whole table. Will you play it safe, pay taxes, and carefully reconstruct the lost pieces of ancient lucky cat statues? Or will you take calculated risks, amass hidden wealth, and outsmart your rivals? The people need a new leader. Are you the one?&#10;&#10;To win: &#10;Be the first player to have 10 gold.&#10;OR&#10;Be the first player to have 2 sets of lucky cat tiles.&#10;&#10;The dice have three faces that give you different resources: coins, broken cat tiles, and reroll cubes. The other faces give money to other players, levy taxes, or let you invest your money in your store (hiding it from the government). The more taxes everyone pays, the more dice everyone gets to roll as the city is rebuilt. The reroll cubes work on yourself as well as other players rolls.&#10;&#10;Optional Dexterity rules: In the center of the table, a lucky cat plushie beckons. If any player rolls two cat or two crown symbols, be the first to hit the plushie and you get the broken cat tiles or avoid the heavy tax! Move Fast!&#10;&#10;Advanced variable power tiles allow you to manipulate the dice, your cash, and your luck. Take-that advanced powers are entirely optional to include or not. Variable starting conditions allow experienced players to draft different starting resources.&#10;&#10;Lucky Cat was designed for big or small groups of diverse friends. There are many paths to victory: strategy, speed, luck, bluffing, and even negotiation. How will you win?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion includes new Heroes, new Creatures and Minions, and a previously unseen Witch, Skriga, and her Werewolf familiar Accalia. Comes complete with 4 new double sided map tiles that add water barriers to the game as well as 5 new Encounters for this new land.&#10;&#10;Skriga paddled her boat idly. Life at sea suited her fine. Sure, there were no stupid minions to kick, but no Demons to kick her either. And plenty of fish! Leave them in the bottom of the boat for a couple of days and they get really tasty. Sea dragons would fetch the really ugly fishes from the depths, if you shout at them loud enough. Ugly ones tasted best and it felt good to push the sea dragons around. They were so full of themselves! Anything could swim. She could learn if she wanted to.&#10;&#10;Looking up she saw a storm brewing, small but close. Perfect, everyone likes a little rain in their face, trickling down their backs. She turned the boat to head towards the better weather. &#10;&#10;As she paddled, it became clear this was not a simple storm. Water splashed and circled in the air, the vortex moving towards her faster than she moved towards it. Then it was upon her, and everything changed. She was under the water, not on it, and her precious boat was torn to pieces around her. And it was cold, so cold. As she floated towards the dim and strangely diffuse light above her, the cold dragged her mind to a dark, silent place. And then she cracked her face against the sheet of ice above her.&#10;&#10;Trapped beneath the ice for decades, Skriga could barely be called alive. Frozen in place, she was too chilled to draw power from Neemoss but the fading tendrils of her magic could feel the dead and drowned around her, together with the rotting flotsam and jetsam that is human decay. Her slowed thoughts could imagine new spells to use her surroundings to her advantage and when the ice began to thaw, she was a new Witch. We might call her a necromancer, although she had no name for what she had become.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Everybody then discusses to choose only one to fund.&#10;Phase 3 : Players collect resources (1 or 2 if on a tile with one of their stations). If the last resource of a tile is taken, then it is turned over and it will not produce any resource anymore.&#10;Phase 4 : During this phase one event (negative or positive) happens. Negative ones can be countered with sustainable development tokens (gained thanks to some projects)&#10;Phase 5 : Players pay one resource for each of their people on the board.&#10;Phase 6 : The planet regenerates its resources (1 or 2 per tile)&#10;&#10;If a player meets his individual objective, he wins alone, if the main goal is achieved, everybody wins, if neither of these conditions is met before the end of the eighth turn then everybody loses.&#10;&#10;",

A team can therefore be as many as 3 (cooperating) players.&#10;&#10;It still can be a good little 2-player (or 2-team) game or you could even have the game play itself and move the pieces for it. :-)&#10;&#10;(Writing the rules - Robot Directives - for a solitaire hex-and-counter game is VERY challenging ... a designer's holy grail.)&#10;&#10;If you are the/a &quot;live&quot; Axis player, watch out for the 2-factor (&quot;T-34&amp;KV-1&quot;) Russian mechanized corps, which by the rules take down the German panzerkorps in the exchanges - even on an X/2 result - and you don't know whether you'll be facing 2, 4, or 6 of those. :-)&#10;&#10;Note the stand-up mechanized korps pieces for &quot;live&quot; Russian players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Yes, sometimes life could be really good. Her lair was nice and damp. Her mates&rsquo; leg bone was still juicy. Her babies skittered around the web-lined tunnel, too small to do any harm, but big enough for a sweet meal soon. Life has its moments.&#10;&#10;A spiderling abruptly turned and ran towards her. Happy days! Her claw snapped out to pierce its abdomen. A succulent dessert would be the perfect end to the meal. As she raised the oozing creature to her mouth, she caught sight of a disturbance near the entrance to her web tunnel. It was not just this one spiderling that was running wild, the whole brood was acting up.&#10;&#10;In the dim light, she finally saw it. A slight swirling disturbance in the air, slowly advancing towards her. Was some crazy witch attacking her, in her lovely home?  The audacity! Then suddenly it gained pace, sweeping down the passage towards her. It cleared everything in its path, all the bones, bodies and babies disappearing into the swirling void. With nowhere to go and no time to think, Karakurt stared at the portal, venom dripping impotently from her fangs, as the Conjunction encompassed her.&#10;&#10;Suddenly the pain was dreadful! Bright lights burned her eyes! Pleasant smells assaulted her nostrils! A dry warm breeze played across her sensilla hairs! She had never known such discomfort.
