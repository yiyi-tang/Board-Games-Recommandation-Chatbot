    "Description": "Components: 54 (2 &times; Alphabet/2 &times; Pun)&#10;&#10;Object of the game&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to form one or more words on your own hand. The score of a word results from the number of letters. Example: The word &quot;GAME&quot; consists of four letters and thus results in four points. The words &quot;TURN&quot; and &quot;CARD&quot; result in four plus four points, i.e. a total of eight points. The player with the most points on his hand wins.&#10;&#10;Pun Rules&#10;&#10;The starting order can be determined by lots. The player who draws the highest card in the alphabet begins. First, each player is dealt six cards face down. The remaining cards are dealt face down in the center as the deck. Three cards from the deck are dealt face up in the center. There must always be three cards in the center throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Phase 1&#10;The active player may swap an unlimited number of cards with the other players in the first phase. You may also exchange several cards for one.&#10;&#10;Phase 2&#10;The active player can then choose between these three options:&#10;1. The player can swap one or more cards from the center with those in his hand and then end his turn.&#10;2. The player can draw a card from the deck and end his turn. This option cannot be selected if there is no more card in the deck.&#10;3. The player can end the round. This ends his turn. The round continues until  all other players have completed their turn Now the points of each player are counted.&#10;&#10;All words in the dictionary are allowed. Abbreviations and names are not allowed. Players can also agree to allow words in other languages or limit themselves to terms from a specific subject area (e.g. animals). The &bdquo;Pun- card&ldquo; is the wild card and can represent any one of the 26 letters.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;Pun Spielanleitung&#10;&#10;Karten: 54 (2 &times; Alphabet/2 &times; Pun)&#10;&#10;Anleitung: Deutsch und Englisch&#10;&#10;Anzahl Spieler: 2&ndash;8&#10;&#10;Altersgruppe: ab 6 Jahren&#10;&#10;Autor: Bastian Ruhl&#10;&#10;Ziel des Spiels&#10;&#10;Ziel des Spiels ist es, ein Wort oder mehrere W&ouml;rter auf der eigenen Hand zu bilden. Die Punktzahl eines Wortes ergibt sich aus der Anzahl der Buchstaben (also jeder Buchstabe ist grunds&auml;tzlich gleich viel Wert). Beispiel: Das Wort &bdquo;SPIEL&ldquo; besteht aus f&uuml;nf Buchstaben und ergibt somit f&uuml;nf Punkte. Die W&ouml;rter &bdquo;ZUG&ldquo; und &bdquo;KARTE&ldquo; ergeben drei und f&uuml;nf Punkte, also insgesamt acht Punkte. Derjenige Spieler, der am Ende die meisten Punkte auf der Hand hat, gewinnt.&#10;&#10;Finaler Sieger: Man kann danach Spielen wer nach einer bestimmten Anzahl an Runden die meisten Punkte hat oder wer der Sieger der meisten Runden ist.&#10;&#10;Pun-Spielregeln&#10;&#10;Wer anf&auml;ngt, kann ausgelost werden. Der Mitspieler, der die h&ouml;chste Karte im Alphabet zieht, beginnt. Zuerst bekommt jeder Spieler sechs Karten verdeckt ausgeteilt. Die restlichen Karten werden, als Stapel verdeckt, in die Mitte gelegt. Drei Karten vom Stapel werden offen in die Mitte gelegt. W&auml;hrend des gesamten Spiels m&uuml;ssen immer drei Karten in der Mitte liegen. Der Spielzug eines Spielers besteht aus zwei Phasen.&#10;&#10;Phase 1&#10;&#10;Der aktive Spieler darf in der ersten Phase mit den anderen Spielern unbegrenzt viele Karten tauschen (verbal und darf verdeckt oder offen stattfinden). Es d&uuml;rfen auch mehrere Karten gegen eine getauscht werden (bis man selbst nicht mehr tauschen m&ouml;chte oder die anderen Spieler nicht mehr tauschen m&ouml;chten). Das Tauschen von Karten ist ein wichtiges strategisches Element und sollte nicht vernachl&auml;ssigt werden.&#10;&#10;Phase 2&#10;&#10;Anschlie&szlig;end muss sich der aktive Spieler zwischen drei M&ouml;glichkeiten entscheiden:&#10;&#10;1. Er kann eine oder mehrere Karten aus der Mitte mit denen auf seiner Hand tauschen und den Zug beenden.&#10;&#10;2. Oder der Spieler kann eine Karte vom Stapel ziehen und den Zug beenden. Diese Option ist nicht w&auml;hlbar, wenn keine Karte mehr im Stapel ist.&#10;&#10;3. Der Spieler kann das Spiel beenden. Dadurch ist der Zug beendet. Das Spiel l&auml;uft noch eine Runde weiter und endet, sobald der Spieler, der es beendet hat, wieder am Zug w&auml;re. Nun werden die Punkte gez&auml;hlt.&#10;&#10;Die Umlaute &Auml;, &Ouml;, &Uuml; werden durch AE, OE, UE gebildet und das &#225;&#186;&#158; durch SS. Alle im Duden stehenden W&ouml;rter sind erlaubt. Abk&uuml;rzungen und Namen sind hingegen nicht gestattet. Die Spieler k&ouml;nnen sich aber auch darauf einigen, W&ouml;rter anderer Sprachen zu erlauben oder sich nur auf Begriffe aus einem bestimmten Themenfeld zu beschr&auml;nken (z. B. Tiere) (siehe Spielmodus &ldquo;Stadt, Land, Pun). Die Pun-Karte ist der Joker und kann einen der 26 Buchstaben vertreten.&#10;&#10;Es k&ouml;nnen auch Karten aus dem Deck genommen werden (empfiehlt sich Q, X, Y rauszunehmen, wenn man nur einsprachig deutsch spielt).&#10;&#10;",

Allow skirted the board faster.&#10;&#10;The approach to the Ghost Galleon&#10;Follow the black arrow on the beach to opposite black arrow. &#10;Go around the galleon in the same direction as you walked along the beach.&#10;&#10;The Ghost of the Blackbeard&#10;You can move it whenever you get a 6 at the die roll. Use it to help you get in the way of the others.&#10;He can never leave Galleon.&#10;&#10;Houses with cannon and houses with cannonballs&#10;To shoot a cannon, the Phantom must move to the house directly behind that cannon.&#10;&#10;Board&#10;When the Phantom comes home next to yours (he can stop there even if he has not finished the sum of the data), or when you arrive at a house after his, or if you are in a cabin when he enters, you are immediately taken spiritually to walk on the board, Ha, ha, hal !! &#10;When you have recovered from the shock (ie lost in turn), you are saved by a barrel passing through there. Jump to the barrel of your color and start your journey from there.&#10;&#10;Search and Obtaining the Treasure&#10;You must keep one or more keys that will open the treasure chests.&#10;&#10;Entrance into the Haunted Cabin&#10;Enter the path of the door (marked with an arrow). You can not enter if the Ghost or other pirate there.&#10;Remove the round silhouette from the top of the hill. Hold any key face down or the Parrot with face up in front of you.&#10;Devessair and re-enter the Haunted Cabin in new turns if you want to catch another circular silhouette.&#10;&#10;The parrot&#10;When you catch the Parrot, immediately:&#10;&#10;     withdraws at random any silhouette belonging to another player;&#10;     remove a key from the Haunted Cabin, even if there is the Ghost;&#10;     look under any of the chests to see which key opens and future references.&#10;&#10;&#10;In subsequent times, the player who has the Parrot may prefer not to cast the dice, but to repeat 1, 2 or 3.&#10;&#10;The Ghost of the Blackbeard and his Parrot&#10;If the Ghost moves to next to the pirate who has the Parrot, the Blackbeard sends the parrot back to the Haunted Cabin, where it is placed on the top of the hill of circular silhouettes. Then the pirate walks on the board!&#10;&#10;Entrance into the booths with treasure chests&#10;Enter in the same way as described for Haunted Cabin&#10;The bottom of each ark shows what key is needed to open it. Remember this for future references, or if you already have a matching key (with 2 or 3 teeth) prove it to the other players showing them your key and the bottom of the ark. Then open the ark, secretly remove the silhouette (if you still there is one) look at it and keep it face down in front of you. Replace the lid on the chest and&#10;put it back in the cabin. One of the chests does not need a key - just remove the silhouette.&#10;The split key is unnecessary and does not open any ark!&#10;&#10;Duels&#10;Duels are an exciting way to gain weapons, treasure, keys and the Parrot of other pirates.&#10;If you wish to challenge an opponent to a duel, move to the house next to his (do not need to come with exact number) and shout: &quot;Choose the weapons&quot;! You can not challenge him to a duel if he's in a cabin or in his refuge.&#10;Both display the silhouette of a weapon, face up, if you have it. Then roll the dice to decide the outcome of the duel:&#10; * a player with a pistol throws the three dice.&#10; * a player with a sword throws two dice.&#10; * a player without weapons or with a broken sword casts a die.&#10;&#10;The highest value of a single dice designates the winner.&#10;The winner removes any of the silhouettes or the parrot (if any) from the loser along with both weapons used in the duel.&#10;The winner can then, if he wishes, change places with the loser.&#10;&#10;Winner of the game&#10;The first pirate to arrive at his own refuge, having found the treasure is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

During the game's setup, each village is given an unlit lantern (backside of the token). When a player sends one of their heroes through a portal (cave) they come out with a torch. A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Note: This mini expansion is packaged inside the Deluxe Edition.  Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.&#10;&#10;",

It's a game that anybody can learn to play in minutes but spend a lifetime mastering and will be a great addition to your tabletop strategy game collection.&#10;&#10;The board is a square grid divided into 7 rows and 7 columns. Each player begins with two microbes, colored blue or red. The microbes are placed at the four corners of the grid, with blue in the top left and bottom right corners, while red occupies the other corners. Red takes the first turn. During a turn, a player may move one of their microbes one or two spaces in any direction, including diagonally. If the player moves to an adjacent space, a new microbe is created on the space the microbe moved from. If the player moves to a non-adjacent space, the space on which the microbe began the turn remains empty. Any of the opponent's microbes which are in spaces adjacent to the space a player moves onto will be &quot;infected,&quot; turning to the color of the player who has moved. Players are required to move unless no legal move is possible. The game is over when either all cells of the board are filled or all microbes on the board are the same color. The player with the most microbes on the board at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The most money wins.&#10;&#10;Unlike similar table-top games, in Big Time the luck element is minimized. Sure, you&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; of horses, but you won&rsquo;t roll dice and check your horse card to see how far your steed goes. And you won&rsquo;t spend your time making multiple bets on which horse will win the race, either. What you will do is focus on the race itself, and your share of the purse&#10;&#10;Big Time Horse Racing is a thinking person&rsquo;s game. The types of horses in a race, the length of the race, post position and how the race will be run are the important factors. On each turn, players will carefully choose a card to play from their hands &ndash; but only one card will determine the results which will apply to all the horses on the racetrack. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll want your card to be chosen, and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll try to hinder other players instead of helping yourself. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll benefit all horses of your type, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll selfishly give yourself a bonus at the expense of those horses.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll also have to decide when to hold your horse back, when to &ldquo;make your move,&rdquo; what to do in the turns, and even if you&rsquo;ll hand the race to an opponent if you can&rsquo;t finish in the money. There is betting, but it&rsquo;s limited, and thought will be required here, too &ndash; if you want to win the day!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Missions range from simple get-out-alive or search-and-rescue, to elaborate multi-scenario campaigns.&#10;&#10;Each player has a pool of colored dice based on his grunt's skills and attributes. He gains access to more dice and more colors as he levels-up. Players choose and roll dice from their pool, then take actions as allowed by those rolls. The xenomorphs move and attack automatically, triggered by those same dice. Play is simultaneous and in real-time, so the pace of the action can be intense and proceeds as quickly as players can roll and apply results!&#10;&#10;Cards to buff each grunt add a dizzying variety of perks, special abilities, and hi-tech gear. But the hidden beauty of Colonial Marines: Bug Hunt is its innovative dice combat system that brings true wargame tactics to a genre dominated by entries that are rich in theme but light on strategy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Ron Elfman signs on as Guest Editor (after expressing some misgivings about the amount of wood pulp that went into this print run) to bring you some insider info.&#10;&#10;If you want to put on a show, dancing across the pitch, pulling off impressive feats of speed and agility, the Wood Elves are for you. Find an ancient (but sturdy) tree and clamber into its arboreal embrace with this fine volume to spend an afternoon learning about the forest dwellers of Athel Loren.&#10;&#10;Read about the rich history of these unlikely Blood Bowl favorites, including insight into the wide variety of strange woodland Spites, Treemen and Dryads that cheer them on (and sometimes join them)!

    "Description": "Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse is a game of massive battles set in the grim darkness of the far future. If you've ever wanted to field an entire Space Marine Battle Company or household of Imperial Knights (and more besides), then this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;As with Battle-forged armies in Warhammer 40,000, your collections are organised into any of 10 different types of Detachment (and each led by a Commander) that move and fight together on the battlefield. Each Detachment also gains a Faction Ability, enabling you to theme your army by Detachment and include narrative-driven alliances within it.&#10;&#10;The innovative rules for Apocalypse enable you to play massive battles to completion in a matter of hours. Alternating Detachment activations ensures that there is minimal downtime for players, maintaining the fast-paced and exciting action throughout. Damage is resolved in the final phase of each game turn, meaning that even units that are destroyed will still have a chance to make their mark on the battle before they succumb.&#10;&#10;In each turn, players issue Advance, Aimed Fire or Assault orders in secret to each of their Detachments, giving them a chance to bluff, surprise and outmanoeuvre their opponents with their choices.&#10;&#10;Each player constructs a deck of 30 Command Assets (from a choice of 300 included in the set), including a number of faction-specific cards, enabling them to pull off strategic power plays as the battle unfolds. These effects include devastating psychic powers, changes of orders and crucial re-rolls.&#10;&#10;There are six Apocalypse missions to choose from, as well as a mission generator with which to create your own.&#10;&#10;This set contains:&#10;- 120-page Apocalypse Field Manual (including full game rules)&#10;- 6 punchboard sheets of double-sided Apocalypse gameplay tokens&#10;- 300 Command Asset cards&#10;- 12 six-sided dice&#10;- 12 twelve-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The D-Day folio series consists of four separate games, each portraying a portion of the Normandy campaign area. Turns represent two to three days each; the games cover the campaign from the initial landing to the breakout. Each game comes with one map covering a portion of the battlefield at 2.5 miles per hex.

The initial landing is made from both air and sea, but will run into the heart of the German Panzer reserve. Caen was the cork in the Allied bottle and the Germans made every effort to halt progress on this front. In the campaign game, the Allies can &mdash; as they did historically &mdash; use threats on Caen to keep German forces away from the rest of the front and ease the progress elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;17&quot;x22&quot; terrain map&#10;100 die-cut counters&#10;one Eight page system rule booklet&#10;one exclusive scenario rule&#10;10x13 ziplock&#10;5x3 ziplock&#10;&#10;Players: 1-3&#10;Ages: 14+&#10;Hex Scale: 2.5 miles&#10;Play Time: 1-2 hours&#10;Complexity: Low-Med&#10;Solitaire Ability: Medium&#10;&#10;",

Players control robots on a sleep ship whose task is to awaken all the passengers on the ship and usher them to escape pods before the ship explodes!&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who earns the most points as described here:&#10;&#10;The modular hex-shaped-tile board sets out a grid of numbered spaces for the robots to travel on. Located at the corners, where 2 or 3 tiles intersect, are triangular sleep chambers. Each player controls two robots which are placed around the outside edge of the board in the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Robots must follow 3 rules for movement, with the goal of causing sleep chambers to be removed from the board and matched with one of the numbered escape pod cards which are visible to the side of the board (launch bay). Robots must move (1) to an adjacent hex tile, (2) to a space where a sleep chamber sits, (3) to a space whose value is either one higher or one lower than the value of the space the robot moved from.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one of their robots per turn. Removal of a sleep chamber from the board requires 2 steps. When a robot lands on a space where there is a sleep chamber, the chamber will either be lying down (untouched) or standing up (unlocked). &#10;If the sleep chamber is untouched when the robot arrives, it will be pushed out of the space containing the robot and stood up (unlocked). If the sleep chamber is unlocked when the robot arrives, it is pushed out of the space it is in. This push causes the sleep chamber to be removed from the board, assigning to it the number of the space it was pushed to.&#10;&#10;The launch bay contains 18 of the 24 escape pod cards - randomly chosen at the beginning of the game, each with two possible locations to store sleep chambers. Players look to remove chambers from the board that match the numbers of one of 3 available escape pods in the launch bay. If a match is made, the player takes the cards and the sleep chamber to their safe zone and earns 2 points.  If the number of the sleep chamber does not match an available escape pod, but they have an available second space in a pod they have already launched they may place the sleep chamber in this space to earn 1 point.&#10;&#10;One of 3 events will cause the game to end. (1) ALL the sleep chambers are removed from the board. (2) ALL the escape pods have been launched from the launch bay. (3) ONE player (both of their robots) no longer has a legal move.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players count points to determine the winner. In the case of a tie, players count escape pods.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two legendary cyborgs from AvP Arcade Game are now available. Compatible with with AvP board game and Unleashed wargame expansion.&#10;&#10;Dutch Schaeffer is a no-nonsense Major in the USCM and an experimental &lsquo;half-synthetic&rsquo; cyborg developed by Weyland-Yutani Corporation after his arm was torn off in an off-world colonial resistance against a xenomorph hive. The only other known example of a cyborg in the USCM is Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa, who Dutch famously teamed up with after their supporting USCM squads were all but wiped out during a Xenomorph invasion of San Drad, California on Earth. Interestingly, Dutch and Linn also temporarily allied themselves with two yautja during that incursion, but that has since become highly classified and sensitive information, of which both Dutch and Linn have been programmed to forget about due to many suggestive rumours about Weyland-Yutani Corporation involvement. Schaeffer is a heavy-set Olympian of a man, enhanced by bionics throughout his body and carries an impossible to ignore cybernetic arm which he uses to smash his foes into the ground, grapple them, throw them or simply blast them to pieces with the M56 Smartgun mounted within it. Without the physique Schaeffer has maintained for himself, using this device would be practically impossible for any human to utilize.&#10;&#10;Linn Kurosawa is a petite, cyborg soldier, but her size is no means indicative of her combat prowess. Where her counterpart Dutch is a wall of muscle and machine, Linn is a whirlwind of destruction armed with a pair of M7 heavy autopistols and a katana that has been honed to a mono-molecular edge, and able to cut through nearly any armour. Linn&rsquo;s armaments don&rsquo;t end there though, as she has an over-flowing arsenal of martial arts techniques which she applies in all kinds of combinations to deal a crushing, but utterly puzzling, blow to her&#10;adversaries. Since the xenomorph infestation incident of San Drad, Linn has continued to command the 13th USCM company and has seen far more off-world combat than Schaeffer, often in unexpected locations. To this day, Dutch and Linn team up in a variety of combat zones against all manner of foe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Build mechs, buildings, &amp; defenses, produce resources, use research labs to earn new tech, and fight off various monsters, including a giant final boss at the end of the game. Will your organization come out on top in defending New Osaka? Time to see if you have what it takes!&#10;&#10;Background: In the year 2055, a Great War raged across the globe against the vile forces of Max Von Fury. Max was a mad genius bent on taking over the world with his AI infused robotic creations. He very nearly succeeded. Allied forces discovered his home base in the Old Osaka Prefecture of Japan and that was where Max&rsquo;s last stand took place, destroying much of Old Osaka in the process. In his defeat, his final act of defiance was to open portals to another dimension within Neyagawa, Yao, and Ikoma, unleashing great monsters into our world. After a time, other portals started appearing in various nations, small at first, but slowly getting bigger.&#10;&#10;Now, major organizations fight for control over New Osaka, the great bastion standing against the first major source of the monsters. Whichever group proves they have what it takes to defend New Osaka against the monster threat will earn major contracts around the world when the other portals start becoming a threat. Untold power and control awaits the organization that proves itself worthy!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: You have 'motor cars' and characters you use to activate buildings on the map. You have battle mechs you can move around to take over research stations and take on monsters (rolling dice to beat the monster level). Beating monsters produce special resources and points. And you also have production mechs that you can move to factories to produce resources that let you upgrade buildings, mechs, and earn points. The final round, all players fight a giant monster. Players generate points for how they do all of these actions and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the heart of Nethermoor is the broken tower of Arkenspire&mdash;a once-mighty tower built by the sole survivor of the Pheran empire, Szera the Doomchild. Szera&rsquo;s history is inexorably tied to her fortress of Arkenspire.&#10;&#10;Vague written histories of Vaulsk have been deciphered by scholars to reveal that the earthquake (known by the Pheras as &ldquo;the Welcoming&rdquo;) was both prophesied and coordinated by a large faction of Phera necromancers led by the lich-born girl Szera. Despite the accepted Phera practice of worshipping death, the art of necromancy was new and rather taboo in Pheran society. Szera became a plague on Vaulsk, and was eventually banished along with her retinue. The young girl boldly accepted her exile, and went on to found her own kingdom in what would eventually become Aridika. However, Szera had left her stain on the Pheras, and her will continued even in her absence, to the eventual doom of Vaulsk. The Welcoming completely swallowed the capital city, and only the elder Phera who lived in the safety of the ziggurats survived.&#10;&#10;Thus, the greater Pheran empire fell, and its remnants held the lich queen Szera and her burgeoning empire of Aridika directly responsible. The elder Pheras formed a suicide army and crossed the Jaded Depths, determined to tear apart Szera&rsquo;s tower fortress of Arkenspire, stone by stone. Guided by the elder&rsquo;s burgeoning control of the hex magic believed to be released by the Welcoming, the Pheras brought war to Aridika, and gave their collective lives to break apart Arkenspire and its connection to the Arkenhold&mdash;the underworld spiritual prison that Szera sought to rule.&#10;&#10;With their dying breath, the Phera elders spoke the mysterious hexes given to them by the Welcoming and bound Szera&rsquo;s supernatural energies to the very soil of Aridika. While the Doomchild lived, her physical existence was injected into the land itself. The Doomchild was cursed to wander her broken kingdom, seeking a way to break the spell that prevented her from merging the worlds of life and death.&#10;&#10;Eventually, the First Four Heroes of Eastony defeated Szera and bound her in the depths of her wicked ruined tower&hellip; there the Doomchild sleeps, but still schemes, determined to finish her work.&#10;&#10;The Ruins of Arkenspire expansion takes heroes to the accursed tower that was once the Doomchild Szera&rsquo;s seat of power in Aridika. In the heart of Aridika, the entire region of Nethermoor is completely under the control of the Profaned&mdash;a legion of undead abominations that serve their necromantic overlords. As the Profaned begin threatening the provinces surrounding Nethermoor, valiant heroes are needed to push back the undead assault!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, there are worse things lurking around Arkenspire than just the living dead. But the heroes will have to discover those mysteries as they unlock the secrets of the story deck included in Ruins of Arkenspire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the creator of Tournament Fishing, HUNT: The Deckbuilding Game brings the wild back to your table for another fantastically designed game of memory, skill, and timing based on the core system of the first game.&#10;&#10;This time around, you will be heading out alone in a solitaire adventure, facing off against a reigning champion Hunter named Gary. You each will have 13 days to HUNT and bring back as many animals as you can. Do you have what it takes to unseat the current World Champion?&#10;&#10;HUNT is a solo card game that combines familiar elements of deckbuilding along with hand-management. It features multi-use cards that can be used in 3 different ways. The theme is integrated into the game in a very realistic way and hunters will appreciate that and non-hunters will learn a thing or two about the sport all while appreciating the cohesive mechanics.&#10;&#10;Gary is controlled by an AI deck and presents a very consistent and challenging experience every game. There is an element of memory to the game but many ways for the player to make choices to limit that by the cards they buy and in the starting deck itself. Those already familiar with Tournament Fishing will enjoy the familiar mechanics and find something new and unique as well. For those that have not, HUNT is also a great starting point to see if you like the system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
