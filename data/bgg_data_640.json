    "Description": "Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage (also called &quot;Masters Cribbage&quot;) is a card game stemming from the classic Cribbage, with some additional cards. It is played with a standard deck of cards,along with six new types: Super Fives, Zero Card, Super Ace, Wild, Super Card, and the Master Card. In addition it uses a cribbage board which is a signature piece of equipment with holes and pegs for scoring.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib. One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib. The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences. Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board. This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards. Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board. The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points. Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.&#10;&#10;2-players and teams of two play a full length game to 181 points. 3 individuals end play until 141 points. 4 individual players play to a standard cribbage length game of 121 points.&#10;&#10;The six special cards are the crux of the game.&#10;&#10;The Zero Card: When someone plays a card for a 15 or 31 during pegging, play the Zero-Card next to collect an additional 2 points for the 15 or 31. You must play the Zero-Card if you can played in a run or double run with zero, ace, and two.&#10;&#10;The Super Ace: A Super-Ace pairs every ace. You can use a Super-Ace as a high ace for a run of queen, king and Super-Ace for both counting and pegging. The Super-Ace can be played as 1 or 11 during pegging. The value of the Super-Ace is 1 [u]and[/] 11 during counting (as though you had one of each card). The holder can also use as 1 and 11 with fours to total 15 points during counting the hand total.&#10;&#10;Special Fives: Extra fives in play allows the high hand to go from 29 to 45 with 5 fives. The total points of  five 5&rsquo;s is 20. The 15 combinations are 20 and five pairs is another 20 making a total of 40 points.&#10;&#10;Wild Cards: During pegging play you must use the Wild Card at the same face value as the point counting portion of the hand. Play a Wild Card as a seven during pegging, you must count it as a seven when you total your hand&#10;&#10;The Super Wild: The Super-Wild is a Wild Card with one extra feature. It can be played during pegging as one face value and counted at another. You can play a Super-Wild as a seven during pegging and use it as a five during counting. If you play it as a 10 value you must specify it as a 10 or other face card value.&#10;&#10;The Master: The Master is like a Super-Wild played as a separate face value during pegging and counting. The Master allows the extra option to play it after calling &lsquo;go&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Rulebook:&#10;&#10;NAVY is a fantastic and all absorbing pastime in air - naval strategy in which aircraft carriers, cruisers, frigates, submarines, tenders and fighter planes - a total of thirty perfectly detailed models - engage in combat (on a sparkling blue sea plan, criss-crossed by meridians, parallels and clearcut coastlines) to conquer islands, ports and airports, force naval blockades or impede the beforehand selected ever challenging military objectives from being hit or reached by the adversaries. This navy game can be played by two or more players (up to 12) from 8 years upwards.&#10;&#10;IMPORTANT:&#10;This navy game exclude blind luck, so badly needed with cards or dices, because the man-o-war and air attacckers move in precisely the same way as the teal task forces when sent out on a mission, having similar displacement, speed, navy apparel and airplane armaments.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Board represent an hypothetic Pacific Sea divided into meridians and parallels, where only the intersections are marked. There are two home lands drown on the map, and other six movable.&#10;There are two factions in the game (Copper and Nickel) that face each others in order to accomplish certain objectives (capture the flag, dominate the sea, defende transport, tow home a captured enemy frigate ecc... scenarios are countless).&#10;Each faction has always an ADMIRAL, that decide where put the mines (secretly marked on &quot;Admiral's plot&quot;), his fome flag (the tower) and which unit group will move. An Admiral could have COMMANDERS, in charge to manage the units (there could be a commander that handle all units, two commanders that share the army or specific commanders that handle a group or a type of units... depends on the number of players).&#10;&#10;Teams take turn by moving one unit at time (like in chess) orizontally or diagonally without change direction (planes can) and in case check if they hit a target.&#10;Each unit has three characteristics, Life points (1 to 3), speed (2 to 5 crosses) and range (0 to 3 crosses). Submarines can shoot only forward or backwards, and can immerse themselves (admiral removes the miniature from the board and tracks down their path on his plot), Airplanes can be very fast on high altitudes but can bomb (and be shot) only on low altitudes, they also can patrol 12 crosses away from a land or a carrier otherwise are considered lost.&#10;&#10;",

If &quot;Money&quot; is something the player does not have, then he misses the next turn.&#10;If a player is stopped at a sign (speed sign), he exceeded the speed limit when cornering. Pay a fine - the card in 1 G currency value. After that you can move on. If &quot;Money&quot; is something the player does not have, he/she must turn to where the arrow points. &#10;If a player is stopped at the sign with a blue circle, then a card with &quot;Money&quot; is lost.&#10;If the player is stopped at a sign (arrow), he must move forward one character.&#10;The player who stopped at a sign (crossing), may, in his/her next turn to turn in any direction indicated by arrows.&#10;You win the game when you reach the end first.&#10;&#10;Hint! Sometimes it is good to choose longer route to save money, because they are safer. &#10;And for beginners it is good to show the signs before the game starts, as a memory training!&#10;&#10;",

What makes the game something other than a trivial exercise is that the person whose turn it is, is always the player with the lower score, which means that getting too far ahead can ultimately set you behind, as your opponent takes several turns in a row. The winner is the player whose claimed numbers have the highest sum.&#10;&#10;Because the shape of the board is irrelevant (technically, you could play by grabbing numbered chips from the middle of the table), the designer gave the game some visual appeal by making the board square, with numbered spaces set up like the board was broken into fragments.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(((Work on this title will start again in 2016)))&#10;&#10;Loosely based on stock trading, company ownership and economic stability.&#10;&#10;Each player will start the game with a small fund and during the first round will vie for low priced stock to gain control of one or more of the companies in the game. The players will then get turns to make decision of how to grow the companies they control while adding to their personal account, company account and making sure the global economy does not go bankrupt.&#10;&#10;The player can buy upgrades in a number of different fields to grow the company profits each round. This in turn will move the stock price higher for that company. If you are invested into a company you don't own and you feel the current owner is not doing enough for the company you can try and make the deals needed to buy out controlling stock in the company or you can dump your stock and send the price falling down.&#10;&#10;The game will comprise of only about 20% random mechanic. Just as in real life, the best laid plans can cur-come to unexpected events. On the players turn they must roll to see how many actions are allowed for their current turn...however if you need more actions, you may buy them.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most money in the personal account at games end. While you will most likely be a company owner during the course of play, you do not need to be an owner of a company at any point to win...just make the right investments.&#10;&#10;Buy Low / Sell High&#10;Invest and Win&#10;&#10;The game will incorporate player to player interaction and company to company interaction...a company can also own stock in other companies. It would not be unheard of for one company by game end to have controlling stock holdings over ALL the other companies.&#10;&#10;Unique game-board will allow players to write onto it with vis-vis type markers, to track market progress&#10;&#10;",

Thus getting on top of a neighboring piece and blocking it takes a roll of a two. &#10;A player that cannot make a legal move with his/her roll is eliminated, unless he/she still has one or more of his/her playing pieces outside the board (i.e. not used yet).

    "Description": "This is a card game for 7 players. It is based around Space Pirates. Though similar to BANG!, there are several unique twists. Each player has his own unique objective, and his own unique card set based on his own unique alien race. Each player commands a ship that has 15 Hit Points. Hits are usually taken using Dice. However, while some players may have powerful attacks, the focus of the game for many players is not to destroy the other players but to accomplish an objective.&#10;&#10;Samples:&#10;Akzinal - A traditional thief. His goal is to capture all treasures.&#10;Felian - A snakelike race, the Felian are tremendously territorial. Their objective is to be the last Faction standing.&#10;Homin - This hominid race lived relatively peacefully until an alien race sent an explosive that destroyed many lives, not including the lives that were lost. The Homin Captain seeks to find and neutralize the alien menace.&#10;Morph - As their name suggests, the Morph are a race of appearance-altering people who have developed their ships to transform as well. Always seeking to attain transcendence, the Morph try to do so by learning from other people. Their objective is to acquire technologies from all other factions.&#10;Ralyk - Wolf Men. Because their genetics prevent their reproduction, the only way they can continue as a race is to (naturally) turn others into Wolf Men. They prominently seek out the Alphas of each species. This said, their objective is to capture all opposing Captains through duel or by kidnapping.&#10;Var*por - A squidlike race who travel aboard live ships. These ships look like rays but hold solar powers. Thus they are called StarRay in first phase and SunRay in later phase. The objective is to raise a StarRay to its second phase and lead it to a New Birth phase where another StarRay is born.&#10;Wallaboo - A small teleporting Kangaroo race who stow away on ships and influence the playing field. They maneuver game play while attempting to remain unnoticed and escape capture. Their objective is to be free aboard the winning ship.&#10;&#10;Objectives that are well thought out with interesting back-story, only made more incredible by the fact that this game is so easy to play.&#10;&#10;As stated, each faction has their own unique abilities, but a shared deck unites them all. In this shared deck are Detonator Cards (the central card which allows players to make basic attacks or to play their faction cards), Evasion Tactics which protect ships from attack, Quick Fix cards to restore Hit Points, Steal cards that allow players to steal Faction abilities from other factions (including Captains and Treasures), Void cards which return continuous abilities to their decks, and other (more unique) abilities.&#10;&#10;Dueling, a major factor of Traditional Bang, is now done exclusively in battle for captains. (All players may Duel for opposing captains, as Captain cards hold unique abilities. This was also true of Traditional Bang). This does not require the use of cards. Any player can Duel with an opponent that has less than 1/2 Hit Points. Each Captain has his own HP rating, and a series of D6 Dice Rolls resolves a Duel. The winner retains the opponent's captain along with his unique ability.&#10;&#10;Another new feature of Shores of Heaven is a mini game called Common Threat, wherein 2 D6's are rolled and the values are multiplied. Players must work together to destroy the Common Threat before returning to play. Each player who fails to neutralize the threat loses 1 HP. The Victor redeems all lost HP.&#10;&#10;FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLE RULE SET. SOON, WITH PRINTABLE CARDS TO BE UPLOADED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME WITHIN A FEW MINUTES...&#10;&#10;START &#10;Along with cards, you will need a D4 and a D6 to play. (Unique sided dice are usually inexpensive and can be found on the internet or at specialty board game shops.)&#10;After Starting Position has been determined, each player pulls a faction at random from the SPECIES deck. This card remains face up until the faction is removed from play. There are two SPECIES decks, only one of which has a WALLABOO card. If the WALLABOO card is chosen, the Wallaboo faction keeps the additional SPECIES deck to mark his current position. His position is revealed to only the player who plays the IMPRISONMENT card. (Each faction has an IMPRISONMENT card in his FACTION deck.) If the Wallaboo plays his TRUCE card, his position is then revealed to all players.&#10;At this point, all players but the Homin also receive a THREAT card, distinguishing them as a Menace or as Benign.&#10;OBJECTIVES:&#10;Akz&iacute;nal - Acquire all treasures. This can be done using a STEAL card from the SHARED deck or a FILCH card from your personal deck. The treasure is returned to your opponent if 1) It is VOIDED. 2) It is STOLEN. 3) It is taken back using 2 DETONATOR cards. 4) You are destroyed. (It is reshuffled into the FACTION deck.)&#10;Felian - Be the last Faction standing. Your Treasure card can help, as it allows you to regenerate after 1 round destroyed. This card stays in effect until it is stolen or voided.&#10;Homin - Hunt and neutralize the Menace. THREAT cards distributed at the start of play determine the Menace. If the Menace is destroyed by someone else, THREAT cards are redistributed. You must destroy the Menace yourself.&#10;Morph - Steal and hold Faction cards from each opponent. These are considered learned abilities, and may be made Lasting Effects, regardless of status, as long as your treasure is in play. (See CARD SYMBOLS for details.) Addendum: Wallaboo movement cards effect range. Sabotage card (in Wallaboo deck) counts against your HP, and is returned to the Wallaboo deck as soon as acquired.&#10;Ralyk - Acquire all Captains. This can be done using a Steal card, or by Dueling. (See CAPTAIN DUEL for details.) If an opponent&rsquo;s ship is destroyed, his captain is left out, and a Steal card can acquire the Captain for you. &#10;V&auml;r&middot;por - Raise your StarRay to New Birth phase. See SunRay gauge. (This is a narrow purple sheet marked with 15 movements and contains pictures of SunRays at all phases.)&#10;Wallaboo - Remain free aboard the winning faction&rsquo;s ship. If imprisoned (See Imprisonment cards), you cannot play any of your cards. You can, however, discard and collect cards each round until you hold the Escape card. (Since it has a cost of 2 Detonator cards, you will want those in your hand when you find it.)&#10;CARDS You will start with 2 FACTION cards and 5 SHARED DECK cards. This is the maximum number of cards you will hold in your hand. However, both at the start and end of your turn you will be able to replenish your hand. (Thus Attack does not penalyze Defense.) You may only discard unwanted cards at the end of your turn, before replenishing your hand. &#10;Cards of the same type may be stacked to boost effect. I.E. Because of this, a player who has 2 FOCUS cards may be able to roll a maximum value of 8 with a D4.&#10;CARD SYMBOLS Each card likely has 1 or both of 2 symbols. The first is LE (Lasting Effect). The card may be played down to be in permanent use. The second is #D. This indicates how many Detonator cards must be played to use the card. If the LE has a #D over it, this indicates that there is a cost to make the card a lasting effect. If the card has LE and #D on opposite cards, it may be played as a Lasting Effect but you must play as many Detonator cards for each use.&#10;CAPTAINS&rsquo; DUEL - Each Captain Card has a number in the upper right corner. This is how many hits a captain may take before he is defeated. Each time a Duel takes place, both captains start with full HP. Both captains roll a D6. When one opponent rolls higher, the opposite loses 1 HP. This is repeated until 1 captain is lost. Captains may only back out of a Captains&rsquo; Duel if a truce is agreed upon. The winner keeps the opponent&rsquo;s captain as prisoner and can use the additional Captain&rsquo;s ability freely. If you lose your Captain, you can only rescue the captain using a Steal card, or a Void card. Any captain can duel with an opponent&rsquo;s captain so long as the challenged opponent has less than &frac12; HP. &#10;VOID - This card usually means the opponent forfeit&rsquo;s a card of his choice. However, if you play a VOID card with a DETONATOR card, you may roll a D4. Rolling a 4 or higher (using bonus cards) can give you the ability to choose which Lasting Effects are voided. This can prove a useful tool in recollecting Captains and Treasures as the VOID card returns cards to their Faction decks.&#10;COMMON THREAT - When this card is found, it is played immediately. Roll 2 D6&rsquo;s, and multiply the scores. Each player in succession uses their attack cards to destroy the common threat. If the player fails to destroy the threat, he loses 1 HP. This continues until the threat is destroyed. The Victor receives all lost HP. The player of this card may determine the initial opponent after the dice roll. (This means that some clever calculation can result in a quick HP boost for him.)&#10;RANGE  - Unless otherwise stated, all attacks have a range of 1 in either direction. Captains&rsquo; Duel is maximum range. &#10;TREASURES - All opponents may steal treasures to use opponents&rsquo; treasure abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Pavlov&rsquo;s House became the name of one particularly well-defended apartment building, its moniker gained from Sergeant Yakov Pavlov, who commanded the platoon which first seized the building and which kept defending it throughout the battle. The house was a four-story building in the city-center of Stalingrad, overlooking a large square, the  9th January Square . The small garrison established anti-tank and machine-gun posts at the windows and held off all attacks for fifty-nine days. Each time enemy infantry or panzers attempted to reach the defenders, Pavlov&rsquo;s men took them under heavy fire littering the square with corpses and wreckage. Eventually the defenders, as well as the Russian civilians who remained in the basement throughout, held on until 25 November 1942, when they were relieved by counter-attacking Soviet forces.&#10;&#10;This is STALIN'S FURY, a brand new set of four scenarios + a new 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on heavyweight stock.

To do this, you roll a die, and your pig must travel forward around the board and land on the same space as or pass by another pig -- when this happens, that pig's player must toss one energy disk into the game box.&#10;&#10;The main deviation from this pattern comes when a pig lands by exact count on one of the five sparkling starter spaces in the arena.  When this happens, the player has three choices at the beginning of the next turn.  To continue on, to reverse direction and move, or to roll the Die of Power; the Die of Power may cause you to lose your turn, reclaim an energy disk, move 5 spaces or teleport to any space, designate another player to lose a disk, or let you become the Turbo Cochon (Pig), who teleports, forces another player to lose an energy disk, and collects that disk all in one fell swoop.

But your patriarch is in failing health, and his sons must prove who is the most worthy of Hokkaido! Hokkaido is the second game in Blue Panther's &quot;Trailblazer Series&quot;, following Nepal. Featuring quick gameplay, key decisions every turn, and just a little bit of conflict. Hokkaido is a strategy game with a Euro feel for 2-4 players that plays in an hour or less. Players take the role of a clan leader in feudal Japan, trailblazing trade routes and holding on to them in an effort to convince the Shogun that they are worthy to rule the isle of Hokkaido. Three actions per turn, seven actions to choose from including move, grow, sea move, claim public trade route, draw a card, discard, reveal private trade route. An important decision or two every turn, and never enough actions to get it all done. Conflict can be used, but sparingly, when a province is overpopulated. A simple and robust combat mechanic rewards players who plan ahead. Victory is won through control of key trade routes and area control. Population limits scale with the number of players to ensure a tight board for any number of players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FROM THE PUBLISHER&quot;S INTRODUCTION (EXCEPTS):&#10;&#10;Skirmish! is a quick-to-learn, easy-to-set-up game of combat that can be played using almost any miniatures figures.  The point of this game is to simulate small-scale battles and to play as well as possible and to have fun, win or not.&#10;Skirmish! is intended for both veteran and novice players.  It is simple enough to be a beginner's first wargame, and versatile and expandable enough to satisfy more experienced gamers, especially those who want to pull out some of their old toy soldiers out of a footlocker or the closet and use them in a game.&#10;&#10;Skirmish! is designed for simplicity and playability.  The basic rules can be read, a handful of soldiers selected, and a game set up in about 20 minutes, and in much less time than that for players already familiar with the rules.  And, while their emphasis is on playability, these rules allow for consistency, taking the gaming action up at least a few steps from merely &quot;playing soldiers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Would-be hardcore gamers mau complain that these rules are not &quot;realistic&quot;.  Sure they are.  They are just exceptionally streamlined, and in the spirit of &quot;playing soldiers&quot; are simple and flexible.  There are no cumbersome charts or combat matrices, no supporting papaerwork to keep track of a game in play, and a minimum of simple tables.  Most attacks can be completely resolved with a simple roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;Anything beyond the basic rules is optional.  With the incorporation of selected optional rules, Skirmish! can be made as complex as is enjoyable for the players.  Most players will eventually, if not initially, want to use some of the optional rules.&#10;&#10;From RPGnow.com:&#10;&#10;This book is part of a thematic series of works on miniatures wargaming published by Skirmisher that includes the H.G. Wells books Little Wars and Floor Games, the company&rsquo;s spinoff Little Orc Wars rules, and the Quactica miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1) What is Sector?&#10;Sector is a board game, for 2 to 4 players. The game is based on the strategic occupation of the game board. Taking turns, the participants role a normal cube die and place pieces on the board, according to preset rules. Some of the pieces, or some of the squares where the pieces can be placed, have specific properties that affect how that particular turn is played. Players who can't, in their turn, place the required pieces on the squares of the board are eliminated. The winner is the last surviving player.&#10;&#10;2) What do I need to play Sector?&#10;(a) A game board (15x15 squares), with special squares marked;&#10;(b) 225 normal pieces and 20 special pieces (per 2 players);&#10;(c) Nontransparent bag(s) or box(es) for the pieces;&#10;(d) One cube (1-6) die.&#10;&#10;3) Let's start the game. Who plays first?&#10;Let the players throw the die and the person with the highest number goes first. After that, the turn proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;4) What does each turn consist of?&#10;(a) Roll the die.&#10;(b) Take the number of pieces corresponding to the value obtained in that particular throw from the nontransparent bag and place the pieces, in a straight line, on the board. If you happen to draw a special piece or the last piece happens to end in a special square, certain other rules apply.&#10;&#10;5) It's my first turn. I've rolled the die. Where should I begin?&#10;In the first turn, all players start in any chosen square, on the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;6) How can I place my pieces?&#10;The pieces, always corresponding to the number obtained with the throw of the die, must be placed in a straight line. You are not allowed to turn in a different direction nor are you allowed to place one piece over another. The line, except obviously in the first turn, must always start from a preexisting piece belonging to the current player.&#10;&#10;7) What are special squares?&#10;Special squares are clearly marked squares on the board that have a unique propertie. When a line, in a turn, ends on a special square, the current player can place, if possible, an extra piece on any other free special square in the board. This only happens when the turn ends on a special square, not when it crosses a special square. The extra piece is only taken from the nontransparent bag when all other pieces are in place.&#10;&#10;8) And special pieces? What are they?&#10;Special pieces are distinctly marked pieces that allow the player to convert, if possible, adjacent opponent pieces into his own. They are mixed up with the normal pieces in the nontransparent bag and are taken, eventually, by chance, when the player is taking the number of pieces obtained by the role of the die or taking a piece for a special square as described above. Special pieces can be used at any point of the line and in any direction as chosen by the current player. The drawing in the special piece shows the allowed positions from which the opponent&acute;s piece(s) can be converted into a player&acute;s piece. In the drawing, on the piece, a dark circle represents the player special piece and the light circles represent the the allowed conversion positions.&#10;&#10;Description from the author.&#10;&#10;",

During your turn, you roll a die and MUST use all your movement points that turn.  You can move either your own pieces or the pedestrians.  The first player to get their trio home first wins.  Crosswalk may not look deep, but it is surprisingly fun and replayable.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you can stack pyramids of any color, either helping score potential points for yourself or to eliminate rival pyramids.  If all your pyramids leave play, you lose!  Otherwise, when there are no more moves, if you have more pips worth of pyramids in towers you control, you win.  Stack Control combines the shared pieces of Volcano with the scoring mechanism of IceTowers, and bears a striking similarity to Sid Sackson's Focus.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Designer's own description:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Tiltyard is a sort of multi-round trick taking game, somewhat like a cross between the Sedma Group and a beating game. The game is themed around jousting events (the lance, the axe, and the sword) so there are three rounds with two &quot;passes&quot; each. One player leads a card and the other must play a higher card of the same colour, or a matching card of the opposite colour, or pass. If they play a card, then the trick continues and the other player faces the same three options. This continues until someone passes, the other player captures all of the cards played to the trick. At the start of the game, each player chooses 3 Royal Favours (court cards or Aces). These cards can be activated at the beginning of a round to impart a special ability to the owner (for instance, a Jack adds +1 to the value of all cards of its colour). They also determine which cards will be used for scoring your captured tricks: only cards of the majority colour within the 3 Royal Favours are counted.&quot;&#10;&#10;All you need to play are the rules (PDF file) and a standard deck of cards.&#10;&#10;",
