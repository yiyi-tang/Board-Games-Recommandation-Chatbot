    "Description": "Crazyhouse is a chess variant very similar to bughouse chess, but with only two players. It effectively incorporates a rule in shogi (Japanese chess), in which a player can introduce a captured piece back to the board as his own.&#10;&#10;* A captured piece reverses color (useful to have 2 sets on hand for this variant) and goes to the capturing player's 'reserve', or 'pocket'. At any time, instead of making a move with a piece on a board, a player can 'drop' a piece, in his reserve, onto an empty square on the board.&#10;    * Promoted but captured pawns are dropped as pawns.&#10;    * Pawns must not be dropped on the 1st or 8th ranks.&#10;    * Drops which cause immediate checkmate are allowed. Unlike in shogi, this includes pawn drops.&#10;    * A check that would cause checkmate, in regular chess, can be answered if the defender can make a legal drop which blocks the check.&#10;&#10;",

This isn't easy, because Kroko can scare them away.&#10;&#10;How it is played: Each player gets eight &quot;monkeys&quot; and tries to move them towards the trees. Throwing a 1-4 means moving the same number of spaces. A 5 means you have to move one of your monkeys away from start. If you throw the Kroko side of the die, you give Kroko a push, i.e. you tip the crocodile-shaped spinner in the middle of the board. When Kroko stops, his big tooth points to a specific section of the board. All the monkeys in this area are scared and run back to the start.&#10;Special spaces include Kroko spaces (player has to push Kroko), spaces where a monkey is safe, and liana spaces which allow a monkey to climb to a free space in a tree. The game ends when all tree spaces are occupied. The player who got the highest number of their monkeys to the trees wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CodyCards is a fast and light card game based on the traditional games of 31/Scat/Blitz/Ride The Bus; players compete in rounds to avoid having the lowest scoring hand of 3 cards.  It is played with a custom deck of 54 cards in 4 suits (with values ranging from 1 to 10) but can be played with a normal deck with slight modification.  A print-to-play edition exists.&#10;&#10;The story of the game is that a bird named &quot;Cody&quot; is trying to steal coins from the players.  At the start of the game each player gets 3 coins.  At the end of each round one of the players will wake him up and he will then steal a coin from the weakest player at that time.  Players try to avoid having the worst hand at the time that the bird wakes up.  The game ends when all but one player have lost all of their coins.  Players have to decide when it's to there advantage to try to force the end of a round -- but trying to end the round may invoke a penalty and often results not in the end of the round but in a sneak peek at a trump card which affects scoring.&#10;&#10;Basic Gameplay:&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the dealer (who rotates clockwise after every round) shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player, and then shuffles 2 random cards along with the special Cody-the-Bird card and sets these aside face down as the &quot;nest&quot; pile.  The dealer then places the remaining cards face down in a draw pile, and turns the first one over face up as the discard pile. Starting with the player to the dealer's left and going clockwise, a player's turn consists of either: Taking the top face down card from the draw pile, or taking the top face up card from the discard pile, or knocking on Cody's Nest door.&#10;&#10;If the player chooses to take a card, they then immediately discard one card from their hand face up on the discard pile and play proceeds clockwise (exception: once per round players may &quot;bury&quot; their discard face down). If they choose to knock on Cody's door, they take a peek at the top card in the Nest.  If it's Cody the Bird, then it is turned face up and everyone has one more round to try to get a better hand.  If it's not, the peeked at card is set aside in a special &quot;Trump&quot; pile, and the player who peeked has some advance information about how hands will be scored at the end.  There are also a few special cards that allow players to perform actions out of turn.&#10;&#10;The round ends when Cody the Bird is revealed, and at that point hands are scored and the lowest scoring player loses a coin.  Hand value is based on:  The sum value of up to 3 cards of the same suit, OR having a 3-card straight of the same suit (33 points), or having 3 cards of same face value (33 points).  But having cards in a revealed trump suit will decrease the hand score.  There is also a penalty for being the player to knock on Cody's Nest and end the round.&#10;&#10;Strategy:&#10;&#10;While there is a lot of luck in the game, there are some real strategic elements as well.  Players must decide which cards to hold and draw that will be most likely to give them the highest scoring hand.  To do this they must consider which cards have already been discarded and they must take into account the information they reveal to other players when they discard or choose a face-up discard card.  In addition, players must decide when they have a good enough hand to take the risk of trying to end the round -- knowing that they will pay a scoring penalty for doing so.  The moment when a player &quot;Knocks on Cody's Door&quot; is typically accompanied by curses and laughter as players find out if the round is really ending, or if a Trump suit is being revealed that will help or hurt them, and make emergency plans to quickly improve their hand before the round ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a continuation of the Leningrad&ndash;Novgorod Offensive of January 1944, the Soviet Estonian operation pushed the front westward to the Narva River, aiming to thrust deep into Estonia. Stalin's main strategic goal was a quick recovery of&#10;Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia.&#10;&#10;The German answer was a stout defence for the possession of the strategically important Narva Isthmus.&#10;Army Group Narwa&trade; is a board game depicting this event in time.&hellip;.&#10;&#10;The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river in February. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counter attacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944.&#10;&#10;Army Group Narwa&trade; covers the first three months of the Narva Bridgehead campaign where each turn represents one week.&#10;Army Group Narwa&trade; is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players. It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Plan West, K&#195;&#182;nigsberg '45 and Stargard Solstice.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a chit-pull system telling you which armies to move.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;- Book-case box&#10;- 70 x 50 cm map (28 x 20 in)&#10;- 300 die-cut counters&#10;- Game rules&#10;- 2 dice&#10;&#10;",

Instead of playing individual countries for individual players, my rules NOW have all the countries going together at the same time, the incomes are still separate and Japan still controls Japan's income, etc, but NOW ALL players will conduct their turns all at one time, with separate incomes for separate countries and they will all purchase their units at the same time, their turns at the same time, placed on the same &quot;Place Units&quot; board on the game and all playing pieces are color-coded like the regular game. Germany spends income on Germany's pieces and places them in German-held territories with industrial complexes, and Britain does the same, etc on down the line.&#10;&#10;United States is NOT at war with anyone and therefore cannot declare war, unless and Axis player declares war on it first or after its 3rd turn for example, like in the real Global game.&#10;The question of ownership of the Dutch territories in the game has been solved. Players will no longer need to land grab the Dutch territories in the wake of Hollland's collapse. Instead, ownership will go to the United Kingdom because they control and are patrons of the Dutch Govt in Exile in London  and the Dutch Govt. In Exile is under British control, therefore they belong to the United Kingdom. They will receive the usual bonus for having posession of them. See my PDF document for additonal changes.&#10;&#10;The goals of the game are similar to a regular Axis &amp; Allies game. The Axis will capture London, Paris, Kiev, Moscow, and Washington. The Allies will capture the Axis capitals of Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome.&#10;&#10;The players are France, Soviet Union, Italy, United Kingdom,(Pacific and Europe) and USA.  The goals for the Axis and the Allies are the same as Europe 1940 and Global 1940. Nothing's changed there.&#10;&#10;The Allies capture the Axis capitals of Berlin and Rome.&#10;&#10;The rules are the same as regular Axis &amp; Allies.&#10;&#10;I wanted to expand upon the whole Axis &amp; Allies game by adding more to it.  This pack also adds new territories, such as Crimea. Crimea is now important for control of Sea zone 125 as it was in real life. The Black Sea Fleet is also represented with one Battleship and 1 destroyers, and 1 Transports. The Romanian fleet and Russian fleet will inhabit the same waters, but Romania will not be at war until Germany is at war with the Soviet Union because Romania and Hungary are controlled by Germany.&#10;&#10;There also new rules regarding the setup.&#10;&#10;Germany will receive 1 Major Industrial Complex in Romania to represent the Ploesti oil refinery, which was a large portion of Germany's oil production and gasoline in World War II and 1 Major Industrial Complex for Slovakia-Hungary, which was a large portion of Germany's armaments production that supplied the Germans with the tanks they used to invade France in 1940.&#10;&#10;",

The game comprises of artifacts in the form of 'dinosaur bone sets' or 'relics'. There is no limits of appraisal attached with these artifacts although hold minimum of one appraisal. The player can bid for these throughout the game.&#10;&#10;However, the dinosaur bones have one distinct feature that each type of dinosaur, there are three bone set in the form of head, tail and torso, which are gained by players separately and if a player able to acquire all three parts of the same dinosaur, than it comprises one artifact and its value doubled.&#10;&#10;The main objective of the game is to collect as many artifacts as possible along with searching for the jackpot while moving through the board. The player can gain extra appraisals and can trade, buy or auction the relics during the game. The appraisals have three level; red, blue and white. When the white appraisal exhausted, the game concludes.&#10;&#10;The main strategy includes the removal of 'Fake' appraisal while comprising 'dinosaur bone artifact' as it the only time the 'fake' can be removed. At the end of the game playing having the jackpot appraisal won the cash from the jackpot box along with 'scratch off value card' as well as pre-game ante. The player having the most value of artifacts declared winner, however the player can not win ante, without possessing jackpot.&#10;&#10;",

Black takes the first turn of the game. From then on, each player takes two turns in succession before the other player moves. The object of the game is to have the most territory (and hence most stones) when the board is full.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;http://blog.zmxv.com/2010/12/rin-abstract-strategy-game.html&#10;Demo:&#10;http://beta.appspot.com/rin/demo.html&#10;&#10;",

The first player to do so wins the round and scores points based on the symbol matched, the guards lost and the opponents guards eliminated. As pairs of symbols need capturing, if an any time a player has only one guard left they are eliminated - leading to a secondary win condition.&#10;&#10;In each turn a player moves two guards eliminating (jumping over and removing) any opponets within reach. Chi symbols can only be occupied if capturing is not possible. There are 6 games, but as the rules (and aim) for each are identicle these seem to be more like variants rather than fully fledged games.&#10;Due to the mechanic of capturing these games play similar to checkers but the Chi matching alters the strategy quite well.&#10;&#10;The six games are called: Tae Kwon Do (2 Players - Front Board), Aikido (4 Players - Back Board), Kung-Fu (4 Players - Front Board), Karate (2 Players - Back Board), Judo (2 Players - Front Board) and Jujitsu (2 Players - Back Board).&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is martial arts, however this is not crutial and seems tacked on. The identical game would work, for example, with a space theme or a roman warrior theme. As with all abstracts the theme is not that important.&#10;&#10;",

Each pitch is divided up into 10 squares across and 6 squares down. The rows across are represented by the letters A to F. The columns down are marked 1 to 10. So every square can be chosen by giving a letter and a number A7 or C2, for example. The idea is to trace a line from Row F up to row A, without running into a T square which represents a tackle.&#10;&#10;",

It appears to be a magic scroll, used for summoning a wolf spirit.&#10;&#10;You hear a clattering behind you, and the hairs on the back of your neck prickle.  You turn to see a crazed-looking goblin shuffling towards you with a rusty scimitar in its hands.  Quickly, you snatch up the sword.  The goblin lunges at you.  You clumsily block its attack, then thrust forward and impale the foam-mouthed creature.  It slumps to the ground, dead.&#10;&#10;You have no idea how you got here or why you are here.  But you have a few tools at your disposal, and you are going to find a way out.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dungeon Shift is a print-and-play solo dungeon-crawling card game.  The player begins the game with four cards from the Equipment deck and must use those cards to overcome the various challenges presented by the Rooms, Monsters, and Traps in the Obstacle deck.

Along the way, you may step on special spaces that will give you sparks (the &quot;currency&quot; of this game), cards, or allow you to activate your unique Robopower!&#10;&#10;On your turn you may do these things:&#10;- roll a 6-sided die 2 times &#10;- spend sparks if you have them&#10;- play cards if you have them&#10;You can do these in any order. You can spend sparks &#10;or play cards between die rolls.&#10;&#10;Of course, racing is only part of it: the other part is fighting! You can attack your opponents with the cards in your hands , which usually represent a gizmo you can use offensively. You can also spend 3 red sparks to shoot opponents... and of course, as the name implies, you can crash into them!&#10;&#10;Players are never eliminated from the game, they continue racing until a winner crosses the finish line!&#10;&#10;",

Each goal card is labeled home, city or factory and shows two, three or four eco symbols, respectively, the symbols being air, water, energy and natural resources. Each player starts with a hand of five eco cards; most of these cards show one or two eco symbols, along with a description of what this solution represents, e.g., &quot;Recycle used paper&quot; shows one tree (natural resource) while &quot;Front-loading washers&quot; shows one water and one energy.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either starts a stack of cards on the table in front of him (with at most three stacks in play), adds up to one card to each stack in play, or else discards any number of cards from hand. The player can also play one action card (of which there are five in the deck) and claim one goal card, assuming he has the needed eco symbols in a stack and the environmental solutions match the situation shown on the goal. (&quot;Carpool lanes&quot; are useless in providing clean air at home.)&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, he refills his hand to five cards. When a goal card is claimed, another goal card is revealed. Once the final goal card is claimed, the player with the most goals wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player who has the most eco symbols on his goal cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

After that the player must try to stop on of the six rhombus shaped areas to access the middle area again, where they started.

The artwork is reminiscent of an arena filled with gladiators being cheered on by thousands of fans.&#10;&#10;Game-play:&#10;The game board consists of a 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid, players start in the corners, are given 10 life tokens, and dealt 5 cards each.  There are 3 different types of cards in the full deck of 126 cards: black Movement Cards, red Combat Cards, and full color Item Cards.  The players draw back up to a full hand of 5 cards at the beginning of each turn, allowing the player to use all their cards on their turn or hold some back to defend against attacks on the other players' turns.  Each successful attack causes the defender to lose a life token.&#10;&#10;The Center Square:&#10;The center square of the 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid has special properties for both attackers and defenders.  If an attacker is occupying the center square and successfully lands an attack on the defender, the defender loses 2 life tokens.  If the defender is in the center square and the attacker successfully lands an attack, the attack has the choice of the defender taking the hit (and losing one life token) or knocking the attacker out of the center square and into any available adjacent square.  This can setup the attacker for various combinations for dealing additional damage on a second attack on the defender by first occupying the now available center square.&#10;&#10;Movement Cards:&#10;Movement Cards allow the players to move their miniature one square either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.&#10;&#10;Combat Cards:&#10;The Combat Cards are used to attack opponents either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.  The strength of the attack is determined by the number in the corner of the card.  Combat Cards are also used to defend against attacks and are successful if the defender's card is equal to or greater than the number on the attacker's card.  Combat cards can only be played against another player if their miniatures are adjacent, unless using the throwing axe (see Item Cards below).&#10;&#10;Item Cards:&#10;The Item Cards include various weapons, armor, and other items to modify the numbers on the Combat Cards.  If a player has the two handed axe equipped (+4 to attack) and plays a Combat Card with a 7, the defender must counter the attack with an 11 or higher.  If the defender had a shield equipped (+3 to defense), then only an 8 or higher is required to defend the attack.  Bonuses to attack and defend do stack, but each player can only have 2 cards equipped and certain cards cannot be equipped at the same time as any others.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;Be the last player standing.&#10;&#10;",

The high bidder of the open auction gets the cards and the amount spent is noted. The game continues until the deck is depleted. (There are four cards left over. I presume these cards are not auctioned but the rules don&rsquo;t say.) The value of the cards won by each player is totaled and their value is subtracted from the amount spent. The player with the highest grand total is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Deluxe Edition includes play money. Players are given $6000 in this edition and are forbidden to spend more than that.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blitzkrieg in the West was designed by Joseph Miranda. It is the first in our new series of &ldquo;Blitzkrieg Campaigns&rdquo;, two player wargames covering the great mobile campaigns of World War II. Blitzkrieg in the West puts you in command of either the German armed forces, or the Allies, during the epic campaign for the Low Countries and France in 1940. The system uses a combination of counters, maps and cards to give players the full range of options in emerging modern warfare, with a new twist: each player has different operational capabilities, generated by cards picked in secret before start of play.&#10;&#10;This allows for tradeoffs between additional mobile capabilities for armor, enhanced fortification effects, specialized types of air missions, and even airborne special operations. This allows for a wide range of game strategies, and ensures that every play of the game will be different. It also allows players to explore the various &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options of the original campaign. Players will be in the position of their historical predecessors, who can exploit new forms of warfare.&#10;&#10;Mechanized ground unit are represented as divisions, while infantry are corps level. Headquarters can provide non-divisional support. Air units are different types of groups, differentiated by aircraft models. Special rules include shock effect, national morale, flooding lowland areas, establishing bridgeheads across rivers, open cities, and much more.&#10;&#10;The counters are beautifully printed and die cut with full color on both sides. The game box is 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game comes with extensive historical notes, providing some new insights into the climactic campaign of 1940 which changed the fate of Europe.&#10;&#10;",

The land is rich, travelers abound, and there is money to be had in founding a village!  Will you create an economic hub, or a haven for the underprivileged?  Will you foster the arts, or train mighty soldiers?  When people gather and speak of your village, what tales will they tell?&#10;&#10;Village Tale is a Print and Play Card Drafting game inspired by Satoshi Nakamura's Fairy Tale.  The game takes place over four rounds of play.  In each round, players are dealt six or seven cards.  Each player chooses one card and passes the rest of the cards to his or her neighbor (alternating left and right each round).  From the remaining cards, players choose one and pass the rest, and so on, until no cards are left to pass.&#10;&#10;From those cards, players simultaneously play one card into one of the four districts of their village (north, south, east, and west).  Any card effects are resolved.  Then players play three more cards, one at a time in this fashion.  Players discard their remaining cards, and go on to the next round.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, players find out how many points their buildings are worth.  Each building has a fixed value or a variable value based on the other types and locations of buildings a player has played.  Whichever player has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to The Game of Science, where you can do all this and more--in an hour or less.&#10;&#10;The game moves forward as you hire new scientists and outfit them with the tools of their trade. You'll use your scientists and equipment to make discoveries, which give you science credits (credibility and prestige, the currency of the trade). Your scientists can also mess with the research of other players as you compete with them to accumulate the most scientific credibility. And finally, you'll use your accumulated credibility to propose theories, the key to winning the  game.&#10;&#10;But the fun isn't over yet. Now the challenge is to convince your fellow players that you can use your theories to explain something new about the world. If they believe you, they'll let you win--but if they're not convinced, one of them might steal the show!&#10;&#10;Every game will be different, as you explore new ways to combine scientists and decide on your favorite theories.  No two games will play out the same!&#10;&#10;The Game of Science is educational as well as fun. It was developed by scientists using real scientific concepts and experiences. We wanted to share the excitement, adventure, and humor of the day-to-day life of a modern scientist.&#10;&#10;The game developers are also active in science outreach and education.

The idea is to win a majority of the cards.&#10;Snap is a traditional game where cards are turned over and if two match, you must call &quot;Snap&quot; and if you are the first to do so, you can keep the cards. The object is to take all the cards eventually.&#10;The illustrations aren't by an artist as they usually are for this company, but they are photographs taken at a Wildlife Park, by Phillip Wayre.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Road Kill Truckers puts the players behind the wheel of a truck that is barreling down a rural highway.  Normally, the local wildlife crosses the road without any problems, but not today.  Players roll custom animal dice to determine which animals are in the lanes ahead, then decide which lane to swerve into, rolling dice to see if they hit or miss the animal in the new lane.  Each round has the players in a different turn order and each players' choice can affect the other players by removing available options.  The animals are assigned a point value from 1 to 6 and the players roll six sided dice to see if they can roll a number equal to or greater than the animal's value.  The winner is determined once the trucks reach the end of the road by adding up all the points from the animals that were successfully hit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Roman antiquity this game was known as Alea, meaning 'gambling', but came to be called Tabula, 'board' or 'table', since it was played on a board.&#10;&#10;Tabula was an ancestor to Backgammon, and has a similar board and style of play to Backgammon.&#10;&#10;Tabula was a gambling game of which the Roman Emperor Claudius was most fond. Around the year 50, Claudius wrote a history of the game of Tabula which, unfortunately, has not survived. His imperial carriage was equipped with an alveus, a Tabula playing board, so that he could play while traveling.&#10;&#10;Tabula was also the game which was primarily responsible for the gambling mania which swept Rome prior to its being declared illegal under the Republic. The fine for gambling at any other time except the Saturnalia was four times the stakes, although this law was only weakly and sporadically enforced.&#10;&#10;The equipment for Tabula is the same as in Backgammon except that each player has three dice instead of two.&#10;&#10;All of the pieces start off the board in Tabula. Both players enter their fifteen pieces into the same starting table and move them around the board in the same direction.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to move all of your pieces to the finishing table and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all his pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From website:&#10;&#10;Agent Saboteur is a face-paced card game full of bluffing and sabotage, where you command a team of international spies trying to stop the terrorists and build your reputation in the process. One of the great things about this game is that no one sits on the sidelines and waits for the other players to get done. For the casual gamer, Agent Saboteur is easy to teach, fun to play, and will quickly become the game you play most often. For the hobby gamer, it will become the go-to game you get out when friends or family stop by.&#10;&#10;The Story: &ldquo;Welcome, handler XXXXXXXXXX. Your reputation precedes you. That little matter you took care of in XXXXXX was quite impressive. Some believe you may be ready, so from here on your organization will only be tasked with stopping the type of incidents that end up on the front page. The last agents that got sent got themselves XXXXXX within a week and we&rsquo;re still explaining the glow in XXXXXXXXXXX. Everything you hear, see, or do from this point forward is strictly classified. Good luck. You&rsquo;ll need it.&ldquo;&#10;&#10;The Gameplay: Your assignment is to use the spies and mission updates in your hand to stop the terrorists. Whichever player gathers the most points in incidents wins. To do so you'll work the source to gain more agents to your team, but if you push your luck, you may get made and lose them all. Then you'll need to send your agents on missions, traveling incognito using your fake passports. Beware, if the other agents guess where you're sending them, they can sabotage the attempt. Keep your cards close to your chest and you just might live.&#10;&#10;",
