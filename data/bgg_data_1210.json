    "Description": "Stratik was a simple wargame produced by a model manufacturer. It was originally sold in six sets, each with a different map; the sets could be combined to accommodate more players.&#10;&#10;In addition to the map each set included rules, special dice, and markers for things such as step losses. Players were required to supply the models; each player required a tank, a personnel carrier, an artillery piece, and a soldier.&#10;&#10;The game was apparently fairly simple but included rules for air support and supply, and the advanced rules (which required an umpire) had rules for mines, anti-tank gunships, etc.&#10;&#10;A special edition of the game was produced as a promotional item; this came in a wooden box and in addition to all six maps and associated items from the original sets, included many models.&#10;&#10;",

Retired detective Arthur Dukes just purchased one of these mini storage units in hopes of reselling the contents for a profit. Art was hoping for a big score, but was disappointed to find that he&rsquo;d won a virtually empty storage unit aside from a single box. However, after opening the box and seeing some of the contents his heart began to race and his palms became sweaty. Instantly, memories from his career with the Valley Falls Police Department flashed before his eyes and he was taken back to the times of tracking down some of the city&rsquo;s most notorious serial killers. It now appears that a new evil has awoken in Valley Falls.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 9/10&#10;&#10;",

Cultivators collect the natural foods currency and this is increased by building ashrams and institutes.&#10;&#10;The object is to collect karma cards in order to progress; a player who becomes a master may move forwards or backwards, a bodhisattva can move anywhere, and a player who gets enough can attain shanti and enter Nirvana.

Zirak (a brave and cunning human) has infiltrated this foul ceremony in disguise to discover the spelled subject and then escape from there to break the spell.&#10;&#10;Dadaan is a compact and quick deduction-based party game that is played in two phases. In the first phase character cards are secretly dealt; Then only Deev reveals his role; Deev is the moderator of this round and, while other players keep their eyes closed, draws a random card and selects one of the subjects on that. Zirak also checks the selected subject without revealing his identity. Then the group will have 3 minutes to discover the subject by asking yes/no questions from Deev. Meanwhile Zirak should give some subtle clues concealed in his question to other players, while keep her/his identity hidden. &#10;The second phase will begin only if the group has guessed the subject correctly before time runs out. Now -with the help of Deev- Dadds have to identify Zirak.&#10;The winner gets the score indicated on the subject card. &#10;The game will be played for one round more than the number of players, and at the end the player who has the highest point, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Dadaan is inspired by Insider by 'Oink Games', but it has several major changes when compared to its predecessor: Theme, Story, Character, Roles, Rules, Scoring, Graphic (Illustration &amp; Packaging).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each set of lists is then followed by a section on rating the troops, and an armoury describing their game statistics.&#10;&#10;The booklet ends with a section on using armoured trains in IABSM, and a set of Blinds for each side.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mortain Counterattack - Hitler's Plan to Retake Normandy&#10;&#10;The F&uuml;hrer had another great idea to win the war. The situation in Normandy had changed dramatically since D Day and he was determined to turn it to his advantage. Although the British/Commonwealth forces remained bogged down around the city of Caen, the Americans were on the move. After being tied up in the hedgerows of western Normandy, they launched Operation Cobra and were now breaking out, driving west along the coast heading for the Brittany ports. If the Germans could strike out and sever the advance of the American Third Army under General George Patton they might be able to force the retreat of the Americans back toward the Normandy coast or at a minimum slow down their advance and breakout into central France. The target was the seaside town of Avranches located at the base of the Cotentin peninsula.&#10;&#10;It was a desperate struggle that saw the battle-weary American troops of the US 30th Infantry Division (ID) and one armor Combat Command stop four panzer divisions. It will most be most remembered for the heroes of the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Regiment/30th ID who held out for six days on Hill 314 overlooking the town of Mortain. Their stubborn resistance slowed and then stopped the German advance toward the coast.&#10;&#10;The fourteen scenarios in this book cover the action from the initial assaults on August 7th, 1944 through the final attacks on August 11th as the Americans continued to force the Germans back in an effort to relieve the encircled troops on Hill 314. The majority of the scenarios cover August 7th as it was clear that after that day the Germans had already lost most of their forward momentum despite repeated attempts to continue the drive to Avranches.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios are drawn from Operation Epsom, the British offensive that took place west of Caen, in Normandy, from 26-30 June 1944. They feature engagements between British VIII Corps (15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, 11th Armoured Division, and 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division) and the German 12th SS Panzer Division, Hitlerjugend, II SS Panzer Corps (9th SS Panzer Division, Hohenstaufen, and 10th SS Panzer Division, Frundsberg), and other armored forces.&#10;&#10;15 Scenarios cover VIII Corps&rsquo; initial attack on the positions of the 12th SS Panzer Division, the drive across the River Odon, and the counterattacks by II SS Panzer Corps and other armored units that attempted to cutoff or collapse the British salient. Take British infantry, supported by powerful artillery barrages, against battle-hardened panzergrenadiers. Use a Crocodile flamethrower tank to reduce German fortifications. Conduct counterattacks with improvised but capable German armored forces and engineers (with flamethrowers of their own!) through Norman villages. Fight over the bridges over the Odon that were so critical to the outcome of the operation. The scenarios show the varied nature of the fighting that took place in the fields and villages of central Normandy in late June 1944.&#10;&#10;A Historical Summary, Orders of Battle, and Designer&rsquo;s Notes are included to help put the scenarios in the larger context of the battle for Normandy and allow players to design their own scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bahn Frei is a dynamic and strategic cooperative boardgame with a contemporary setting in the German railway system. The story is about 1-4 train conductors (players) taking on the lead of German train operations for two weeks. Their challenge is to provide an excellent traveler experience in order to win the game and permanently get the job and fame of running the company.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 15 rounds. Each player is the conductor of his/her own train and cooperates with the other players to pick up and deliver passengers to their destinations within the time frame indicated on their tickets. The number of passengers that show up each round is determined by dice and event cards bring along specific challenges. Players need to cooperate and discuss very well in order to plan each round, identify the best strategy and transfer passengers where possible in order to avoid complaints. The special dynamics of the game pick up speed when all players make their moves simultaneously within 30 seconds. At the end of the round passengers being delayed leave the game and complain if you cannot manage to smoothen the situation with vouchers. The game is lost when 8 or more passengers have complained.&#10;&#10;Every gameplay is unique and influenced by different factors. Add-on variants included are&#10;(A) 8 passengers who need &quot;special treatment&quot;&#10;(B) every train has a different super-power that can be used&#10;&#10;Note to everyone who does not know about German trains: Most Germans tend to complain about their railway system all the time. Everyone you approach will have a disaster story at hand about delays, cancelled trains, trains stuck on the track over night etc. They measure the service of the trains by high quality standards, globally known as &ldquo;Made in Germany&rdquo;. Therefore, most Germans will have an emotional attachment to failures on trains and will find themselves in one of the stories brought into the game through event cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Above their heads the pirates' treasure chest fell into the water and they are trying to catch the treasures. However, currents of the sea move these jewellery around.&#10;&#10;This game of logic is played in four rounds, each round consisting of four turns. In each turn a wave tile is revealed and treasures move in the given direction. In every 3rd and 4th turn of each round kids can catch the treasures, however the number of moves they can do in a round is limited. The way treasures move are more and more calculable in subsequent rounds so what feels rather random in the first round becomes perfectly calculable in the last round. Can you collect the most treasure? Or, in the advanced game, can you collect the most valuable sets?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Sand And Flies&quot;. Volume 4 in the Obscure Battles series, the series take the player to the Mesopotamia Campaign in WW1.&#10;&#10;The Mesopotamian campaign was a campaign in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I fought between the Allies represented by the British Empire, against the Central Powers, mostly Ottoman Empire and a few German units.&#10;&#10;A more difficult place to fight would be hard to find. Flies attacked the troops, soldiers froze during the winter nights and were overcome by heat during the summer. Dust turned to mud when the banks of the Tigris overflowed during the rainy season.&#10;&#10;A war no side wanted but compelled to fight, the affair was mostly a see-saw string of battles both against each other and the elements. Senior commanders from both died from cholera during the campaign!&#10;&#10;The Battle of Kut and the subsequent Siege of Kut changed the campaign dramatically. The surrender of an entire division was a shock for the British Army. Massively reinforced, the British managed to take Baghdad 2 years later after some very bloody battles but never advanced further.&#10;&#10;The game has&#10;&#10;&#10;     Over 100+  counters&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Battalion to Corps HQ sized units&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Aircraft, Gunboats, Armored Cars, Tribal and Line Infantry, Cavalry and riverine transport units&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Motor Transport Mode: Motorization was used extensively in the later stages and rules allow for &quot;motorized&quot; infantry units to advance faster.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Seasonal flood dangers&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     &quot;Maude's road&quot; and &quot;Blockship Attacks&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Out of Communication and Out of Supply rules that are very easy to track&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Solo Play Algorithm that lets players design a grand strategy and then implement it tactically.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 22-page rulebook with charts and 2 scenarios that come with rules for exploitation and flank attacks, special conditions for being Out of Supply and Out of Communication.&#10;&#10;The complexity level is Simple (with optional special rules scales up to medium/detailed).&#10;&#10;The game introduces an &quot;Order of The Day Marker&quot; pull system to the OB mechanism that randomizes the fire and movement but simplifies the routine chores and allows much faster gameplay.&#10;&#10;Players must collect and husband their precious RP points to mount and sustain offensives. Also - they can &quot;purchase&quot; Leaders to help their units.&#10;&#10;Provided are large 0.8-inch counters at 256 DPI that can be scaled even more or down ( just apply the same scale adjustment to the map ). There is a 55 x 36-inch map formatted for home printers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blitzkrieg in the Far East 1: Japan is the sixth in the series of early war handbooks for I Ain&rsquo;t Been Shot, Mum. The handbook covers the Japanese army during the first phase of the War in the Pacific, December 1941 to June 1942, when its battle-hardened armies inflicted defeat after defeat on the Allies.&#10;&#10;Unlike the other titles so far in the series, the nature of Japan&rsquo;s campaign of expansion means that the booklet is not divided into sections defined by the different types of division that fought, but into sections defined by the different geographical mini-campaigns: Malaya and Singapore, Burma, the Philippines, The Dutch East Indies and the South Seas. In effect, it is several theatre booklets rolled into one.&#10;&#10;There are a total of forty-eight different lists split as follows:&#10;&#10;     Malaya &amp; Singapore: 7 lists from 25th Army&#10;     Thailand &amp; Burma: 5 lists from 15th Army&#10;     The Philippines: 16 lists from 14th Army&#10;     Hong Kong: 1 list from 38th Division&#10;     Borneo: 2 lists from 35th Brigade&#10;     The Dutch East Indies: 15 lists from 16th Army&#10;     The South Seas: 2 lists from the South Seas Detachment&#10;&#10;&#10;Finally, we have the usual ratings and armoury sections, and a note on air support.&#10;&#10;Although designed for IABSM, Blitzkrieg in the Far East: Japan contains a vast amount of information useful to gamers of other systems, and is really a must-buy for anyone interested in the early war period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s also a section on the forts and bunkers positioned along the Belgian border.&#10;&#10;The Dutch section contains seventeen separate lists covering everything from the First Line divisions through to the Light and Peel divisions through to the three independent brigades, the cavalry and the various territorial commands. There&rsquo;s also a short section on the defence of the main airfields and another on the defence of Rotterdam.&#10;&#10;Both the Belgian and Dutch sections contain a lot of background information, so the handbook should be very useful for players of other game systems as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Next, after a quick look at the infantry that doesn&rsquo;t fit into the above (e.g. the Gebirgsjaeger), the book moves on to the ten panzer divisions: with each panzer division given its own section and set of lists. There are, for example, five different lists that relate to 9th Panzer Division alone.&#10;&#10;After the Panzertruppen, the book covers the cavalry, the SS and the army level support troops (that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find the StuGs!) before finishing off with the Fallschirmjaegers and Air Landing troops that dropped into Belgium and the Netherlands. Finally, we have the usual ratings and armoury sections, and a note on air support.&#10;&#10;Although designed for IABSM, Blitzkrieg in the West: Germany contains a vast amount of information useful to gamers of other systems, and is really a must-buy for anyone interested in the early war period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two In Common (TIC) playing cards are an intuitive and powerful deck of cards with huge game potential.  Great for families with kids 7 and up, as well as for the most seasoned and serious card players.  May the brain floss begin!&#10;&#10;The games are organised by difficulty (or Brain wave:&#10;1) Easy - Brain Ripples &#10;2) Medium 1 - Brain Maps&#10;3) Medium 2 - Brain Waves  &#10;4) Difficult - Gamma Waves&#10;&#10;Designed by a Neuroscientist, TIC playing card games challenge your visual perception, processing speed, forward thinking, strategizing and resilience (through frustration and losing!)&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Sample Game #1&#10;&#10;Time&rsquo;s a Ticking (2-5 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 10 Minutes)&#10;&#10;To set up, the deck of cards will be shuffled and five cards are dealt face-up onto the middle of the table within reach of all players.  The rest of the cards are distributed evenly among all players.  Any extras are put off to the side, not to be used that game.&#10;&#10;There are no player turns in &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s a Ticking&rdquo;.  Instead, the object is to be the first player to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.  Players will be able to play cards to one of the five face-up center cards, covering the existing one like a standard discard pile.  The catch is that in order to lay a card down in must create a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo;.  As explained above, a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; is when cards have two properties in common.  For example, you could lay a 2-Yellow-Moon on a 4-Yellow-Moon because two of the properties match.  A 3-Blue-Star on top of a 3-Red-Star would also work.&#10;&#10;In the event that no one can play any more cards, the player with the fewest cards in their hand is the winner.  You CAN play cards that aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;Tics&rdquo;, but if you&rsquo;re caught, you&rsquo;re out for 5 &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; plays&hellip;meaning you&rsquo;ll need to wait for at least five cards to be played before you can begin laying out cards again.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Sample Game #2&#10;&#10;Tic-a-Long (2-8 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 5-20 Minutes per Round)&#10;&#10;Like &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s a Ticking&rdquo;, the object is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand before anyone else.  Each player is dealt eight to ten cards to start, though you can shorten or lengthen the round by dealing fewer/more cards respectively.  If you&rsquo;re playing with younger children for example, you can opt to deal six or seven cards per player.  The deck is put into the middle of the table and one card is drawn face-up as a discard pile.&#10;&#10;On your turn you&rsquo;ll try to play cards onto the discard pile, one by one.  If you play a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll get to go again.  If you play a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;, meaning only one property matches, then your turn is over.  If you can&rsquo;t play anything, then you&rsquo;ll draw one from the deck.  If you still can&rsquo;t play, your turn will end.  If you end your turn by last playing a card with stars, the opponent who goes next must draw cards from the deck equal to the value listed on the stars card.&#10;&#10;A player who has one card in their hand must announce it&hellip;if anyone catches them then they&rsquo;ll be forced to draw two cards.  A player&rsquo;s last card cannot be played as a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;&hellip;it must be a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; followed by a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;More games can be found on the official website.&#10;&#10;",

In some cases, when projects are complex, collaboration is essential. But you need to be careful: there are always those who like to point out all their merits and take ownership of the collective successes achieved.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to bring the maximum progress to the city and to achieve the maximum personal prestige.

    "Description": "Red Dawn Rises! Revolution in Central Asia 1918-1920 is the first in a planned series of scenario books for our Setting the East Ablaze rules.&#10;&#10;Although written specifically for warfare in Central Asia in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War (1917-26), we have found that the rules are very flexible. The earliest they have been played successfully is the Second Afghan War (1888), the latest modern day Africa. Both, with minor adjustments, worked well. These scenario books will cover a slightly wider core period and a significantly wider geography. Most will be based around historical engagements, but those of you who follow &lsquo;The League of Extraordinary Kriegspielers&rsquo; adventures in their alternative reality of 192? will be glad to hear that those tales will also be told before too long.&#10;&#10;The backdrop for this first set of scenarios is the main source book for the so-called Back of Beyond period: Peter Hopkirk&rsquo;s &quot;Setting the East Ablaze &ndash; On Secret Service in Bolshevik Asia&quot;. This rollicking tale, first published in 1984, tells true stories of the period in breath-taking fashion.&#10;&#10;This book contains eight/nine scenarios, each with a historical context, objectives, army lists and maps. Most are playable on a 6&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; table, and require manageable amounts of figures and terrain. It covers the period from February 1918 in the immediate chaos following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 up until September 1920, when the Reds really began to exert their brutal grip on Central Asia. All games are based on known historical facts and orders of battle, and where none exist, a reasonable extrapolation of what was known. If some of the historical battles were very one sided (as they were), I have tried to rebalance the sides to give a better game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Scenario 1: Counter Revolution in Samarkhand&#10;         Pt1: The Mutineers Attack!&#10;         Pt 2: The Revolution Strikes Back!&#10;    &#10;     Scenario 2: The First Battle of Bukhara&#10;     Scenarios 3-4: The TransCaspian Episode&#10;         The Battle of Kakhka&#10;         The Battle of Dushak&#10;    &#10;     Scenario 5: Bailey Vanishes&#10;     Scenario 6: Counter-Revolution in Tashkent&#10;     Scenario 7: Bailey Escapes&#10;     Scenario 8: The Fall of Bukhara&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DevSecOps is a serious game designed as part of a 10 week course on Secure Software Design and Development.  It is introduced at the beginning of the course as an introduction to many of the concepts taught in the class and presented again late in the course as an opportunity for review.  It is designed with the following lesson objectives in mind:&#10;&#10;     Judge the cost and risk trade offs between secure and unsecured software aspects including code, data and usability.&#10;     Devise a strategy to produce a system under threats.&#10;     Comprehend that partial security may equate to no security.&#10;     Identify examples of insecure code and methods of mitigating them.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds, each of which has four phases.  Play continues until someone meets the win condition in phase four of a round.  Phases occur sequentially, but players perform a single phase simultaneously (i.e., all players perform Resource Production then all players perform Project Advancement, etc.).  The phases in a round are:&#10;&#10;     Resource Production: players simultaneously select 4 cards from any combination of decks (e.g., 2 usability cards, 1 DevSecOps card, and 1 data card).  The only caveat is that each player must take at least one DevSecOps card.  &#10;     Project Advancement: players play any number of cards from their hand to their tableau.  Each card has a cost associated with it.  To play a card, a player must discard cards from his hand equal to the cost of the card.  &#10;     A card is turned up from the event deck that affect all players and generally involves losing cards in their tableau.  &#10;     Check for Project Completion:  If a player has 2 Progress Points in each area and an ``Authority to Operate card in their tableau, that player wins (ties are possible). &#10;&#10;&#10;Game components consist of five decks of cards.  There are three component decks that represent management focus on Usability, Software, and Data.  Cards in these decks provide personnel and data security from attacks as well as Progress Points.  The fourth deck, DevSecOps, improves players' ability to advance in the component areas as well as containing several copies of &quot;Authority to Operate&quot; (needed to win).  The final deck is an event deck that causes players to lose a card in one of the component areas if it isn't sufficiently protected.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Summon your armies to the battleground - customize your deck, protect your Ruler, and battle your Linkers to win the day!&#10;&#10;A basic game starts with:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Four acrylic standees of your characters (one Ruler/J-Ruler and three Linkers)&#10;     A 20-card deck (five cards per character)&#10;     A map&#10;     Score Tracker&#10;&#10;&#10;Opponents will start at either end of the map - one opponent chooses which side of the two-sided map will be used, while the other gets to place their standee first. Linkers begin on the map (starting spots are designated on their card) while Rulers wait on the score tracker to make their appearance.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players gain energy to be used by their armies to move, attack or defend, while the Ruler moves along the Score Tracker:&#10;&#10;Once the Ruler reaches the &quot;zero&quot; end of the Score Tracker, they charge onto the battlefield to join the fray!&#10;&#10;Points are scored for:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reaching the opponent's end of the battlefield (1 point)&#10;     Making the opponent 'deck out' - if a player uses all of their cards and needs to draw but can't without shuffling, it's a 'deck out' and worth 1 point to the opponent&#10;     Defeating an opponent's ruler and sending them back to the Score Tracker (2 points)&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 2 points or bring their opponent to zero is victorious!&#10;&#10;In the full game, you will choose 5 Linkers and 1 Ruler to play with. Each character comes with one stat card and 5 Action cards, so you have a total of 30 action cards. You will choose TWENTY of those cards to play with for this match, and set the 10 other cards aside. You will play the match with a deck of 20 total action cards, setting one of each Linker up on the board in the spaces designated by your Ruler.  Just like in the basic game, the Ruler will then go on the score tracker, based on the value of that Ruler, and will enter the game as the J-Ruler once the game has passed that many rounds. Scoring will continue the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bingo Hall Brawl is a fast-paced two player dice game of luck, tactics, and spandex. Go head-to-head with your opponent - simultaneously rolling ten dice to decide who wins each lock-up, gets to execute offence, and win over the rabid pro wrestling crowd.&#10;&#10;Using a mixture of attacks, counter-attacks and blocks, your aim is to build your posture enough to hit a finisher and pin your opponent for a count of three! Crowd reaction tokens can be earned and used to unlock steel chairs, start &lsquo;this is awe-some&rsquo; chants, or lower your opponent&rsquo;s posture to give you some space to recover. The dice decide the outcome of each grapple, but it&rsquo;s up to you to decide when to play to the fans and when to fight dirty.&#10;&#10;Once your posture reaches a certain point you can attempt a pin: both players break out their pin dice and roll them once for each count from the referee. If you can score equal to or higher than your opponent three times in a row the bell rings and you are declared the winner! If not they kick out and you lock up again. It&rsquo;s unpredictable, it&rsquo;s tense &ndash; it&rsquo;s pro wrestling!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tru&rsquo;ng is the name of a new bot system for Fire in the Lake. It follows in the footsteps of the innovative card-based bot system that was first developed for Gandhi, giving fans of Fire in the Lake more opportunities to get this great game to the table.&#10;&#10;Tru&rsquo;ng is quick to use and easy to implement, but is sophisticated enough to play the full Fire in the Lake game. When selecting Operations and Special Activities, cards are drawn from the Tru&rsquo;ng deck&mdash;there are six cards for each Fire in the Lake faction. Each card examines the current state of the game and selects the appropriate action for the active faction. A single, faction-specific table then determines where that action will occur. The same table is used to select spaces for Operations, Special Activities, and Events, minimizing the need to flip between multiple player aids.&#10;&#10;Playing against Tru&rsquo;ng feels like playing against a human opponent. It is unpredictable yet responsive to strategic needs, it goes after its enemies while keeping an eye on its ally, and makes moves up to now limited to human players&mdash;like choosing a Limited Operation to block an opponent&rsquo;s Event. Tru&rsquo;ng can take the place of a human player for any Fire in the Lake faction, can be used with every Fire in the Lake scenario, and can be used in any combination of player and non-player setups.&#10;&#10;In 40 CE, the Tru&rsquo;ng sisters successfully fought to liberate their homeland from foreign occupation. They defeated the Chinese army that had been sent to pacify the region and for three years ruled as queens. In the past two millennia, the legend of the Tru&rsquo;ng sisters has grown; they are now celebrated as exemplars of sacrifice and patriotism in defense of their homeland. It was the birth of Vietnamese national identity.&#10;&#10;Note: The Fire in the Lake Tru'ng Bot Update Pack is compatible with the First and Second Edition of Fire in the Lake as well as the Second Edition Upgrade Kit. This is a Solitaire system for Fire in the Lake only and is not the same as the Solitaire System included in Fall of Saigon, which is for Fall of Saigon scenarios only. Tru'ng can be combined with Fall of Saigon to enable players to play Solitaire across the entire scope of the Vietnam war.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    24 double sided operations cards (6 US, 6 ARVN, 6 NVA, 6 VC)&#10;    1 11x17&rdquo; Non-player aid card&#10;    1 8.5&rdquo;x11&rdquo; instructions cards (NP Coup round instructions, Event instructions)&#10;    1 Rulebook&#10;    1 Reference Booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;(description from the publisher and BGG user)&#10;&#10;",
