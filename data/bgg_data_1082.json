The first player to reach the opposite circular space wins the game (space 121 or 0) an gets the content of the cash box.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by 4 dice with the numbers 1 to 4 and &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; on their sides. Each number on a die is for another player color. &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; for each color are on the same die as the &quot;1&quot;. The Players may only move the amount of spaces indicated by the numbers of their own color. If a player rolls al 4 of his numbers the roll counts double. If all dice show the same number, the Player may move for all 4 dice.&#10;&#10;On the roll of a &quot;+&quot; of his color, the player gets 1 token from the cash box, on a &quot;-&quot; he has to pay 1 token. If all 4 dice show a &quot;+&quot; he gets 4 token and on 4 &quot;-&quot; he has to pay 4 token.&#10;&#10;If a player rolls only the color of an other player, this player may move 2 spaces and gets 1 token for a &quot;+&quot; from the active player. If a &quot;-&quot; is rolled the other player has to pay 1 token to the active player.&#10;&#10;If a player gets on a space of his own color he gets to move 1 space ahead. On a black space with a white dot the player has to skip a turn. The spaces with the thick black border cause the players to jump 2 spaces back. If a player would get on an occupied space he may not move and has to wait for his next turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ubergang des Barocks (Transition of Baroque) is a trick-taking with the theme of aristocratic fashion and ball dancing.&#10;&#10;In the late Baroque period, the aristocratic fashion changed from one moment to the next, and everyone was desperate to follow. Many times, a tea party was held in the salon in advance of the next ball. These salons served as testbeds for fashion to be shown at the ball&#10;&#10;Trendsetters appear at the balls in costumes different from those at the salon in in a game of aristocratic one-up-manship. Players try to win the people's praise at as many balls as possible with knowledge of past trends.&#10;&#10;Basic flow of game&#10;Preparation phase: Cards are dealt to players&#10;Declaration phase: Players take the bid card they think they can achieve. If exactly correct, the player will score 2 pts.&#10;Salon phase: Starting with the lead player, each player plays one card to the table, following lead if able. Black is always trump.&#10;Ball phase: Each player takes the salon card back into their hand, then plays a card face down. This card must be either a) same number value or b) same color value as the Salon card. In this way, the lead color may change. Winner of the trick is the player who plays the highest value of the lead suit, or highest trump value.&#10;Scoring phase: The winning player gains 1 pt and leads the next trick.&#10;Cleanup phase: After all cards in your hands are played, players who achieved their bid gain 1 pt. Cards are reshuffled and the next round begins with the next starting lead player.

Drawing up to 5 cards from any combination of common deck or the nation specific deck players will draw cards to upgrade their ship. Available upgrades are stronger cannons, thicker and stronger hulls, and crew members with special abilities. Players declare an action during the action phase that can include boarding the enemy ships, attacking with the ships crew and cannons, or batton down the hatches to give a temporary defense boost. Shaman and mages can be used to cast spells giving boosts to your crew, damaging enemy ships, or repairing your own ship.&#10;&#10;",

One of the ship's many improvements over earlier models, these built-in Refined Gyrostabilizers provide the RZ-2 with a turret arc that can rotate exclusively between the front and back of the ship.

Players also receive a hand of four crop cards comprising resources and actions for successfully growing and harvesting a crop, or revealing eliminating the pest cards. Each round, players all draw one more card for their hand, choose one to play, and pass the rest of their hand to the next player. Players must decide between monitoring and managing their pests, applying fertiliser and other crop enhancers, or amassing the seasonal workers, pack houses and export licences needed to make the most profit.&#10;&#10;The cards run out after eight rounds, when players take turns to tally their scores. Type of orchard they have and the resource cards they have collected determine their base profit level. This is increased by fertiliser, pollination etc, but decreased by the particular pests that remain in their orchard. The game can be customised for regional orchard types.&#10;&#10;Integrated Pest Management is part of an educational kit used in schools to teach children about horticulture and biology.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Howard, Wings in the Night&#10;&#10;In Solomon Kane&rsquo;s time, Africa was a deeply mysterious and dangerous land. Little explored by Europeans, it was a place of near-legend. Kane is one of the few who dares to brave the trek to its shores, and fewer still who venture into its interior. For this reason, he is a stranger in this endless land of magic and cannibals, and has to rely more than ever on his inner strength and the blessings of his immortal companions. Unsurprisingly, it is not long before Solomon Kane is in the middle of a deadly situation once more.&#10;&#10;This expansion adds 2 new adventures in the dark continent! These are the Wings in the Night and The Footfalls Within. Between them, these Adventures have a total of 5 Acts (50 chapters).&#10;&#10;Wings in the Night: As soon as Solomon escapes from some dangerous cannibals, he falls straight into the fire from the frying pan, walking into a ruined village that has been terrorised by the inhuman akaana. These strange flying creatures seem to be a horrible amalgam of bat or bird and human, and they strain Kane&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s creatures&rdquo; to breaking point. Solomon undertakes to protect the innocent villagers, and when this plan goes tragically wrong he swears vengeance as atonement for his error. Are they part of the strange natural world in this alien land, the work of the devil, or some dark summoning from the mind of a sick wizard? Any of these seem possible. And any of them are, depending on the path you take and decisions you make. Remember: You and your friends make the decisions in your games, and perhaps your skill or your luck outstrips his previous efforts! Fighting a numerous foe, who can fly as well as fight, makes this a unique challenge for the Puritan hero.&#10;&#10;Footfalls Within: Solomon Kane does not approve of slavery. In fact, it utterly disgusts him, and his first thought, on finding a train of Arab slavery is: &ldquo;Sons of iniquity, the wrath of God is upon ye.&rdquo;  &#10; &ldquo;The fury Solomon Kane felt would have been enough at any time and in any place to shake a man to his foundation; now it assumed monstrous proportions, so that Kane shivered as if with a chill, iron claws scratched at his brain and he saw the slaves and the slavers through a crimson mist.&rdquo; So, despite the fact that he is alone, he cannot help himself. He must confront the slavers&hellip;&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    8 double-sided tiles&#10;    14 Fight cards&#10;    8 Fight Effect cards&#10;    191 Discovery cards&#10;     29 Miniatures&#10;    2 Storybooks (5 Acts/ 50 Chapters)&#10;&#10;&#10;This is an expansion, and cannot be played without the base game.&#10;&#10;",

Gather 3-10 friends and battle to create bulletproof master-plans to break into the bank, bypass security and steal the cash.&#10;&#10;One player is nominated to be The Bank, all the other players are Robbers. Robbers are dealt a hand of random items, weapons and skills (Action Cards) to use against the bank security systems (Security Cards) which The Bank is dealt a hand of, and can use in whatever order they wish. The Bank also takes one card describing a uniquely fortified or defended bank vault (Vault Card) for the final round.&#10;&#10;One Security Round at a time, Robbers will play an Action Card and explain/role-play/justify how they would use it to defeat the Security Card. Creativity is key. The winner of each round is decided by The Bank and they will receive a new Action Card. When The Bank runs out of Security Cards, it's time for the Vault Round and Robbers can combine any of their remaining Action Cards to create an elaborate plan to break into the unique vault, get the cash, and escape.&#10;&#10;Players will need to play their cards strategically, holding powerful cards for the final round if possible, and creatively justifying their choices to win over The Bank.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The gang roams the galaxy, staying out of the way of the authorities and carving out a living by scrounging, scamming, or whatever else works. The Orphans Gang is always ready to welcome new members, as it's also used to losing members to tragedies such as prison, death, or becoming an adult. Perhaps in a remote mining outpost they can lay low quietly for a while.&#10;&#10;All members of the Orphans Gang share the same trait, common to street urchins: it's impossible to hold them down. As such they all have the Unstoppable skill as a bonus, allowing them to slip by mobs of Xenos (or burst through them, in the case of Goliath).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Designer Jeff Downey has managed to incorporate just about every nuance of table-top baseball into a few pages of very clear rules and only two charts. If you like to rush, this is potentially the quickest playing baseball game available.&#10;&#10;Very general player-attributes are &ldquo;graded&rdquo; for overall skill (Batter, Eye, Power, Defense/Fielding, Speed) i.e. a batter&rsquo;s Power rating could be &ldquo;Star&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good&rdquo;, &ldquo;Average&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Poor&rdquo;. Likewise, a pitcher would be rated similarly for Control etc.&#10;&#10;For each at-bat, a card is drawn. It is first checked against the pitcher-rating chart, and depending on the result, following cards may need to be drawn, i.e. the pitcher-result may indicate &ldquo;Batter&rdquo;. In this case, the batter has put the ball into play and so the batter chart is used when drawing the next card (using the &#10;batter&rsquo;s particular rating, of course.) The result might be a hit or possibly &ldquo;Eye&rdquo;, so then the batter&rsquo;s ability to wait for a good pitch is being called into question. We go to &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; chart and draw another card for the result etc.&#10;&#10;Steal, bunt, hit and run, double plays, sac flys, errors, and fielding are all represented in this fascinating, fast and very successful &ldquo;micro-game&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;It is easiest to use a fictional team and randomly generate the attribute-grades, but you can certainly use real stats and create a general guide for using historical players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Asteroid Field is a chaotic solitaire card game in which you are the computer of the autonomous miner spaceship A-438 that works in the asteroid belt. Your mission is transport the mineral from the base asteroid to the artificial storage planetoid with the minimum cost.&#10;&#10;The players form a board of 5 x 4 cards as the asteroid field. The game goal is to cross the asteroid field without being destroyed while using the smallest quantity of fuel. If the ship is destroyed or the fuel runs out, the player loses. The player can try to improve his marks crossing the field spending less fuel units.&#10;&#10;The player uses a token as spaceship to cross the field, he can change the ship's speed and direction. In each turn, asteroids disposition in the field changes chaotically according the rules. There are cards to control speed and fuel consumption.&#10;&#10;The only randomness in Asteroid Field is the card order. This game is chaotic because despite having all the data it will be hard to predict the result of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The eight houses of the nobility plummeted into a ruthless cold war in an effort to claim the throne. You control one of these houses and must use everyone at your disposal (including covert agents, military geniuses, scientists, traders, diplomats and administrators) to ensure that the next in line is allied with your house.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lords of Maleryth is a fast-flowing deck management game set in an interstellar empire.  Using a  deck building mechanic, players must defend their own deck whilst attempting to remove cards from their opponents decks, control fleet movements on a central board, and develop rule-breaking technology.&#10;&#10;The majority of cards represent different characters in the Empire with different skills and abilities. Each card is numbered sequentially.Once the central supply deck is depleted the game ends, and the player with the lowest numbered card in play in front of them wins.&#10;&#10;Unique player communication rules add to the pressure, meaning that players indulging in thinking time give their opponents opportunity to scheme against them, whereas players who think fast limit their opponents opportunities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on iconic seasonal flowers found in Japan, Kuzushi Seasons  pits 2, 3 or 4 players against each other in a unique game of positional influence and control. Simple rules lead to beautiful complexities in this abstract area control tile placement card game. It's smart, fun, approachable and addictive.&#10;&#10;Card placement and area control is all resolved orthogonally to other cards. So up, down, left and right only. Players try to control more of the board through influence from the base cards they play on each turn. Then they check up, down, left and right of the base they place to see what player (if any) has a majority of base cards around it. If no one has more bases than anyone else around it, that square is uncontrolled, and any flag there is returned to its owner, which they can again either as a base or a flag as required.&#10;&#10;This makes for a dynamic board that gets built out into a square as play continues (6x6 for 2 players, 7x7 for 3 players, or 8x8 for 4 players). Once the boundaries are established, play continues until all the board is filled. The winner is the player who has the most cards of their color on the board. If there's a tie, the player with the largest &quot;island&quot; of their color cards touching is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description of the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The cards are chosen but not shown to the enemy player. Each plane can be tailed or tailing or even unopposed. Having an unopposed plane is a big advantage because it can help join in a battle between other planes. each player shows one card if the direction is different then the plane breaks the tail and is tailing the enemy, but if the card is the same then a second card is flipped, if the direction is the same the tailing plane gets a shot, its a simple high low cut, but some cards add effects like ace's a new plane joins your dogfight.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is air superiority but the campaign game adds ground targets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;designer from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
