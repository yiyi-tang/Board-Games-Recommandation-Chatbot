Choose one player to be the round's chief. That player gives all players a random card numbered 1-10, then they read one of the five hundred theme cards included in the game, e.g., &quot;Batman wants to replace Robin to fight the bad guys. Create a new duo 'Batman and ...' from the worst to the best.&quot; The chief looks at their number, then gives an answer based on their number. If they have a 1, they want to give the worst possible suggestion; if a 10, the best; if a 5-7, somewhere in the middle.&#10;&#10;Each other player then gives an answer to this theme based on the number they were dealt, then the chief needs to decide who has the lowest number, then the next lowest, and so on. For each mistake, the chief flips a unicorn token over to its poop side.&#10;&#10;If all the unicorns have left by the end of the fifth round, leaving you with nothing but poop, then you lose.

Today and for the first time ever, we introduce the concept of true &quot;Shared Deck-building&quot; - Everyone plays on the same single deck with the same hand, and yes everyone has a part in building this same single deck.&#10;&#10;In the Azure Peninsula, civilization has not tamed the breathtaking yet deadly nature it offers. Isle whales would crush entire towns in their passing, and river wyrms swallow whole camps. Yet every so often, a tiny hamlet or a cosy little village would spring up atop a hill. In our story, the village chief has just passed on, leaving a chaotic mess of younger heads to run the place. The Tool Master needs stone to craft useful items for everyone, while the Culinary Chief feeds the group, the Scouting Lead goes out with his party to patrol and scour for materials, and the Commander protects the walls and its inhabitants.&#10;&#10;They are but a tiny settlement with limited people. How will the different leaders work together to utilize their resources? Too much of one resource will cause some leaders to not be able to do what they have to do, and too little of anything could spell doom for everyone. A single deck represents the village, and players take on the roles of the various leaders. They must balance their own needs with those of other leaders in order to survive and thrive amidst a harsh land. Every leader is important!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Hakodate was a war in which the first maritime strategy faced by modern Japan dominated the battlefield. The Kaiyo was lost in an accident, and the new government army acquired the ironclad Kotetsu, and the power balance changed drastically.&#10;&#10;The player aims to establish the Republic of Ezo from the standpoint of Takeaki Enomoto. The operation of the Navy is important, but money is needed for the Navy to function. Taxes must be collected while paying attention to the feelings of the residents, and ground troops and warships must be prepared to prepare for the arrival of the new government army. Can you fight better than historically against the new government forces who are trying to end the civil war early with the game system? Or can we achieve the long-cherished desire to establish the Republic of Ezo?&#10;&#10;Published in Banzai EX Magazine

    "Description": "Devolution is a game about the dark nature of politics, where you will attempt to take control of the Judiciary, Media and Strategic Companies to gain the absolute power over the Republic and become the Supreme-Leader-For-Life! (Just a heads up though, life may be short and death unnatural).&#10;&#10;To do that, you will need to gain popularity points by bribing or manipulating the voters. It comes at a cost of increasing depravity of public life and so the doomsday clock is set in motion! If you don't seize power before it reaches 100, the people will storm the palace gates and hang everyone.&#10;&#10;The increasing depravity may not be all bad news. When the Depravity Meter reaches 70 there will be an opportunity for one of you to seize power as the leader of the revolutionary movement that will soon swallow everyone. Players can also seize power with the generals in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat or with Priesthood or with Business.&#10;&#10;    winning conditions depend on the number of players&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player holds seven cards and plays 2 per turn. These and popularity can be used to buy cards from the Republic deck or to spite and stop the other players which raises the depravity which, as Depravity Meter reaches 70, gives one more opportunity, for those holding the Spirit of the Revolution card, to seize power as the leader of the people. There is a variety of cards in the deck, some can be used out of turn in reaction to another player&rsquo;s play adding more dynamic interaction to the game (you can foil someone else&rsquo;s plan by assassinating the Judge they needed to gain an Judiciary Institution with a Black Ops card, for example).&#10;&#10;Like in politics, the effects of one&rsquo;s actions are not always 100% predicable: dice rolls) and as the Depravity Meter goes up past bomb-marked fields, the player causing the depravity has to draw a card from the Shit Happens deck which may adversely affect just them or everybody at the table (the logic being that the misdeeds withing the party affect the image of the whole party). Players draw cards at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;",

The Republican player (Mexican side) needs to recruit forces within the local population, establish military training camps, carry out ambushes and disrupt the French communication lines as much as possible.&#10;&#10;The security of this route became an issue of strategic importance for the circulation of war supplies and of the different military forces that would march inland; patrolling and keeping it open was a task for different special units, like the Sudanese Regiment and the Foreign Legion.&#10;&#10;The Guerrilla war would begin, led by veteran officers: Their mission was to maintain a war of attrition, all the time and in the most effective ways possible; a state of harassment for the French invasion and their Mexican allies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rising Star Football Edition, the board game of dreams, where you have the chance to play out a footballer's career of your own. Compete against your opponents to earn points, money and fame all in the hope of having the greatest career and becoming Rising Star champion!&#10;&#10;This sports based role-playing game allows individuals to play out a footballer's career. They compete in matches, have contracts and sponsorships, work with an agent and take part in different events.&#10;&#10;Matches use the match dice to decide the scores and players roll against each other. Match Event cards can be used to impact the final score. Contracts allow the players to earn money and they can change contracts by being transferred or entering negotiations where their agent's ability (if they have one) comes into play.&#10;&#10;With varied tiles that require different actions and lots of cards to read aloud this game brings all the components of a footballer's life into a board game and gives a fun competitive environment for friends and families to play.&#10;&#10;Players roll the game dice to move around the board. Depending on where they land, different events occur. They could land on a variety of match event tiles where they have to play out a match against an opponent in the hope of defeating them and gaining points. They could appear in the press and draw a press card to read what the papers are saying about them, impacting their fame. They might enter contract negotiations and use their Agent's ability to enhance the amount of contracts they are offered. There are many different events that occur as the player goes through each season and this can change the storyline of that player as well as impact their career in positive and negative ways.&#10;&#10;The length of game varies depending on how many seasons players wish to play. This is decided at the start of the game and one trip around the board is equal to one season. The game ends when all players have completed the agreed upon number of seasons.&#10;&#10;Throughout each player's career their goal is to collect Points (won by participating in Matchdays, Reserves, Derby Day and Cup Final events), earn money by improving their contract, gaining sponsorships and getting transferred and gain fame by appearing in the press. The referee keeps track of the scores and the winner is the player with the highest career score. The scoresheet has a simple formula for calculating the winner at the end of the game and the results are announced in reverse order crowning the winner Rising Star Champion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TWO FREAKIN SWORDS is a card game with deck construction, role playing elements (with characters carrying over between games and perma-death), and a rock-paper-scissors mechanism. Players create characters, customize decks of 40 cards, and go back and forth against opponents in 1 vs 1 games, 3+ player rumbles, and 4+ player team games.&#10;&#10;Each deck comes with 10 cards of 4 different types:&#10;Defending/Block&#10;Defending/Parry&#10;Attacking/Strike&#10;Attacking/Fake&#10;&#10;Before the game, players must fill out a character sheet if they haven't already. They can then customize and organize their decks, keeping the number of cards in the deck at 40 and a minimum of 8 of each type of card. If not everyone has a custom deck, players must instead draw cards from a single pile of 80 cards (two standard decks shuffled together).&#10;&#10;All players then place an aggression coin by their right arm and draw 4 cards from their (or the community's) deck. Players then place the card they want to play with the indicator side (Defending/Attacking) facing up. They then decide what they want to do in response to their opponent(s) cards. Once everyone has their cards down, players flip their cards over and compare each hand independently (Player A's right hand vs Player B's and vice versa).&#10;&#10;The goal is to get enough hits on your opponent to knock them out of the game (a new character can take 5 hits before dying), tearing up their character sheet in the process and (if you win) adding +1 hit point to your character for the next game you play. The game ends when the last player (or team, in a team game) is left standing.&#10;&#10;",

You and your teammate must work together to reveal the identity of the imposters.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is about investigators and assassins. Where the murderers pose as police but there is a person who knows who the real criminals are.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the daily life of the Dominican Republic. Where the weapons have names that the locals assign to them. The game has a heavy jargon used by the Dominicans.&#10;&#10;There is a medical examiner who is on the side of the investigators and who can give clues to the investigators. The medical examiner can mark, in a folder, the state of the body, how hard the blow was, where the body suffered the attack, how quickly it died, what was the cause of death.&#10;&#10;A player can accuse another player by selecting the weapon and place that the player think are correct. If the player fail then he lost he badge (and cannot accuse any other player).&#10;&#10;The game can end in two ways, the first way is after three turns of accusation have passed. Second way is when Investigators find the weapon and the place where the murder occurred.&#10;&#10;There are two teams, the team of police officers and investigators and the team of the murderer, his accomplice. The team of investigators wins if they find the weapon and the location of the murder. The teams of the murderer and accomplice win if after three rounds of accusations the investigator does not find the weapon and the place. Another winning condition for the killer team is if the killer finds out who the snitch is.&#10;&#10;",

One set gives orders to patrolling units unaware of the player. The other two sets of orders are for aware units attacking the player's units, separated by the size of the Walks (Light/Reg Vs Large/Behemoth).&#10;&#10;Patrol instructions include: Sweeping the area for the player, Patrolling objectives, Checking suspicious behavior, etc...&#10;&#10;Attack instructions include: Rushing the player, Flanking, Various types of attacks, etc...&#10;&#10;Each card includes: Compass directions, Dice rolls, Player to attack, and Hit Locations. There are also playing card symbols on each card to be used for variable actions or objective orders in the case of multiple objectives.&#10;&#10;For each enemy activation, the player draws a card for that enemy unit. The card gives the enemy order or orders, sometimes requiring multiple cards to be drawn to show what direction the enemy moves, and also which player to attack.&#10;&#10;H.E.: Walk Solobot AI is quick to learn and gives you a good fight. The enemy might just surprise you!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Return to the nostalgic (and sometimes painful) schoolyards of youth to battle it out at recess in a cutthroat game of tag.&#10;Hype Tag is an innovative, addictively re-playable strategy card game for 2-4 hipsters ages 13 and up.&#10;&#10;To win, be the first player to get up to 10 on your hype meter, flip it over, and then go back down to 1. You gotta GET HYPED by making impressive tags and creating mischief on the playground... but then you need to have enough self-control to SIMMER DOWN and go back to class!&#10;&#10;Hype Tag features the unique interaction of two different decks of cards. The HYPE deck has the strategic depth of a trading card game while the TAG deck has the simple fun of a classic card game. It's like if Magic and Uno had a baby.&#10;&#10;A unique aspect of Hype Tag is the hype mechanic. Each HYPE card has a number in the upper corner and you must at that number (or higher) on your hype meter to play the card. Many cards also have a bonus, granting an even more powerful effect the higher you get. But... when you flip your meter over and start moving back down, your dwindling hype prevents you from getting bonuses and eventually makes some hype cards unplayable. So you have to be crafty and a little bit cutthroat to win. The game ends when the first player gets back down to 1.&#10;&#10;Be sure to manage your hand carefully because you have to play a tag card to tag an an opponent at the end of each turn. If you can't, you have to call a time out which rewards the other players. In 3 and 4 player games, Hype Tag has a unique non-standard turn order which gives players a choice about who to tag. And this choice carries strategic implications.&#10;&#10;The game also include &quot;Sass&quot; cards that block and copy the actions of others, trait bonuses that reward certain styles of play, and Older Kids - special character cards you receive when you reach 10 on your hype meter - that grant powerful abilities aiding your descent back down to 1.&#10;&#10;It is great casual fun that also stands up to very intense tournament style play.&#10;&#10;",

These certificates are awarded to the first player to collect a set of 3 unique photos in the indicated class (mammals, birds, etc.) and are worth 7 fame points. Increase your set to 5 unique animals in that class to upgrade your certificate, making it worth more.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each unique photograph you take increases your fame, as does becoming a world traveler and fulfilling commissions. You can also specialize in one or more continents to increase the value of the photos you take there.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will assign an assistant to 1 of 3 actions (photograph, travel, or market). Alternatively, you can choose to take a rest action and return all your assistants to your supply.&#10;&#10;Every photographer starts out with very basic equipment, training, and connections. This limits how much each action can do.

All players are always involved even on another player's turn.&#10;&#10;Then players use their imagination as well as observation to find words on displayed cards. Each card provides various interpretations while also providing visual objects to allow players to focus on searching and observing the illustrations.&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing a random letter from a bag and rolling the die. The die will determine if they are going to play an individual round or a joined round where all players guess the words simultaneously.&#10;&#10;The die roll will also indicate the number of words that a player has to find on the face-up illustrated cards. Words must start with the selected letter and can be actually present on the cards, or players can use their imagination based on the illustrations.&#10;&#10;If the die roll shows a balloon (the Lingolandia logo), then all players guess at the same time--providing a very interactive round of play.&#10;&#10;Correctly guessed words are awarded points which are recorded on the road to the finish line on the board. The first player that gathers enough points to cross the finish line is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Let's just hope your case doesn't go cold before revealing your solution (dramatically, of course) and catching the culprit! Case closed!&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s more than one way to catch a killer though.  So what&rsquo;s it gonna be? Good Cop or Bad Cop? If you&rsquo;re playing Good Cop you&rsquo;re chasing down a specific killer, whereas Bad Cop you'll have to successfully frame any one of the eight suspects in order to win. Each way to play comes with its own set of rules and tactics, but will you use fair play or foul play? There's 8 new suspects but which of these fairy-tale felons committed the crime?&#10;&#10;We've kept the same design for the backs of the cards as the 1st edition of the game. This means that you can combine decks, swap the special action cards around and even try and solve two murders at the same time! Want to separate the decks back again when you've finished? Don't panic - the font used for the titles on each action card is different to the original, helping you to tell which card belongs to what game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Every Kickstarter copy of Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria will include Rise of Titans - 4 Advanced Expansion Modules packaged inside the base game's box. They publisher will sell these modules on their website but these modules will not be available in the retail edition.&#10;&#10;Module #1: Shrine of the Titans&#10;This is a 6th Shrine that occupies the cavern at the center of the game board. After each battle, you will place your highest value Troop die into the Shrine of the Titans. &#10;The Shrine can hold a number of Troop dice equal to the number of players. On your turn, you can move your Warden token to the Shrine of the Titans and buy up to 3 dice...if you have enough Gold. This module also includes 5 additional Troop dice.&#10;&#10;Module #2: Great Battles&#10;This is a set of 10 oversized Battle Plan cards in which all the players can participate. 2 Great Battle cards are always available throughout the game and each time you complete a regular Battle Plan, you check your dice to see if any of them match the Troop Types noted on the Great Battle cards. If there's a match, you add the lowest strength matching die to one of the Great Battle cards along with one of your Participation Markers. You immediately gain the reward on the Troop Position chosen.  &#10;When all 5 Troop positions are filled on a Great Battle, the card is resolved and each Participation marker on that card earns you a share of the Victory Points for that Great Battle. This module also includes 20 Participation Markers and 5 additional Troop dice.&#10;&#10;Module #3: Ancient Spells&#10;&#10;This is a set of 28 cards (44x68mm) with 2 of 6 unique and powerful actions spread throughout the cards in every possible combination. During setup, shuffle the cards and give 3 to each player. &#10;At any time during your turn, you may play an Ancient Spell card from your hand to perform one of the two available powers. It's important to note that playing an Ancient Spell card is a free action along with your regular action. These spells are meant to augment and boost specific actions, dice, etc.&#10;&#10;Module #4: Wraith Dice&#10;&#10;This is a set of 5 purple custom dice (16mm - same size as the other dice in the game). During setup, just toss the 5 Wraith Dice into the bag along with the usual dice needed for your number of players. Each die has Strength of 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3, (opposite sides always add up to 4) so they are weaker than the regular Troop dice, but this also means that they're more likely to give you better Discounts if you draft them at the Tactics and Champions Shines, and more likely to pay out more gold if you draft them from Gold Shrine. &#10;Wraith dice are considered WILD when completing any Battle Plan. So, even though they're weak, they can be any Troop Type you need. Wraith dice are also wild if you put them on a Great Battle card (Module #2). When you draft a Wraith die, it DOES NOT take up a Troop slot on your Player Board! You just set it somewhere on your Camp and use it when you need it most. The flexibility of these new dice will add lots of new play options to your game of Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria.&#10;&#10;About the base game:&#10;For years the humans, elves, and dwarves have been slowly encroaching on your territories and slaying your kind in the name of progress. They've built their citadels, keeps, and villages as they push you further into the darkness. Now is the time to rally your troops and lay waste to their kind and bring forth the reign of the Shadow Kingdoms!&#10;&#10;You are a Warden hungry for the destruction of Valeria. You must outwit the other Wardens to earn the right to command an army for the Shadow Kingdoms. Visit dark Shrines to gain minions, magic, gems, and gold to fuel your war machine. Command monsters into battle to conquer the lands and earn Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must move your Warden from its current location to a new location. When your Warden enters one of the 5 Shrines, you first take any available die from the Shrine and place it on your player board, then perform the Shrine action associated with the Shrine.&#10;&#10;There are 5 troop types (die colors) in the game: Goblin (green), Orc (red), Skeleton (white), Gargoyle (purple), and Gnoll (brown). Send your Warden to the Camp on your player board to use your minion dice to resolve battle plans and place Victory tokens on your Campaign board.&#10;&#10;",

As a reward for the protection your fortifications provide, the first crewmember to fortify cities worth 100 points will be named King or Queen of Shipwreck Island.&#10;&#10;Players draw Wall Segment Cards which allow them to place Wall Segment pieces on Wall Plans around their cities. They trade with other players for the wall Segment types they need, or draw from the Supply Station. Wall Plans are color coded so they must get the right type of Wall Segment to build on the needed segments for their cities. Players are dealt 3 City Defense plans at the beginning of the game and choose one as their starting city. They can build on their starting city or any city connected by one road to it.&#10;&#10;They try to finish all the wall plans around a city to protect it from Pirate attacks. At the end of their turn, they roll to see if the Pirates attack their cities or what other actions may happen. If they are attacked, any any part of the city's Wall Plans are unfinished, wall segments are destroyed and must be rebuilt on the next turn.&#10;&#10;Other rolls allow for moving the &quot;Island Army&quot; marker to protect a city from attacks, drawing extra cards, stealing a card from another player, or placing a wall segment piece.&#10;&#10;Players may also purchase Reinforcement Cards which allow for extra building actions or protection from attacks.&#10;&#10;Players score points after completing a city's defense plan. They move their scoring marker around the scoring track. The final round begins when one player passes 100 points. Each player gets one more turn to score points. The player with the most points after the final round wins and is declared King or Queen of Shipwreck Island.&#10;&#10;",
