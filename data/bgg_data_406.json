The longer you hold on to a specific stock, the more money you can make on dividends.  However, the longer you have a stock, the more likely it will go bankrupt before you can sell it.

Unbeknownst to them, the reinforced 95th Guards Rifle Division was moving into positions overlooking the village of Krasny Oktabyr. As the Germans moved up from the river&rsquo;s edge, the two forces collided under a summer squall, mutual surprise giving way to ferocious fighting. The Russians charged through the rain into the midst of the German force. Fighting was at point blank range; tanks often shot each other at less than one hundred meters. Both sides lost several vehicles before they each fell back. The Germans aimed themselves at Hill 226.6, which clearly dominated the local landscape. This fight was only the first of several fought this day as the Russians struggled to hold them back...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slings and Stones is a strategy boardgame which uses a standard checkerboard with chess and checkers pieces. It can easily be learned and played in a few short minutes, but mastery of the game will take much longer. Each and every move can have huge ramifications, and players will find it extremely difficult to plan more than a couple of rounds in advance.&#10;&#10;I stumbled upon this game while skimming through some old journals I found in my grandfather&amp;#65533;s attic. The rules were gleaned from Kardon's writings on the Muighar tribes, and I've tried my best to keep them authentic.

    "Description": "Epic: Warlords is a strategy wargame of a vast scope, dealing with the rise and fall of civilizations over hundreds of years, and the terrible battles and wars between the races of Elves, Goblins, Dwarves, and Man.&#10;&#10;Epic: Warlords depicts an epic war between the ancient races of Man, Elves, Goblins and others for the domination of the world. The game takes place over the course of centuries or even millennia. But it is at the scale where even within this lengthy time frame, individual heroes and individual actions can leave an impact certain to give birth to legends.&#10;&#10;This game involves many campaigns, all of indefinite length, within a larger round that involves the growth of populations and cities. And although armies may be large, individuals stand out due to leadership, artifacts, and miracles. At points in the game, you may wonder, 'just how did one hero defeat 3 units of my armies?' But use as reference - rather than the real world - the myths of Hercules, Odysseus, and King Arthur, or the fantasy stories 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Conan the Barbarian' (at the end of which Conan and a friend kill about 50 mounted enemy knights).&#10;&#10;http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.html &#10;(Click &quot;Download EPIC.ZIP&quot; for rules and bits)&#10;&#10;",

Nannon reduces the basic concepts of Backgammon to the smallest feasible combination that still retains the idea of Backgammon.&#10;&#10;For instance:&#10;&#10;Rather than having &quot;stacks&quot; of men on each position, Nannon allows only one man per spot.&#10;Since you can't &quot;stack&quot; men, contiguous groups of 2 or all 3 men of the same team can't be hit.&#10;Each player has only three men, as opposed to the 15 of Backgammon.&#10;Each player gets one die, rather than getting to use two. (Nannon makes use of the fact that each player has her own die.)&#10;The board only has six positions, instead of 24.&#10;&#10;Nannon does, however, still provide a doubling cube, which is rather relevant since the individual games of Nannon are so much shorter than those of Backgammon.&#10;&#10;",

The players take turn placing tiles on the board, starting with the player who is dealt the lowest numbered double-tile, who must place this a his first move.&#10;&#10;Tiles are placed according to the following restrictions:&#10;&#10;* A tile must be placed such that it spans two squares (i.e., one half of the tile is on a black square and the other half is on a white).&#10;    * No two tiles can share a square.&#10;    * If a tile is placed next to another tile, the number of dots on the touching tile-end(s) must match that of its (their) neighbour. If a tile-end is next to several other tile-ends, only one of these need to match.&#10;&#10;When there are no un-drawn tiles left and two passes in a row occur (i.e., both players pass), the game ends. At this point, the unfilled areas on the board are scored: Each connected unfilled area on the board counts to the color that is in majority in that area. If there is the same number of black and white squares, no player gets points for the area.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The jumped checker or king is then captured (removed from the board).

A checker can only move if in so doing it captures an opponent's checker or king.&#10;&#10;On his turn, after he has finished capturing, a player may use the checkers which he has just captured to transform some of his opponent's checkers into kings, by placing a single captured checker on top of a checker of the same color which is still on the board.

The maps are 21&quot; x 27&quot; and there are two Pacific and two Atlantic maps with a total of 39 areas.&#10;&#10;As a standalone game, The Two Ocean War allows double-blind player movement via two copies of the Atlantic and Pacific theater maps. During the movement phase, players place their fleets on their own game boards, unaware of the other player's moves. Once moves are completed, both players go area by area on both maps, resolving battles between fleets placed in the same areas on the two different maps and to resolve combat and determine victory points awarded for each sea zone. Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.&#10;&#10;The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones. Additional rules let small ships torpedo big ones under certain conditions, and since the game represents fleets worldwide, there are opportunities for some Axis ships to change theaters just as the Allied ships can.&#10;&#10;",

Players attack other bees of unknown value, and the bee with the higher value survives. Whoever captures their opponent's queen bee wins. Mathematics skills covered include inequalities; fractions; decimals; negative numbers; and place value. The game contains a game board, bee value cards, and playing piece stands.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've just stumbled onto a small secret pond, hidden right in your own neighborhood. Three odd little creatures and their frog-friends are playing, and whatever their game is it's good! There's a duck made of paper, a bug trapped in a rock, and a toad spitting sparks from its tongue.&#10;&#10;They're all squealing and jumping, leap-frogging and bumping, and racing the pond; oh what fun! Such tumbling and flapping and sparking and quacking; how you'd love to join the confusion. Then they all see you watching and ask you to play, and assure you it's not an intrusion.&#10;&#10;Sizzletoad! is the game for two to four players (ages 5 and up) that combines rock-paper-scissors and tic-tac-toe with an exciting leap-frog race around the pond! There's a nice bluffing element as well (especially in the 2-player version).&#10;&#10;Players duel with each other in rock-paper-scissors style using their 12-card hands of Fossilticks, Paperducks, and Sizzletoads to decide which player will be able to put cards on the lily pad pond, make a tic-tac-toe, and score the most victory points.&#10;&#10;During the race around the pond the excitement builds as the players speed closer and closer to the flower at the finish-line! Care for a game of Sizzletoad! anyone?&#10;&#10;This is a great game for parents to play with their kids when they're looking for a bit more variation and strategy than say, &quot;Candy Land&quot; or the like.&#10;&#10;Here's a quick &quot;How to Play&quot; summary for the two-player game:&#10;&#10;In a two player game, of Sizzletoad! the players shuffle and split the deck (which is filled with an equal number of Sizzletoads, Fossilticks, and Paperducks.)&#10;&#10;Each round a single card is compared between the players and the winner of the duel puts either of those two cards onto the lily-pad tic-tac-toe grid of the board.  The other card goes into that player's discard pile.&#10;&#10;When one of the players places a matching &quot;3-in-a-row&quot; card on the tic-tac-toe grid, the other player counts the cards in his/her own discard pile, scores one point for each card and moves his/her game piece around the board by that many pips, then hands his/her cards over to the maker of the tic-tac-toe.&#10;&#10;The maker of the tic-tac-toe then puts those cards into his/her own discard pile and adds them all up, scoring one point for each card and also moving his/her game piece around the board by that many pips.&#10;&#10;All of the cards are then shuffled, re-dealt, and the players have another duel. The players continue dueling and adding cards to the board and their own discard piles and moving their game pieces around the numbered pips on the board.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who makes it all the way around the board onto or past the flowered lily-pad before the other player.&#10;&#10;With easy game play, this solid game is a fine addition to any &quot;children's'&quot; game library.&#10;&#10;Remember:  Sizzletoad-beats-Paperduck-which-beats-Fossiltick-which-beats-Sizzletoad!&#10;&#10;Sizzletoad! by Mindspan Labs (previously WizerGames) is Made in the USA&#10;&#10;Mindspan Labs Digital has released a 1 and 2 player app version of Sizzletoad! that is now available in the Apple app store.&#10;&#10;",

If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players compete at this spin-and-move race to the chimney.&#10;&#10;There are two editions to this game. One is a standard long-box game with a traditional foldout game board, featuring flat plastic reindeer on wooden stands. The other edition features a 3-D rooftop game board that sits atop the game box, with holes in the roof to insert the plastic reindeer for movement. Both editions include a wooden nose for Rudolph to help a player in moving through the cloud spaces.&#10;&#10;The 3-D version also came with a Santa Claus sack of five jingle bells so that players could mark how many times they had won. I do not recall if the standard edition came with this sack.&#10;&#10;",

At the start, the board is perfectly balanced, but as the players move the marbles, the board tilts back and forth depending on the weight distribution of the marbles.&#10;&#10;There are 18 &quot;slide&quot; areas around the board, and should your marble end up in one of these slides, a tilt of the board may send your marble forward or backward, or possibly right into the &quot;home&quot; area.&quot; (Think &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; with actual chutes.)&#10;&#10;Though essentially a children's roll-and-move game, young players will quickly learn how to make the laws of gravity work for them. There is also some low-level strategy as players may choose to move their marbles backward if it would allow them to enter a slide.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, Checkers may move to any adjacent, empty square. A King may only move by jumping (in any direction) over friendly Checkers or Kings, capturing as he goes. Captured Checkers may be reintroduced later, but Kings that are captured do not return to the game.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of jumping are the same as in the game Checkers, except that Kings may jump off the far edge of the board, into the 'end zone.' This King is removed from play. If a King has an opportunity to jump, he must jump, continuing until no more jumps are possible. So beware!&#10;&#10;Winning: Victory is achieved when a player has jumped two Kings into the end zone.&#10;&#10;Royal Carpet is an attempt to create a game of tempo in which friendly pieces have both positive and negative synergies. Crafty players will block jumps and then unblock them later, forcing an enemy King to jump his royal brethren. For those so inclined, this game is fun to play with a backgammon doubling cube, held initially by the Red player.&#10;&#10;",

At first it seemed the battle would be easily won: for each of your soldiers who fell in battle a score of Marauders were dispatched. But by the third day it became apparent that, while your own forces rapidly dwindled, there would be no end to the Barbarian horde. And this morning your losing battle quickly became a rout: The King was slain, you found yourself surrounded, and the forces controlled by you and your brother were reduced to a mere handful a piece.&#10;&#10;Now, as the Marauders press in, you know that you will soon be sent to your reward. But you don't fear death. In fact, only one thing weighs on your mind: this is your absolute last chance to outdo your brother. And you are certain he is thinking the same thing.&#10;&#10;Object: Each player will attempt to amass more Kills than his opponent before both Princes die in battle.&#10;&#10;Reference cards are also provided but not required.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Formula-1 auto racing game published in Russian. Half-page of 'English' rules translated by a non-native English speaker. Appears to be just a roll and move game with a little strategy in choosing which of two lanes to select when moving forward or diagonally following connecting arrows. Track is in color on heavy paper approximately 17 x 22 inches and, from the graphics, appears to be a track in Australia. Cars on heavy paper are approximately 1 inch cutouts that are folded into a triangular 'tube' to give a 3D representation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description quoted from the rulebook:&#10;&quot;The object of the game is to achieve the highest total score including bonuses.  This is accomplished by rolling dice combinations which match the categories on the score sheet and by the skillful choice of scoring options.&quot;&#10;&#10;Imagine playing Yahtzee with poker dice, and you've got the basic premise of Royal Kismet.  There are three suits available - red, black, and green - with values from 6 to Ace in each suit.  Players attempt to create a poker hand (or other scoring set) after rolling the dice three times.&#10;&#10;What makes Royal Kismet truly unique are the dice included.  Each die has a unique distribution of numbers and suits - making it much tougher to calculate the odds of rolling that last Ace you need.  (Blank sides and a Joker can also affect the roll.)&#10;&#10;",
