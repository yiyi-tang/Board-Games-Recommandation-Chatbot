Players are collecting sets using cards in hand and an open draft.&#10;&#10;Players draw and discard cards, forming sets and runs as in Rummy. Once each player has formed their hand, they score. Each two of a kind is 1 point, each three of a kind is 3 points, each four of a kind is 7 points, a six-card straight is 5 points and a six-card flush is 5 points.&#10;&#10;The start player has a ring from King Solomon, and if they have the most points (or tied) they keep the ring and score 3 bonus points. Otherwise, the ring moves clockwise. The game ends when every player has had the ring, and the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Players can draw from the deck, or from the pool, and hold or discard. When a player holds, they put their hand down until everyone is ready to score. Players cannot keep drawing , they are forced to hold finally.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;King Solomon once used many angels to build the temple with the power of the ring given by the archangel Michael. Use Solomon's Ring to create an army of angels stronger than any other player!

    "Description": "Tang Garden with all Expansions (Golden Age, Ghost Stories and Seasons and every other Promo excluding the Golden Cat).&#10;&#10;The Tang dynasty was considered the first golden age of the classical and now iconic Chinese gardens. Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself and from where he ruled. Players will act as Imperial Garden Designers and they will be called to build the most incredible garden while balancing the elements of Nature.&#10;&#10;Tang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns by playing one of the two actions available in the game:&#10;&#10;1) Placing tiles and matching the elements to increase their personal nature balance and unlock more character miniatures.&#10;&#10;By balancing the nature elements on the player boards, players will attract new characters into the garden. On each player turn, if the elements are balanced, the player will have to choose one miniature from the ones available and finally decide which one of the characters will be placed in the garden, orienting them towards their favorite background, while keeping the other with you to keep exploiting its ability.&#10;&#10;2) Draw decoration cards and place one on the board to get prestige by completing collections.&#10;&#10;Players will draw a quantity of cards based on the board situation and choose one to keep. Players will then have to place the chosen decoration in one of the available spots in the garden, creating a unique and seamless scenario that will never be the same.&#10;&#10;During the game, by placing tiles on special parts of the board, you will be able to place a panorama tile, a new element that adds a never ending perspective for the visitors. Both small and big panoramas will be placed perpendicularly to the board by attaching it to the board insert by creating a seamless look on the four sides of the board. The Panoramas will interact with the characters at the end of the game by giving prestige points based on what your visitor sees and likes.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Airships and Automatons players play as an Automaton that can convert into an Airship and back again. They will be traveling around their city sheet completing tasks with dice rolls. Certain areas require the  player to be an Airship while other tasks require the player to be an Automaton. Further still, there are two spaces that can be used by either.&#10;&#10;Players will have to move each turn, 1 space as an Automaton or up to 2 spaces as an Airship. They will use their dice to Convert, move an extra space or two, or activate their area of the City. Players also gain powers and create combos by completing tasks in the City.&#10;&#10;Opportunities arise for players who are playing quickly to trigger a bonus by moving back into Area 1 of the City which allows all players to Convert, but the triggering player to earn a special bonus.&#10;&#10;The game plays over 12 revolutions of the City sheet. Each revolution will last a number of rounds determined by the players. Will they play fast? Will they play slow to do all of the actions? The choices are plenty!&#10;&#10;Scoring is done for each area with the players having a grand total at the end. The winning Automaton will have to master the clock as well as plan ahead each time focusing to maximize areas so they can outscore their rivals.&#10;&#10;Airships and Automatons can be played solo or with up to 4 players. There are suggestions for how to combine the airships and automaton cards, but with this print and play format, players can create any number of combinations they choose. Additionally, printing out a set of cards for each player allows them to choose their own combinations and see if their own skill can beat their opponents when using the same Airship/Automaton combination!&#10;&#10;Get ready to roll and write in this all new Steampunk game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Compared to basic Dose, Double Dose includes cards that make players reveal truths, perform dares, and share their deepest, darkest history. It also integrates an online function that allows players to reload random rule, dare, truth, and never-have-I-ever suggestions via the website: dosecards.com.&#10;&#10;Players race to play or trade all of their cards. Each card can change the color, advance the game, or make your friends drink. Cards are played on their color, but some cards allow players to trade their entire decks or otherwise change the game dynamics wildly. The winner is the first player to play all the cards.&#10;&#10;Similar to UNO, once a player only has two cards, they must shout, &quot;Dose!&quot; before another player realizes it or else they must drink and draw two cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The sprawling Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia has remained untouched by humankind. It&rsquo;s thousand year old red cedars and 300 foot Sitka spruces shadow uncharted paths. The forest has grown wild and unscathed. Until now.&#10;&#10;In humanity&rsquo;s quest for wealth and resources they have pushed further and further into the dense overgrowth. Only this time they&rsquo;ve traversed too far. In the depths of this Canadian forest lies the Viridian, an army of animals sworn to protect their home. Once content to hide, these high functioning animals with human-like cognition have nowhere left to go. It&rsquo;s time to fight.&#10;&#10;The attack against the invading human forces is led by Viridian High Marshal Caal, a vicious, but aging gorilla. He has championed Viridian since his escape from the Vancouver Zoo and united a ragtag group of animals who were also seeking safety. The group became organized and strengthened under his leadership, but now he is looking for a successor. You, a young general, must join this fight.&#10;&#10;Every game of Viridian: Final Reckoning represents a battle against the humans. Your goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible - place enough of your troops within striking distance to take them down. Every defeated enemy is another addition to your war resume. Additionally, every battle has specific goals you must meet in order to survive. Regardless of your score, if you do not meet the mission goal, you die. Not only are you battling for survival, but you&rsquo;re also fighting to become the next leader of Viridian. The player with the highest score becomes the next Viridian High Marshal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Ruled and guided by the enigmatic Ethereals, the T&rsquo;au seek to unite every sentient being under the light of the T&rsquo;au&rsquo;va, or Greater Good.

Your task is to spend their money wisely to get goods that are worth points.

The auctioneer records the starting funds for each player &mdash; $40-50M depending on the player count &mdash; and sets up the artifact deck by shuffling three gift cards with the 27 artifacts. Only 10-20 items will be sold during the game, with that number being determined by the player count.&#10;&#10;For each auction, the auctioneer reveals the item, then conducts the auction specified by that item, such as an open auction in which players write bids on their personal boards and raise them, an auctioneer bid in which the auctioneer calls out amounts and players lower their hand to drop out, a sealed bid in which agents reveal their bids simultaneously, and a second price bid in which the winner pays only the amount of the second-highest bid. If the auctioneer reveals a gift card from the deck, this gift goes to the player who won the most recent bid.&#10;&#10;The auctioneer tracks the funds that all players have available, and an agent must track their own holdings &mdash; and everyone else's &mdash; mentally. If they win a bid for more than they have, they must sell off previously acquired items at their listed opening bids to acquire funds.&#10;&#10;Once the specified number of items have been sold, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each tiles has four triangles, which match to neighbouring tiles to make squares. The triangles are coloured red, green and blue, or rainbow as jokers. Coloured sides must match up.&#10;&#10;The spells are shown on theme cards, and have simple patterns of squares, such as an L shape, or a V shape. When a player has built a pattern of squares that match the shape and colour of a them card they hold, they can reveal the card as a competed spell. The first player to get to three completed spells wins the game.&#10;&#10;A player can swap theme cards in hand for a public pool, or draw from the deck.&#10;&#10;Players also have item cards, which allow the tiles to be changed. So a quill lets a player rotate a tile. A pocket lens lets a play change a square's colour. By careful use or tiles and items, a player can complete their spells faster.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2017, and a second edition was published in 2018 with revised card design.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

If you're there now - you will be back to the daily terror instead of playing to relax. If you're about to do it - you may decide not to! Like we just said - congratulations!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;You step into the uncomfortable shoes of a parent whose sweet offspring brings him joy at the same time and seems to be trying to destroy him. All parents are different: there are businessmen and punks, politicians, managers, athletes, but they are all united by one thing - they try to survive without going crazy. Well, of course, and win. Each role has pros and cons, starts with different levels of health, sanity and money and has an individual special skill. There are two ways to win - you are either the last to be still alive or the first to get to 30 health and sanity.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS&#10;Before starting the game, do the following:&#10;Give a random parent card to each player. Return the unused ones to the box.&#10;Put cubes to indicate the current levels of sanity and health (initial values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;are marked on the parent cards).&#10;Shuffle all the playing cards and create a deck. Place it in the middle of the table.&#10;Give 4 cards to each player, as well as the starting money marked on their parent card. Three cards are then removed from the pile of cards and the top one is turned over so that it is visible to everyone.&#10;You are now ready to begin. Each action in the game is determined by the cards you play or are already in front of you.&#10;&#10;FIRST ROUND: The last person to have become a parent takes the three cards without bidding anything, the other players take one card from the deck. If there is no parent between you, skip the first round and start directly from the second.&#10;&#10;EVERY NEXT ROUND: You bid for the three cards visible on the market. With shouting, cunning, insults and everything. The one who bets the most wins. There are no restrictions on bidding - you can always intervene. The one who wins the bidding takes the three cards he has bid for. The others take one card from the top of the pile. The winner of the bidding starts first and can play as many cards as he wants - without restrictions. After him is the next player in clockwise direction. When everyone is done, it's time for the next round, which repeats the second round. And so on until a winner is announced in one of two ways:&#10;Either the last survivor or the first who reaches 30 health and sanity.&#10;&#10;",

Now you can participate in historical or what-if missions and aerial combats of WWII.&#10;&#10;Kamikaze 1946: Divine Wind accurately recreates the speed and deadliness of air-to-air combat in a fast moving game system. Based on historical combat results, aircraft characteristics, and tactics of the aces, the simple rules are easy to follow. Most missions can be completed in 1-2 hours, with 2-8 players. Each player can easily control a dozen or more aircraft. The rules and data you need are contained within, along with information on painting 1/300th scale aircraft from Luftwaffe 1946 Miniatures. Can you alter the path of history?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Great fun in the company of characters loved by the youngest.&#10;&#10;Colorful board, large pieces and spacious house make the game more attractive for children. Instead of pawns, wooden characters move around the board, so children can impersonate their favorite fairy tale characters. A standard die with dots is replaced here by a multicolored wooden dice, so even toddlers who can't count yet can play their first board game.&#10;The manual also encourages players to play the cooperative variant, in which all players collect berries to a common basket. This way, rivalry will be eliminated from the game and the little player can focus on having fun, enjoying the time spent together and teaching cooperation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Castle Von Loghan - Deluxe Edition is a co-op, group-decision making, survival board game that offers a unique narrative and dungeon-crawling gaming experience. The game includes several game modes, such as Story Campaign and Exploration.&#10;&#10;The Deluxe Edition comes with an additional Campaign Mission, a brand new game board, and additional game content.&#10;&#10;Working together as one group, the players adventure inside Castle von Loghan where they will face an array of dangers but also will find several valuable treasures.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players have to decide where to go next, solve the secrets of the room in which they have arrived, battle the enemies protecting it, then prepare for the next encounter.&#10;&#10;The only route to winning the game is through survival &mdash; and to survive, they need to work together.&#10;&#10;Notable mechanisms: Sharing of health and clarity, unique narrative events that require careful listening and decision making, a ten-game-long Story Campaign that is filled with the best RPG elements one could expect, easy-to-understand card-based tactical combat that comes with a variety of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Intro to the story:&#10;&#10;In 1970, inside the Albatross Scientific Institute (LOS ANGELES), a group of scientists make contact with a group of hyper-intelligent beings known as the CeDI (Celestial entities from the Downing Ipsys) who claim that humankind is doomed. They have brought with them some of their advanced technology, instructing the humans to make use of it in order to evacuate the Earth which, according to the aliens, will become uninhabitable in approximately 100 years. Aided by the scientists at the Institute, the aliens unlock G.O.D.O.S., an AI they have brought with them from their galaxy. They claim G.O.D.O.S. will help all of humanity... but the aliens seem to have a personal mission linked to G.O.D.O.S. as well; one which they haven&rsquo;t revealed to anyone else. On the 27th of August, G.O.D.O.S. is activated.&#10;&#10;A council is formed and, with the help of the aliens, they begin work on Project KARR. The goal is to build at least five ships that are not only capable of carrying about 1 billion people each, but can keep them alive for hundreds of years. The KARR also serve as colonization units. The news of the aliens and of Project KARR is shared, bit by bit, with the humans, and by 2067, the ships are ready to launch.&#10;&#10;In 2068, the ships leave earth, leaving behind all those who refuse to go.&#10;&#10;Each ship heads towards a different point in space in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to serve as a new home. They cannot go to the aliens&rsquo; solar system, since humans can not survive such a long journey or the interstellar travel required to get there. After several years in transit, the KARR-5 ship collides with a huge meteorite and is heavily damaged. Hundreds of thousands of humans die, and many of the ship&rsquo;s sectors are damaged beyond repair.&#10;&#10;In his desperation, a certain human decides to take matters into his own hands. Owning the only copy of G.O.D.O.S., a man named Deacon Padjin, the Prime Commander of the KARR-5, uploads G.O.D.O.S. to the KARR-5 ship&rsquo;s operating systems. G.O.D.O.S. takes over the entire ship!&#10;&#10;With the help of G.O.D.O.S., the ship is saved. Humans learn how to resurrect the dead by placing the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of deceased individuals into androids. The newly-resurrected individuals, known as the Resurrected, remain ignorant of their death and subsequent resurrection. This technology becomes so advanced over the years, that it is almost impossible for someone to tell if they&rsquo;re human or a Resurrected. The KARR-5&rsquo;s population begins growing back to its original size.&#10;&#10;G.O.D.O.S. secretly develops a semi-functional time-machine, but after extensive testing, the results are grim: it can only send people to the past, but it can&rsquo;t bring them back, and it cannot send anyone into the future. G.O.D.O.S.&#10;&#10;A few years pass; the KARR-5 is still stationary. Deacon Padjin, who is still deeply involved with the time-travel project, develops a module that allows time-travel to the future. After managing to remove G.O.D.O.S. from the ship's systems, he uses the time-machine to escape to the past, safely, taking the AI and some other people back with him.&#10;&#10;The remaining leaders of the KARR-5 assess the situation and, after 10 years of testing and many different iterations, manage to partially replicate the time-machine.  Having done so, about ten years later, they send a group of KarrSEC agents after Deacon and G.O.D.O.O.S. armed with a state-of-the-art tracking device, capable of following someone through time.  As there have been no changes to their timeline, it is a widely-believed hypothesis that Deacon succumbed to an untimely death, either during the jump or as a result of it.  However, the KARR-5 Council, and the KarrSEC, want to ensure that G.O.D.O.S. be dismantled so that it can&rsquo;t make any modifications to the timeline, thus changing the course of History forever.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the CeDI engage in secret meetings with some of the scientists from the Institute, informing them that the loss of G.O.D.O.S. will most likely have disastrous consequences. The CeDI finally reveal their true intentions: they need G.O.D.O.S. to break through a time bubble that has been placed around their planet in which an intergalactic battle is being fought. Without G.O.D.O.S., the CeDI will likely lose the battle, which could easily spread to other parts of the galaxy, a threat that none but the CeDI is prepared to face.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, the evidence about the sort of animal that could be responsible is inconclusive. Rumors abound that the murders might have been committed by a werewolf, given that they all occurred under the  light of a full moon. The local authorities, however, aren't taking that seriously. The only connection that the three  victims share is their love and patronage of a local watering hole called Ernie's Bar. Can you determine who (or what) is responsible for the deaths of these three victims? Beware: this case may get a little hairy!&#10;&#10;As with all Deadbolt Mystery Society games, you step into the role of the detective. Examining the evidence provided,visiting different locations and using the password protected QR mechanic to uncover the truth.&#10;&#10;Players win once they catch the killer, find whats missing or whatever else is needed to solve the case at hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Sedan 1940&quot; is a battalion and lower-level Operational wargame focused on the decisive action at Sedan led by Rommel in 1940, encircling the majority of the French army by driving through the Ardennes and surprising a contingent of less than stellar French divisions. The system focuses on combined arms, combat effects can vary depending on the units in a stack (also called a force). Units feature both a Primary Combat Value and a Secondary Combat Value representing different types of arms/weapons available to units, and advanced rules are available to further simulate radio issues with command and control.&#10;&#10;Forces are activated by chit pull, activating whole divisions at a time. Each unit is allowed two basic actions or one special action. The sequence of play is unstructured, allowing movement, assaults, fire-combat and planned assaults to occur as chaotically as they did historically. Unit types range from armor, infantry, artillery, anti-tank/air, engineer, and motorized units. Units can be placed in Overwatch status allowing them to engage in Opportunity Fire using their Primary Combat Value.&#10;&#10;Each day turn is approximately 2 hours while night turns are 4 hours for a total of 20 turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Harness Racing Game&quot; is quite literally that. The basic game has a lot in common with TOTO-ravi and Solvalla: for example, while the number of players is limited to 8 - with everyone driving 2 or 3 horses - any number of outside players can also participate in the totalisator betting. Just as in the other two games, the rules suggest a separate 'banker' player to handle the money and bets, presumably making the game feel more thematic.&#10;&#10;In the actual gameplay Ravipeli is quite a bit more involved, though. The most striking difference is the innovative movement technique, where instead of simply rolling and moving players must first promise a certain number of movement points, then roll 2 or 3 dice; the more they promise the faster and farther they move, but the risk of galloping also grows ever greater. Gallops bring negative points and at certain moments in the race or if happening repeatedly, may even result in disqualification. There is also a multitude of small rules on how to drive a galloping horse, how to change  lanes voluntarily or involuntarily, how to drive in between and in front of other horses, etc., which imitate the real rules of harness racing (even including things like &quot;Shouting at the horse, getting heated up&quot;) and lead either to disqualification or a fine that is taken from the offending driver's monetary prize, if they manage to reach the finish line.&#10;&#10;The rules are a bit vague in who actually wins and how so in that sense this game aims to be more of a harness racing simulator than a competitive game.&#10;&#10;",

Guess you&rsquo;ll have to bust them out. If the Wolf finds your brothers though, he&rsquo;ll toss them straight back in the clink. Get creative with your moves to get your farm built before your opponents. Will the Wolf be fooled if 3 pigs stack up in a poncho and make the rounds completing tasks?&#10;&#10;In 3 Pigs in a Poncho, players will move their dice around the action rondel completing the action matching their die value then re-rolling for their next turn. 3 Pigs is at its core a farming game. Players use actions to build their hideout which gives them bonuses from bricks, sticks, and straw. But building has to be done with care, straw can stack on anything, but sticks only stack on sticks and bricks and bricks only stack on bricks.&#10;&#10;Players also have an opportunity to raise livestock, building them stables and if they have a pair and an empty stable, they can get baby Unicorns, Llamas, and Cows!&#10;&#10;Players also try to keep their fairy tale pals safe from the Big Bad Wolf Sheriff, Red Riding Hood, Billy goat gruff and Puss in Boots need your help!&#10;&#10;Players will get to be strategic with their dice in that they can space the 3 pigs out on the rondel, but doing so makes them susceptible to being arrested by the Wolf who is also moving around the rondel. Or they can stack their piggies, less opportunity to get exactly the action they want, but less likely to be arrested also!&#10;&#10;The game plays until a player has completed all 3 sections of their hideout. Then players score on their sheets. The game is a roll and write in that the players roll dice and mark their player sheet based on the actions they completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Nighttime. The Cult of Gloom performs their dark rituals, seeking to open the way for their dread lord and master. Rumors abound of a red-masked killer lurking in the shadows. A monstrous giant rat-man-beast stalks the sewers, its terrible teeth teeming with toxins. And, above it all, The Chairman of The Organization &mdash; the largest organized crime syndicate the world has ever seen &mdash; watches the ebb and flow of his underlings, his subjects, his city. If things need a more hands-on approach, he'll send his Operative to deal with the dirty work. A few street-level heroes have teamed up, calling themselves Dark Watch. The gun-toting vigilante Expatriette has plans (and guns) for every contingency. The ancient martial artist and auto mechanic Mr. Fixer has a lifetime of experience. The cursed paranormal investigator NightMist knows countless incantations. The arcane avian apprentice The Harpy &mdash; once known as the villainous Matriarch &mdash; is now a bird of a different feather, using her magical power for good (though she still has a lot to learn about control). The hapless Setback&rsquo;s luck might be bad (most of the time), but he&rsquo;s the heart and soul of the team, ready to throw himself into danger without a second thought to protect others. As a team, they have a lot to offer, but they still have their work cut out for them. Perhaps they could use a little help from a new hero? Time will tell...&#10;&#10;",
