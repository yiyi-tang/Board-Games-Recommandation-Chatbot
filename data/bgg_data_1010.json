    "Description": "CDOS, short for Crazy DOS and stylized as C:DOS, is a game themed after DOS, more specifically MS-DOS and multi-user Concurrent DOS (CDOS).&#10;&#10;&quot;Set in your average office from the late 80s, your task is to transfer the files in a floppy disk before your pesky coworkers crash the server.&quot;&#10;&#10;Crazy DOS borrows mechanics from Crazy Eights and related games but what makes it a unique game is the use of real DOS commands (most cards represent both a file to &quot;transfer&quot; and a command you can &quot;execute&quot; to protect you from your opponents' actions or to speed up your shedding strategy) and a gameplay that simulates working with networked PCs.&#10;&#10;The 18 commands in C:DOS work like they would on the computer: with MD you can create a new directory (pile), CD lets you change the current working directory (the pile where cards/files can be transferred to), CLS cleans your shell (the pile where you execute commands), with ATTRIB you can set files as hidden files (to transfer them face down and bluff), DEFRAG lets you see the contents of piles and reorder the cards/files to your liking...&#10;&#10;C:DOS has an educational component in that it can be used to teach players basic computing in general and DOS in particular.&#10;&#10;Removing the DOS and PC rules from the game, a deck of Crazy DOS can be used to play what is basically a slightly different version of Crazy Eights, making for a simpler party game that can be used to introduce players to Crazy DOS itself.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 2-player card game based on the Resident Evil franchise using collectible card game style mechanics. One player is the Heroes. The other is the Umbrella Corporation.&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks:  &#10;&#10;     The Hero Deck has 3 types of cards: Teams, Characters and Events.  These have the following sub-types: Operative, Merc, Survivor&#10;     The Umbrella Deck has 3 types of cards: Facilities, Units and Events.  Unit cards are further divided into the following sub-types: Soldiers, Monsters, Zombies and Vehicles. Traps are a subtype of Event.&#10;&#10;&#10;Event cards and Traps, when played, take effect immediately and are then discarded. Other types of cards remain in play.&#10;&#10;The Umbrella player starts with all 6 Facility cards in play except for the New Facility. &#10;The Hero searches his deck for 1 Team Card and puts it into play. &#10;Each player draws 2 cards for their starting Hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 6 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw Phase&#10;         Each player draws 2 cards from their respective decks.  &#10;         If the Hero player has no teams in play, he must search his deck for a team, put it in play, and then shuffle his deck. &#10;    &#10;     Event Phase&#10;         Certain event cards are played only in this Phase.  Players take turns, starting with the Umbrella player. &#10;    &#10;     Recruit Phase&#10;         Cards are put into play from the players hand. When putting a card into play it is placed face up on the table. &#10;         The Hero player puts team cards into play. The Hero player then puts character cards into play. Character cards must be attached to team cards.  A team card may have up to 2 characters attached (or 3, if at least one of them is a survivor).&#10;         The Umbrella player may play one or more Units.&#10;         The Umbrella player may play the New Facility card.  &#10;    &#10;     Assault Phase&#10;         The Hero player may conduct one assault - one of his teams may attack one target facility.  The Hero player commits the team, its characters, and any event cards he wants to play that will assist an assault. He adds up the force values and bonuses of all these cards and adds 2D6. This is the Assault Force Total (AFT). &#10;         The Umbrella player commits the targeted facility, one unit, one or more traps and any events that will assist in defending against the assault. He adds up the force values and bonuses of all these cards and adds 2D6. This is the Facility Defence Total (FDT). &#10;         If the AFT is equal to or greater than the FDT the base is destroyed and removed from play. If the FDT is greater the Team is destroyed and removed from play.  Of the attached characters of a destroyed Team 50% are discarded and 50% put back in the Hero players hand. &#10;         If the facility is destroyed all other cards used in its defence are discarded. If the facility wins, there is a 50% chance the defending unit is still discarded. Win or lose all Event and Trap cards are discarded. &#10;    &#10;     Search Phase&#10;         The Umbrella player may conduct one Search and Destroy Mission - one of his Units may attack one target team.  This is handled just like an assault.  The Umbrella player generates a Search and Destroy Force Total (SDFT). The Hero player generates a Team Defence Total (TDT). An Umbrella unit, even if it wins, has a 50% chance after combat of being discarded. &#10;    &#10;     End Phase&#10;         Max hand size is 5 cards.  Players discard excess cards. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The Hero Player wins if all the Umbrella facilities are destroyed.  The Umbrella Player wins if all the teams are destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

You move the guards just like heroes.&#10;- Reinforcement guards: these extra guards are added when the theft is commited.&#10;- Guard room: if a Hero an a Guard are (by mistake) on the same tile, the hero gets caught and must be freed.&#10;- Beholder: a Hero and the Beholder cannot stand or pass through a Mall tile where the other type of pawn is standing. A hero must be standing on a Command space to move the Beholder.&#10;- Sensor: a Hero cannot stand on a space covered by the sensor. A hero must be standing on a Control space to rotate the sensor.&#10;- Locked escape: a Hero must be standing on a Code space for the dwarf to be able to escape.&#10;&#10;All of these modules bring in more options to make Magic Maze a more intense and puzzling experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2 players in which one player represents the West, the other Russia. The premise of the game is that since the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union as a Superpower, Russia has maintained an active war-footing with the West, using every means possible (covert, hacking, criminal, disinformation, hard force, etc.) to subvert and destabilise the Western powers and the new world order. The long term goal is to remain a major player in an illiberal, multi-polar world.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck. Some cards can be used by both players. Some cards can only be used by one side.&#10;&#10;The game starts in the year 2000 with each turn representing 2 years. The game ends in 2020. There are a total of 11 turns which proceed as follows:&#10;&#10;1.    Players are dealt 7 cards each.&#10;&#10;2.    A player may reveal a spy card to look at his opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;3.    Players can discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.&#10;&#10;4.    A player may discard an economic card to draw 2 cards.&#10;&#10;5.    A player may discard a military card to make his opponent discard a random card&#10;&#10;6.    A player may discard a political card to draw 3 cards and discard 2 cards.&#10;&#10;7.    A player may discard a culture card to gain 1 Victory point.&#10;&#10;8.    Players reveal their hands.&#10;&#10;9.    The player with the highest force total wins the hand.  Every card has a force value but a player can only count cards that match his side or that can be used by both players. A player may only use 1 card of the same type, so for example, he could use one military card toward his total but not two. This is the &ldquo;One-Type-only Rule&rdquo;. If a player reveals a crime card, however, he may break the One-Type-Only Rule, once, unless his opponent plays a law card.&#10;&#10;10.   Discard all cards.&#10;&#10;If any player wins 3 hands in a row, they win the game.  Otherwise the winner of the first turn gets 1 Victory point (VP), the winner of the second turn gets 2 VP, the winner of the third turn gets 3 VP and so on. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players select units from a list of over 50 characters/units with differing hit points, equipment and capabilities.  For a typical game each side should have about 20-24 hit points worth of units.  To start units are placed on a player&rsquo;s back 2 rows.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck containing Attack, Defence, Move, Special and Option cards.

Options include but are not limited to healing, regeneration, disarming, immobilization and fear.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Draw Phase&#10;-    Draw 5 Cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Action Phase&#10;-    Play cards from your hand to have your units move and attack.  Move and attack cards have an associated range value that determines the exact distance in spaces that a unit moves or is hit by an attack from its source. &#10;-    Attacks do one hit point worth of damage unless otherwise stated. The attacked player may play defence cards to negate attacks. Units are eliminated when their hit point value reaches zero.&#10;&#10;3.   End Phase&#10;-    Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by completely eliminating all enemy units.&#10;&#10;",

Most of the locations are for sale, the moving player can buy them. If a player's pawn later enters an already owned location, the player must pay rent to the owner. When owning all locations of a site (two to four locations per site), the owner can build houses and later hotels on the locations to increase the rent for other players. The game ends after a fixed time, or if all players but one are bankrupt.&#10;&#10;This version includes some major differences to the standard DKT game:&#10;&#10;In every region there are two souvenirs, priced 50 and 100. You can buy one of them when you stop in the region, the cheaper one is sold first. You can only own one souvenir per region. Whenever you pass start, you get 50 extra for each souvenir you own.&#10;&#10;Field 21 is a Geb&auml;ude (&quot;building&quot;) special field. It allows you to build up to 2 houses or 1 hotel (if you already have 4 houses) on each property you own, even if you do not own the whole region.&#10;&#10;There are no auction rules, only the person stopping on an unowned property can buy it.&#10;&#10;You can sell properties among players at all times for whatever prices you settle on.&#10;&#10;The rulebook includes a long section describing the various tourist attractions depicted in each region.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FusionPlay &ndash; Heroes is the first mobile NFC card game. It&rsquo;s played with physical cards, each containing a Near Field Communication chip. These chips enable communication between the playing cards and a smartphone. As soon as you slide a card under the smartphone, it appears on the screen of the phone. Then the app processes the actions and visualizes the results. The game itself is a duel between two players like a digital-analog homage to beat-em-up games of the 16-bit era. Each player chooses one of the 4 heroes and uses the heroes&rsquo; unique skills to win the battle. The game is fast paced and always motivates to play &ldquo;just one more round&rdquo;. All components are pocket sized, so the player can always have them with them.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game, the smartphone tray plates need to be placed on the table, and the smartphone should be placed on top of the tray plates. These little bars make it easy to slide the cards under the smartphone. Both players choose one hero and take all 7 cards of this hero. The app is launched, and a &ldquo;Single Round&rdquo; or a full match is selected. Then both players scan their hero cards in the &ldquo;Choose your Heroes&rdquo; screen.&#10;The game begins.&#10;&#10;Both players shall choose one card, and slide it (with the face down) under the smartphone. The players will take their cards back again. The app will uncover both played cards, then process and visualize the effects of the cards. Depending on the actions taken, the players will deal damage, heal themselves, buff themselves, lower the stats of the opponent, or debuff; e.g. inflict negative conditions like burning or bleeding. Attacks can also miss or hit critically, which depends mainly upon the Dexterity values of the heroes. The game ends, when one player runs out of lives. When playing a &ldquo;best of 3&rdquo;, you need to win two rounds for winning the whole match.&#10;&#10;Many effects from the actions depend on one or more attributes of the heroes. An example: Donar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Into the Skies&rdquo; raises the Dexterity for one round. His &ldquo;Hammer Throw&rdquo; adds twice the Dexerity to the damage. It may seem like a good move to raise dexterity first, and use the &ldquo;Hammer Throw&ldquo; one round later. A good, but also very predictable move. Each hero has 6 unique actions that all trigger different effects. Most of them trigger multiple effects at once. If you remember beat-em-up games from the good old 16-bit era, then imagine every card symbolizes one button on the controller, triggering a specific move.&#10;&#10;Besides using your actions in the right situations, they can also be used to sum up to powerful combos. Each hero has two unique combos and one mighty super-combo. To trigger a combo, you need to play the cards in a specific order and then activate them by playing the hero card itself. The hero card can also be used to block an opponent&rsquo;s combo, or to pause one round, and regenerate some energy.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The treasure that hides under the sand changed the peaceful lives of the bedouin tribes that inhabited the planet. Used to the hard life of the desert, these tribes soon became the most valuable allies in the gas-extraction business. You are the new leader of your tribe and must guide your people to find the gas wells and to build  extraction ducts that will reshape the landscape forever. Use your people wisely to control the most strategic places on the map and keep an eye on the movements of rival tribes. Don't forget that the powerful and greedy corporations of Earth pull the strings in the shadows and are capable of helping you...or making your tribe disappear between the dunes.&#10;&#10;Bedouin is a strategic game whose main mechanisms are area control and hand management. There is a high interaction between players as they collect the tokens of the gas fields that their tribe controls; these tokens are worth different amounts of victory points, and their value can be modified by different actions during the game. The modular construction of the desert guarantees that you will not find two games the same. Every action counts under the burning sun of the bedouin's planet!&#10;&#10;",

Care has been taken to make the game feel like a Soviet-Afghan wargame; The Soviets may be able to take lots of tanks and helicopters, but when the enemy is ambushing from hidden positions on high ground, the tanks wont be able to target them and the helicopters wont even know where they are. Tanks will need to back off from areas of high ground in order to get a shot and helicopters will have to spot the hidden ambushers, or rely on information from the ground in order to work out where the Dushman (Enemy) are.&#10;&#10;In the end this game is all about asymmetrical warfare and providing the feel and tactics of the period. The game naturally encourages real-life tactics and unit organizations (although example soviet organizations are also provided) and each faction has its own unique tactical choices and challenges to overcome.&#10;&#10;Rules are provided for Infantry (both regular squads and specialist teams like spotters and heavy weapon teams), vehicles (from the humble transport truck to the various BTRs, BMPs, BMD and heavier armor of the soviets.) and helicopters. Vehicle and anti-vehicle rules have been streamlined to be as simple as possible and allow the focus to be on infantry. Rules for suppression, morale and infantry quality are all part of the package. Helicopters and vehicles can transport troops and helicopters can land and take off in-game, or be called in by spotters, provided there are enemy targets around...&#10;&#10;Games take anywhere from an hour and a half to 2 hours for larger games and a variety of markers are provided with the rules for ease of play. A 6' X 4' or 4' X 4' table is recommended.&#10;&#10;",

There are two sets of instructions on every card. One set gives orders to patrolling units unaware of the player. The other set of orders is for aware units attacking the player's units.&#10;&#10;Patrol instructions include: Sweeping the area for the player, Patrolling objectives, Checking suspicious behavior, etc...&#10;&#10;Attack instructions include: Rushing the player, Defensive posturing, Flanking, etc...&#10;&#10;Each card includes: Compass directions, Dice rolls, Player to attack, and Reactions. There are also playing card symbols on each card to be used for variable activations or objective orders in the case of multiple objectives.&#10;&#10;Included with the deck and rulebook are sixteen shards matching the playing card symbols. These can be used for random setup of enemy units.&#10;&#10;The rules were specifically designed for miniature games with ranged weapons.&#10;&#10;For each enemy activation, the player draws a card for that enemy unit. The card gives the enemy order or orders.

Take a gem for every group you form. When you sell gems, the price you get is equal to the largest group of that gem on the table.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, the values of gems fluctuate, so you want to sell when the price is high. Just don't wait too long! One skillful play by an opponent can drastically reduce the price of your favorite gem!&#10;&#10;",

The green shortcuts may only be used to capture other aunts. If an aunt gets on the same space as another aunt of the same color, they get stacked one on another and form a double-aunt. The double-aunt may move twice the rolled number of spaces.

    "Description": "The next time your favorite kid wants to play War, suggest a game of Battles instead. Unlike War, Battles will be over in 10 minutes and actually presents simple but meaningful choices for the players.&#10;&#10;Battles is a 2 player game played with a standard deck of cards. The game consists of 7 battles, each of which has 3 skirmishes. Whoever wins 4 battles wins the game.&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;Shuffle the deck of cards. Deal 21 cards to each player. Set the remaining 10 cards aside.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;The game consists of 7 battles, each consisting of 3 skirmishes. To play a battle, each player draws the top 3 cards from their deck. Both players simultaneously choose one of their cards and presents it face down. After both have chosen a card, they turn it face up. The player who played the highest card (aces are high) wins the skirmish, and moves the 2 cards to their side. If the cards are of equal denomination (a tie) then the 2 cards are set aside in the middle. After all 3 skirmishes are played in this fashion, the winner of the battle is determined. The player who won the most skirmishes (typically 2 or 3) wins the battle and takes all 6 cards and stacks them in a set. Players then draw the next 3 cards from their deck to begin another battle.&#10;&#10;RESOLVING TIES&#10;Typically winning 2 or more skirmishes will win a battle. However, if 2 skirmishes end in a tie, then only 1 skirmish is needed to win the battle. However, if both players each win 1 skirmish, and the other is a tie (or if all 3 skirmishes are tied) then the battle is unresolved. In this case, a 4th skirmish is needed and both players draw 1 card from the set of ten set aside at the beginning of the game. Whoever draws the highest card wins the battle. If the 4th skirmish is also a tie, the youngest player wins the battle.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;After all 7 battles have been played, the winner of the most battles (4 or more) wins the game (and the war!)&#10;&#10;",

There are 2 basic card types: Units and Spells. &#10;Units are further divided into Individuals and Groups. All cards have a strength value between 0 and 10 and a special ability that is activated and resolved as soon as the card is played.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of the table. The top card is flipped over to be the start of the discard pile. The first player to go is dealt 2 cards. &#10;The second player to go is dealt 3 cards. The third player to go is dealt 4 cards and so on.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns with each turn being divided into 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Conquest Phase&#10;         You win if, at the beginning of your turn, your cards in play have a combined strength of 40 or more.  &#10;    &#10;     Scour Phase&#10;         Draw 1 card from the deck and put it in your hand.  &#10;    &#10;     Deploy Phase&#10;         Play 1 card from your hand face up to the table. Immediately resolve the card&rsquo;s special ability. If the card has a strength of zero (most spells) it is immediately discarded. Otherwise it stays in play as part of your army, its strength contributing to your army&rsquo;s total strength. You may play a second card if the strength of both cards played is 10 or less. &#10;    &#10;     Last Phase&#10;         You may unflip a card in play by discarding a card from your hand.  Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;A player wins if, at the beginning of your turn, your cards in play have a combined strength of 40 or more.&#10;&#10;",

The Computer is your friend. Traitors are executed. Good Citizens help root out Traitors. Mutants are traitors. Secret Society members are traitors. You are a Mutant and a Secret Society Member. You know very little because of your (Red) low security clearance. You have been assigned to a team of Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters shoot trouble. Stay Alert! Trust No One! Keep your Laser Handy!&#10;&#10;Each player has a family of 6 clones. Every time your clone is killed, one of your remaining clones takes his place. When all six have been killed you lose and are out of the game. Players try to survive while killing off their opponent&rsquo;s clones.&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks: The Mission Deck and The Paranoia Deck.  Cards are of 4 types: Combat, Comprehension, Communication and Treason.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Requisition Phase&#10;-   Each player fills their hand to 5 cards from the Paranoia Deck.&#10;&#10;2.  Mission Phase&#10;-   Flip over the top card of the Mission Deck. This describes an encounter all players must face. The encounter will be one of three types: Combat, Comprehension, or Communication. Each player must play (discard) one Paranoia card of a matching type to survive. If a player cannot play a matching card his Clone is killed.&#10;&#10;3.  Action Phase&#10;-   The current player may initiate one or more actions. Actions require the expenditure of Paranoia cards. He may continue doing this until he has no cards left in his hand.  The Actions include: &#10;&bull;   Situational Awareness: Discard 2 Comprehension cards to draw 3 Paranoia cards and put them in your hand. &#10;&bull;   Accusations: Play one or more Treason cards onto an opponent. The opponent may play Communication cards to discard Treason cards on a one to one basis.  If a player has 3 or more Treason cards and no way to discard them, that clone is immediately terminated by the computer. &#10;&bull;   Shoot the Traitor: The player picks a target opposing player who has at least &#10;one Treason card. Both play combat cards from their hands. The player who plays more combat cards kills the opposing player. If both play an equal number of cards then roll 1D6: The higher roll wins. If still tied, both are killed. &#10;&bull;   Special Actions: Some cards allow for special actions when played. These special actions (SA) are described on the individual cards. &#10;-    All played cards from Action Phase are discarded.&#10;&#10;4.  Debriefing Phase&#10;-   Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard any excess cards.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to kill off all your opponents&rsquo; clones and be the last one alive.&#10;&#10;",

It starts like this; choose your IT Champion, cards are dealt, you're fighting against the other players, and the evil Der Magicker a diabolical hacker. You see Der Magicker is building his army of zombies to take over the world and more importantly beat you and the other players. Champions must gather or steal weapons, troops, and strategically play cards to beat Der Magicker and the other players. There are many ways to gather your army, draw a card, attack another player, kill a higher powered zombie, etc. Pay close attention because one card will change the game entirely or can be a win card with the correct gameplay.

On September 15th Indian forces launched their counter-attack,&#10;&#10;Operation Riddle, that sought to throw back the Pakistanis and take back the crucial crossroads town of Chawinda. What ensued was the largest tank battle of the post-WWII era to that date, one that would only be eclipsed by the 1973 Yom Kippur War.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Hot Blood, Cold Steel is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&#10;One sheet of 180 single-sided, un-mounted counters (mounted counters can be had for an additional $5.00).&#10;One Players' aid sheet&#10;7 pages of rules&#10;&#10;The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. Hot Blood, Cold Steel uses the Blood and Steel design. Players draw formation chits to activate their formations and units, and play is very interactive. A complete game takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete. Although designed for two players, Hot Blood, Cold Steel is well suited to solitaire play.&#10;&#10;",

Who helps to find the right building materials? &#10;The children learn how to build a house step by step and to find out what kind of work and materials are needed. The adults support the children by declaring and naming construction work, building materials and vehicles after the six building lots.&#10;When navigating the road network between construction sites, the kids also train their fine motor skills. Then the children let the colorful trucks ride along the streets. With the help of the small trucks, the children now transport the wrongly supplied building material to the right construction sites. &#10;Depending on the development stage of the children, only three and later all construction sites are to be supplied. In assigning and discovering the colorful construction site, the everyday knowledge and logical thinking of the little ones is stimulated playfully. For older children, game variations with first rules are possible and the color cubes are used.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll the die and try to collect their own tiles by picking them first from the shared pool, and when this is exhausted, from tiles picked up by other players. The winner is the first player to obtain all their tiles and complete the picture on their board. The rules as printed actually contains several incongruities and ambiguities leaving important aspects up to extrapolation or guesswork.&#10;&#10;There is no date of publication, but the 70s is a decent guess.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Swords is a fast-paced simultaneous action card game for 2-5 players that feels like a multi-person sword fight!  It's quick, fun, intense, strategic, and not too difficult to learn.  Players play their cards at the same time either on themselves or on an opponent and each card has a different effect depending on where it's played!&#10;&#10;Swords is an exciting game of quick decisions and sudden changes in fortune, just like a real sword fight!  You and your opponents make your decisions in secret and execute them at the same time, strategies adapt by the second, and every hand is a surprise!  You can win by playing aggressively, always attacking and making opponents draw cards, or you can hope that the others will be so busy fighting each other that they won't notice your quickly diminishing hand as you Yield and discard an extra card.  Often a person you were just attacking might suddenly become an ally when you realize, almost too late, that someone else is about to win and you need to team up to take them down!  There are many different strategies, some readily apparent and others more sneaky, and reading your opponents is just as important as making the right choice at the right time!&#10;&#10;Here's a quick summary of how to play!&#10;&#10;Everyone starts with seven cards. Each round, players each choose a card in secret and then play their cards at the same time.  The goal of the game is to run out of cards first.&#10;&#10;There are four types of cards: Attack, Defend, Yield, and Riposte.&#10;&#10;You can play any card on yourself or an opponent and each card does a different thing depending on where it is played!&#10;&#10;Attack when played on an opponent makes them draw 2 cards.  If you play it on yourself you lay a trap for any player who plays a card on you, making them draw 4 cards.  But look out, it's risky!  Anything that's played on you still hits you, and if no one plays anything on you the trap backfires and you have to draw 2 yourself!&#10;&#10;Defend when played on yourself does what you might expect, it defends you!  When you play it on someone else, it acts as a sort of guard break, negating cards they've played on themselves... just watch out for that Attack trap, Defend is defenseless against that!&#10;&#10;Yield lets you sneak an extra card into the discard pile when you play it on yourself.  When you play it on an opponent, however, instead of putting that extra card in the discard you give it to them!  Like some kind of card vampire!&#10;&#10;Riposte is like a counter attack when you play it on yourself, it bounces Attacks, Yields, and Ripostes back at the person who played them on you.  When you play Riposte on someone else it immobilizes them for the next turn, leaving them wide open!  Careful though, if more than half of the people playing lay down Riposte on the same turn it causes a Clash and every single person has to draw 2 cards!&#10;&#10;The main game is played with 3-5 players but there is also a fun and sneaky 2 player variant that shakes things up with a hidden Dagger mechanic!&#10;&#10;A battle usually lasts around 5 to 10 minutes!  You can play single battles or play a war where battles award 1 point for a tie or 2 points for winning alone, and the first player to 6 points wins the war!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Knowing that goats eat cabbages, that wolves eat goats and that all of them fear dogs, how will you cross a river with wolves, goats, dogs and cabbages without losing too many of them? Rules are simple, the goal is to earn as many points as possible by saving &quot;passengers&quot; (animals or vegetables).&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a hand of 4 cards taken from his own Passenger deck. Each turn, the active player reveals the top card from a common Placement deck, perform the appropriate action by playing a card from her hand, then discards it. She may also optionally play an Action card from her hand if she has any left.&#10;&#10;Passenger cards are cards picturing animals (Wolf, Goat or Shepperd dog) or vegetables (Cannage), while Action cards have an effect on all players.&#10;&#10;Players must fill boats with 3 passengers before they leave for the Island where the passangers will disenbark. Players must keep in mind that when disembarking, Goats will eat Cabbages and Wolves will eat Goats, unless there's a Shepperd dog in the boat to check on everyone. Players get points for all Passengers getting safely to the Isaland.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a players plays the last Passenger card from his hand, which triggers the last turn. Players add-up all their points and the one with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The rest of the players choose a combination of race and class for their Hero. Certain spellcasting classes also get a deck of spell cards, unique to that class. The players team up to defeat the evil monsters of the Abyss, achieve the Quest goal, and find the exit to the map (typically leading to the start of the next Quest).&#10;&#10;On each turn, a Hero may take an Action then move, or move then take an Action. An &quot;Action&quot; is one of nine possibilities: Attack, Cast a Spell, Search for Treasure, Search for Secret Doors, Search for Traps, Disarm a Trap, Use an Active Skill, Use a Special Action, Switch Items.&#10;&#10;Movement around the map each turn takes 1d6+4 squares. Attacking, defending, and some other actions are performed with pictographic Combat Dice.&#10;&#10;The Heroes lose the Quest if they fail to achieve the Quest objective, or if all Heroes are killed before they find the exit to the map.&#10;&#10;",
