    "Description": "The Pisces game is all about fishing, fish, and conservation. The goal is to obtain the maximum points by being the most successful at catching fish and receiving credit for implementing conservation measures to maintain a healthy population.  Each fish follows a uniquely structured life cycle that models their real-world dynamics and susceptibility to overfishing, including snapper, tuna, sardines, sharks, mahi mahi, and crabs. Players select which fishing zone and species will present the best fishing opportunities each round.  The availability of sea life to catch changes throughout the game, as the fish go through various life cycle stages and are harvested by the players. If they are abundant, they are easy to catch. But if they are overfished, it gets harder, just like in real life.  Strategize to protect your stock from overfishing while collecting the boats and gear to tip the odds of a big catch!&#10;&#10;-description from designers&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to reach all of your destinations whilst collecting as much cargo as you can along the way. There will be many challenges to overcome.&#10;&#10;To travel through the void unmarked by hardship is a fool&rsquo;s dream. The system is filled with pirates, mutants, endless bureaucracy, and &mdash;worst of all&mdash; other merchants.&#10;&#10;A keen mind can turn the tide. Just remember, even for the saltiest of captains, Lady Luck can be quite fickle.&#10;&#10;Merchants of Sol is a game for 2-6 players age 12+. Gameplay averages out to about 20-30 minutes per player. A key element of the game is its narration. As you draw cards to determine your fate, each destination and event has an exciting blend of story and facts about our solar system including the planets, dwarf planets, and moons that fill it.&#10;&#10;Unique design and simple mechanics involving subtle strategy ensure a wonderfully balanced play experience. Every play session will be different as there are multiple paths to victory. Amazing artwork graces every surface making it as fun a game to look at as it is to play.&#10;&#10;Fair winds and following seas!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a coaster and places it moth-side up in front of them, while one coast is placed light-side up equidistant from all players. The moth side of a coaster has two black lines intersecting the perimeter (180&ordm; apart) and a red line every 22.5&ordm; around the perimeter.&#10;&#10;On your turn, announce a number from 1 to 6, then roll the die. If you guess correctly, you advance your moth, possibly take a second turn, or even send a player back to start; if you guess incorrectly, you might still advance (although not as much) or another player might move instead of you.&#10;&#10;To move your moth, take the flying disc and place the edge of the 1, 2, 3 or 4 space (depending on what you rolled) adjacent to one of the black edges on the perimeter of your moth disc, then roll your moth disc until a red line on your disc hits the other black edge of the 1, 2, 3 or 4 space. The higher the number, the farther your moth will move &mdash; albeit in a curved manner instead of straight toward the light.&#10;&#10;No disc can ever be placed on top of another, so if a moth is blocking your way, then you must fly elsewhere! Whoever first touches their moth to the light disc wins!&#10;&#10;Nachtschw&auml;rmer includes three variants, one of which has you start the game with several obstacles in play, say pretzels or gummis. Any time you hit an obstacle, you must eat it, then return your moth to its starting point.&#10;&#10;",

Frontline makes each battle diverse and unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Use specific cards skills and abilities to gain an upper hand against your opponent, there is no one strategy to win the war!&#10;&#10;Stunning illustrations on each card emphasise the raw, gritty feel of being on the battlefield, and make every victory feel truly earned.&#10;&#10;The highs and lows of battle. The ability to have your back against a wall as your opponent smashes through your defences, only to have one of his commanders guards flee, potentially changing the course of the battle makes each game truly tense and memorable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If one player has been KO'd, the other player earns 3 points; otherwise, the player with the most life earns 1 point.  Prepare a new round, with renewed life totals, and play until one player has earned at least 7 points; the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fistful of Lead fans asked for a space fighter game and here it is - Fistful of Lead: Starfighters!&#10;&#10;As with previous Fistful of Lead rules each player only needs 5 or 6 miniature ships per player to start gaming.  &#10;You can play 1-on-1 games or larger skirmishes with up to 6 or 8 players.&#10;&#10;This book contains rules for building your flight and how to set up different scenarios.  &#10;A few genre options are provided to get you started as well as rules for fleet sized ships..  &#10;Most players of any age will pick up the game mechanics quickly, even those who have never played a wargame before.&#10;&#10;Starfighters! was not meant with any particular miniature line in mind.  You can use whatever miniature space ships you have.  There are many popular lines out there to choose from and some are very affordable on discount sites.&#10;&#10;This IS NOT a theoretical recreation of fighter on fighter space combat, but rather a Hollywood take on dogfighting in the dark depths of space.&#10;&#10;This IS a great way to spend an hour or two having fun with your friends, playing with spaceships and yelling &quot;PEW! PEW! PEW!&quot;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Motor Sport is a replay style game, where anyone can recreate a sports car race if they know the starting grid and finishing order.  The game is a pen and paper type of game, with no display offered or required.&#10;&#10;The game is structured to last six turns, and the game offers three layers of complexity.  Each turn consists of an action phase, followed by a consolidation phase.  A deck of cards drives the sequencing of when drivers act.  On every turn, each driver has a D6 rolled to check if they have some sort of driving incident (improvements and detrimental problems).  If an incident is triggered, it is immediately resolved.  Otherwise, drivers who have a normal turn are resolved in the consolidation phase.&#10;&#10;After six turns the race is completed, and the winning driver is noted.  Motorsport allows players to easily rerun entire series of races from Formula 1, Indy, Nascar and other racing series.  Real-world results (qualifying and final standings) inform the statistics that drive the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Players draw and play chits, the interaction between them outlines who can move and engage with their units. When all units in the game have moved and/or performed a combat action, or both Players consecutively PASS the turn ends. Combat is instantaneous.&#10;&#10;Engage &amp; Destroy combat situations are presented in near-historical context, which balance resources and capabilities between the players making the game contest of skill rather than a match between unbalanced order of battles, allowing the game to portray period type engagements in a skill contest format.&#10;&#10;There are three types of games in Engage &amp; Destroy:&#10;&#10;     Meeting Engagements - players must take and hold locations, gaining more points than their opponent before the game ends,&#10;     Assault - one player must push a defender back behind a series of defense lines before the game ends,&#10;     Firefight - In Arena, it&rsquo;s a pure shoot out, with the player who earns the most &ldquo;kill&rdquo; points winning by game&rsquo;s end. &#10;&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Time Scale: 2 minutes/turn&#10;Map Scale: 175 metres per hex&#10;Unit Scale: Single Vehicle or Team&#10;Players: 2&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Playing Time: 1 to 4 hours&#10;&#10;",

In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;",

This is a crisis like no other.&#10;&#10;Climate Crisis, the game, is a collaborative board game where you and your friends (maybe even your enemies) can sit down together and try and save not only the planet but humankind.&#10;&#10;General game play description:&#10;Players must work collaboratively to save the world from climate change. There is a tricky balance between moving to renewable energy, recycling, population, staying alive and keeping enough energy to keep going.&#10;&#10;The goal is to optimise world population, stay alive and achieve environmental sustainability!&#10;&#10;The players work together as they search for scientific discoveries that will solve our climate crisis. This needs to be done all the while the population and pollution across the planet grows and the level of Greenhouse Gases rises. Take too long and the planet dies from too much pollution or the Greenhouse Gases get to the point of no return.  As the greenhouse gases rise the impacts from climate change increase and become more common!&#10;&#10;Balance the needs for energy production from fossil fuels and environmentally sustainable sources. Keep the population with enough Food and Water. Players are faced with numerous challenges &ndash; you need energy to function but fossil fuels create pollution and damage the environment. Moving to clean energy costs time and money, and is not as efficient. Feeding the population with Dairy products can be effective but comes at the cost of energy and pollution.  All the while the climate crisis clock keeps ticking!&#10;&#10;Each player has special skills that they can use to work together to save the planet. A highly collaborative game where players need to coordinate their actions and devise plans and strategies to solve the crisis.&#10;&#10;Sustainable Qualities:&#10;This game is all about educating people about the trade offs around sustainability. The complex interaction between population, energy production and consumption, food production, water use, economic advancement. It also shows the impact of pollution and waste and the dramatic effects of climate change &hellip; whilst still giving people hope that if we collaborate and work together we can build a solution to escape the mess that we have made!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The civil war in Yemen has been going on since 2015; fought between the government, a rebellious faction, and their respective allies. Each group claims to be the legitimate government of Yemen. The fighting uses everything from World War 2 leftovers to modern ballistic missiles, with Saudi Arabian troops and US drone strikes helping the government and Iranian arms aiding the rebels.&#10;&#10;Aden is a 2-player (but very solitaire friendly) hypothetical campaign for control of this southern Yemen port city, a combined company- and platoon-level game where each battle takes place over the course of one or more days. Difficult terrain splits the east and west of the city, combatants often retreat to avoid taking losses before surging back, and making the most of your scattered leadership is the key to resupplying your people and sustaining an offensive. Units activate with a unique dice system, and combat is centered on an add-or-subtract dice method reminiscent of Greg's Armageddon War.&#10;&#10;The game remembers that Aden is a functioning city, with key points that will be strategic objectives in scenarios or have special combat effects. Destroy an enemy in sight of the international hotel where the media are staying? Extra victory points. Enemy is holed up near a major mosque? You cannot call artillery on them.&#10;&#10;Aden includes:&#10;- an 11 x 17 inch map of the city.&#10;- seventy, LARGE 1 inch counters for the government, rebels, allies and status markers, &#10;- a 32-page rulebook with a six scenario campaign for control of the city, each player playing both sides to see who does it best.&#10;&#10;",
