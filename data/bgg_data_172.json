    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;G&auml;msh Alpin is a fast card game for teams of two whose communication is on point. Thus, the game works only with 4 OR 6 players, not 5.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, each team of two players secretly agrees on a signal &mdash; a wink, a gesture, a word, whatever &mdash; they will use in the game. This signal should be clear enough for the partner, but not something that can be identified by other players.&#10;&#10;Now the actual game starts, with partners sitting opposite one another. All players simultaneously exchange cards in hand with cards on the table. As soon as any player has managed to collect four of a kind, that player tries to let their partner know by giving that team's secret signal. If the team partner identifies the wink, the nudge, the code word, whatever, that team can score points. However, a vigilant opponent might just be faster and counter in time by announcing that this particular team has sent the signal. The opponent does not have to tell the group the signal. Special cards spice up the whole procedure.&#10;&#10;G&auml;msh Alpin is a further development of a public domain game.&#10;&#10;",

On June 22 in Byelorussia, more than a million Soviet soldiers swept against the German Army Group Centre: the Allied counter-offensive was underway and would not stop until it reached Berlin.&#10;From Overlord to Berlin is a strategic wargame that simulates the end of the Second World War in Europe on all fronts: east, west and Italy. One player directs the Axis forces and must resist Allied pressure for as long as possible while the other directs the Soviets and the Western Allies and must wipe out Nazi Germany and its satellites before the end of the game. The simulation begins in June 1944 with the Normandy landings, the fall of Rome in Italy and Operation Bagration in the east. There was still hard fighting ahead including crossing the Rhine and pushing forward into the heart of the Reich, surrounding numerous armies in the Ruhr and reaching the Elbe.&#10;In the east, Hitler&rsquo;s counter-attacks in Hungary and in Poland accomplished nothing against the might of the Russian bear.&#10;At the beginning of January, Russian troops attacked along the Vistula and drove the Germans back to the Oder. Budapest fell in February, and Vienna was captured in April. Finally, the offensive on Berlin began in April and the Reich fell at the beginning of May 1945, putting an end to the Second World War in Europe.&#10;&#10;The cardboard pocket includes :&#10;216 die-cut counters (Units : fronts, armies and army corps)&#10;1 Zone map of Europe from France to USSR, 59 x 40 cm&#10;1 rulebook, 2 player aids&#10;&#10;&#10;French or English Rules and Charts.&#10;&#10;",

In an ideal world, you want to utilise symbols that are not your own role as when it comes to apportioning blame (Accusation), the numbers of your cards vs the other person you have accused of being to blame will be counted.  &#10; Accusation is achieved by pointing your finger very vehemently at the accused player.  Keeping a mental track of what&rsquo;s been played is therefore a really good strategy as looking through the pile is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The player with the most of their own emblem in the pile takes the entire blame pile.  However, you don&rsquo;t want those cards left in your hand at scoring either.  All the other players not to blame may &lsquo;bury&rsquo; a secret and discard one card of their &lsquo;own blame type&rsquo; out of their hand permanently.&#10;&#10;The game stops and is scored when the draw pile is exhausted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Some have called it the most crucial campaign of the Second World War.  It was not fought on the ground with tanks and artillery; it was the Battle of the Atlantic, pitting the German Wolfpacks versus the allied convoy system. Upon the result of the campaign hung the fate of Great Britain, and, by extension, the Allied cause in Europe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Atlantic Wolves&quot; is a solitaire wargame based on this important World  War II naval campaign. It covers the decisive part of the campaign,  August 1942 to May 1943. The player, assuming the role of Admiral Karl Doenitz, controls the German Kriegsmarine and tries to achieve success against the Allies, played by the game system. The game is a deluxe re-implementation of Gary Graber's classic wargame Battle of the Atlantic, now out of print.&#10;&#10;The map is a representation of the general locations where the Battle of the Atlantic was fought. There are seven named Areas on the board (e.g. Eastern Seaboard, Newfoundland, North Atlantic, Mid- Atlantic, Iceland, Bay of Biscay, and African Coast).&#10;&#10;Counters in the game represent German U-Boats, &ldquo;Milch Cow&rdquo; (Milk Cow) submarine tankers, ACE, Condor bombers, Surface Raiders, and Admirals Doenitz and Raeder. Also represented are Allied Escorts, Air Patrols, Convoys, and various markers. Each U-Boat counter (in the rules, simply termed &ldquo;U-Boat&rdquo;) represents 4&ndash;6 operational U-Boats.&#10;&#10;Victory is won by the German player sinking Allied ships and avoiding the establishment of a secure &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain. The more tonnage sunk, the better for the Germans.&#10;&#10;The German wins the game by fulfilling three requirements:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Preserving the fleet. If, during any turn, one-half or more of the U-Boat counters that started the turn are sunk, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win. Example: During the first turn, if three or more U-Boats are sunk the Allies win.&#10;    Preventing a &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain from being established. If there are four Convoy markers on the board at the end of any turn, a permanent lifeline to Britain has been established, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win.&#10;    Sinking Allied ships. The German must sink 600,000 tons for three consecutive turns AND average: 400,000+ tons for the entire game if there are no Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game; OR 450,000+ tons if there is one Convoy marker on the board at the end of the game; OR 500,000+ tons if there are two or more Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Solitaire Game of the Strategic Bombing Campaign against Japan: 1944-1945&#10;&#10;On April 18, 1942, Jimmy Doolittle led a squadron of carrier-based B25 Mitchells on a daring surprise raid on Tokyo. The raid, conducted as revenge for the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor four months earlier, caused little damage but was a harbinger of the destruction from the air that was destined to befall the islands of Japan&hellip;&#10;&#10;By 1944, US forces had seized island bases in the Marianas close enough to Japan to employ the new long range B29 Superfortresses in a high-stakes strategic bombing campaign against Japanese industries and cities. So began the short (late 1944 until August 1945) but incredibly destructive life of the United States Army Air Force&rsquo;s (USAAF&rsquo;s) 20th Air Force.&#10;&#10;Your objective as you take command of the 20th Air Force in September 1944 is nothing short of reducing Japan&rsquo;s cities, large and small, to smoldering rubble! To do it you&rsquo;ve got the powerful and sophisticated B29, in ever increasing numbers and with flight crews improving in combat and navigation skills, and a research effort you direct to develop more and more sophisticated weapons. While initially you must focus on clearing the sky of Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) fighters and blasting Japanese war industries with high explosive bombs, eventually you will develop incendiary bombs which rapidly reduce Japan&rsquo;s combustible wooden and paper cities to ashes, and their dispersed war industries to ruins. Simultaneously, demolish her ports and kamikaze bases, and mine her waters. In the meantime, research marches on, perhaps you will obtain the ultimate weapon, the Atomic Bomb? Hopefully you will, because you are in a race against time &ndash; if Japan can hold out long enough the US will have to launch &ldquo;Operation Olympic&rdquo;, the costly planned invasion of Japan, and your strategic bombing campaign will have failed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The extremely addicting and fun thing about games that push your luck is that one moment where you tell yourself this is the last card you will be taking... then you survive and you change your mind that you will be drawing just one more... and you still survive! And you promise that this next one would really be your last - and you survive yet again! Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.&#10;&#10;In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him. And the more you push your luck, the more your foes are forced to push theirs if they are to beat you! The pressure is ON!&#10;&#10;In this game when a female warrior is Gathered (drawn from the deck), a player has the option of Forming her into the current fighting group for that round and her Battle Points will be counted for the player's total score in that same round, or the player can choose to Keep her in his hand instead. If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately. Only after the current round ends will all such Kept cards go to their players' hands, where they can now be played at critical moments to turn the tide against other players. An interesting thing to note is that Gathering is secretive. Other players will never know the actual total score of a player in a round (unless the Dark One wipes them out), but they will know the amount of cards drawn by the player so they can make a rough guess.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're a master villain of a sinister secret society with a plan to take over the world! Send your minions around the globe to execute nefarious plots such as marketing evil soda, hijacking a nuclear submarine, building a time portal, or ruining a beloved movie property. Each turn you&rsquo;ll send your minions to exotic locales such as London, Cairo, Machu Picchu, or Antarctica to gather the resources you need to carry out your plans: Finance, Occult, Science, and of course Unobtainium. Watch out for your opponents&mdash;they&rsquo;re trying to pull off their own schemes. Each sinister plot you execute is but one small part of your secret Ultimate Scheme!&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of five steps: draw new schemes, move minions (perform twice), collect resources (perform twice), execute schemes, and the end step. Players perform each step in play order, so if Player 1 collects the resources in Cairo, Player 2 can't get Cairo's resources that turn. During the course of the turn, players move their minions to sites and collect the resources each site provides. Then they pay resources to execute schemes held in their hand, and earn progress points toward victory by doing so. To execute a scheme, a player must meet the scheme resource cost, and have a minion located in the scheme's site (for example, to subvert the U.N., a player must have a minion in New York). Action cards give players special advantages in moving minions, collecting resources, gaining new minions, or destroying enemy minions. The &quot;first player&quot; rotates each turn.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a secret &quot;Ultimate Scheme&quot; card such as Ruin Christmas or Destroy Rock 'n' Roll. The Ultimate Scheme card dictates how many progress points the player needs to win, and what *kind* of schemes he or she needs to pull off. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the first player to complete his or her Ultimate Scheme does so. If multiple players finish their Ultimate Scheme on the same turn, various tiebreakers determine victory -- but the easiest way to win is to be the first villain to pull off your grand plan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dark Blood plunges players into the abyss of darkness, where they embody powerful asymmetrical cults striving for dominance over a hapless village. Whether as the cult of the Demonologist, Warlock, Necromancer, or Doomsayer, players must adeptly recruit villagers or harvest their blood to empower their sinister rituals. &#10;Through a fusion of Area Majority, Worker placement and Resource gathering, they vie with one another, navigating the perilous path of corruption, enhancing their Rituals, and staining various parts of the village to seize territories and augment their Taint (Victory Points). With each round introducing fresh challenges and opportunities, players must judiciously balance their strategies to outmaneuver their adversaries and emerge as the foremost cult as the fifth round draws to a close.&#10;Game Overview: &#10;Each player delves into their Ritual Book, serving as their player board, to oversee their Cultists, amass Resources, and upgrade their Rituals. The main board grants access to the five pivotal locations where the four cults will contend for control, eventually corrupting them. &#10;At the outset of each round, during the Upkeep phase, these locations undergo random variations in the number of available Peasants, the resources they yield and more... &#10;In the Placement phase, all cults place their workers (Cultist Miniatures) in these locations, determining the actions their cult can execute in each one. The majority in each location dictates not only special actions but also the initiative in which these actions will unfold. &#10;Subsequently, in the Resolve phase, each cult assigns their cultists to diverse actions, from resource gathering for Ritual upgrades to hanging peasants at the Tree of the Damned to bolster their Dark Favor. Crucially, each cultist can be designated to various Rituals in the player Ritual Book, with distinct effects such as Proselytizing other Peasants to expand your cult or Sacrificing peasants to procure their blood. Several additional Rituals are available, but the paramount one is Corrupting the land, which, when enhanced, may summon your Cult's Monstrosity! &#10;In the final phase, players Defile the land and bid their accumulated Blood to dominate the most corrupted location. The number of Sigils placed by each player significantly influences the ultimate outcome. As the fifth round concludes, the locations you corrupted, along with other factors such as your cult's size, upgraded Rituals, secret quest, concealed Taint and more, will determine the prevailing cult.&#10;&#10;",

Flip and Write your way to the best combinations of fields, gardens, mills, farms and manors. But be careful! After each time you 'write', you hand your polder to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the 17th century in the Netherlands, a time when the country was experiencing a massive economic boost and merchants were looking for ways to increase food production. As a result, they came up with massive projects to enclose lakes with dikes and pump out the water with windmills. The resulting low-lying tract of land is known as a polder. One polder was qualified as an UNESCO World Heritage site: the Beemster Polder. The Beemster has a solid dike of 42 kilometers long, was pumped dry with 43 windmills, has its lowest point at 7 meters (23 feet) below sea level, and has a surface of 72 square kilometers (nearly 28 square miles). The land created in this polder, and the three polders created in the following decades, was incredibly fertile and therefore mostly used for farms. But the rich and powerful of the nearby city of Amsterdam also created &lsquo;buitenplaatsen&rsquo; (country houses or manors). In the game Polders, the four big polders created in the first half of the 17th century are your playing field.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Games can be simulated or even entire seasons.&#10;&#10;The game contains 42 cards that represent various Major League Baseball players during the peak of their careers. Players must use their managing abilities to gain an edge in a game that uses cards to represent both pitcher and batter, charts to represent fielders, and dice to represent the bat and pitches.&#10;&#10;Baseball express is a slimmed down version of Strat-o-matic Baseball (both in play and size).

The player takes the part of American infantry and armor pushing inland to take objectives, using a dice-roll action system that gives you a guaranteed number of actions each round, but not always of the exact type you need. A card-driven action system manages the German defenders, including veteran units, machine-gun nests, and even tanks. Victory is based on objectives and American Morale score, and game complications include lack of supplies and surprise German reinforcements, so even on the edge of victory, it pays to be cautious. But with a time limit on every scenario, not too cautious. With five scenarios of increasing difficulty and complexity, Scream, Aim, Fire! is a challenge you will have to rise to and a challenger that is always ready for you.&#10;&#10;Each Game Includes:&#10;2 x 17&quot; x 22&quot; Game Maps&#10;140x 1&rdquo; Counters&#10;Full Color Rules&#10;1x Player Aid Sheet&#10;36 x Players Cards&#10;5 Scenarios&#10;&#10;- from Tiny Battles Publishing website&#10;&#10;",

Fun-Size Edition keeps this same idea, but challenges players to complete puzzles in a new way.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has a set of eight polyomino pieces, each a different color. Players decide before the game begins whether they'll use the A- or B-side of the puzzle cards, with the A-side puzzles requiring exactly three pieces to complete and the B-side puzzles requiring exactly four. Which pieces? Well, you have to figure that out for yourself, with each puzzle having at least three different solutions.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a new puzzle card and must race to fill in the blank spaces as quickly as possible. As soon as one player has done this, they start counting down to zero and everyone else must complete their puzzle before time is up. Whoever completes their puzzle card in time keeps the card for a point; the player who started the countdown both keeps their card and earns a gemstone worth one point. After eight rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;To even the playing field between adults and children in Ubongo! Fun-Size Edition, the adults can play without the yellow piece &mdash; a straight line that covers three spaces. All of the puzzles can be solved without this piece, but doing so will be more difficult than normal...&#10;&#10;",

This fierce commercial competitor, too tolerant as a state, opposes France&rsquo;s expansion toward the Spanish Netherlands. This war for glory pitches against each other living legends of the Thirty Years War like Turenne, Cond&eacute; et Montecuccoli. As a result of this conflict, the King of France earns the nickname Louis the Great.&#10;&#10;The War of the Reunions (1683-1684) - Spain does not accept the annexation by France of enclaves and surrounding areas in the Spanish Netherlands, stating their boundaries were poorly defined by the international treaties ending the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War. Vauban recommends limiting the territorial enclaves, leaning against the mountainous area and securing the enclaves by constructing strongholds; it&rsquo;s a matter of turf.&#10;&#10;The War of the League of Augsburg (1688-1697) - The Habsburg&rsquo;s victory against the Ottomans diverted the Empire&rsquo;s attention on the French territorial gains following the War of the Reunions. In 1687, Louis XIV wanted to transform the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent accord and send an ultimatum to the emperor who refused. The German princes and the great European powers form an alliance to counter France&rsquo;s politics of expansionism and religious persecution. France finds itself diplomatically isolated.&#10;&#10;The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1713) - King Charles II of Spain dies with no descendants. The two principal reigning families of Europe, the Bourbons (France) and the Habsburgs (Austria), are both related to Charles II and claim the throne. The principal stake is the domination of Europe by seizing the enormous heritage of the Spanish Habsburgs. France is confronted with its fiercest military enemies: Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy.&#10;&#10;Maximise your resource points to recruit armies, build strongholds, lead sieges and battles and win glory points.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to vanquish Montecuccoli, Eugene of Savoy or Marlborough with Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Villars and impose the Sun King&rsquo;s will?&#10;&#10;The game includes :&#10;&bull; One 59 x 41 cm map&#10;&bull; 270 double-sided, pre-cut counters and markers&#10;&bull; A book of rules and scenarios&#10;&bull; Two colour player aids&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.&#10;Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.&#10;The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;&#10;The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story.

Randomise one player to receive the stating player card. You are now ready to start a game of The Necrohamster!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Each game turn (except the first turn) starts with the Draw Phase. During this phase every player draws 2 cards from a communal deck of cards to replenish their hand. Next is the Summon Phase. During this phase each player simultaneously selects one card from their hand to summon. Once every player has chosen, all cards are revealed. To pay for the cost of the card each player must discard cards from their hand equal to that card's summon cost. The summoned card then goes into that player's personal summon area. Once all players have summoned their creature cards, starting from the first player, each player resolves any card effects going in a clockwise player order.Once card effects have been resolved, players begin the next round, starting again with the Draw Phase.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;The game ends on the round in which any player has summoned their 8th creature card. Complete this round then add up all the points each player has accumulated. The player with the highest total is declared as the greatest Necrohamster in all the lands!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Kadon website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Background ::   In ancient Greek mythology there was a sea god named Proteus. His most notable characteristic was that he could change his shape at will, from a man to a fish, a whale, a bird, or anything else. This most useful skill against opponents gave rise to the expression of being in a &quot;Protean struggle.&quot; The Proteus game set is so named because the game can change its form &mdash; not its physical form, but rather the game rules themselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Michael's concept was to create a meta-game that allowed for rule-changing but had a fixed slate of  rules, unlike the fluid game of Nomic. The rules on 9 wood tiles determine how the players may move their pieces, trade the tiles, or even win. A rule is activated when a player's piece enters a correspondingly shaped tile, and the previously active rule is turned off. A placement phase precedes the movement stage. Experienced players can sometimes win even before movement begins. The strategy is intense because long-range moves are not calculable.

    "Description": "Lord Waldemar is celebrating his 80th birthday in his stately home and has invited numerous prominent guests. Baroness of Walloon-Brabant is expected with her entourage, as well as Sir Adam Stoneworth and Count Bobby of Wexford. Even the famous opera singer Barbette Brunette and former boxing champion Arnold Wendestein have announced their attendance. We are looking forward to this special occasion, which will of course take place at 5 p.m. sharp - at tea time.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, there has also been an increase in burglaries and thefts in this noble area lately. For this reason, Lord Waldemar has hired a renowned detective who, of course, appears with his assistant. During the celebrations they should keep an eye on the property and the luxurious belongings of his guests. If that succeeds, Lord Waldemar will acknowledge it very much.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Roll the dice up to 3 times. Choose dice with the same number and flip (or remove) a tile from your board that matches the result of the dice.&#10;Try to find valuable rooms or thieves and arrange your detectives correctly, so you can score them.&#10;&#10;End: If a player places his 5th detective-tile correctly, everyone count all their points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Category Game is a party game about finding words: a 5x5 plastic grid with 5 &quot;word category&quot; cards (placed over the columns) and 5 letter tiles (placed at the left border of the rows)is filled with 25 marbles (whose value is 1, 2 or 3 points). Any marble is placed in a cell in the grid, whose position is corresponding to a category column and a letter row: you can take the marble finding a word in the category of the column, beginning with the letter in the row.&#10;&#10;For instance, if the category is &quot;Games&quot;, and letter is &quot;C&quot;, you can also say... &quot;Category Game&quot;!  Players are arranged in teams, then the starting player has 15 seconds to try to get as many marbles as he can, saying words matching the category on the column, and beginning with the letter on the row. The uncomplete grid is then passed to the next player, who has 15 seconds to take some of the remaining marbles, and so on. When the grid is empty, or when everyone passes (i.e. when you only have on the grid marbles corresponding to a difficult or impossible letter/category match), points are scored. Category cards and letter tiles are then changed, marbles are randomly put again on the grid, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Category Game is a very nice reworking of a traditional pencil and paper game: I appreciate the fast pace induced by the 15 seconds sandtimer, the partnership play, the good assortment of category cards, and... the arguing! In effect, some of the cards are an undoubtful source for arguments (or - when the going get tough - for &quot;marbles wars&quot;... be careful!): &quot;Into the sea&quot;, for instance... What if someone says &quot;Cars&quot; or &quot;Chairs&quot;? Shouldn't cars or chairs get into the sea?&#10;&#10;",

After that, the player must set a new spot on just-drawn curve. To every spot can be attached maximum 3 curves.&#10;     The player who on his/her turn doesn't have a valid move, loses the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the image shown, the two black spots each have only two curves coming out of them, but nonetheless cannot be used because no curve can be drawn between them without crossing another already-drawn curve. Thus this game is over. The two black spots are called &quot;survivors&quot;, and the number of survivors is what can effectively be controlled in the game.&#10;&#10;Sprouts is one of many combinatorial games analyzed in Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays as well as other math books on the subject of combinatorial games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game takes inspiration from the great air races of circa 1908 to 1913 which took place in the pioneering era of air travel. These air races galvanized interest across the world and encouraged by generous prizes by newspapers and other sponsors attracted international entries. Air travel was risky and most unreliable. Often only a small number of the entrants would make it to the finish line. Will one of your pilots manage to face up to the challenge?  But watch out: In this era of gentlemanly behavior and stiff upper lips, there are a few cads and bounders who will cheat to win.&#10;&#10;In Magnificent Flying Machines, the player who ends the game with the most victory points wins. These can be earned in various ways including being the first to land successfully on a certain terrain tile, landing on the middle airfield, transporting cargo or passengers, or performing trick maneuvers. Simply being the first to cross the finishing line is unlikely to be enough on its own to secure a victory. The winner will be the player who picks a strategy that best matches the abilities of the pilot and features of the flying machine they are using.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. A round begins with the first player taking a turn. Each player takes their turn in order clockwise around the table. During a turn a player has two action phases available. There are three types of action phase to choose from. These are the takeoff phase (which may also include refueling, repairing and scavenging spare parts), the flying phase (which may also include gaining altitude and performing trick maneuvers), and the landing phase (which may also include refueling). In addition, whenever a flying machine lands on a terrain tile any passengers that wish to will disembark, and any cargo intended for that terrain type is unloaded. It may also take on available equipment, cargo and passengers if space is available to do so.&#10;&#10;Players progress in the game by passing a series of takeoff, flying and landing tests. To determine the difficulty of a particular test, first look at the number of symbols for that test shown on the terrain tile that the flying machine is on. Simply add the number of symbols shown on the terrain tile to the number of symbols on the relevant weather tile. If a player needs to take a test, first check to see the total number of relevant symbols shown on the flying machine dashboard. This is the number of dice that may be rolled when attempting to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test. If the player does not roll enough symbols they may then choose to make use of special equipment, use spare parts, or play trick and boost cards to obtain additional symbols in order to pass the test. If a player is unable to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test then a failure occurs. If the dice rolled include a catastrophic failure symbol, then a catastrophic failure occurs. The effects of such a failure vary depending on the test being taken.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monsters and madmen are everywhere. Glory awaits the stalwart heroes who would stand against the forces of evil.&#10; You&rsquo;re not one of those heroes.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;re the people behind the heroes - the shopkeepers and the smithies and the potion brewers who outfit adventurers with the gear necessary to undertake their quests.&#10;&#10;In Hero&rsquo;s Crossing, players manage individual towns that produce and sell resources heroes need on their journeys. Your task is to juggle supply and demand to best outfit the heroes with what they&rsquo;ll need. Do your job wrong and a brave knight may end up fighting a dragon with nothing but twigs and shoelaces. Do your job right, and you may help save the world.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a color-coded dice drafting system, where players pick dice one by one to perform actions such as generating new resource cubes, moving resources around town, bidding on new buildings, or selling resources to heroes. Depending on the action, the color and number on the die matter in different ways - use a red weapon die, and you can generate weapon resources in your town, whereas a blue magic die may allow you to move magic resources from your production centers to your shops. Higher numbers on the dice make your actions more powerful, but they also make you a target: players can steal dice from each other or send spies into the towns of players who have an edge.&#10;&#10;Each hero has different needs. Some may want several weapons, whereas others may want a mix of magic and potion resources. If you have the corresponding resources in your town, you can sell those to the hero, where every sale awards victory points. The more you sell, the more victory points you gain, and the more likely it is you'll win!&#10;&#10;",

More importantly, you want to make sure that no one votes for either of your two words!&#10;&#10;To set up a round, lay out as many word cards as twice the number of players plus one, so eleven cards in a five-player game. Each word is assigned a number (e.g., 1-11), then each player secretly receives two number cards at random, with the final lone number being placed face down on the table. If you receive, say, 3 and 8, then you need to think of a one-word clue that links word #3 and word #8. Write your clue on your board.&#10;&#10;Everyone reveals their words at the same time, then everyone tries to figure out which pair of words corresponds to each clue, with the long-term goal of figuring out which of the words was not assigned to any player. Once everyone has written their answer, reveal each player's pair of words as well as the lone number. If you guessed the answer correctly, score 20 points. For each player who guessed one of your words, lose 10 points.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Historically, it was a stunning victory but the blitzkrieg strategy was untested and the potential was present for Poland to hold on long enough for other countries to intervene against Germany.&#10;&#10;In the game, the German side needs to force the Polish surrender quickly. This occurs by capturing the Polish capital, Warsaw, and other Polish rallying points. The Polish side needs to delay the German advance long enough to garner international intervention. This occurs when the Polish win three delaying actions.&#10;&#10;Lightning Game Series&#10;&#10;",

No stash may have the same color as another stash. &#10;&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a piece from your stash in a vacant space on the board. If there are any pieces in adjacent spaces (including diagonals), move them one space directly away from the piece you placed. You&rsquo;ve just slammed a major impact onto the board, and it scattered nearby pieces. If a moving piece attempts to enter an occupied space, allow it to, and push the occupying piece into the space beyond; this may cause entire rows of pieces to move.&#10;&#10;If a piece attempts to leave the board, place it in your treasure chest &mdash; unless it&rsquo;s your color. If it&rsquo;s your color, put it in your stash.&#10;&#10;Once all pieces have been relocated, your turn ends. Play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all stashes are empty or when all players agree to stop playing.&#10;&#10;Winning: Each piece has a point value equal to the number of pips on it (1, 2, or 3).

    "Description": "In Totem, players reveal each others' strengths and qualities by forming totems, combinations of an animal card (representing a strength) and a quality card. Every player contributes one animal card and one quality card to each other player's totem.&#10;&#10;Players can earn more points if the cards that they played were considered to be especially relevant and accurate, either by the active player or by the other players. The favourite animal and quality cards for that round stay in front of the active player and become their totem. The game ends when everyone has a totem.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game wins, but everyone else gains something as well: a greater awareness of how others perceive and appreciate them!&#10;&#10;",

Their finest scientists may even be drafted to serve as simple soldiers at the front!&#10;&#10;Fast and quick playing, Die Atombombe shows just how easy it was to be bewitched by the idea, and how hard it really was to mount an effective nuclear program under the increasing rain of Allied bombs and the Soviet menace looming to the east.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cards include &ldquo;asks&rdquo; - which require players to create a product based on the requirement - and &ldquo;must haves&rdquo;, which augment their invention with necessary features. Walrus Surprise cards add in an extra gameplay twist during pitches - for example, by requiring the players to sing a jingle for their product or explain why the previous player&rsquo;s invention was a bad idea.&#10;&#10;Players judge the best pitch and the player with the most pitches approved wins.&#10;&#10;",
