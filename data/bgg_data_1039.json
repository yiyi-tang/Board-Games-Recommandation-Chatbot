    "Description": "Kingdom 18 is an 18 card hand management game with hints of deck building. Players take the role of nobles attempting to build kingdoms either through diplomacy or force. The goal is to grab the highest point value lands and create the most powerful kingdom or take less valuable lands that offer you powerful actions later.&#10;&#10;Players start with a hand of 4 cards, each with 2 possible actions. These can be different values of military might or political savvy, or they can be an assassin or a shield that can steal the values of other cards their opponents play.&#10;&#10;Each turn players place 1 card facedown on each land. These cards are revealed and another turn commences. After the second turn the players with the most strength on the land wins it. Bonus points are awarded for matching the types of cards the land prefers.&#10;&#10;Collected lands count towards the end of the game scoring but also have their own in-game action. They are shuffled into the player's starting 4 cards and 4 new cards are drawn. The lands can have strong or weak abilities but only have one option.&#10;&#10;Once all lands have been claimed the final scores are tallied and the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players can add 1, or 2, or all of them to their game:&#10;&#10;Atlantikwall: This module lets one player play the German side on any existing Battle Map. The German player can transform a 2-player game into a head-to-head confrontation, or be added to any group of players (even solo). Includes a full set of unique German Specialists, German Items and Decorations, a set of Red, White &amp; Black dice, a player aid, a Resource card, and some additional Allied Specialists and Items.&#10;&#10;Think of the German player as the Battle Map itself. It is up to him or her to &ldquo;activate&rdquo; some of the features of the Map, and to make life difficult for the Allies. He plays like all the other players, rolling dice to gather resources, and spending those resources to recruit Specialists and find Items. The main difference is that the German does not move: instead, he uses his Courage to draw cards from the &quot;Decorations&quot; deck, which give him special one-time abilities.&#10;&#10;Battle Conditions: This deck of 50 cards reflects the unpredictability of battlefield conditions, whether it&rsquo;s from nature itself or the hazards of combat. Drawn at the start of each turn, they affect all players and supersede Sector attributes, offering a variety of effects like friendly fire or smoke cover. Some are good, some are bad, and some offer opportunities to be seized at the right moment. Beware of plane crashes, supply trucks catching fire or loss of morale!&#10;&#10;Badges: A reprint of the 1st edition hard-to-find mini-expansion, consisting of 10 cards. Badges can be drawn at random by a Unit that obtains a &quot;Battle Cry&quot; RWB.

    "Description": "Fugo is a territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent stones of its color.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to it.&#10;&#10;A smothered group is a group without liberties.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. At the start of your turn, you will face one of these situations:&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are no smothered friendly groups. In this case, you must place a stone of your color on an empty point. Your placement must not increase the number of smothered friendly groups unless it also increases the number of smothered enemy groups.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are one or more smothered friendly groups. In this case, you must move one stone from one of those groups to an empty point such that, after the move, the group that now includes the moved stone has at least one liberty. You may only move a stone from a point where it is orthogonally adjacent to one or more enemy stones.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available on your turn, you lose. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

This game is not a deck builder, so both players will be playing from a pre-set deck. Each player gets a hand of seven cards (with at least one &quot;pusher&quot; card in their hand) before the game starts. You must flip cards to use them, only using specific cards for your turn.&#10;&#10;There are a few different card types; Pushers, Henchmen, and Actions. Pushers sell the drugs and can be used once per turn. Once you flip the card over in order to use them you gain money that can only be spent during that turn. Once the turn is over, the money disappears. Pushers cannot attack, defend, or take damage and only one can be used per turn.&#10;&#10;Henchman have different costs, abilities, and attributes. They are used to gain power in the town and can be attacked. Henchman also cost a fair amount of money each, so you will need to be able to pay them to use them in your turn. The first turn you draw a henchman, you have to have them flipped, so they cannot be played right away.&#10;&#10;Action cards are not flipped but instead discarded. There are only two of each action card in the deck, so you need to play them wisely. Each action is immediate and costs resources to play. These can be used to harm player&rsquo;s henchmen or the player themselves.&#10;&#10;Each player has 10 health points (the player themselves who holds the cards) so once they have been harmed enough to reach zero health points, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Pusher Kings has some really awesome artwork drawn on the cards! This card game does not have deck building aspects, so it is an easy game to pick up and play with your friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You are a Victorian industrialist who is looking to build a transportation network. You can do this by placing roads, rivers, or railways to connect towns to other places, as well as block off the routes of your opponents.&#10;&#10;First, you must choose which mode of transportation each player should use. One should use roads, one rivers, the other should use trains. Then, you must shuffle the cards and hand them out to various players. Each player should get a town card, as well as two other cards dealt to them.&#10;&#10;Players must place tiles so that the modes of transportation connect to the tiles already placed on the table. These tiles will need to match up for every mode of transportation to be placed, then the player will be able to draw another tile from the deck, so they always have three cards. Players can also skip a turn by discarding all of their tiles to draw a new hand.&#10;&#10;After all of the tiles are placed, players must count up how many connections they have between towns. There are different points depending on how well the transport links are between different places. This can be seen in more detail in the rules of the game.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;This print-and-play game has an unusual distribution method - players download a Windows executable program which generates random tiles for printing.  Once printed, the tiles are used for traditional tabletop play.

There are four female character cards dealt face up on the table, and the players are girl-chasers, competing to win the 'best' one. But which woman is best is only determined at the finish.&#10;&#10;During the game, players play hand cards against their chosen targets. These attribute cards have positive values for virtues, and negative values for bad behaviour. Some cards are played face-up, some face-down, so there is a strong element of bluffing in the game. Some attribute cards alter the rules as they are played.&#10;&#10;The game is very social and encourages table talk about the good or bad attributes. For example, during game play, players will talk up the virtues of one girl, and talk down the vices of another. &quot;She is Born Rich! That's 6 points! I'm after her.&quot; &quot;But she's also a Money-Waster. -8 points. Are you sure you want her? hehehe.&quot;&#10;&quot;You know what? This girl is so Gentle and Kind and worth 8 points!&quot; &quot;Poor you. You might have not known, but actually, she is a B*tch. -6 points!&quot; &quot;Oh no, she's a B*tch and also likes Kinky Sex? Oh my oh my...&quot;&#10;&#10;Players also put secret tokens on the female cards, to show their likes or dislikes. After the cards have been played, the players must 'Express Love' by simultaneously pointing at the woman they chose. If only player chooses one woman, they get her. If more than player points at one woman, the player with the highest token wins her.&#10;&#10;Then all the attribute cards are flipped and the value of the different women is calculated. The player who picked the best woman, wins!&#10;&#10;There are two Versions of the game, this original edition is themed on men trying to get the best girlfriend. There is another edition with the genders swapped, and the women are trying to get the best boyfriend - &#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#226;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#150; (Get&#226;&#152;&#133;Smart Love). Whilst the games are very similar, there are differences in the special cards which affect the gameplay. With both editions, you can combine and play an 8 player game.&#10;&#10;The game name has a couple of twists. The English name can be abbreviated to Ge&#226;&#152;&#133;S Love, which for Japanese readers equates to 'guess love', trying to guess which girl to choose. But the name &#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#150; in Japanese, has the word &#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#185; in it, which is used in many vulgar or even obscene words in Japanese. So the publisher is deliberately signalling to buyers that the game is for adults but still sociable, since the girl-chasers will be nice to some girls, and not so nice to others. This version has gone through ten reprints in Japan and always draws a crowd at game shows, with its risque design (by Japanese standards).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#233;&#154;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#229;&#177;&#158;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#231;&#167;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#239;&#188;&#136;Guess Love&#239;&#188;&#137;&#10;&#10;Get&#226;&#152;&#133;Smart Love&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#183;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#166;1&#229;&#144;&#141;&#239;&#189;&#158;8&#229;&#144;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Every turn the player draws a card. As soon as he can form one of the two words the player has to move his token accordingly. &quot;Ruck&quot; means forward and &quot;Zuck&quot; means backward. The number of spaces is equal to the number of cards used to form the word (2-4). If a player moves his token onto a green space, he may move forward to the next green space.

Each scientist uses these materials to make their twisted schematics a reality. With the help of their faithful lab assistants and the occasional pack of ghouls at their summons, the madness is contagious. The Angry Villagers have their own set of 6 custom dice to determine their actions for the night. Will they storm the lab with a Pitchfork or Fire? Will they decide to cut off the Electricity instead? Maybe some will sleep through the night or decide to go Grave Robbing instead to use for their own creations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are four male character cards dealt face up on the table, and the players are boy-chasers, competing to win the 'best' one. But which man is best is only determined at the finish.&#10;&#10;During the game, players play hand cards against their chosen targets.

Some attribute cards alter the rules as they are played.&#10;&#10;The game is very social and encourages table talk about the good or bad attributes.&#10;&#10;Players also put secret tokens on the male cards, to show their likes or dislikes. After the cards have been played, the players must 'Express Love' by simultaneously pointing at the man they chose. If only player chooses one man, they get him.

Y'know, those &quot;Welcom' to the town of so-and-so&quot; or &quot;A potion? That's some golds&quot; talking NPC folks.&#10;&#10;Since there is a dungeon nearby this town, you see many adventurers stepping by this town, every day. One day, one villager said &quot;I bet that Warrior will  survive and get back.&quot;, followed by another saying &quot;I don't think so, but I'd bet that Sorcerer will.&quot; In a small village with little amusements, this gambling quickly became the most popular game in town.&#10;&#10;You are one of the villagers, betting on adventurers, which of them would come back alive.

This could be the canopic jar, the embalming material, the amulet, or even a death wish. This information is depicted on the cards and these are what you collect over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;However, the main dynamic of the game are the dice. These are all bespoke dice that slow up an opponent or speed you up in your race to collect the cards that you need. They have low, medium or high numbers on them and this determines the range of choice that you have to select cards on your turn. Once found, you can then collect the reward for your found Mummy. The player with the most reward money, wins!&#10;&#10;This family-friendly game plays at a number of levels, from simple enjoyable gameplay to more complex strategies to win! Over time, players develop a better understanding about how to find their mummies in the quickest time.&#10;&#10;The artwork is very detailed and allows for children to really explore the area of Egyptian mummification. They are actively learning about a period of history, without actually realising the information is going in! This is the power of this little card game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It was originally designed to fit inside a standard Alto Mint Tin.&#10;&#10;Using two standard ten-sided dice (2d10), this cracking little game helps to recreate all the &#239;&#172;&#130;ow and jargon of a real football match, with substitutions, injuries, free kicks, corners, penalties, last-ditch saves, formation changes, players getting sent o&#239;&#172;&#128; and own goals too!&#10;&#10;Players compare team strengths in three outfield areas (Defence, Midfield, and Attack) to determine a basic modifier to the Target/Progress Roll and then roll the dice to try and move the ball between their outfield areas in an e&#239;&#172;&#128;ort to score goals.&#10;&#10;Included are playable Bonus Action Cards for each team, Event Cards that are drawn every time a Progress Roll fails (allowing formation changes, introducing injuries, providing second chances, adding injury time and tactical changes, etc), and an Xtreme Event deck that allows for those extra special moments when things go amazingly good, or disastrously bad!&#10;&#10;If you download and play this game, please do leave any comments/feedback about your experiences &mdash; several players have asked if I'm planning a larger, full-card version, with more options and events, varied time segments and tighter controls, and this is certainly something I might be taking a look at over the next few months... Others have asked if I'm planning any expansions with real football player and team names, and to be honest I'd encourage anyone who wants to do this to freely supply replacement team/player ratings if they prefer. Better yet, upload and share them here!&#10;&#10;Thanks in advance for taking the time to download and try it!&#10;&#10;If you get to play it, please do rate it and add a comment -- all feedback is appreciated.&#10;&#10;",

Do you push-your-luck and hold out for 'the whole caboodle', or cut your losses and deliver a sub-standard product...?  It's your call, but when the last Wine Collector has left the building, it's game over!&#10;&#10;Each round, players take it in turns to either draw a card from one of three decks (either a new one from the top, or the last previously discarded tile) or can choose to satisfy a Wine Collector's demands and 'claim' the relevant Income from that Collector. Collectors will pay well if all their demands are satisfied, or not-so-much if you can only meet some of their expectations...&#10;&#10;There are three tile decks:&#10;&#10;Grapes are double-sided tiles with a particular grape or wine variety on each side. These are placed in front of players when they're drawn, but each player may only have a maximum of four  grapes/varieties in front of them at any one time, but may choose to draw additional Grape tiles and discard down if necessary to ensure they do not exceed this limit. Grape cards will need to be given up for each Wine Collector claimed.&#10;&#10;Flavours are tiles that have two representative flavours on them, and they can be utilised one way or the other by rotating the tile through 180 degrees. These are kept in a player's hand until used to claim a Wine Collector.&#10;&#10;Finally, Nuances are tiles that have three descriptors on them, and can be used to satisfy Collector demands either in part or whole, depending on how they are used and which descriptors are covered by other tiles when making a claim. These tiles are also kept in a player's hand until used.&#10;&#10;A player's hand size is limited to just six tiles/cards in total (excl. Grapes/Varieties which are kept on the table in front of them), and you must juggle these as best you can to make a call on what tiles are worth holding onto, and which ones can be safely discarded...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wait a minute. Don't we mean BLACK Friday?&#10;&#10;Nope. It's &quot;Balck Friday,&quot; as in German General Hermann Balck. In the winter of 1942, his crack 11th Panzer Division fought an amazing series of battles along the Chir River in response to the Soviet surprise attacks that surrounded Stalingrad. It has been called one of the finest divisional actions of all time.&#10;&#10;Bottom line, a single Panzer division, fighting one day after another (frequently after overnight marches) pretty much destroyed an entire Soviet tank army. And more.&#10;&#10;But it's a virtually unknown story, as the disaster of Stalingrad and Manstein's relief effort (our own Wintergewitter game) get all the headlines. It may be hard to imagine, but minus Balck's extraordinary fire-brigade work, Stalingrad would have been much, much worse!&#10;&#10;On Christmas Day (a Friday), Balck and his units were called upon once again. They had to stop a Soviet probe deep behind the porous German lines, aimed at knocking out the airfield at Tatsinkaya, which was supporting the Stalingrad Pocket. ATO spotlights Balck's amazing efforts with a new, unpublished and complete game.&#10;&#10;With 100 die cut counters, a full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map and just 4 pages of rules, you'll be able to quickly explore this one remarkable exploit during a very &quot;dark December&quot; for the Axis.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Scale: ca. 0.667 miles/hex, 8 hours/turn (from Jay Murphy's video posted on BGG on 10Jan2025: https://boardgamegeek.com/video/532153/balck-friday-the-tatsinskaya-raid-december-1942/balck-friday-intro ).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the latest scientific research from Positive Psychology, the Happiness Board Game teaches players how to raise their happiness levels. Players take turns rolling dice and moving around the game board. Game board is made up of three kinds of spaces: positive circumstances and attitudes, negative circumstances and attitudes, and bonuses.&#10;&#10;When players land on a positive space they take a card from the corresponding deck and read it out loud. Cards present positive situations were points are rewarded for being in a positive circumstance or having a positive attitude. Those points are then multiplied by their corresponding weight (10% or 40% respectively) that the situation has on one&rsquo;s happiness level. Players than move their score tracker the appropriate number of spaces in the scoring area.&#10;&#10;The same happens when players land on a negative space, except the points are negative and suggestions are given on what players can do to raise their happiness levels in negative situations.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards provide points of discussion such as, &ldquo;You begin volunteering at the local animal shelter. Scientific studies have found that volunteering increases our level of happiness. Right now have every player name some volunteering work that he or she would like to do.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Play ends with the first player to reach 100 points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Though these campaigns took you to every corner of the Star Wars galaxy, there was still a common thread. In every campaign, up to four players took on the roles of Rebel heroes, battling a single Imperial player who commanded the forces of the Empire arrayed against you.&#10;&#10;Now, with the Legends of the Alliance companion app, you have the chance to unite with all of your friends in a cooperative campaign. The Legends of the Alliance app takes over all of the functions once performed by the Imperial player, freeing you to experience entirely new campaigns in a fully cooperative environment with your friends as you fight side by side against the Galactic Empire!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The preschooler version of the classic Pi0ctureka game with a giant mat&#10;&#10;Pictureka! is a new kind of game, both in mechanic as in artwork. The mechanic is invigorating with its large square gaming tiles. The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.&#10;&#10;A game turn &#10;Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.&#10;&#10;How to win the game? &#10;Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. &#10;The artwork is something not to be found in &lsquo;standard&rsquo; games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.&#10;&#10;",
