The combat mechanism is fun and adds an element of luck and skill without much complexity. The game system is infinitely expandable.&#10;&#10;Players will assemble a &quot;dungeon&quot; by creating a stack of coasters that includes rooms, monsters, and treasures. They then adventure through the dungeon by turning over tiles, battling the rooms, defeating the monsters, and looting the treasure. Along the way, they may pick up magical treasures or spells that can help them in their quest. If they survive the dungeon, the player with the most treasure points wins. If they do not, the dungeon wins. But either way, there will be laughs and maybe even a drink or two!&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by players trying to drop quarters on coasters. If they miss, players take hit damage. If they land on the coaster, the monsters take damage. Battles continue until either monster or player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You command an army of stag beetles. They are fighting each other on a cloven oak tree. The winner takes the ultimate delicacy &ndash; the oozing sap. The rules are simple, yet the tactical and strategic approaches are nearly endless. The goal is to get three of your stag beetles to the opponent's front row first. To get there, you'll need to push the enemy bugs off onto other branches, crush them, and drop them from the tree.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 10 x 10 square board. You can use two or three beetles to displace one or two enemy beetles in columns and in rows. But watch out! Diagonal push moves are mandatory. Even if you don&rsquo;t like the direction! It will often be convenient for you to let your opponent push your stag beetles out during the game as this will weaken their position. And you can use these weaknesses to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Some weaknesses can become strengths during the game. It works both ways. In the beginning of a game, it is generally good to keep a lot of stag beetles in diagonals. However, the more you move into your opponent's territory, the more you must be vigilant that they don't take advantage of your diagonals. For instance, they could place their beetles behind yours just to make you push them towards your front row.&#10;&#10;A popular tactic is to sacrifice some of your stag beetles by letting them fall off the tree or be crushed. This destabilizes your opponent's position, and you can easily sneak this move in. You can also let your opponent reach your first row with two of their beetles. By doing this, you gain a positional advantage. You can quickly place three of your beetles on the enemy's first rowg and win. The game is very dynamic. A position that may seem wrong can quickly turn everything around and let you win. You just need to find the right way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragonbond: Battles of Valerna is a fantasy miniature wargame that brings the vibrant world of Valerna to life; players field magnificent dragons, legendary commanders, mighty heroes, powerful monsters, and brave soldiers in a desperate battle for victory.&#10;&#10;Battles of Valerna utilizes a unique fatigue system that encourages players to make the choice between pushing their units to exhaustion or saving them for a perfect opportunity.&#10;&#10;Players take turns activating units by placing fatigue tokens on them (the more fatigue tokens a unit has on it the less effective it becomes). Units move and attack, competing to score objective points dependent on the scenario. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are three types of dice for attack and defense. If a unit is in an advantageous position they upgrade their dice to a stronger one. If they are in a disadvantageous position for example if they are flanked or exhausted, they would use a weaker dice.&#10;&#10;When building their army, players can choose to dragonbond their mighty dragons and generals, making both even more powerful - this comes at a cost. If either unit is killed, both units are lost!&#10;&#10;The Wargame is completely modular.  By changing the captain you can change the rules for the unit and the generals impact upon the behaviour for the entire army.&#10;&#10;",

The game board has a grid overlaying a landscape with red and blue numbers along the Y and X- axis (similar to the game Battleship). The dice is marked on three sides with red numbers (1 to 3) and the other sides marked with blue numbers (1 to 3). &#10;Players start at the bottom taking turns. If the dice shows a red number, a player ascends vertically, if it shows a blue number, then the player moves to the right into the landscape. Depending on the coloured numbers on the dice, players will ascend and travel right across the board. Once a player ascends to red 16 they are at the highest altitude and can go no higher. If a player has already reached red 16 and rolls red again, they must miss a turn. &#10;To win the game the players in turn continue to roll the dice for a blue number and move to the right. This is continued until number Blue 30 and Red 16 is reached (top right corner). Whoever reaches this number first is deemed the winner.&#10;One space on the game board shows a meteor (Red 9 - Blue 18). If a player lands on this square the player is out of the game, because his balloon burns as a result of being struck by the meteor.&#10;&#10;The game celebrates a milestone in human endeavor. The front box shows the yellow balloon and black and silver capsule that Piccard and his assistant used in 1931. They were the first people to visually observe the curvature of the earth.&#10;&#10;Of interest to other board games, Auguste Piccard was the inspiration for Professor Calculus in The Adventures of Tintin and Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek was named after one or both of the twin brothers.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a turn performing their chosen action to ultimately gain the most victory points (VP). VP can be acquired by gaining Treasure, using Opportunities, and mainly by killing monsters.

Each villain&rsquo;s deck is comprised of their minions to help drive the story.&#10;&#10;From the Shadows is a turn based, light deck builder. Heroes begin the game with a deck of 15 cards, tailored to their abilities. During the game players can loot more cards from monsters they vanquish, building their deck and making their hero stronger. The final Villain is more difficult than his minions and basic monsters. Once a player kills the Villain the game is over and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Captures can be spent to gain control of enemy cards which pivot to the orientation of the buyer, changing the relative strengths on the battlefield and subverting enemy plans. In addition, each player is dealt 1 of 15 unique 'hymn' cards, which grant powerful abilities that dramatically alter the board state.&#10;&#10;The game feels a bit like chess, but with far less predictability, due to the randomness of the deck and the asymmetrical powers of the hymns. Skill is gained by learning to predict patterns of movement, and being willing to take risks.&#10;&#10;",

Planes that fall in the sea must go back to the start. Planes that hit the cliffs on either side of the board are eliminated outright!&#10;&#10;The winner is the first pilot to land their aircraft &quot;on one of the squares of the Finish.&quot; They may overshoot the winning roll without negative consequence.&#10;&#10;",

Each round players must weigh whether to take an early upgrade or wait for a larger draw and, thus, a better upgrade.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game was conceived by Aldo Spinelli in 1989 and develops on a chessboard of 4 squares per side. &#10;Each player has a traditional six-sided die, which is moved from one square to another in an orthogonal direction, rotating on an edge of his choice as many times as the value expressed by the top face. &#10;The dice can change direction after each rotation and can also retrace the squares already traveled during the same move. The die can only pass into empty squares. &#10;The player who manages to finish his move in the square occupied by the opponent wins, so that, after the last rotation, his die shows on the upper face a value identical to that indicated at that moment by the upper face of the enemy die.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is inspired by the Etruscan divination art and is an interpretation of how dice could have been used more than 2500 years ago. &#10;The Netsvis board reproduces the sacred Etruscan space and can be used both alone, to draw the wishes of the day, and in competition with other players, having as its objective the challenge to Fate with the simple throw of the dice.&#10;How to play.&#10;&#10;     Netsvis is a solitaire where you face pure destiny, destiny and what governs all the daily events behind it. It can be used as a divination tool (do I win or does Fate win?) But it is also a competitive pastime towards oneself. In fact, it is possible to numerically evaluate the outcome of the single game and gradually try to obtain better and better results. In this way it is also possible to compete with the participation of more players in succession of time.&#10;     The two dice act alternately as dice and checkers. The white die W is favorable, the one that could win. The black die B is the unfavorable one, the one that could make you lose.&#10;     At the start of the game, B is placed in the gray box in the lower center. It doesn't matter what value is shown on the top face of him.&#10;     You roll W with your right hand and, starting from the square occupied by B, advance it to the right to the first square that shows the same image of the face that came out in the roll of the dice. Here the die W stops while B remains in his place.&#10;     Now take B and throw it with your left hand. The result of the shot causes B to move to the first square corresponding to the exit face, starting from the position of W but in the opposite direction, ie to the left. Now two clarifications are necessary. The first, completely connected to superstition, is linked to the traditional beneficial influence of the right hand (which must be used to roll the white dice) while the left has always been considered a bearer of misfortune. The second clarification is fundamental for the purposes of the game. When the rule says: &quot;Bring B into the first square on the left starting from the one occupied by W&quot; it means that a possible release of the colors magenta, yellow or blue in this first throw of B will make it move to the right with respect to its initial position but &quot; however &quot;to the left of the white die.&#10;     After placing B in the corresponding square, W is taken from the square in which it is and raised (with the right hand) and then moved to the right up to the first square equal to the exit face. Also in this case the reference to the starting point of the displacement of W is the square in which B stands.&#10;     And so on, toss after toss in a continuous back and forth that leads W to the right arm of the board and brings B back to the left. The game continues until one of the two dice cannot move because it is in such a position that there is no square in front of it with the symbol that came out in that roll. If it is W, it is placed on the top white square and the player has won.&#10;     If it is B, it is moved to the top black box and the player has lost. So it's fate that won the game!&#10;     You can only win with an odd number of rolls and lose with an even number. This distinction also has its own symbolic meaning ... And you can win with a few moves or after a tiring sequence of rolling the two dice. Likewise, if Fate is adverse, a few moves may be enough to reach the nefarious black box. If you manage to stall, you must never lose hope: the arrangement of the numbers on the board can often turn the tables in our favor.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You're given a non-stop barrage of ingredients, which you use to make sandwiches... of variable quality.&#10;&#10;Starting with a hand of eight cards, each turn you choose three cards to discard as a &quot;sandwich.&quot; The only rule is that the three must be equally distant from each other (e.g., 2-3-4, or 3-6-9, or 5-5-5, etc.). You then draw a number of cards based on the &quot;quality&quot; of your sandwich: if it all cards discarded were of the same suit, you draw four; if all three were of the same color but two different suits, you draw three (that is, you get back the same amount you discarded); if the cards were of different colors, you only get back two.&#10;&#10;The game consists in decisions about when to play certain cards and when to hold on to them, having a good idea of what's left in the deck and what's not, and in keeping your hand size healthy enough to stay in business. If you would draw the last card, you win; if you cannot make a sandwich out of your ingredients, you lose.&#10;&#10;The game can be played entirely in-hand, holding the deck of cards with the ingredients on top and the discard pile face-up below.&#10;&#10;As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.&#10;&#10;",

In this fast-moving game, you and your fellow players own competing General Stores in a boomtown where new gold was just discovered. You must battle it out selling specific supplies to the gold prospectors flooding into town. But first you must either buy the goods from local suppliers or trade with a devious gang of vigilantes when supplies become too scarce. And of course, you must move quickly to make your fortune; because in just 6 months, the gold will run out in this town and the prospectors will move on to another!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY: The game is played over 6 Rounds &ndash; one for each month from July through December. Each Round has 2 Phases: Production Phase and Buy/Sell/Trade Phase.&#10;&#10;During the Production Phase, each of the 8 Suppliers produce Goods (or has Goods stolen by the Vigilantes!). Production is random based on the Production Cards that are chosen each round, so some goods may quickly become scarce!&#10;&#10;During the Buy/Sell/Trade Phase, players either buy Goods from the Suppliers, sell the Goods needed by a Prospector to make a sale and claim the Prospector Card, or trade Goods with the Vigilantes.&#10;&#10;Some claimed Prospector Cards include a Contract Goods bonus which can be used to make future sales &ndash; making this an &ldquo;engine-building&rdquo; game!&#10;&#10;Play continues for 6 rounds (representing 6 months) with special rules at the end of September when the Vigilantes flee and drop their stolen goods for players to grab, and during the final month of December when the gold has run out and prospectors are stocking up quickly to move on to the next boomtown.&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME: Win the game by collecting the most Provision Points from completed sales to the Prospectors, as well as Bonus Points from individual Bonus objectives achieved at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Management expects that the new aircraft A81 introduced to normalize its performance will play a role as a game changer.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to operate the A81 aircraft in an efficient manner, producing high performance.&#10;&#10;The game board and auxiliary game board are placed in the center, and the player takes a personal board with the same color as his cube according to the number of players. The game starts with a first player and runs several rounds clockwise.&#10;&#10;In player turn, each player proceeds in the order of the next three steps.&#10;1. [Rolling the dice]&#10;The player rolls three dice at the same time in his turn and distinguishes the top color of each dice. Designate A for the same color on the top of each die and B and C for the different colors. &#10;(Example: Yellow+yellow+red = A+A+B / Blue+Purple+Red = A+B+C / Blue+Blue+Blue= A+A+A)&#10;2. [Choose 1 out of 2 tasks]&#10;The player chooses one of the two tasks(flight Service, staff training) in his turn and behavior once.&#10; - Task 1: Flight Service&#10; - Task 2: Staff Training&#10;3. [Moving score markers based on behavior]&#10;Move the score marker according to the player's behavior immediately.&#10;&#10;The next player will also continue in the same way in the three-step order, and the round will end when all players play once. As several rounds progress, if the cube is no longer available after one's turn(if there is no A81 reservation), the game ends after only the corresponding round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the A81 aircraft management performance(passenger fare score, employee training score, reservation waiting score, checked baggage import performance, profitability improvement performance, marketing performance) is all calculated and the player with the highest total wins.&#10;If the total is tied, the player with more colored cubes in the business class wins. If it is still a tie, more players will win the cube(reserved waiting) remaining on the individual board, and if it is still a tie, they will win jointly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chocoloco is a casual card game of chocolate swapping and order filling for 2-4 players. Each player manages their hand, which can have chocolate and action cards. Players may play any or all of their cards on their turn before drawing back up. Players arrange chocolates on the table to try and fill orders to score points.&#10;&#10;The catch? You have to work to build your own order combos while blocking your opponents. Oh, and there's a limited set of orders. The easy ones go fast, so plan ahead! It's kind of like a certain candy-swapping puzzle game but made with cards where players can mess with the board of chocolates &mdash; and each other!&#10;&#10;All players share the cards on the table and may use any of them to complete and score orders. Get 15 points to win a round (or 10 points to have faster rounds). Once you win a round, you gain a Round Winner card. Win 2 rounds and win the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements Crazy Cake Bakery.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The First Sovereignty spread humanity to every corner of the galaxy, but eons have passed since its fall, and the countless worlds once under its thumb became no more than whispered legends to one another. Now, a potent new FTL advancement, which rumors say emerged from the cryptic galactic core, grants humanity the hope of travel to the farthest stars in a single lifetime. You are one of the few with the mettle to give up your planet-bound life and become a STAR CHARTER.&#10;&#10;Star Charter is a card-driven solitaire game where you play a star charter, striking out from your home planet to travel the space lanes and the vast void, discovering long-lost worlds of a densely inhabited galaxy. When you have discovered three new worlds, you have won the game, but it is possible to become adrift in space and lose. Whether you win or lose, the known galaxy has the potential to grow with each new game.&#10;&#10;This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few materials (a map, paper, index cards, and colored cubes) and the remaining components will be generated as needed during play. Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The game rules include tables and guidelines for making new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Star Charter an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. The galaxy&rsquo;s worlds can grow endlessly over a connected campaign as players return to see what each new era holds for the future of humanity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
