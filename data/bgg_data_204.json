Then, one at a time starting with the youngest player and continuing around the circle, draw a card and do what the card says. Hilarity ensues.&#10;&#10;After you have dried your tears of hysteria and given your cheeks a rest, move the appropriate amount of spaces as indicated by the card.&#10;&#10;BUT! Stay alert. The cards are the key to everything. Some of them award you points based on an action. Some are contests, where the winner moves. SOME even allow you to grant points to another player. They are EXTREMELY silly and will keep everyone on their toes.&#10;&#10;Work your way down Silly Street. Whoever lands on the last spot first leads the group in an epic dance party and wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A square-shaped board with 13 slits (axes) crossing it is placed in the center of the table. A square-shaped card is drawn from a deck and placed onto the board. The card covers the entire board except for the ends of the axes, leaving room for a mirror to be inserted into the axes perpendicular to and on top of the card. The card displays several spheres that are red, green, yellow, or blue.&#10;&#10;Players race to choose which of the 13 axes they think the mirror should be inserted into so as to produce the most points when all the reflected and actual spheres are counted. A player cannot choose an axis that another player has chosen. Once all the players have made a selection, the mirror is inserted in turn into each chosen axis. The player who chose a particular axis decides which direction the mirror should face when inserted into that axis. The axis scores for the player who chose it. Each green sphere adds a point, and each yellow sphere subtracts a point. The player also adds points equal to the difference between the number of red and blue spheres.&#10;&#10;Play continues with a new card. The game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon point total.&#10;&#10;",

Basically, you and the other players are stuck in an abandoned farming community, hunted by a psychotic 21 year old with 10&quot; metal blades bolted through her fingers. The game play is very gory, the odds are in Angel's favor, and you must often fight with weapons no better than a flashlight. (Or a rake if you get really lucky..) However, that's the fun of the game! You see, the point of Death Angel isn't really to &quot;win&quot;, but to survive. Face it; Angel is better. She can appear and disappear at will, she's always got a deadly weapon, and worse of all, she regenerates almost instantly. Lucky for you, she does play fair; if you out run her, she might leave you alone. If you do something silly like jump through a window, she'll go away. (If you survive the fall, you can rejoice!) If you hit her too hard, she'll disappear. (Of course, next time you see her, she's going to be pretty peeved at you.) And finally, if you survive until 5AM, she'll allow you to continue your life in peace. And so, the primary goal is not to defeat Angel, but to survive her wrath. I wouldn't bet money on surviving all 6 hours, though. Expect to lose 2, maybe 3 victims before daybreak...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While digging on the slopes of Mount Ego, the Dwarves of Shafausa discovered a secret passage under the falls of the river Rain. From there they gained access into a subterranean world of obscure galleries and gigantic caves, full of immeasurable wealth. The exploitation of this area rapidly assured the small tribe a lifestyle far superior to anything previously known in Helvetia. Their neighbours, the Vampires of Zugriga, immediately realised the fantastic commercial potential of these discoveries. Thanks to a clever stock exchange system, they implicated the other Helvetian tribes in their dealings, for the joy and well-being of all &ndash; or so they claimed.&#10;&#10;But wealth doesn't just fall from the sky, and it takes a good dose of know-how to be able to rival with the skill of a vampire...&#10;&#10;In Shafausa, each player represents a Helvetian tribe that has come to propose a new monetary system based on an exchange of resources. Each round players can make purchases (buildings, mines, warehouses) and exchange currency &ndash; and through these transactions influence the stock market for the prosperity of their region. Each player holds three Power cards with special actions, but can use only one during the game as the other two are then removed from play. The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round having seven phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Extraction: Mines and certain buildings produce resources, with some buildings affecting how many resources something produces.&#10;    Order of Play: Players bid for turn order; as players drop from the bidding, they place their marker in line relative to those who have previously dropped out, so whoever stays in the longest can get the position he wants.&#10;    Buying and Constructing: In turn order, players buy at most one available building and construct two warehouses; alternatively, a player can pay to remove a building in order to make space for new buildings next round.&#10;    Management: Players can build mines, add miners to their workforce, construct purchased buildings, buy and sell resources, and construct new towns.&#10;    Administration: Players pay for buildings in reserve and check their resource limits; resource costs are adjusted based on past sales.&#10;    Speculation: In turn order, players pay to adjust the prices of various resources, with each price marker being adjustable only once.&#10;    End of Game Check: If one of a player's towns or warehouses has been filled, the game ends. Players then score points for their towns, mines, buildings, and so on, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to this &quot;Geek&quot; version of the rules, Shafausa includes a &quot;Colonial&quot; version in which players draft start-up tiles (instead of starting with pre-determined characters who come with specific buildings, funds, etc.) and a &quot;Family&quot; version that removes the &quot;Speculation&quot; phase, simplifies turn order, and otherwise makes the game less involved.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player first rolls all five dice, sets aside at least one die, then rerolls, with the process continuing at most five times, at which points all the dice will be set aside. The player discards all 6s, then for each other value he places 1-2 chips onto the game board, mostly from his hand but sometimes from the stock.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a column by filling in the red circle, he claims all the chips in this column and every other player must remove 1-3 chips in his supply from the game. A player can borrow up to five chips from the supply on his turn, but if he fails to repay them at the end of that turn (by claiming a column), the game ends and the player with the most chips in hand wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Raid sur Bruneval 1942 - Raid on Bruneval 1942 - (Operation Biting) is a solitary tactical game that appeared in the French  Vae Victis magazine #104 (special game edition). It simulates the Raid of British paratroopers under Major Frost's command to capture a german radar near Bruneval (northwestern France) during the night of february 27th 1942. During this operation, the british dropped by parachute must capture the radar, one or two german operators, destroy the manor and finally embark all in the waiting Landing Craft Assaults.&#10;&#10;The game is edited under ziplock and contains a A3-size map depicting Bruneval surroundings at night (scale at 1/25000), 108 counters (the 3 formation of British paratroopers Drake, Nelson and Rodney ; german coastal defense, luftwaffe guards, MGs, pill-boxes and part of 685th infantry regiment reinforcements ; activation and other markers). One typical counter unit represents around 10 men. The rules are included in a separate 15 pages A5-sized booklet.&#10;&#10;The duration of the game is 13 turns from 0:15 et 03:15 am. The player plays the British side first each turn and then the activated german units fight, move and get reinforcements in this respective order. Except for the coastal defenses, the german units are not represented on the map at the beginning. Instead, several randomly selected activation markers are deployed in specific areas of the map. The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide from 0 to 4 german units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other.&#10;The British must score at least 10 victory points to get a marginal victory. More than 20 is a decisive victory. The historical score is 24 VP.&#10;&#10;",

Each number may only appear once per row and column. In this way, the players gradually try to fill the rows and columns. If a player is the first to complete a row of numbers, they can write down the number in the middle as a point. The trick is: if you wait too long, you get fewer points or minus points. The player with the most &quot;lucky points&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players build cities while trying to survive extreme weather disasters that become more and more common as carbon dioxide accumulates in the air. It's a family-friendly game perfect fit for casual and strategic gamers. It's also a great choice for teachers looking for a visual way of introducing their students to climate change.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to grow, sustain and protect a large population. Players take turns pulling new citizen cards and purchasing new development cards to add to their city.&#10;&#10;Each citizen has their own special ability, including the construction worker who can help you repair your city, the educator who can teach your workers to use advanced technologies, and the solider who can help protect your city from outside attack.&#10;&#10;One of the best parts of Tipping Point is that players can use their imaginations to build the type of city they want. There are dozens of different development cards to choose from, including oil wells which earn more money, hospitals which protect citizens from extreme weather, or power plants which are needed to power buildings. But this growth and development comes at a cost: the release of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2).&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered when 1 player reaches a population of at least 10 citizens. Since Tipping Point also has a semi-cooperative mode, it is possible (but quite challenging) for all players to win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This 2009 publication is the second such collection.&#10;&#10;Matching pairs in the Memory game involves finding the related words printed on the cards. Since each card has its own illustration, the pictures on two matching cards will usually have nothing in common. For instance, where &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (gold fingers) is illustrated with a close-up of the hands of a golden statue, the matching &quot;Golfdinger&quot; (golf thingies) card displays a pile of golf tees.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When Dragons Fight is an operational level game on the hypothetical invasion of Taiwan by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) circa 2003-2004. The simulation is based on the premise that the PRC opens with a massive missile attack and is able to use their economic and military leverage to keep America out of the conflict. With no foreign power intervening, the PRC must conquer the island within 15 days or the Republic of China (ROC) wins. The war itself is conventional and fast-paced.&#10;&#10;The game is of low-to-intermediate complexity. The system covers a wide spectrum of modern operational warfare, including rules for amphibious landings, air mobility, and land and air combat. Victory is determined for the PRC by seizing a significant portion of the island's population centers, which would render Taiwan's continued existence as an independent country economically and strategically impossible. The Taiwanese win through denial of Communist Victory Points or the capture of the landing beaches.&#10;&#10;Units portrayed are mainly brigades and divisions, ranging from about 5000-10,000 men, and some 50-250 armored fighting vehicles in the mechanized units. The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan) with terrain types limited to clear, beach, mountain, cities &amp; large towns, rivers and highways.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Command magazine #54 (2001)&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;hex scale = 11 km per hex side to side &#10;time = one day per game turn &#10;strength = regiment/brigade/division sized units&#10;&#10;",

One card is placed in the center of the table with its characteristics revealed. Players then take turns placing a card from their tableau in a row on the table; a player can place a card between any two other cards. After placing the card, the player reveals the characteristics on it. If the card was placed correctly &ndash; that is, with the particular characteristic in numerical order compared to all other cards on the table &ndash; the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck and adds it to her tableau.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all her cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, she wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;",

Games feature a period of economic build-up, preparation for combat, then Raiding and end-game. Players will align with one of four unique Fate Decks, boosting replay value and interaction. Craftiness, table politics and strategic play determine the winner. &#10; Overview:&#10;Players take on the role of an aspiring deity. They must build up a Temple, gather Faithful followers and collect powerful Relics in an attempt to wipe their opponents off the map &ndash; only one deity can reign eternal in this free-for-all of legendary proportions!&#10;&#10;Play Time: &#10;2 players (1-hour), 3 players (1.5 hours), 4 players (2-2.5 hours)&#10;&#10;Basic Play: &#10;&#10;    Play follows a 4-step turn: Reveal (start), Marketplace (buy), Raid (combat), Reinforce (end). &#10;    The Tile Deck, Faithful Deck and Relic Deck feed into a central board called the Marketplace. &#10;    Players use Faithful (human followers) in their Temple to collect gold and defend in combat. &#10;    Faithful placed in the Raiding Party can attack opposing Temples during combat. &#10;    Relics (4 of which are aligned to each Fate) further increase strategic play and add variety. &#10;    Players will purchase Tiles from a randomized stack (the Tile Deck) to customize their Temple, which is then arranged strategically to increase hand-size and defenses. &#10;    The four fates are: Chaos, Grace, Prosperity and Wisdom, each tailored to a unique play-style. &#10;    Each Fate Deck has a powerful set of 20 different cards, in theme with each of the Fates. &#10;&#10;&#10;Combat: &#10;A Raiding Party ventures into an opposing Temple, encountering Defenders and Traps along a Tile path  to the Heart of the Temple, where the opposing life force dwells. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, with Defense rolling first and combining its total. Faithful played from the Raiding Party must beat defending total or they are forced to retreat. If the Temple is conquered, damage is dealt through Smiting. When an opponent&rsquo;s life hits zero (20 max), they are defeated. The last remaining player has achieved immortality!&#10;&#10;",

Working together closely exchanging weapons, zapping aliens, and building a smart infrastructure is the only way to stay alive.&#10;&#10;But fighting off the hordes of aliens alone won't cut it.

Don't wait too long, or the Spawnmonster will have grown too powerful for you to confront her and live to tell your grandchildren about it.&#10;&#10;To build up your defenses, you draw cards from a Resistance deck that contains weapons and Modules. Add the Modules to your Space Station to make it more efficient. Use the right combination of weapons to rid your Space Station from the ever-growing alien presence &ndash; but choose your actions wisely! For every action you use to build, the Spawnmonster sends out another of her brood to the Space Stations, sometimes with deadly consequences...&#10;&#10;",

Hooker began forging the AOP into the weapon he and Lincoln knew was needed to defeat the Army of Northern Virginia led by Robert E. Lee.&#10;&#10;Using his cavalry aggressively in conjunction with the newly formed military intelligence unit, Hooker fixed Lee's location and conceived a brilliant plan to sweep him from the field. Hooker's army, now numbering 135,00 men in eight corps and an artillery reserve would confront the Army of Northern Virginia's some 59,000 souls on ground of its choosing.&#10;&#10;The movement began on April 26th, 1863 behind a dense screen of Federal cavalry, foiling the prying eyes of rebel spies and scouts. Surprise was complete, but ahead lay the thickets and dense woods of the Wilderness. Little did the Union soldiers suspect the ignominious outcome that awaited them. For Lee, recovering quickly, launched a counterstroke still studied today for its sheer audacity.&#10;&#10;Designed by award winning Richard Berg, Chancellorsville places you in command of either army.&#10;&#10;Units are demi-brigades. Each hex on the three maps is around 265 yards and each turn is an hour. At this scale, players must master both operations and tactics to be ultimately successful.&#10;&#10;",

Every chef gathers ingredients from the Protein, Vegetable, and Flavor decks and, after the judge reveals the challenge, they choose which ones to get rid of and which ones to keep. Then, before the chefs can share their creation, the judge unveils the Secret Ingredient that must be incorporated in some way into each dish. After hearing what each chef has prepared, the judge will determine who wins each round. Then, the next player at the table becomes the judge - and at the end, the player with the most challenges won is the champion of Competition Kitchen.&#10;&#10;",

Each noble favors a different arrangement of cards, such as the longest straight, the most cards of the same color, or as many of the same card as possible.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of cards numbered 1-9 in either red or black. Each player starts with cards in hand, along with other cards in a face-up display. Gameplay takes place in phases, with players first swapping a card from the display with one from their hand or drawing from the deck, then discarding. After this phase ends, the nobles issue challenges, going to whoever best satisfies them, although they can be won away from you in the future.&#10;&#10;Ideally you can build a hand that's flexible enough to satisfy three nobles during a single challenge...&#10;&#10;",

If you do not roll, you get exactly 3 movement points.&#10;&#10;If you manage, either during or at the end of your turn, to create a row of three ice cream flavours on the board that matches the flavours in one of the cones in your hand, you have served the cone and can place it face-up in front of you. Remember that the flavours must be in a horizontal or vertical row; diagonal lines or rows that go over the edge of the board do not count. &#10;If you have no more cones in your hand, you take a new cone from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;The game ends when a player who has just served a cone is unable to take a new card because the draw pile has been used up.

Show everyone that your planet is the most prosperous in the entire galaxy!&#10;&#10;Planetopia is a space deck building game where players each embody a planet and will optimize their hand to achieve the most interesting combinations to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game goes clockwise,each player taking one turn at a time. During his turn a player has the choice among the following actions:&#10;&#10;Mandatory action to choose among:&#10;&#10;     Take a Cosmos card: Take a Cosmos card from the common trail. The rightmost card is considered to be closest to your planet, so you can take it without spending an Atom token. On the other hand, if you choose to take a card farther away from your planet, you will have to spend an Atom token on each card to the right of the chosen card. The chosen card then joins your hand, you can only apply its effect once you play it. Once the card is taken, slide the remaining cards to the right to fill the empty space. Then draw a new Cosmos card and add it to the left end of the row so you have 5 cards available again.&#10;     Play a card: Play a card of your hand face up in front of you and apply its effect. Most of the time the Cosmos cards can accommodate new residents on your planet, then take the Alien tokens corresponding to the icons on the card played and place them on your game board. If you end up with more Alien tokens than your board can welcome, discard the token(s) of your choice without obtaining Atom token(s) in exchange. If you play the last card you had in hand, recover all your cards at the end of your turn.&#10;     Recover cards: Collect in your hand all the cards played face up in front of you.&#10;&#10;&#10;On top of your mandatory action you can make another optional action to choose between:&#10;&#10;     Atomize: You may decide to discard one or two of the residents of your choice from your planet, receive an Atom token for each discarded Alien token.&#10;     Make a combo: Discard the Alien tokens corresponding to the pattern on the Prestige card and take it. Keep it face up in front of you. Some cards can also recover special tokens.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can therefore do a maximum of two actions per turn: one mandatory and one optional, in the order of your choice.&#10;&#10;The game is played in as many rounds as necessary for a player to score 25 Prestige points. The player with the most points is then declared the winner, her Planet is the most remarkable of all the Galaxy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For centuries she has been plotting and scheming, lying in wait until the time when she could bring the world to its knees under darkness and ruin. That time has come and the Water Witch will reign!&#10;&#10;In Paradise Lost, you will play a legendary Hero. Take on the role of Alice, Aladdin, Beowulf, Billy Goat Gruff, Hercules, Merlin, Perseus, or Red Riding Hood. The Water Witch has ripped you from the pages of your own story, bringing you and the others to life in order to fight an evil Villain, possibly your nemesis: the Jabberwocky, the Warlock, Grendel, Troll, the 9-headed Hydra, Sir Mordred, Medusa, or the Big Bad Wolf.&#10;&#10;The Water Witch is certain that if the great Heroes of fables and lore perish, it will change reality and the world will succumb to despair.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow Heroes must travel the realms of the Water Witch; deduce whom she has summoned as her champion Villain and the weapon needed to defeat them, all the while preparing for the fight to come. Along the way you will speak to Oracles, learn secrets from the Truthseekers, recite ancient scrolls, seek the Villain&rsquo;s hideout, and much, much more. Tread careful, the journey will be perilous and it is possible to enrage the Water Witch even further.&#10;&#10;Paradise Lost is a fantastical deduction game for 2-5 players where you can&rsquo;t win just by having the most complete information. Deduction combined with worker placement, resource management, and point-to-point movement makes for a truly unique gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Sometimes it takes an imaginary world to save the real one!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player manages a section of the market area, and to group the booths in their section better, players want to rearrange booths &mdash; but you can relocate booths only as long as they stay along the same alley!&#10;&#10;Your own market section has booths along four horizontal and five vertical alleys, so it has five rows and six columns of booth spots. One of the spots in your 5x6 grid is empty; the other 29 spots have a booth, and each booth belongs to one of five market segments. On each turn, you move one booth horizontally or vertically to the empty spot, i.e., to the spot from where the previous booth was moved.&#10;&#10;To earn points, players try to reach goals better than their opponents. The game includes twelve goals, such as having one of the five market segments grouped the best, or having two specific market segments connected the best, or having the longest straight path with one market segment or the biggest rectangular area with one market segment.&#10;&#10;These goals earn you a point when you reach them first, when you overtake another player, and when you have the lead at end of the game.&#10;&#10;The number of turns players have depends on the progress on the time track, so you can assess how many turns remain in the game, but you can't know for certain.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Attacks can destroy some parts of player tower, block his queue, steal construction (wooden elements from tower) and more.&#10;Winner is player who will build highest tower when there are no wooden bricks (construction) to summon from Source.&#10;During game, tactic is very important, as well as hand management. But game has two modes, for younger and older players:&#10;Basic - for younger players. It's rather building race then real fight. Basic mode will let you learn about game mechanics and summoning Construction (wooden bricks)&#10;&#10;Advanced - it's where real magic starts. In this mode players use Special Cards, which contains additional attacks (3 per card). And those spells are much more powerful then basic attacks (from Attack Chart). Also, its easier to get cards to attack, named Elements. There are 4 elements in game: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water.&#10;While your tower is getting bigger, you need to focus to prevent lower sections from being destroyed. For this, you use Section. You can summon Section each 5 levels of tower, and when you have 8 or 6 (depends on game type) constructions in your storage.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s in the box:&#10;- 126 wooden bricks (0,6x06x2,3 inch)&#10;- 20 Summoning Cards&#10;- 24 Elements Cards&#10;- 11 Special Cards&#10;- 12 Securing Sections&#10;- Attack Chart&#10;- Instruction&#10;&#10;What is for what?&#10;&#10;Wooden bricks allow players to build towers. Each floor of tower consists from 2 bricks. Those bricks are named &ldquo;construction&rdquo;, and can be removed by other player when he uses hostile action (attack) on yours tower&#10;&#10;Securing Section building this prevents lower parts of tower from most attacks, however there are some strong spells that can remove it and even construction below!&#10;Summoning cards allows to summon construction elements from &ldquo;source&rdquo;. Summoned construction can be used for building tower or placed in Storage (near tower). Bricks in storage can be traded for Attack Card or Section.&#10;&#10;Elements Cards are used mostly to assembly spells, like attacks, area attacks, stealing, blocking move, forcing other player to make bad move, ect.&#10;Special Cards are used in Advanced game. They add 33 actions to the game. Spells and attacks are much stronger. Also, these cards adds some defensive abilities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SPI's Adventure Gaming is an introductory booklet that included three small-format games selected to represent the scope of the SPI product line: The Creatures that Ate New York, Napoleon at Waterloo, and The Tower of Azann.&#10;&#10;The Creatures that Ate New York is a lightweight takeoff on The Creature that Ate Sheboygan. Up to seven players may play. Each player has a secret objective, which could involve destroying a certain Manhattan location or just beating up on the other monsters.&#10;&#10;Napoleon at Waterloo was one of SPI's standard introductory games. It is a traditional two-player wargame designed by James Dunnigan.&#10;&#10;The Tower of Azann is billed as fantasy role-playing, however it is closer to choose your own adventure. One or more players have characters journeying through the Tower. Unlike the other two entries, this game did not include counters or a map. No gamemaster is needed, the game is based on a paragraph system and movement between the rooms is sometimes governed by a die roll.&#10;&#10;",

Each player throws 3 dice to determine which actions they have available to them in a round. The players get re-rolls for abilities. Money and tokens are placed in the corresponding boxes. These are emptied beginning with the #1 box down to #6. Every token allows for an action. Either taking resources (black piece or new token for a player), placing a token on the civilization track, or moving a token on the track.&#10;&#10;A player can have up to a maximum of 26 tokens on the civilization track. Once a token is on the track, a new token can be placed adjacent to it. Different spaces give different abilities to the players, such as re-rolls, victory points, or resources. Some spaces have a cost to use them, such as War, which allows the removal of a token from another player.&#10;&#10;The civilization track consists of 30 spaces. It starts with the 1st space, Writing, and ends with the 30th and final space, City. Once a player places a token on the 30th space, the game ends and victory points are tallied. Points are obtained from the civilization track and for every 3 black token, coin, or playing piece leftover. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The fourth game by Martin Wallace in spielbox.&#10;&#10;&#10;",
