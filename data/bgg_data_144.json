    "Description": "&quot;Konflikt '47&quot; is set in a world very much like ours--that is, until 1943. With the development of atomic weapons, the world changed. The testing of a prototype nuclear device by the Manhattan Project opened a rift in the fabric of space. When the Fat Boy atomic bomb was dropped on Dresden in March 1944, it created a second rift. German scientists set to work studying it with far more speed than their U.S. counterparts. Both nations began to receive radio signals through the rifts, though often undecipherable. Soon it became apparent that these signals were messages from unknown originators wanting to help each nation's war efforts.&#10;&#10;As the messages were pieced together, discoveries were made that allowed each nation to make huge leaps in industrial and scientific research. Despite repeated pleas and demands from their allies, both the United States and Germany were reluctant to share the messages coming through the rifts. Stalin then declared the United States an enemy in May 1944: the Soviet Union would end the war on its own.&#10;&#10;It is against this backdrop that players find themselves. Using the incredibly popular Bolt Action rules, this rulebook offers everything required to build a force that incorporates the incredible weapons and technologies made possible by the rift signals, and to engage in tabletop battles for supremacy and survival. Fully compatible with existing Bolt Action material, Konflikt '47 takes the war to a completely new level.&#10;&#10;",

Do you have what it takes to be a famous race car driver? Find out today with Famous 500 - the World's Smallest Car Racing Game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Famous 500 is a fun, fast-playing car racing simulation. The game focuses on managing the wear and tear on your vehicle, which you customize at the beginning of the game. For each hairpin, gentle curve, and straightaway on the track, players play a speed card, attempting to be the fastest car through that section. Higher speeds and more dangerous sections of track, however, will increase the wear and tear on your tires, fuel, and engine. Drop below zero in any of these and you&rsquo;ll blow a tire, run out of fuel, or burst into a ball of flame. The player who crosses the finish line with the most speed points is declared the winner. Famous 500 is the third game in Famous Games Company&rsquo;s line of World&#226;&#128;&#153;s Smallest Sports Games and has earned a reputation as the most strategic and cutthroat title in the series.&#10;&#10;",

The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.&#10;&#10;The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.&#10;&#10;The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.&#10;At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&#10;&#10;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&#10;&#10;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

Their mission was to break the German stranglehold on the &lsquo;Mount Bracchi Triangle&rsquo;, a wedge of hills dominated by enemy spandaus and mortars and open the road to Rome. The fight would be slow and bloody, with each German machine-gun nest needing to be eradicated before the next leap of a few yards forward could be accomplished.

    "Description": "Battleborn Legacy is a Fantasy themed board-wargame at the strategic level for 2-4 players that takes roughly 120 min to 180 min to play.  Players acquire resources necessary to build powerful armies, accomplish quests and discover rare magic as they attempt to earn enough victory points to win the game.&#10;&#10;Put your skilled artisans to work to build a strong economy and then unleash legions led by powerful heroes to vanquish your foes.  Never underestimate roaming undead armies and always be on guard as the deadly dragon may strike at the most unfavorable time.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game by choosing a hero and a race alliance.  This can be accomplished randomly, in turn order or by blind bid.  Once the selections are made, players will place their stronghold, hero and starting army on one of their race alliance territories, then in reverse order players will place their race lord on another alliance territory in a different province.&#10;&#10;Player aid cards help players with their turn sequence, unit costs, casualty results and random events that may occur throughout the game.  Each players turn consists of the following sequence: A rune blessing that affects all players, players then purchase new units and structures and place them in a queue.  Each player then takes their turn moving units, initiating and resolving battles, deploying new units, collecting resources and updating their victory tracks.  All players may then heal heroes, repair damaged strongholds, draw new quests and resolve a cataclysmic event to end the turn.  There are 7 turns and if a player hasn't earned enough victory points through expansion, questing, killing other heroes or slaying the dragon the final cataclysm destroys the world and all players are defeated.&#10;&#10;What really makes Battleborn Legacy stand out from other war games is a combination of features including the following:&#10;&#10;1. Unique Battle boards for regiment and hero placement.  Color coded for easy unit placement, also coordinates with matching attack/defense dice.  &#10;2.  Heroes and units may become veterans through battles won.&#10;3. Random casualty chart that adds a real combat element to the game.&#10;4. Card draw that may change the outcome of key battles and events during the game.  These cards include powerful artifacts, unique hero abilities, magic weapons, quests and much more.&#10;5. Resource management system that evolves with game play.&#10;6. Random events such as dragon attacks, natural disasters and undead uprisings that may change players objectives and strategy throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Battleborn Legacy is a must try for fantasy war game enthusiast that enjoy RPG elements, real strategy and where victory is decided by each player's tactical combat skill and cunning and not just the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "4th Street Software Pro Football is a dice, chart and card simulation of NFL football. The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.&#10;&#10;Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:&#10;&#10;First, let&rsquo;s set the scene. It&rsquo;s the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miami&rsquo;s got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. They&rsquo;re down by a touchdown.&#10;&#10;The Miami coach selects a passing play, &ldquo;F1 Cross&rdquo; (F1 is the flanker, and he&rsquo;s running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).&#10;&#10;The play card is essentially a 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo; card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.&#10;&#10;The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.&#10;&#10;So let&rsquo;s roll the dice and see what happens&hellip;&#10;&#10;20 sided die = 2 &#10;12 sided die = 6&#10;2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4&#10;&#10;The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).&#10;&#10;Here are the two players involved on the play:&#10;&#10;J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]&#10;Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]&#10;&#10;The offensive player&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (pass rush) of the defensive player&rsquo;s. These two ratings are subtracted (6 &ndash; 4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.&#10;&#10;Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his &ldquo;B&rdquo; column across from &ldquo;4&rdquo; and find the result code of &ldquo;47&rdquo;. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the field&hellip;there are approximately 90 of them.)&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.&#10;&#10;",

The first accommodated 2-6 players and came in a brown box (there were apparently actually two versions in a brown box, but the differences between them are apparently very minor). The second is in a blue box, takes only 2-4 players (there are also solo rules, but the gameplay is very different with them), and has some changes from the earlier edition. There was an expansion kit for this edition which added the other two players, but which appears not to have been widely distributed.&#10;There was also a &quot;Spanish Main Up-Date Kit&quot; to upgrade the 1st to 2nd edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the website&#10;Thunder's Edge is a science-fiction board game of politics, strategy and giant mecha for two to five players. Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.&#10;&#10;from review by Nickjost:&#10;Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.&#10;&#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board. This introduces a minimum one turn delay from when an item is purchased to when it can be deployed.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Thunder&#039;s Edge: Demon Canyon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The crusaders must use their powerful knight squadrons, especially the Templars and Hospitallers, to protect their slow infantry and baggage trains.  Saladin must skilfully deploy his mamelukes, horse-archers and skirmishers to wear down the crusaders and prevent them reaching Arsouf.&#10;&#10;Siege.  2 players.  Nineteen attacking knights must take a castle in 40 days.  Arrayed against them are not only 10 knights, but boiling oil, Greek fire, and rocks.  Luckily the attackers have the know how to build ladders, rams, mines, catapults and towers to help them break in.&#10;&#10;Border Raiders.  2 players.  Border clashes in 13th century Germany.  Karl the Black must loot and plunder the villages of his neighbour Duke Conrad.  Clever use of archers and knights to protect the levies laden down with plunder is necessary to win this game.&#10;&#10;Tournament.  2-4 players.  Three days of jousting where knights can increase their prowess is followed by the grand melee which mixes those unhorsed with those still on horseback.  Jousting involves secret choice of target and simultaneous revealing.  The grand melee rewards speed for the mounted knights and swarming for the unhorsed knights on a team.&#10;&#10;",

It is played in several rounds where the players will avoid cumulating points. Each of them starts with 4 cards face down and looks only at 2. By replacing some of their cards with drawn ones and playing capacities, they will progressively gain knowledge of their game and the ones of their opponents, whom they will steal cards from.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the players&rsquo; scores are marked down and added to the ones of previous rounds. A game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points, the winner being the one who has the least. For a shorter game, a maximum score of 50 points can be set.&#10;&#10;The theme is post-apocalyptic, the illustrations being humoristic creatures and heroes inspired by old movies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Captain's Sea is a low-to-moderate complexity game for two players who take the roles as captains of the original American frigates (Chesapeake, Congress, Constellation, Constitution, President, and United States) or their opponents from the British or French navies during the turn of the 19th Century. All of the classic duels fought by these ships are represented in detail. Unlike other age of sail games that focus on fleet actions, Captain&rsquo;s Sea puts you on the deck of a single ship with the responsibility of leading her to victory. You must maneuver against the wind and your opponent to achieve optimum firepower, as well as manage your crew as they scramble to man the guns, work the rigging, and repair battle damage, all while being hammered by the burning shot and flying splinters caused by your enemy. Can you keep your crew in good order or will you be the first to strike the colors?&#10;&#10;The action of the game is driven by control of the weather gauge. This is done in a unique fashion by moving ships relative to both the wind and each other, stressing the benefit of position. The ship with the better position has greater flexibility in maneuver as each player predetermines his ship&rsquo;s movement through a simple action selection process that does not require pencil and paper to track. Players must also allocate available crew points (a diminishing commodity as a ship takes damage) to man the guns, rigging, or other actions that the situation might mandate. A deck of action cards provides period flavor and swings of fortune. Throughout a turn, you as captain, are bombarded with difficult decisions that determine the fate of your ship.&#10;&#10;Included with the game are ten scenarios, including such classic engagements as the Constellation vs. L&rsquo;Insurgete (9 February 1799), Constitution vs. Guerrier (19 August 1812), and Chesapeake vs. Shannon (1 June 1813). Even those ships that did not fight a major engagement get the opportunity to play out a historical opportunity missed. Additionally, players will find it easy to create hypothetical pairings to see what might happen.&#10;&#10;",

An evil as old as time has awoken and it is possessing you all by taking advance of your weakness. If nobody finds the book of the dead and destroys it, this will be your last night as humans.&#10;&#10;The Possession is a game for 3 to 5 players in which time is against them. The evil is stalking you and each round the players could be possessed by it, and becoming one of the thirsty blood demons looking for living souls, the other players' souls!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, all players roll a die: the more wounds you have, the more easily you become a possessed. Then players play an action card to indicate how many actions they can play and how much they risk suffering an evil event. This risk is higher in the cards that give more actions.&#10;&#10;When a player finds enough pages from the book of the dead and burns them in an altar, before the evil owns all players, he becomes the winner. By using the action points, players can cover the house looking for the pages as well as objects, weapons, and keys to get into the basement and attic-; they can also rest in order to get back the action cards played and heal wounds to keep alive.&#10;&#10;A possessed player must attack his friends so that the evil inside him feeds of his crime and not with his soul. He will be able to smash doors, escape for windows to get inside in other rooms and so, surprise another players. He will have more action points depending on his possessing level.&#10;&#10;The other players can attack the possessed ones. The only way to stop them is dismembering them completely &mdash; but these amputated members will be wandering around ready to claw and strangle whoever gets close enough...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Euronimoes is a euro-style print-and-play game for 2-4 players requiring only the rules (which include a playing mat), double-six dominoes, and a handful of poker chips.  It takes about 10 minutes per player to play, and it takes less than a minute to &quot;build.&quot; (Only 1 set of double-six dominoes is needed for a 2-player game. Two double-six dominoes sets are needed for the 3-4 -player game.)&#10;&#10;How does it differ from your ordinary, garden-variety game of dominoes? Players of Euronimoes are trying to play their dominoes in their own personal area in such a way as to minimize their point count at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The pips in any column must form one or more sequential runs &ndash; at the end of the game, the value of a run is equal to its smallest number. A run of 6-5-4-3, for example, is worth 3; a run of 4-3-2-1-0 is worth 0. And again, players don&rsquo;t want points.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, of course, since players also have to buy the dominoes they play, but that&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a simple game, but there&rsquo;s a lot going on. Players of Euronimoes will quickly find that it takes plenty of planning, quite a lot of strategy, and at least a little luck to come out on top.&#10;&#10;Anyone who enjoys puzzle games should definitely give it a try.&#10;&#10;Enjoy!&#10;&#10;",

By modifying dice rolls, players puzzle out which processes produce gold. Whoever can get the most gold at the least cost is the winner.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Alchemidus is a speed puzzle, with players trying to be the fastest to find the cheapest way to convert clay to gold.&#10;&#10;The game has four pairs of d6 dice, in gold, lead, clay and white to show the process. The 2 gold and clay dice, and 1 of the lead dice are rolled and placed on their respective marker cards. The players must figure how to progress from the two clay numbers, to the one lead number, and then back to the two gold numbers.&#10;&#10;To do this, there are three rows of five cards dealt out from three small decks. One row has spells to remove a die, so you need that to go from clay to lead. Likewise, another row is spells to add a die, so you need that to go from lead to gold. The third row is to modify dice values. The spells are varied and often symmetrical, so you might have one spell saying &quot;If the total is &gt;=7, do...&quot; and another saying &quot;If the total is &lt;=7, do...&quot;, or a spell for odd numbered dice, and another for even numbers.&#10;&#10;Each spell card has a number on it, the cost of using that spell. The numbers go from 0 to 5 with five cards being 10 and one being 20 (Get any value die). Players must read the spells and quickly figure out the lowest cost method of going from clay to gold. It should always be possible, the spells have sufficient variety and there's enough of them.&#10;&#10;When one player declares a cost, the others have a little time to declare a lower cost. The player that proves the lowest formula wins the round.&#10;&#10;The game is well made, the dice and card stock are good quality. The game comes with Japanese rules only but the spell cards are all in English mainly, with notes in Japanese. The spells are sufficiently obvious, gamers will not have trouble figuring them out.&#10;&#10;",

Power, glory, boredom, it is not clear why these eternal gods continue to confront and murder each other, but no one has the memory of a time when the world of Feralis was not accompanied by the incessant rhythm of the colossal armies they summoned.&#10;&#10;Feralis is a deck construction card game for battles 1vs1, 2vs2 and solo. The ultimate goal is to kill your opponents, to do so you have to recall your creaturs, mutate them, and use them to slay the creatures that stand in the opponent's area or go directly to the head of their leader.&#10;&#10;In Feralis, the players have a deck of creatures, a Aesyr that impersonates, and a series of Godlike Skills assigned to the god. The creature cards have 2 sides, a &quot;Call&quot; side and an &quot;Awakening&quot; one. To put them on the battlefield you have to wait for their waiting cost in turns. Once your creatures on the &quot;Call&quot; side are defeated they will come back in the &quot;Awakening&quot; form. You can also play them directly in the &quot;Awakening&quot; form but you will miss the opportunity to see their &quot;Call&quot; form.&#10;&#10;Your main resource is time, you have to put the creature at the right moment to create a powerful combo between your creature. You can reduce the time cost with a limited resource the Catalyst. You have a short amount that you can use also during your opponent's turn to unlock your creature in the Incubator area.  You can support your creatures with your Godlike skills, powerful events that need time to be ready but they can turn the tide of battle. This Skills will recharge once used. Use all these resources wisely and have no mercy, your opponents will not.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the active player takes the free labyrinth tile and pushes it along one of the rows or columns marked with an arrow on the game board. This action inserts that tile into the labyrinth and pushes the other tiles one space, popping one tile out of the labyrinth to be used by the next player on her turn. By shifting the walls, the player hopes to be able to move his token along the paths to land on the treasure currently being sought. If the player does this, he claims the treasure card and a new card is revealed; if not, play continues until someone grabs that treasure.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure has been collected, the game ends and whoever nabbed the most treasure wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each card has an effect or placement restriction that will help you gain cards from other players, speed up construction, add to your neighbor's towers, peek at the deck, allow you to build any card, etc. In team mode, the effects are useful for exchanging cards between team members.&#10;&#10;The only building restriction is that cards cannot go over 21 and you cannot build tower cards that match your neighbors' topmost card on their nearest towers to you. Nobody in your city wants to be a copycat.&#10;&#10;Completed towers gain you points based on the number of kites on the card, with lower-value cards scoring more points. Completed towers and other actions may award you a bonus worth points at the end of the game. Cards in your hand and unfinished towers do not score.&#10;&#10;Race to build the perfect city until the deck runs out, and enjoy building towers from around the world on top of other towers from around the world.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the first half of the 20th century, the United States and the Japanese Empire constantly made plans for a naval war against the other rising power. Each believed that the U.S. Navy would fight its way across the Pacific Ocean, with important clashes taking places in island chains like the Marianas and the Carolines.&#10;&#10;Pacific Crossroads is the new introductory boxed game for the Great War at Sea series. It's based on the actual plans of both the United States and Japan for naval conflict at the close of World War I and immediately afterwards. Players try to seize and hold bases to either enable or stop the American drive across the Pacific.&#10;&#10;While the game is intended for new players, there's plenty here for old salts, too. New ships like the American 1910 battle cruiser design are present, as are the battle cruisers the Americans feared Japan would acquire from the Royal Navy. There's a lot of naval warfare in this small package, which also ushers in a new edition of the series rules.&#10;&#10;The 22x17-inch operational map covers waters around the Mariana and Caroline Islands and the coast of northern New Guinea. Players maneuver their fleets on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.&#10;&#10;The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;",

War was now too expensive, too deadly. But they would fight on to the death.&#10;&#10;The War begins with sweeping invasions. Great armies marching to the largest battles yet seen. Murderous fire produces unimaginable casualties. Exhausted, they dig in. The Armies develop Siege Howitzers, Poison Gas, Tanks, and Combat Aircraft. New tactics attempt to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare. Mass Tank Attacks, Storm Troopers, Drumfire Barrages. The war is on multiple fronts. Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Turkey, Poland, Russia, Romania, Palestine, Mesopotamia. The conflict is much broader than just the battlefields. Factories must be supplied and people fed. Produce the guns, shells and bullets the armies need, or face disaster.&#10;&#10;The Grand Campaign combines all of the Der Weltkrieg series titles (not a stand alone product). Link all of the campaigns together to simulate the entire war from start to finish.

Your reflexes, your sense of strategy, and your ability to survive will be tested.

Don't worry &mdash; it's normal because surviving the apocalypse is anything but easy. Every attempt will teach you a little more about the game mechanisms and strategic priorities. Until Daylight is a game in which every action counts and where time will be very cruel. In some phases you will have only a few seconds to react before the horde falls on you. You win the game if the following three conditions are met:&#10;&#10;&#10;    All characters survived the ten rounds of the game.&#10;    All enemies revealed in the game were eliminated.&#10;    The group saved at least one survivor.&#10;&#10;&#10;Until Daylight is a co-operative game, but of course players might disagree on which strategy to adopt.

Lots of stuff.&#10;&#10;As you explore you also come across the items you need to get through and learn spells that can alter the very corridors in front of you. But beware; you are not the only one in the dungeon and your opponent will have a very different view of what it looks like&hellip;&#10;&#10;You begin the game with an empty grid of thirty-six square holes (the Dungeon Waffle), plus a bag of thirty-six Dungeoneering Dice. The Dungeon Waffle is placed between you and your opponent, so each of you can see a different side of it. You then take it in turns to draw a die from the bag, roll it and use whatever you roll to either add to the dungeon map, alter the dungeon map or add to your resources.&#10;&#10;Your aim is to score more experience points than your opponent over one or more games. During a game you try to map out a route on your side of the waffle from one edge to the other, and collect weapons and equipment to deal with whatever you might encounter on the way. When adding to the dungeon map you will change the map seen on both sides of the Dungeon Waffle, hopefully helping your route, while hindering your opponent&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zombie World is a card-based tabletop roleplaying game of survivors fighting against the living and the dead for their own place in the world. The game is designed for easy, quick, and intense play.&#10;&#10;In Zombie World, you take on the roles of ordinary people caught up in a zombie apocalypse, struggling to survive day after day, month after month, year after year, in a world destroyed by the restless dead. Maybe you&rsquo;re just an accountant who took up a machete to keep her friends and family safe. Maybe you&rsquo;re an escaped inmate trying to keep your criminal past a secret from your fellow survivors. Maybe you&rsquo;re a soldier trying to lead and protect your whole enclave in this ruined world.&#10;&#10;Zombie World has its roots in the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks: A New Generation, but it takes that system in new directions, using special cards to generate characters, create situations, and resolve conflicts. Making a new character takes minutes: you draw a few cards, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. Every time you take an interesting action in the game, you draw a few cards that will tell you what happens to your survivor. In Zombie World, your story is about the larger group of characters more than it is about any single one of them, as you struggle, sacrifice, and strive to create a place where you and your allies might not just survive...but where you might live.&#10;&#10;Zombie World comes with all the cards, the playmats, the rules, and even a dry erase marker&mdash;everything you need in a small box you can easily fit into your bag and play on the fly. If you&rsquo;re a fan of The Walking Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or World War Z, then Zombie World is the perfect game to satisfy your hunger!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lucha Wars is a two to eight-player dice game, based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or &quot;Lucha Libre&quot; (a.k.a. free fighting). The game is a new variation with new content to Luchador! Mexican Wrestling dice. &#10;Each player selects a Luchador wrestling character to play and rolls their Grapple Dice to try to either reduce their opponent/s life points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.&#10;Each wrestler has individual Life levels, Pinnable level, and Combo Attack zones. Also, they each have their own Special Attacks that can be used during a match by rolling their Special Attack Die.&#10;&#10;Players begin by each rolling their own set of five 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, DODGES, and MISS rolled are played off against each other with DODGES being re-rolled once which can also be used to target their opponent/s dice. The player with the highest Hits is the winner for that round and the loser takes the difference in damage off their Life track.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the winner records the victory by moving their counter up one tile on their Special Attack Track. &#10;The Special Attack track allows a player to do their Special Attack, attempt to PIN an opponent, attack using the Combo Die and attack with a Weapon (Weapons Match).&#10;&#10;If a player has reached the PIN tile on their Special Attack Track, the 'three count' begins against their opponent. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using four of their five wrestling dice or lose the match.&#10;&#10;In a tag-team match, players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them... if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.&#10;&#10;In the Weapons match, four Weapons Tokens are placed face-down in each of the four corners of the wrestling ring. Once a player moves their token to the tile on their Special Attack Track that shows a Weapon, it allows them to take a random Weapon Token and use that Weapon against an opponent at the beginning of any new round. This will often involve dexterity rolls with dice.&#10;&#10;The Ladder match is a two-player game about which player gets their wrestler standee to the top of the ladder first to win the match. The game also includes a Changing Alliances match and Cage Match rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This new version of Destruction of Army Group Center is a thorough redesign, by Ty Bomba, of the game originally published by old-SPI in the early 1970s (in S&amp;T#36). The campaign under examination is &ldquo;Operation Bagration,&rdquo; the Red Army&rsquo;s summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is &lsquo;shaping the battlefield&rsquo; and &lsquo;controlling the tempo,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.&#10; Each hex on the 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers). Each of the nine game turns equals one week, from IV June through IV August. Units of maneuver are corps (and static &ldquo;fortified localities&rdquo;) for the Germans and armies for the Soviets. The latter&rsquo;s great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 &ldquo;air armies.&rdquo; There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number three&rsquo;s Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The &ldquo;Bold Stroke&rdquo; scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; as the failure of the Western Allies&rsquo; D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.&#10;&#10;",

What's more, the artist can't talk, each other player can make only a single guess, and each type of building material can be used only once during your turn. A correct guess rewards both the guesser and the artist, with the players gaining points on a score track. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game of tactics, strategy and confrontation is set in a fantasy world after the Great Depression. Each player runs a company of special agents, and their agents become teams in threes. The aim of the game is transporting the crystals and leftover artifacts (guns and transporting means!) from the mine to your own campsite and from the campsite to your home. The transport will succeed only if the team is strong and fast enough, and if you can use the transporting capacity of your men optimally. However, nobody is left alone with their problems. The competition and the robbers ensure interaction and surprises&hellip;&#10;&#10;The basic game consists of 5 rounds. Players try gaining crystals and artifacts from the central mining project (bidding for the best bunch of crystals), then in the tactically most important phase they choose their 3-card &quot;teams&quot; to take actions in order of their speed. On your turn you can go to the mine to take crystals to your camp; you can attack others' camps for crystals and you can transport your crystals home or to the bank from your camp. You can also collect or use the artifacts found: they can help in increasing your transporting capacity or battle power, but if you don't use them they can mean lots of points in the end of the game. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points (from crystals and artifacts at home and points from the bank) wins.&#10;&#10;Krysis website and rules&#10;&#10;",

The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.&#10;&#10;In ChronoCops: Jules Vernes Parallelwelt-Paradoxon, mad Professor Knix has hidden himself in an inaccessible timeline. In order to stop him, the players must find Atlantis, where all timelines converge.

The first three games were $10,000, with the Third Edition later repackaged as $20,000 with slightly different artwork to accommodate the change. The eighth game used $50,000, per the brief 1981 series.&#10;&#10;",

You take on the role of a clan leader and explore the landscape, discover new tools and offer to holy places. All this to gather as much status as possible.&#10;&#10;Epoch: Early Inventors is very thematic and tries to stay as close to reality as possible.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game you build a landscape of hexagonal playing cards and holy places.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can carry out 1 action and/or develop 1 card and/or offer to 1 holy place.&#10;&#10;You can choose between the following actions: gather food, fish (for food), hunt for deer, butcher deer, explore adjacent cards or work to get raw material.&#10;&#10;You need food to move around the game board and develop cards. Gathering food and fishing are basically the same actions, but depending on the tools you have, the one action might give you more food than the other.&#10;&#10;You need raw materials to develop cards and offer to the holy places. Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.&#10;&#10;Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.&#10;&#10;Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.&#10;&#10;To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.&#10;&#10;Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage. E.g. Rope Making allows you to turn 2 flax into 3 ropes. Sowing gives you 2-4 extra food, when gathering food. An axe makes it easier to chop wood.&#10;&#10;By cleverly using your own cards and those of your opponents, you try to offer materials to as many holy places as you can, thereby increasing your status even more.&#10;&#10;After 14-20 rounds the game is over. The player that has collected the most status has won.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time.  The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of a round, each player is dealt a hand of ten cards (or in later rounds, each player receives an equal number of cards with any remaining cards being set aside). Each player chooses two cards to pass face down to their right-hand neighbor, then the round begins. In the first round, choose a starting player at random; in later rounds, the loser of the previous round begins.&#10;&#10;The starting player chooses one card from their hand and plays it into the center of the table. Each player in turn must play a card of the same strength or higher; if a player can't play higher or doesn't want to, then they must discard their single lowest card. This is called a &quot;tail-tucking move&quot;.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, whoever has played the highest card (with later-played cards breaking a tie), leads a card to the next round. If at least one player has performed a tail-tucking move, then you can play a set of cards of the same strength (from two- to five-of-a-kind) instead of a single card. If you do, in turn, each player must play a set of the same strength of higher; if they can't or won't, then they must discard a number of their lowest cards equal to the number of cards in the set.&#10;&#10;A player cannot play a set that would leave them with no cards in hand, which means that the final trick of the round must be with a single card. Whoever plays the highest single card loses the round, and they collect their card and the two lowest-valued cards, then place those cards in the doghouse in front of them. You scoop any cards not in doghouses, then shuffle and deal the next round.&#10;&#10;When a player collects seven different types of cards in front of themselves, the game ends and they lose. (Alternatively, the game ends if so many cards have been placed in doghouses that you can't deal at least five cards to each player.) When the game ends, whoever has collected the fewest cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

A 2am consult from the Emergency Room can throw off your best plans!&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each day in the ICU, the game's engine tries to add Injury and Crisis tokens to patients and players race to remove these tokens. Each patient can sustain Injury to five different systems: brain, heart, lung, blood, and inflammation. In addition, each patient has a Crisis track representing the intangibles of being sick in the hospital: how much the patient is suffering and how close they are to death. As Crisis tokens accumulate, patients are more likely to develop complications. If all available slots for injury tokens or the Crisis Track are filled, the patient undergoes a Code Blue and the team has a chance to work together to save the patient or else the game is lost.&#10;&#10;This continues for 7 days until one of the game end criteria are met;&#10;1. All patients are cured by removing all of the injury tokens from the Patient Chart representing stabilization and transfer out of the ICU (win) OR&#10;2. Patients have their Goals of Care advanced to the end of the track representing hospice (win).&#10;If your patients survive until the end of Day Seven without transfer out of the ICU or transfer to hospice, the game is a draw. If any patient dies from a Code Blue, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the placed tile fully surrounds a previously placed tile, the bug on the surrounded tile is awarded to the player with the most geckos touching it. Additionally, if the gecko placed results in a bug sequence in the objective market and/or a terrain sequence, the player is awarded the corresponding objective(s).&#10;&#10;The game end triggers when a player achieves six objectives, or if the last tile available is drafted.&#10;&#10;Each objective card has bug points on the bottom of it.

The players are awarded points for leading their herds of animals to the river deltas and waterholes of the Okavango. At a waterhole, the player must replace the drinking herd with the same number OR a higher number of animals of a single kind. If the player brings the same number of animals, the thirsty animals must have a higher ranking than the animals already drinking at the waterhole. If the player brings a higher number of animals, the ranking doesn't matter.&#10;&#10;In case of a river delta, the player has to replace the drinking animals with different animals AS WELL AS a higher number of animals than at the river delta at that time. In this case, the animals' ranking doesn't matter.&#10;&#10;But there are only a limited number of waterholes and animals. The players therefore need to be smart about gathering their animals into herds and allowing them to drink.
