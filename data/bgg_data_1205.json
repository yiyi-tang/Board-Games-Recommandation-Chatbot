From all over the world, the best fighters are invited to prove their worth and do battle to become the next legendary Guardian. Authorities in their chosen martial art, each contender brings a set of special skills to the arena. The fights themselves won&rsquo;t be easy: the masters will not only have to battle each other in duels, but also with 3 or 4 person free-for-alls where they have to keep going until there is only one fighter left standing. Not only that, players will also have to compete in 2vs2 matches where they not only have to adapt to their opponent, but also their temporary partner. Each fighter is unique both in his techniques and in his reserves of energy and life.&#10;&#10;In turn, players will choose one of the five areas on their personal Fighter Board and use the tokens on it. They will be able to hit their opponents with Action Tokens, but they will also have to use their Effect Tokens to control their positions on the Fighting Area, generate energy to trigger powerful special skills and prepare their defense for the next turns.&#10;&#10;In Martial Art, your goal is to knock out your opponents. You have two ways to win the battle in the Fighting Area:&#10;- Cause enough damage to your opponent's whole body, leading to a technical KO.&#10;- Cause enough damage to a single body part to KO your opponent directly.&#10;&#10;The last fighter standing wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, many brave men and women risked everything they had to continue fighting against fascism. Today, we know that the Resistance and the Allies would be victorious, but at that time - living moment-to-moment - it was far from inevitable. They are celebrated not because they won, but because they stood firm when the outcome was uncertain and dangerous.&#10;&#10;There were others - often the wealthy and powerful - who stood for nothing, who risked nothing. The sorts of people who only do the right thing when it is safe and profitable for them to do so, who don't care what side they're on, so long as they're not on the losing side. Throughout the occupation, they attempted a delicate balancing act, collaborating with the Germans while also helping the Resistance, allowing them to hedge their bets until the last possible moment, switching to the winning side so as to escape its wrath.&#10;&#10;These are the sorts of people that players are asked to play in Streets of Shadows. Not the brave heroes of the Resistance, nor even the scared everyday people just trying to get by, but the sorts of people who see the occupation as an opportunity for advancement - as a way to pursue economic, social, and political influence. The game does not ask you to empathize with these unsavory people, but does seek to demonstrate how they enable oppressive power structures to remain in place. Even today, even on the other side of an ocean, there are still those who risk everything to fight for a better world, and others who remain silent, safe, comfortable, and complicit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle to conquer a lost underground world full of ethereal magic and ancient artifacts! Players can choose from different distinct forces, human pirates and fortune hunters, dragon-men, amazonian sorceresses with savage beastmen, and others. Games are played with small sides so players do not need to invest in massive armies, just specialized warbands of personality characters and troops, and battles can be played in an hour. Take your forces into fungal forest, crumbling ruins, and dinosaur filled jungles in campaigns of multiple scenarios where each member of a warband can gain advancements as they win battles and gather treasure. But beware of wild creatures, as they have their own AI rules that allow them to hunt any model on the board. The book comes complete with all of the core rules as well as descriptions of all weapons, armor, tech artifacts, magic and special abilities for all characters and has the roster for the main forces as well as all wild creatures. In addition, the book includes a section detailing the different environments that players can explore and do battle within and descriptions of all of the different terrain types that can be encountered. Finally, there is a complete toolkit in the back that shows how to build your own custom characters or edit existing ones using a simple point calculation system.&#10;&#10;&ndash; RULES BASED ON AWARD-WINNING SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES by Ganesha Games but with extensive additional rules, weapons, armor, technology items (akin to magic items) and new combat and movement options. ShadowSea include a detailed combat system that allows for targeting different body parts or subsystems. The activation system allows players to choose a basic free action or gamble on rolling dice for more complex actions. Game cards for miniatures are tarot sized (4.75 by 2.75 inch), giving room to include all of the descriptions of Special Abilities, Weapons, Armor and Tech Items. This means much less referencing the rulebook and faster gameplay for all. Sets of game cards can be downloaded in PDF format in the Download section of the website.&#10;&#10;&ndash; 3D GAMEPLAY: In ShadowSea, the game a distinct three-dimensional feel with models able to climb terrain, leap across open areas and push or break scenic items. Models can also swim underwater or do battle upon boats in the Shadow Sea. The game is 100% compatible with DeepWars, so players can have full land-sea battles.&#10;&#10;&ndash; INTENSE COMBAT, MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY in the underground realm. Spellcasters can wield multiple magical spell types, including dimensional magic that allows unsavory spellcasters to call forth beings from the ethereal void. Scientists can discover artifacts with tremendous power or design and improve upon their own ether technology to upgrade and create new items.&#10;&#10;&ndash; SKIRMISH WITH RPG FLAVOR: Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. The game can be played in single sessions of an hour, or as a campaign where warbands salvage ancient technology, design their own new tech items, enhance abilities and generally become powerful lords of the deep.&#10;&#10;&ndash; TOURNAMENT RULES &ndash; The rulebook has an entire section on running tournaments, complete with scoring and timekeeping, as well as new Special Operations that each player gets for a scenario. The Spec-Ops are special missions that a warband can accomplish during a scenario to gain bonus Victory Points.&#10;&#10;ShadowSea has many features that make it a flexible gaming system that is perfect for beginners but deep enough for experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;&#10;     SIMPLE RULES that can be learned in one game, using 6-sided dice for rolls for combat, physical activities, spellcasting, using ancient technology or any other action during the game.&#10;     FAST GAMES, lasting around an hour, with game models on each side alternating their turns of activation so that all players can stay in the flow of the game.&#10;     SMALL WARBANDS of 4-8 models, so that anyone can have a warband destined for glory without spending a fortune.&#10;     EASY MOVEMENT rules based on three measurement sticks.&#10;     TABLETOP PLAY allows players to build a map on any 1 meter-square surface without the need for a grid. Just add scenery and start the game.&#10;     LITTLE TO NO BOOKKEEPING! The models in a warband are represented by a basic block of two statistics and a few special abilities. Game cards come with miniatures so players have all of their abilities and rules in their hand,&#10;     MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY interweave in the Underlands. Warbands may battle using arcane magical spells or ancient technological weapons in the mysterious underground realm.&#10;     ACTION BASED GAMEPLAY means that models have many choices of actions besides simply whacking each other across the skull. Leap chasms, climb pillars, break through walls, set explosives or try something unexpected.&#10;     SIX COMPLETE FORCES battle in their quest for ancient artifacts. Over 300 heroes, fiends, wild creatures, ethereal demons, ancient mechanical constructs and stygian monsters.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The cards also have a number of symbols on them, corresponding to the suit.  The game uses a board which tracks how many symbols of each suit a player may score.  Thematically, the players are determining the optimal ratios of shelving products in a supermarket, and players who exceed the position of a marker on the board have overfilled their shelves, with product falling on the floor.&#10;&#10;These limits on the board are determined once each round.  Specifically, when at least one player has played a card of the same suit as was lead, the marker is placed on the position corresponding to the highest rank of this suit played to the trick, excluding the winning card.&#10;&#10;At the end of a hand, the player(s) who collected cards with the most symbols of each suit, without exceeding the limit, earn 1 point each.  The players complete a number of rounds equal to the number of players, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood Reef is a supplement for DeepWars, a tabletop wargame where forces battle below the waves of a lost underground ocean beneath a frozen southern continent. Players command warbands of different troops and special personality characters to search for treasure, explore sunken ruins and recover ancient artifacts. Blood Reef introduces a new force to the battle, the Nereids of Blood Reef, ancient merfolk with an affinity for all creatures of the sea, and their devious Sea Goblin allies. Each of the main four forces also has new models added to their rosters to help recovers the treasures of the reef.&#10;&#10;This book details the region of the Shadow Sea where Blood Reef is located, describing the new environments, wild sea creatures and scenery that can be found there. The reef itself surrounds the sunken city of Xibalba, Gateway to the Underworld. This coral-encrusted city was lost to the sea centuries ago after a massive earthquake. Many of the buildings are now submerged, but tall pyramids, towers and statues still jut from the shallow waters, inviting amphibious warbands to explore them and take control of the glittering artifacts hidden within the crumbling ruins.&#10;&#10;The reef has grown with jagged spurs of coral separated by channels of sandy seafloor between them, creating natural corridors of deeper water that allow small craft and submersibles to explore the sunken city. This book has new rules for these small craft and submersibles, including rules for navigation, deployment, surface and underwater combat and boarding operations. Blood Reef is a dangerous place to explore however, and there are wild sea creatures much larger than any of these craft that can tear them into twisted wreckage.&#10;&#10;DeepWars is required to use Blood Reef, The core rules are based upon the Song of Blades and Heroes (SOBH) game engine by Ganesha Games and are designed for fast and furious play with plenty of heroic action, arcane magic and advanced technology, all handled with a few rolls of 6-sided dice.&#10;&#10;The rules have been designed for battle using 28 mm &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; scale miniatures, with one figure representing one character or creature. Miniatures are referred to as &ldquo;models&rdquo; in the rules, as some larger creatures may not quite be miniature in size. Typical round bases sizes are 30 mm for man-sized or smaller models, 40 mm for bigger models, such as large dive suits, and 50 mm for huge models. Some exceptionally large models, such as undersea vehicles and mechanical contracts, may be mounted on larger oval bases. The nominal ground scale is roughly 15 mm = 1 meter, so most man-sized models are approximately 30 mm tall.&#10;&#10;Blood Reef game scenarios typically require more space than DeepWars games, with 60 cm by 90 cm (24 by 36 inches) a good size for skirmishes so that the reef and a section of sunken Xibalba can be laid out. Larger battles and campaigns should be played on maps of 90 cm by 120 cm (36 by 48 inches). Players can use smaller maps if they want, however, if they just want to skirmish on a particular part of the reef.&#10;Battles in Blood Reef take place in many possible environments, under the waves, at the surface and above the water. Gigantic prehistoric reptiles creature prowl the ruins above the waves, so landing parties should be cautious. Even the skies are dangerous for marine models coming to the sea surface, as flying dragons may swoop down to pluck prey from the water. The opportunity to have land and sea battle makes it possible to incorporate models and rules from our land-based game ShadowSea - Conquest of the Underground World into Blood Reef scenarios. The city of Xibalba is also rumored to be a gateway to deep caverns of the stygian realms as well, so players can even choose to incorporate monstrous stygian creatures into their adventures. However you choose to use this rulebook, AntiMatter Games sincerely hopes you enjoy Blood Reef as much as we have enjoyed making it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player has enough pieces to fill the two rows nearest them at the start.&#10;&#10;On their turn a players rolls dice, with the number being scaled to the board size; one die is suggested for the 8x8 board and three for the 18x18 board. The roll determines the number of moves that can be made; a piece can move to any of the five adjacent squares ahead or to the side of it. However, pieces can be moved on top of friendly pieces and a stack of pieces costs as many moves to go one space as the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;A stack can only be moved onto an opposing stack if the latter is smaller; in this case the entire opposing stack is removed as well as an equal number of pieces from the moving stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cannot make any possible move (in which case their opponent wins) or a player has advanced all their pieces to the other side of the board (in which case they win).&#10;&#10;The game was first published in World Game Review #2.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Energetic is a 4-6 player cooperative board game about the future of New York City. It comes with a map board, three card decks, 142 infrastructure pieces, and more. You play from 2021 to 2035, a turn each year. Your team must work together to balance your budget, your grid stability, and your public opinion to keep the lights on, win elections, overcome climate impacts, and build 16 gigawatts of clean power for the city. Then you will have replaced all fossil fuels, provided there is a matching reduction in demand from behavior change and efficiency.&#10;&#10;Our objective is to give players a quick grounding in what solving climate change actually means, in a physical and social sense, based on demand of energy and the types of renewable or carbon neutral generation that can supply 8 million New Yorkers.&#10;&#10;As you play, one thing you'll realize is that this problem is big, and our response must be too. This means, among other things, that it will be visible. Playing a single Solar piece represents building a piece of infrastructure nearly half the size of Manhattan. Playing a single Wind piece represents the construction of 167 metal structures, each nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower, miles off the Long Island coast.&#10;&#10;We hope playing this game can make your role in the coming decade more effective, better informed, and more powerful, and that by providing a tangible vision of what part of the solution looks like, society can begin the necessary step of reorienting itself towards this larger goal. It's a lot of fun, too!&#10;&#10;During development, Energetic was tested and enjoyed by people ages 11 to 60, including middle school students, MIT energy PhDs, former commodity traders, and leaders at environmental NGOs.

To accomplish this, Pomme&rsquo;s founders worked together to build the legendary Airship Kai, imbuing it with the best knowledge from all nine animal species. Sharing the ship&rsquo;s powers and speed, each kingdom established its foundations.

After a slow start, the Royal Navy helped by construction in the USA, Canada and India, built an extraordinary catalogue of excellent small boats, supported by larger vessels which gave serious firepower and, using the characteristics of each boat to maximum effect, fielded mixed formations supported by destroyers or powerful gun equipped LCTs. They generally fought at night and using radar and radiotelephone, coupled with RAF and fleet air arm support and even secret information from intercepts they fought the Kriegsmarine to a standstill and by 1944, with hugely superior numbers and technological advantage truly ruled any waters which they chose to dominate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

He knew that his excellent fleet could not risk significant battles with the Royal Navy, it was a one-shot weapon. The lighter units, particularly the U Boats, did most of the real work on a weekly basis.&#10;&#10;The German Navy was only raised in 1871, with a brief to concentrate on the North Sea and Baltic Coasts. Perhaps because of its youth, the Kriegsmarine was quick to appreciate the power of the humble torpedo that could cripple or kill a vessel worth millions of marks. They were thus also keen to develop the promise of the torpedo boat, cheap, potentially deadly and of great use in restricted waters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Indeed, by the end of the war the small ships, PT&rsquo;s LCI etc. numbered 7,000 craft of 80 types. Many Early PT boats had up to 4 torpedoes and 2 twin .50 Cal guns in powered mounting, a heavy load for the day. As with most American hardware, this was only the start! Soon a 20mm was added at the stern as standard, useful for surface or air action. Then, enterprising crews frustrated by strafing the tough Japanese barges to negligible effect mounted a USAAF 37mm automatic gun (acquired from an Air Cobra) and found it most effective!&#10;&#10;Indeed, America had not been blind to the possibilities of the coming war and took great pains to watch and learn from her allies and foes so that when war came, America was ready to put into place a building program that dwarfed all the other navies combined and led to the naval dominance that she still enjoys today.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They were, however, good boats and gave the Allies a tough time. They had a ten-man crew; their principal armament was two torpedoes and a 20 mm Breda A/A on the rear deck. They were fast, very fast and could make up to 45 knots, outrunning all PT boats and British MTBs. By 1940 48 of the MAS 500 class were available.&#10;&#10;Another excellent maid of all work for the Italian fleet was the Gabbiano-class Corvette. At 660 tons they carried a 100 mm main gun forward, three 20 mm A/A and four 20 mm in dual mounts. They were also equipped with two torpedo tubes. These were excellent ships, well-built and pleasing to the eye, not fast (18 knots at best) but with good tactical options for a good commander.&#10;&#10;An Italian coastal force is an attractive force to collect. The MAS boat, your main strike force, must use its speed and small size to survive, but although lightly armed and fragile, they are inexpensive boats to add to your fleet. Overwhelm them with numbers and manoeuvring, then hit hard with your torpedoes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We did not feel confined to following too closely the earlier parts in the series as rallying is a very different form of motor sport from those simulated in Parts 1 to 5, and as such needs a different design approach - we felt it better to end up with a product that captured the feel of international rallying rather than trying to fit it into the strict WoMR formula.&#10;&#10;This game allows you to recreate a full World Rally Championship season with real cars and drivers rated to perform as they do in real life. In addition, each Rally venue is rated for its unique conditions from snow, to gravel, to asphalt. Rally data is available for WRC seasons going back to 1998.&#10;&#10;Rallying is all about cumulative time, that is time taken to cover the various stages plus time lost in additional servicing 'penalties', and as such presents a difficult design problem. We wanted the simulation to be realistic and accurate (of course) but also fun to play, and not bogged down by masses of paperwork in keeping track of all the entrants. A complete day of rallying can be completed in a little over an hour and an entire rally over the course of about three-four hours.&#10;&#10;",

But with judicious use of what were pre-war civilian boatyards and the huge resources of their empire and help from the USA, the Coastal Forces would in 1944 have 25,000 sailors in over 2000 small craft!&#10;&#10;These Flotillas, enhanced by Commonwealth, Dutch, Norwegian, French, and other free forces sank over 400 enemy vessels, including 48 E-boats and 32 midget submarines. They also accounted for 32 axis aircraft and fired in total 1169 very expensive torpedoes. This impressive tactical achievement contributed mightily to the allied strategic successes. It ensured that Britain was not isolated for trade. It put a stranglehold on Axis Supply lines and ultimately formed a force that could not be resisted, so much so that by the D Day landings in 1944, the Kriegsmarine was impotent to resist.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Allied boats tended to be 70-80 feet in length, the E boat 115 feet long, and the laws of physics, though complex, favour a larger hull for speed over a shorter one.&#10;&#10;German engineering also gave them another advantage, as when speed reached 25 knots, a crank mechanism when turned moved 2 side rudders to flare, symmetrically outward at 30 degrees, creating an air-filled hollow space, the so-called L&uuml;rssen effect. This gave three distinct advantages, greater speed, a reduction in the tell-tale wake of the speeding boat, and finally settled the boat in a more efficient plane, leaving the vessel shallower in the water, most useful in mine and torpedo infested waters and remarkable for a boat weighing in at 100 tons!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

PT squadron 1 was based on Pearl Harbor and the 12 boats opened fire on the incoming Japanese bombers, claiming 2 planes downed for sure and others damaged. Squadron 2 was based in Manila Bay of the Philippines and had a similar introduction to their war, shooting down a few attackers and learning that fast boats were a tricky target for bombers. Squadron 3 was in New York working up and would later see great service in Guadalcanal.&#10;&#10;The PT boats fought all over the globe, from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, the Adriatic and Mediterranean and also in the English Channel. They achieved many successes, particularly in the last two years of the Pacific War they accounted for many stalking float planes and many hundreds of barges which were the lifeblood of the overextended Japanese army. This barge hunting was a gruelling business and needed a certain ruthlessness on the behalf of the American crews, Japanese soldiers and sailors being loath to surrender, hence a grizzly end to many a barge crew.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These battles are on your own.  In this second battle, each monster's strength is the number of bats on the card.  Each player reveals 2 sword cards from their hand.  If the number of bats is less than the sum of the sword cards, the player earns a number of points equal to the bats.  If there are more bats than the sum of the sword cards, the player also loses a number of points equal to the bats that exceeded the sword value.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For centuries, Japan's policy of seclusion (sakoku) saw it concentrate on coastal defences in order to repel foreign vessels. However, with the advances other maritime nations were making, it eventually became obvious that no longer would Japan be able to ignore the rest of the world. As an island power, it needed a modern navy. Turning to Britain for assistance, Japan quickly created a powerful modern fleet. It was this capable and confident navy that came out to fight the American Pacific Fleet.&#10;&#10;The Japanese understood the potential of air power early and created an effective carrier arm. In addition to the carriers, the Imperial Japanese Navy possessed a powerful battleship force, which included the largest and most powerful battleships in the world, the Yamato and the Musashi. The Imperial Japanese Navy's potential was demonstrated in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Using armour-piercing bombs and torpedoes, Japanese aircraft inflicted tremendous damage on the American Pacific fleet as it lay at anchor.&#10;&#10;Midway was the turning point of naval war in the Pacific and, from then on, the Imperial Japanese Navy was unable to make any headway against the increasing carrier strength of the US Navy. With the victorious Allies pushing towards the Japanese islands, the Imperial Japanese Navy fought desperately to keep them at bay. Kamikaze aircraft and other suicide weapons were deployed, and eventually warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy made death-rides against US forces.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;8 Model Ships&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Kong&#197;&#141; 1941&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Zuikaku 1944&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Suzuya 1944&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Mikuma 1942&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Yahagi 1943&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 3 Kager&#197;&#141;-class Destroyers&#10;4 Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero Flights&#10;Ship Cards&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Royal Navy of Great Britain was the world&rsquo;s greatest navy at the outbreak of the Second World War. However, Britain went to war with mainly First World War-vintage vessels. Since the Royal Navy already possessed many powerful units, construction of the most modern designs was limited. This meant that at the outbreak of World War Two Britain had far more battleships than most other nations, but they had smaller guns than those built to the most modern ships.&#10;&#10;Though the main battle force was kept concentrated in home waters, task forces were assigned to many distant areas, but the Royal Navy could not be strong everywhere. Although badly stretched, the Royal Navy lived up to its traditional &lsquo;can do!&rsquo; ethos, fighting hard in all theatres.&#10;&#10;In addition to the battleship forces, the Royal Navy maintained a handful of fast battlecruisers &ndash; some of them quite old &ndash; and aircraft carriers. These were backed up by a strong cruiser force and light forces including destroyers, motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and motor gunboats (MGBs).&#10;&#10;As the war went on, aircraft carriers became increasingly important and air defences were steadily improved on all ships. Yet the big guns of the battleships and cruisers played a vital role in many theatres of war. British capital ships saw action in the Arctic and the Atlantic against German commerce raiders, in the Mediterranean against Italian forces, and ventured into the Pacific in an ill-fated attempt to stem the Japanese advance. Though the great fleet actions planned for and desired by the architects of the Royal Navy did not materialise during World War Two, the Royal Navy adapted well to the war it was destined to fight and emerged with great honour.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;8 Model Ships&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 HMS Eagle 1940&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 HMS Duke of York 1943&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 HMS Neptune 1941&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 HMS Belfast 1942&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 HMS Dido 1940&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 3 Tribal-class Destroyers&#10;4 Fairey Swordfish Flights&#10;Ship Cards&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Although the United States of America contains a vast area of land, almost all of its allies and trading partners are overseas, and those interests require a powerful navy to support them.&#10;&#10;The US Navy possessed some of the largest and most modern battleships in the world at the outbreak of World War Two, and despite losses during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was able to maintain a powerful presence in the Pacific. However, in the vast reaches of that ocean the battleship was no longer the king of battle. It was fortunate for the Americans that the handful of aircraft carriers then in service with the US Navy escaped destruction; given later events it is doubtful that a pure battleship force could have defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy.&#10;&#10;The aircraft carrier became the main US naval asset during the war in the Pacific, which was very much a conflict between the air assets of opposing fleets. US carrier forces were hard-pressed early on but as the industrial might of the US was brought to bear, new carriers and air groups for them were deployed in such numbers that the enemy simply could not match their strength.&#10;&#10;US naval forces were primarily engaged in the Pacific, but some capital ships and larger numbers of destroyers were deployed to the Atlantic theatre where their primary opponents were German U-boats.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;8 Model Ships&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 USS New Mexico 1941-42&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 USS Essex 1944&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 USS Houston 1940&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 USS Chester 1941&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 USS Portland 1942&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 3 Clemson-class Destroyers&#10;4 F4U Corsair Flights&#10;Ship Cards&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The 20 Emotion Stones (made using Go stones) replace the wooden tiles in the original design. There are 12 white numbered stones too, and a large Elegant marble (Ohajiki). The time track is now laid on a long patterned cloth, a Karesansui Tenugui (Karesansui is a zen rock garden, and Tenugui is the style of cotton cloth). The game is still made in Japanese and English, in a larger gold foil stamped box.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer: In multiplayer mode, you engage in guessing each other&rsquo;s emotions&#10;Solo-play: In solo-play mode, you can understand and organise your own emotions quietly&#10;&#10;Through playing, you might be surprised to learn about your hidden emotions or sympathise with how the other players feel. &lsquo;Knowing yourself&rsquo; is one of the most important practices to make our lives calmer and improve our well-being. Through this, we might allow ourselves to become relaxed, peaceful, and therefore more ZEN.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Kickstarter Edition - In 2021, a Kickstarter campaign produced a limited edition with more sophisticated components. All the stretch goals were achieved: new Emotion stones that expand the game, a new box with a blue Bamboo design, Introspection cards to aid reflection, upgraded Go stones and an Emotion made from clam shells, and a drawstring bag (Froshiki) to use in the game.&#10;&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The goal of all this mess is to follow the rules and get rid of the cards in hand, but keep in mind that failing the challenge or rule makes you to pick more cards in your hand and distances you from the victory. And to raise the bar, you will play on a number of game fields and stick to some unusual rules...&#10;&#10;The game is easy to learn and serves as a handy entertainment to you, your friends and your family.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Developing villages and cities, roads to connect them, and armies to defend them, will all take a toll on the environment.

Modernized in the 1930s, she went on to serve in the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Warspite was part of the Norwegian campaign of 1940 and subsequently was transferred to the Mediterranean, squaring off in fleet actions against the Italian Regia Marina. During the Battle of Crete in mid-1941 she suffered damage from enemy German aircraft and spent 6 months under repair in the US. These repairs were completed shortly after US entry into the war, and she set sail across the Pacific to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942.&#10;&#10;She returned home in 1943 to provide gunfire support as part of Force H in the Italian campaign. She again suffered damage, this time at the hand of radio-controlled glider bombs, during the landings at Salerno. She spent almost another year under repair as a result.&#10;&#10;Before her repairs were fully completed, she was back at sea, providing fire support the next year, supporting the Normandy landings and on Walcheren Island in 1944. These actions earned her the recognition of being the ship with the most battle honours in the history of the Royal Navy, and also accorded her the affectionate nickname, the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot;.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Model Ship&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; HMS Warspite&#10;1 Ship Card&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yamato (&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#146;&#140;, &quot;Great Harmony&quot;) and her sister ship, Musashi, were constructed shortly before the outbreak of World War II. They were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed; armed with nine 18.1&rdquo; Type 94 main guns &ndash; the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.&#10;&#10;The battleship&rsquo;s design was an answer to the numerically dominant US Navy &ndash; Imperial Japan&rsquo;s primary threat in the Pacific. Though laid down in 1937 the battleship was not actually commissioned until late 1941, a week after fated attack on Pearl Harbour. She served as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. It was from her bridge that Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto directed the fleet at Midway in June 1942, though this proved a disastrous defeat for the Japanese. She was thereafter replaced by the Musashi as flagship and spent the larger part of 1943 and 44 moving between ports in a responsive role.&#10;&#10;October 1944 was the only occasion on which Yamato fired her main guns in anger, at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Yamato had been tasked with repelling American forces invading the Phillipines. Though success lay within Japanese grasp, such was the ferocity of a counterattack of a light escort carrier group of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Task Force 77 that the Japanese enacted a retreat, falsely believing they faced a much larger carrier force.&#10;&#10;By early in 1945, Naval superiority in the Pacific belonged firmly to the US Navy. In an effort to delay the Allies&rsquo; advance, Yamato was dispatched to Okinawa in April 1945, with no expectation to ever return. Her orders were to beach herself and fight until destroyed. This was not allowed to occur when, on 7 April 1945 when she was sunk by US carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers, with the loss of the majority of her complement.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Model Ship&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; Yamato&#10;1 Ship Card&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two Bismarck-class battleships were built for the Kriegsmarine. Bismarck was the first, named for the Chancellor (Otto von Bismarck). The battleship was laid down in July 1936 and launched February 1939. She and her sister ship, Tirpitz, were two of the largest battleships built by any European power, and certainly the largest built by Germany. Whilst the physical power they held was tremendous, they also wreaked psychological havoc amongst the allies. Churchill was determined that the two battleships not be let loose upon the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;Bismarck's career, however, was woefully short, spanning just eight months under a single Captain, Ernst Lindeman. During this time, she only took part in a single offensive action that lasted just eight days in May 1941. This operation, codenamed Rhein&uuml;bung, was to attempt what the Allies feared, a breakthrough to the Atlantic and raid allied shipping efforts between Britain and North America (along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen).&#10;&#10;The two vessels were detected multiple times off Scandinavia, prompting Britain to initiate naval blocking maneuvers. The resultant battle, the Battle of the Denmark Strait, saw the British vessels HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales engage the two vessels. Hood was destroyed for her efforts and Prince of Wales suffered damage, forcing a retreat. However, Bismarck had suffered damage significant enough to put an end to her raiding mission.&#10;&#10;Limping for occupied France for repairs, Bismarck was pursued by a Royal Navy set on retribution for the sinking of HMS Hood. She was attacked by 16 Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers deployed by HMS Ark Royal. A direct hit rendered Bismarck's steering gear inoperable. The following morning, she suffered crippling damage in a battle against two British battleships and two cruisers. She was subsequently, on 27 May 1941, scuttled by her crew and sank with many lives lost.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Model Ship&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; Bismarck&#10;1 Ship Card&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

She was modernised in the early 30s. During World War II, but before the United States&rsquo; entry into hostilities, she was assigned to join the Neutrality Patrols that protected American shipping during the Battle of the Pacific. Following the attack on Pearl Harbour, she was redeployed to the Pacific Theatre, along with her sister ships.&#10;&#10;For the remainder of the war she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific, shelling Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and Philippines campaigns. She also supported the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Idaho was present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. Idaho was decommissioned the next year and dismantled in 1947.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Model Ship&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; USS Idaho&#10;1 Ship Card&#10;Damage Sliders&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Overworked and underpaid, dodging cars, buses, and whatever else the street throws at you, it's a job that tests your nerves as much as your physical skills.&#10;&#10;Go Play in Traffic puts you in the saddle of a rookie bike messenger on your first day on the job. You'll need to avoid moving obstacles, route yourself through the streets, and know how to keep your cool under pressure.&#10;&#10;Based on more than 20 years of experience as a bike messenger and a lifetime of a game player, Go Play in Traffic is a fast paced game for 2 - 4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
