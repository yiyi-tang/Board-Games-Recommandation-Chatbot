Bidding takes place; the highest bid wins the employee and becomes the cost of the employee per round. After bidding is over, players add the production amount of their employees (if any) to the appropriate suit column, and subtract the cost employees (if any) from the matching column. Asign a suit to add Spades to.&#10;&#10;Selling: once four employees are hired, the company can be sold. All resources are added and that number of points given. If resources are in negative numbers, those are subtracted from the points to pay off debt. Half of employees are shuffled back into the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Goal: to have the most points after 20 rounds, or the lowest negative resources.&#10;&#10;",

Unforeseen instability splits their source code apart and two new programs emerge; one good and one evil. Will they be mankind&rsquo;s greatest strength or its destruction? Our fate is in their hands.&#10;&#10;Get with the Program is a deduction game with a unique blind team mechanic for 4 to 8 players. You take on the role of an artificially intelligent robot vying for the fate of humanity. At the beginning of the game all players will work together to secretly assign each other in to two teams. Good robots and evil robots. Because this is done in secret no one knows what team they are on. The good robots want stability by decrypting robots with pure code. The evil robots want to sow instability by installing corrupt code.&#10;&#10;Game play consists of two phases. During phase one players assign code cards to robot cards by placing code cards face down below robot cards. A robot&rsquo;s programming is complete when it has 3 code cards. These code cards determine which team that player is on. During phase two, players will be revealing code cards to discover which team the robots are on. As code cards are revealed they will score stability points. Two code cards of the same color will give one point to the blue team. If the code cards are different colors the Red team will score a point. Instead of a revealing a code card a player can place a tracking chip. If they are on the blue team they are trying to match a player to their robot card. Red players want robots to be guessed incorrectly. Play continues until one team has reached enough stability points to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

One to four players work together to try to keep Little Red Riding Hood safe from the Wolf, and get her to her grandmother's house. If the players can do this in under eight minutes, they win. If they run out of time, or connect LRRH to the Wolf by the paths, they lose.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to the Ravensburger game Labyrinth. A series of square cards are laid out, six between LRRH and Grandma's cottage. Two more rows of six are laid above and also below, making a grid of 30 squares. Some of the cards show a wolf, all of the cards have paths, turning and branching.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player takes one of the four remaining path cards, and inserts it into the grid from the edge of one of the four sides. This pushes all the path cards along, until the final one becomes open, and this goes into the player's hand for next turn. Players cannot insert a card on the line where LRRH or the cottage are sitting.&#10;&#10;After moving the grid, players check to see if LRRH has a clear path to a Wolf, and then a clear path to the cottage. If she is connected to a wolf, they lose. If she is connected to the cottage but not a wolf, they win. If they cannot get LRRH to the cottage before 8 minutes are up, they lose.&#10;&#10;Players can make the game harder by restricting the time available, or limiting the actual game turns, to 16 turns suggests the designer.&#10;&#10;The game was released at the Tokyo Game Market in May 2018 and early buyers were rewarded with a special set of stickers.&#10;&#10;",

The challenge is to be the one at the end of the hand and ultimately, the end of the game, who has racked up the highest score. Scoring in this game is calculated by db (decibels) as measured in car audio competitions as the SPL (sound pressure level) of your system.&#10;&#10;Suitable for children under 12 with adult assistance, and crazy fun for the whole family! Customize your fun by setting your own time, goal or scoring limits. Each Legend's card offers unique legendary abilities such as drawing 4 cards per turn instead of three, reducing the cost of buying class cards, or allowing you to fish cards from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of cards and can take a number of actions on their turn such as drawing cards from the draw deck and discard pile, buying a class card / legendary card to build on, buying a 2x amplifier card, building on a class, closing a class and ending a turn by discarding. As you move along in the game you add subwoofers and amplifiers to complete your system and close it out,gaining bonus points for each build you've completed. Once the draw deck runs out, players add up their points to see who is the champion.&#10;&#10;Created by car audio guru Donald Hebig (dBDon) and his wife Ferne (Nerfblat), the world's first and only car audio card game is a great way to share a love for car audio with family and friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Play every person for themselves, or divide into two even teams. To play cards into your/your team's bank that aren't already in play, you need to have a minimum of three of a kind or two with one wild card. Once a collection is started for a number in the bank, each player of your team that follows can add as many cards to the bank as they may have in their hand. For example, if your team could not yet collect queens because no one had laid any in the bank, and on your turn, you put three queens in the bank, the next player in your team to play, can add a single queen on top of that pile. Every card laid in your team's bank counts as points for your team, while every card remaining in your hand counts against your team at the end of the hand. The goal is to be the first team to get to 1600 points.&#10;&#10;What's your playing style? Do you hold on to those high scoring cards, never discarding them? Do you play with risky strategy, only banking three of a kind when you actually have five? Will you end the round and catch the other team with handfuls of cards to count against them? This game can get as crazy and entertaining as you make it.&#10;&#10;This deck of 162 cards (three unique and custom designed decks of 54 playing cards including Jokers) will allow play for 2-8 players. The instructive rule book is user friendly and easy to follow.&#10;&#10;As a bonus, you can split the cards into three standards playing decks to use playing your other favorite card games!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GROWL: 7 Sins + Undead is a double-expansion in one box, and the expansions may be played individually or combined with each other or other expansions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;7 SINS adds some light punishments and rewards to the game experience. It is recommended for 5-10 players.There are 7 sin cards and 7 virtue cards. After all players have been dealt their starting hands (but before preparing the Night cards), shuffle 5-7 cards into the deck. Then prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual. Cards with a [SPELLS] icon in the upper right are called &ldquo;spells&rdquo; and never go to a hand; instead, when drawn they are placed face-up in front of another player. Their effects are ongoing for that player &ndash; some good and some bad &ndash; and must be taken into consideration at all times, especially when checking for death or turning into a werewolf.&#10;&#10;Icons in the upper left of your [SPELLS] cards are considered part of your hand, and may negate (or be negated by) icons on cards in hand. In addition, some cards affect your neighbors to the left and right of you (skipping over any dead players)! There are virtue cards and sin cards; most of the virtues reward the virtuous players, and most of the sins punish the sinful.&#10;&#10;When drawing a sin or virtue on your turn, you must give the card to ANOTHER player (even if you yourself would have qualified to receive it if someone else had drawn the card). If the card has only white text, give it to the player of your choice, to place face-up in front of them.&#10;&#10;READING A JUDGMENT: The 7 Sins expansion cards contain two possible colors of text. The YELLOW TEXT is to be read aloud by the player who drew the card on their turn. (Just like in other aspects of the game, players must be honest when queried during a judgment. You may be asked, for example, about the total number of Gold icons you have, or the number of cards in your hand.) After giving the card to another player, they place it in front of them. The WHITE TEXT is the reward (or punishment!) that the player who received the card must accept. Most card effects are ongoing and permanent for the game (unless other cards move them, or move the players themselves). Once a sin or virtue card has been given to a player, they need to only reference the white text, plus any icons. It does NOT move positions, even if a new player would have otherwise qualified for it (for example, the player with Gluttony retains the spell, even if a different player later acquires the most cards).&#10;&#10;TIMING: Conflicting cards are resolved clockwise from the left of the Start Player (1). If a single player has conflicting cards, they may resolve them in the order they wish.&#10;&#10;UNDEAD adds a third faction which allows dead players to take unique turns instead of being eliminated.&#10;&#10;It is recommended for 5+ players. When playing with only 4 or 5 players: &#10;&bull; Remove the 2 Undead cards with the (6+) label in the lower left.&#10;&bull; Final Night cards that automatically would kill players instead only inflict a wound on them.&#10;&#10;SETUP: Determine in advance if you are playing with this expansion. Shuffle the Undead cards (they have a zombie on the back) and form a small face-down Undead Deck near the play area.&#10;&#10;When a player dies, they are no longer a human or a werewolf. They are now on the undead team, and can never win with the humans or the werewolves. The undead can&rsquo;t change teams or return back to life, even if they give their Wound cards away. Since Undead players are still considered dead, they do NOT take part in Night Phase or draw cards from the main deck. However, during player turns, undead players instead get a special turn. When killed during the game, announce you are undead, place a green &ldquo;I Died&rdquo; card on top of your home tile, and await your undead turn.&#10;&#10;UNDEAD TURN: Draw a card from the Undead Deck and read it privately. You have two choices: 1. Resolve any yellow text (and if the card is a spell card give it to a living player to be placed face-up as an ongoing effect for them). 2. If you don&rsquo;t like the card you drew, you may instead discard it and place any card from your hand face-up on top of the main deck for the next (living) player to draw. Then player turns (and undead turns) proceed as usual.&#10;&#10;The undead win the game at any time if there are only 2 (or fewer) players left alive. When they win, the undead should make moaning noises or yell &ldquo;...Brains....&rdquo; The player(s) whose death triggered the ending do not win with the rest of the Undead.&#10;&#10;If there are 3+ players still alive after you have resolved the Final Night, proceed to The Growl and determine the winning team (werewolves or humans) as usual.&#10;&#10;&copy;Joey Vigour&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Terre Pirates is set between the 17th and the 18th centuries, during the golden age of piracy. This era saw the birth of the most renowned captains, famous for their incredible feats. Here are gathered the pirates that made their marks on history: some were great fighters or great adventurers, others relied on cunning to reach their goals. Choose your captain and play with your very own deck of action cards to get the advantage. Manage your hand by drawing weapons, items, movement and cannon fire cards. The seas being full of dangers and opportunities, take advantage of the fair winds but beware of storms, the Royal Navy and the Kraken. What will be your strategy? Brutal, quick, opportunistic or crafty? Get the most treasures, and bring them back to the capital!&#10;&#10;In Terre Pirates, a card-driven game, each player embodies one of six famous pirates, such as Blackbeard, Anne Bonny and Bartholomew Roberts. Each pirate has his own deck of cards, leading to different strategies: while some are better at boarding ships, others are good navigators, or focus on stealing treasures from the others. On each turn, you will be able to play cards to move, fight or get treasures, and draw up to five cards from four different decks, depending on your current needs: navigation cards to move your ship, cannons to shoot your opponents, weapons to board ships, or items to get treasures. The first player to bring four treasures to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

Players can hide in shops and attempt to knock enemy pawns back to the start. A simple and tactical game for ages 8 and above.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;Players must compete to get their 4 pawns out of the maze-like Lanes. The first player to get 1 pawn out of each exit wins. Players roll dice to move a pawn each turn. If they land on a coffee shop they take another turn. If they land on an antique shop they can hide until its safe to come out. Players can also fast-travel the board through the use of sewers.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will accrue numbered coins which can protect them if another player lands on one of their pawns. If they hold a coin bearing the number rolled, they can send the opposing pawn back to the start.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ZomBN1 Sewage Panic is the second of Bedsit Games' bagged mini-games, designed to be quick to play, easy to set up and very portable. A co-operative game for 1-4 players, Sewage Panic takes place inside Brighton's sewer network while the action of the main game rages in the streets above. Survivors must fight, scavenge and craft their way through ever-increasing waves of zombies. Can they survive until sunrise? This fold-out A3 board comes with rulebook, plastic playing pieces, 60 cards and even a bonus game on the back. Limited to 250 copies.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;A co-operative game, players must work together to survive the zombie hordes. Players each get 2 actions per turn, which can be spent moving around the sewer base, fighting a zombie, scavenging for scraps, or crafting those scraps into survival tools.&#10;&#10;Each player has a coloured pawn, which means they can attack any like-coloured tiles (so a red pawn can attack red tiles and so on), so some tactical manoeuvring is required to make the best use of fighting, scavenging and crafting.&#10;&#10;Some turns, players will come across equipment which can be added to what they manage to craft. Other turns an unfortunate event will occur, which can see zombies gaining in number, or survivors being hindered.&#10;&#10;When all players have used their actions, all zombies on the board move one space towards the base, then more spawn depending on how many turns have been taken. The more turns, the more zombies will spawn.&#10;&#10;If a zombie reaches the base then the players have lost. If they make it through 20 turns then mop up any remaining zombies, then they have won.&#10;&#10;NB: If you have a copy of ZomBN1: A Board Game All About Brighton, then you can use the components from that game to replace the standard plastic pieces with this.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Friday Night Legends allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.&#10;Players act as the coach for the chosen team and make decisions as such. Both players select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them simultaneously. The players then look up results on their team sheet.&#10;&#10;The love of football and passion for football begins for many with high school football. Chris Doelle and Michael Wright encapsulated their passion for American high school football in their exciting vision of the sport in Friday Night Legends. Friday Night Legends (FNL) allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.  The core of the FNL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.&#10;&#10;The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your local gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them.  FNL elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets.  Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple game day pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. FNL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small &quot;Hoosier&quot; type size high schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of high school football.&#10;&#10;Although FNL started out as Texas High School Football, the game's fans started clamoring for teams of their local teams and FNL has started meeting that need.  The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their high school football team universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood Before Richmond is a series of games recreating some of the Seven Days Battles fought between George B. McClellan&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under its daring new commander, Robert E. Lee. McClellan squandered a numerical advantage by demonstrating what would become a characteristic knack for turning tactical victories into strategic failures. Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plans were hindered by subordinates who seemed incapable of carrying them out - chief among them, oddly, the usually exemplary Stonewall Jackson. If either side had  been up to snuff, the war might have been decided in Late June 1861. Tiny Battle Publishing is proud to present the conclusion to this series of quick-playing, medium-complexity games about these fascinating and overlooked battles of the American Civil War.&#10;&#10;A modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate Divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn&rsquo;t pull their weight historically are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It&rsquo;s a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties Lee had during the Seven Days, and it creates the frustrating and tantalizing possibility that Jackson could do something if he&rsquo;d only show up.&#10;&#10;Flipping a counter over when you take a hit doesn&rsquo;t capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire. The unique &ldquo;stack of steps&rdquo; system uses Step Counters stacked beneath the ID Counter to account for brutal attrition and devastating wipe-outs&#10;&#10;The fifth and final game in our series brings the last engagement of the Battles of the Seven Days to light, where having lost his chance to envelop the Army of the Potomac, Lee now faced an enemy firmly entrenched atop Malvern Hill.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;A whopping 176 action-ready counters.&#10;One beautiful 11x17 inch map.&#10;One gritty 12-page full-color grognard-friendly rule book.&#10;Zippered plastic bag perfectly designed to store your steps.&#10;Six sided dice, cutlasses, and Springfields not included.&#10;&#10;",

Curiously, the inception of this love triangle also marks the genesis of much paranormal activity in Sleepy Hollow. Tales of a mysterious &quot;Headless Horseman&quot; have rattled the community, and the whispers imply that he seeks to head off any engagement to Katrina,,, literally. The object of the game is to successfully marry Katrina to one of her suitors, or to thwart the impending marriage by reuniting the Horseman to his Head.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;Shuffle cards and deal 2-4 players one card each. After each turn player keeps only 1 card in-hand. During a turn, player draws a card and does one of the following:&#10;&#10;Makes no play and discards one of their two cards face-down in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Plays a Character Card by placing it in front of them. (Players are only allowed 2 Character Cards in front of them unless they have an Innkeeper played, see Special Situations.*)&#10;&#10;Plays a Townsfolk Card by reading it aloud and following the instructions.&#10;&#10;A player wins the round when they have Katrina and either Brom or Ichabod played in front of them, and the minister card is played (barring the subsequent play of the Bishop). Alternately, any player who holds both the Head and the Horseman in their hand may play them at any time for an instant win (barring the subsequent play of the Blacksmith). First Player to win 2 rounds wins Sleepy Hollow!&#10;&#10;",

Players bring customized strategies (Titans composed of systems, weapons, and crews; and buildings) to battle their opponents for local supremacy. Position and timing are crucial, as weapons charge, initiative changes hands, and the cease-fire deadline inches closer.&#10;&#10;Before the first round players draw cards for initiative, and can either set up by using a system of points, or by drafting their Titan's systems, weapons and crew out of the available cards. After set-up, the players add the weapon and crew cards to their decks of systems. Players can order these decks to their liking. Finally, players place their buildings and then their Titans on the board.&#10;&#10;During a round players take turns in order of highest initiative score to lowest. Each turn a player can either play cards from their hand; they can play ('activate') one card face-up as an action, and others face-down to charge it, or pass. Actions include moving, attacking, blocking attacks, generating shields, repairing the Titan, increasing a Titan's initiative score (and changing its player's position in the turn order), and using crew to operate weapons for bonuses. Players keep taking turns until they run out of cards or they all pass. When the round is over all played cards are discarded to the bottom of their Titan decks, and players draw more cards from the top of those decks.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 18 rounds, or until one player achieves a 10-point lead on their respective scores. Buildings determine the player's starting score. Players then score additional Victory Points by destroying parts of enemy Titans, and preserving their own Titan until the end of the game. Players need to manage all the parts of their titanic machines to turn them into smoothly running engines of victory.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game starts by drafting dragons and storms for your army (beginners can just deal the cards).  The game is played over a series of battle rounds. In a battle, you take turns in clockwise order. On your turn you can add a dragon to your dragon flight, add a storm to your storm front, challenge, or pass.  Both dragon and storm cards have instant effects when played.  Some cards have ongoing effects if the they are the top card in your dragon flight or storm front respectively.&#10;&#10;Each round is played either during the day or the night, as selected by the player who starts the round, but some dragon cards allow the player to change from day to night or vice versa.  Most cards have different combat strengths during day versus night and many cards have different abilities in the day or night, so control of the battle may switch back and forth. Play continues until all but one player has yielded. The last player in the battle round wins all of the cards played in the round and places them in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the most dragon cards in your victory pile at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The legend tells of a Dwarf wizard, Gandum, who created a powerful relic called the Mana Stone. It was created with the power to infuse magical energy into ordinary rock.&#10;&#10;The Dragon Lord Rizz, mad with greed, obsessed over the power of the Mana Stone. He lured Gandum into an ambush within Treasure Mountain. They fought for hours, but in the end, Rizz mortally wounded Gandum. To keep Rizz from controlling the power of the Mana Stone, Gandum cast himself and the Mana Stone into a subterranean abyss. Lord Rizz spent the rest of his life searching for the Mana Stone, but it was never found.&#10;&#10;That is, until a group of dwarven miners uncovered vast caverns filled with glowing crystals, infused with magic from the Mana Stone. Deep in the heart of Treasure Mountain, the miners had discovered the Caverns of Gandum, proving the legend true and unleashing the magic of the Mana Stone.&#10;&#10;The Cavern of Gandum introduces two exciting new elements to Treasure Mountain: spells and the automa deck.  It is recommended you become familiar with the base game before playing with this expansion.&#10;&#10;Spells allow you to bend the rules of the game while placing dwarves, collecting resources, and fighting dragons.  Spells are fueled with purple mana gems that are mined from new mine tile types or gathered in new spaces on the expansion board.&#10;The automa decks add solo and enhanced two player experiences using dummy players. Dummy player actions are controlled using the automa decks.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "RallyBird Baseball (also known as RallyByrd Baseball) is a 1-hour board game that Peter Gelman designed to emphasize quick turns, easy of play, yet meaningful baseball decisions for both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;Here's the general idea of play: Offense chooses a tactic from the set of At Bat cards and places it face down. Then Defense arranged the 6 Glove tiles in their zones on the board. Offense reveals the card, showing the tactic and what zone or zones it tests. Offense rolls 2 six-sided dice and compares the sum of the dice to the sum of the relevant Glove zones. The dice result is either less than, equal to, or more than the sum of the Glove zones. The players apply the At Bat card's  result to the batter and base runners.&#10;&#10;The game board is 18-inches square. The tiles, made of laser-cut pressboard, are 2-inches square. These tiles include Defense's Glove tiles, Inning tiles to keep time, and Run tiles for keeping score. The 17 At Bat cards are poker sized. There are 4 red and 4 blue large wooden meeple tokens, and 2 yellow Out tokens as well.&#10;&#10;The Rally Bird itself, also a tile, is a popular and recommended optional rule that gives the 9th inning underdog an extra chance... extra chances continue if the underdog succeeds, as long as they succeed. In baseball terms, it's a rally. If Home follows Visitor as a 9th inning underdog, both sides will have the opportunity to find inspiration in the birds who visit the field.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In a city under siege by the Corsair fleet, you must fight ship-to-ship, using every ounce of your newfound nautical prowess to gain the upper hand and defend the citizens of Dol Amroth.&#10;&#10;In the A Storm on Cobas Haven Nightmare Deck, the battle's difficulty is increased tenfold as the invaders fill their ranks with more vessels like the Ramming Ship and you have less time to prepare a defensive plan. First, this Nightmare Deck introduces two new objective cards, and when your troupe of adventurers chooses an objective during setup, you must choose randomly among the six Dol Amroth objectives. Will you find the Ships you need to confront the Corsairs, or will each new objective simply destroy your will to continue as you attempt to both accomplish these tasks and protect the city?&#10;&#10;Contains 20 cards to swap with specific cards from A Storm on Cobas Haven Adventure pack encounter deck to raise the difficulty of that scenario to nightmare difficulty.&#10;&#10;This is not a standalone product.

    "Description": "Marking the grand finale of the Dream-chaser cycle, The City of Corsairs Adventure Pack sends you to sea once more, charting a course for the lands of Umbar to retrieve your stolen artifact. But the relic has gifted your enemies with unnatural power, and they are not likely to surrender it willingly. Will you be able to defeat the Corsairs on their own land and end your quarrel with them for good, or will their increased strength prove too great an obstacle after the trials you have already endured?&#10;&#10;The City of Corsairs Adventure Pack features two separate encounter sets, one for the land and one for the sea. Now, should you reach the shores of Umbar, The City of Corsairs Nightmare Deck increases the peril of the second encounter deck by adding treacherous new locations like the Umbar Bridge and bringing the pride and ruthlessness of the Corsairs to the forefront with cards like Inspiring Fury.&#10;&#10;But by far the greatest enemy you will face in your quest is the very captain you have been chasing across the sea for the entirety of the Dream-chaser cycle. Should you dare to set foot on shore, you will come face to face with the dread Captain Sah&iacute;r, now empowered by the dark energy of The Cursed Sword. This Cursed Item rewards the Corsair for his thirst for blood, granting him resources when he deals excess damage. Defeating a man with such a powerful weapon may prove nearly impossible, but you are bound by honor to end Sah&iacute;r&rsquo;s reign and make the seas safe once more!&#10;&#10;Contains 20 cards to swap with specific cards from The City of Corsairs Adventure pack encounter deck to raise the difficulty of that scenario to nightmare difficulty.&#10;&#10;This is not a standalone product.

    "Description": "Konkvest is a chess-type board game specifically made to be played by two players. It is played on a hexagonal board with 142 tiles, as players alternate taking  their turns  to move  their pieces.  The tiles  are  distributed  in  13  rows,  the  middle  row  has  12  tiles  in  total  and  each subsequent row on the higher and the lower level has one tile less, ending with 6 tiles in the final rows. There are additional 28 tiles with specific use defined in the manual.&#10;&#10;The game is intended to serve as an official chess in the fantasy world of Atharon. After its conception, the game took on a life of its own and, rather than remaining just a footnote and a mere mention in the world of Atharon, it became a fully-realized project.&#10;&#10;Since its intention is to basically be Atharon chess, it's played similarly to the regular game of chess we all know. Players alternate turns moving their pieces across the board in accordance with the rules of movement. The rules of movement are too complicated to be described in text so they are explained in pictorial form in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;The main goal is to win the game by beating the opponent by toppling his Queen. Alternative ways include capturing the opponent's base by placing one's Queen on the specific tile the opponent's Queen started off, which is easier said than done. Another alternative way to win the game is to force the opponent's timer to expire.&#10;&#10;By standard a Konkvest game is timed using a 10 minute hourglass, which is balanced out at the start of the game so each player has 5 minutes at his disposal. Once set, the hourglass is laid horizontally. The player who makes the first move lifts the hourglass vertically and the time measurement begins. At that moment, the top chamber of the hourglass represents the time available to the second player. Once the second player makes his move, he flips the hourglass upside down so his chamber is at the bottom. Then it's the first player's turn again. The more one player spends on thinking, the less time he will have for future moves and the more time he will provide to his opponent, and vice versa. The player who's time runs out loses the game.&#10;&#10;During his turn, a player can do one of the following things:&#10;1.) He can move one of his pieces according to the rules of movement on a different tile. If that piece ends its move within that player's promotional zone and hasn't captured an opponent piece, the player can promote that piece. If that piece ends its move on a tile occupied by an opponent's piece, the player takes that piece and adds it into his reserve pool, effectively capturing it. The only piece that cannot be captured is the Queen, once she's toppled the game is over.&#10;2.) He can pick up one of his pieces from his reserve pool and return it on the board as an active piece, strictly within the territory he currently controls.&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, the player flips the hourglass and then it's his opponent's turn to do the same procedure.&#10;&#10;Konkvest is an abstract battle simulation, meaning all of its resources are limited. Players have a limited amount of pieces and a limited amount of movement, they have a limited amount of spots in their reserve pool and they have a limited amount of time to spend on making their move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket was designed as a quick set of tabletop wargame rules for skirmishes in the age of Black Powder. The rules can be learned within a couple of turns and still keep the flavor of the period.&#10;&#10;What separates Fistful of Lead from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved.&#10;&#10;For Fistful of Lead, we wanted the play to be fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair to it. For that reason, record keeping is kept to a bare minimum.&#10;&#10;In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 miniatures without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Now, you can try out different periods within the Horse and Musket era without spending a ton of money.&#10;&#10;Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game. It's perfect for convention games and just one on one skirmishes.&#10;&#10;To play Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket you&rsquo;ll need: this rule book (or, after a few games just the Quick Reference sheet), several 10-sided-dice, an ordinary deck of playing cards, a place to play, a measuring tape, and the miniatures representing your favorite troops. Markers to represent whether your models are Wounded or need to Reload can be found in this rule book.&#10;&#10;Eight-sided and 12-sided dice may also be needed for some of the advanced optional rules.&#10;&#10;Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket was written with 28mm figures in mind, but you can easily use models ranging from 15mm to 54mm without any changes.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Six Days of War begins with a Strategic Segment of card play and counter-play as each side adjusts its diplomatic standing and &ldquo;war footing&rdquo; and shifts unit positions on the map. This is a tense and fascinating game-within-a-game, where cards are played, rescinded, or &ldquo;trumped&rdquo; (at a cost) and Random Events can vary from nothing important to forced actions which perhaps neither player will like. Will the UN peacekeepers be kicked out? Will Jordan give up its neutrality? This stage of the game feels like newspaper headlines, but players can influence the &ldquo;news.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Eventually the war will break out and players will have to jockey for initiative and conduct combat operations as effectively as they can, all while knowing the UN could call for a cease-fire at any time.&#10;&#10;Six Days of War comes with counters representing Israeli and the various Arab states involved in the fighting, with a 22&quot; x 34&quot; color map divided into THREE distinctly different battlefield areas, covering the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and Galilee/Golan. Ground units are mostly brigades and regiments while air units (with extensive coverage of the many plane types) represent 24 to 36 planes. Each full game turn equals one day, with 10 turns as the maximum possible time.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a historically based scenario that makes for a faster beginning (with no preliminary card play) and serves as an excellent solo game. Also included is a scenario showing &ldquo;Ben Gurion&rsquo;s Nightmare,&rdquo; with a more subtle Arab diplomacy and a less attentive Israel meaning the starting positions are different in key ways. This represents an extreme challenge for the Israeli player. There are also optional rules which explore &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; events or can be used to balance play.&#10;&#10;Can you, as the Israeli commander, not only survive and defeat your opponents but create a better future for your country? Can you, as the Arab player, avoid the devastating pre-emptive strike and carve out a long-term victory against a powerful opponent?&#10;&#10;Can either player make these &ldquo;six days&rdquo; something that makes for a better future? The choices are yours, with Six Days of War.&#10;&#10;",

The teams each choose one their own to faceoff for the question. The host asks the question written on a card and the first member to respond may control the question if the response is top answer on the card. The other team gets one chance to give a higher rated response if the first team did not give the top rated response.&#10;&#10;Whichever team wins the faceoff gets to try to name all of the answers on the card with team member taking turns at guessing. If the team correctly guesses all the answers without getting three wrong guesses then that team wins the card. Failure to guess all of the answers gives the other team, as a group, one last guess as to what answer may be left unguessed. If this team is correct then it scores the card, if not the first team gets the card anyway.&#10;&#10;The first team to score five cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;Although not faithful to the television series on which it is based, players familiar with the television series can duplicate the game show using the material provided.&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to play your friends, making them share as much as humanly possible about their deepest darkest secrets. Players continue picking cards and fulfilling its actions until either the chain of cards is broken--which results in that player being kicked out of the game--or a Licktator takes a player out, immediately ending their Licktatorship. The last player remaining in the game, wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a lot of fun, has a lot of elements from traditional games such as spin the bottle, never have I ever, truth or dare and other games, and it has a lot of hilarious rules such as No Cursing, Hodor!, CPR, Eunuch, Premature Pants/Long Live the King and many more.&#10;&#10;The game is available in four languages (English, German, Spanish and Persian).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the basic game players choose to either play a stone normally or randomly draw and play a Joker Go card.  When you play a Joker card, you place the stones shown on the card onto the board in a spot of your choosing.  In the advanced variant you either play a stone normally, draw three Joker Go cards or play a Joker Go card.&#10;&#10;A Joker Go card can completely change the board state, making a lost group safe or killing an unkillable group.   The potential for multiple stones to suddenly appear on the board subverts player's conventional understanding of the game of Go.  It forces players to think about shapes in a new way.&#10;&#10;The basic game adds a very random element where you are challenged to make do with a random Joker Go card as best you can.  They are powerful, but the shapes you need may not be the shapes you draw.&#10;&#10;In the advanced variant you have some flexibility as you have a choice of cards you can play.  Having a hand of cards also gives you some strategic goals.  You can play in a way that will make your hand cards more valuable.  Your opponent has to worry that the &quot;odd&quot; moves you are making will set up a devastating Joker Go card down the line.&#10;&#10;",

To gather souls the gods play a game called AARU. Souls are won by winning tricks.&#10;&#10;The souls of the Pharaohs are the most sought after by the gods. To win a Pharaohs soul you must deduce the value of one hidden card you own! Every time a player plays a card that could have been the Pharaoh card the opponents shout AARU!&#10;&#10;AARU is a trick-taking deduction game for 2 to 4 players aged 8+. Each game takes 15 to 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;GAME OVERVIEW&#10;&#10;A game of AARU is played over 3 rounds and points are scored by winning tricks and by deducing and playing your Pharaoh card at the right time! Points can be lost if a Pharaoh is played incorrectly.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round the players are dealt a hand of cards. All players pick a Pharaoh for the opponent to their left and add it to the opponents hand facing away from them.&#10;&#10;In turn, players play a card from their hands with the highest value of the leading type played winning unless a Power card has beaten it. The twist is that in AARU whenever a player could have played their Pharaoh card (the one that faces away from them) the other Players say AARU to them to indicate they missed the chance of playing their Pharaoh. This way they can eventually deduce when is the best time to play their Pharaoh card for bonus points!&#10;&#10;Points are totaled for each of the three rounds with the winner being declared by having the most points at the end.&#10;&#10;",
