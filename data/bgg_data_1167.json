    "Description": "Kalabalik is a Bridget Jones-tier hot mess of a game that straddles the boundaries between card game, board game and party game, then does something funny in each of them. At its core, it's a short and extremely sweet trip round a playing area made up of cards, where you get ahead through your ability &ndash; and your willingness &ndash; to complete the challenge that your token lands on. Sounds straightforward, right? Haha.&#10;&#10;If you've ever been frustrated by your inability to remember the Presidents of the United States, but really like the idea of creating a recognizable melody by blowing raspberries on a willing collaborator's tummy, it's perfect for you. If you can fold a paper airplane that will go further than everyone else's, and stand up and chuck it with your shoelaces tied together, that's fine. If your knowledge of sitcom characters is better than your knowledge of what you do for a living, you need this game. By the end of it, someone else might be wearing your bra. That's just the way it is.&#10;&#10;Kalabalik is a Swedish word meaning &quot;uproar&quot; or &quot;hoo-ha&quot; and this game stemmed from an idea to create a board game where the rules are: there are no rules. Except rules help control the fun, don't they? So the few rules you'll have to follow are awkward ones. They're joined by a lot of different challenges, refreshed constantly as the game progresses, that are the either the kinds of things you don't really want to do in polite company, or the kinds of things you've been waiting for an excuse to do in polite company. Throw in a bunch of questions that make you think &quot;how the f... oh actually I do know that lol,&quot; and a few confessions for good measure. (You don't actually have to do any of them, of course. This is the 21st century. But if you don't, you're probably going to lose.)&#10;&#10;What emerges is the lovingly-designed equivalent of that one party you went to in your youth that everyone still talks about, for all the right reasons, twenty years later. What's more, the amount of time it takes to set up, learn and play is far shorter than the intense period of soul-searching you'll get when you sit bolt upright in bed in 3am, drenched in cold sweat, having remembered that you won by texting the word &quot;MILF&quot; to your boss.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spell and steel clash for fame and freedom! Battle your friends to be the last one standing!&#10;&#10;Welcome to Arena: Grand Champions, a turn-based strategy brawler that can be played by up to four people. Become one of four different gladiators, each with unique abilities and play styles, and fight against both your friends and the challenges of the Arena to be the last one standing and become the next Grand Champion.&#10;&#10;Game-play&#10;Once the players have chosen their Gladiator and their starting point, the contest begins! How the game plays out largely depends on the choices of each player. Players will make alliances, betray trusts, run, fight, and die for the glory of the arena! If a round passes without any violence to satiate the crowd the crowd will demand blood! To keep the people happy, cheering, and gambling, the arena master can activate various traps and unleash vicious beasts to keep the contenders on their toes. Each gladiator has specific maneuvers and actions that make them uniquely dangerous. Will you pick off some goblins from a distance with the Assassin, bend the minds of your foes with the Enchantress, deflect incoming attacks with the Soldier, or charge head first into a Minotaur with the raging Barbarian? No matter what happens, you must do whatever it takes to be the last one standing and win it all!&#10;&#10;How-To-Play&#10;The players will all pick their gladiator of choice and place them in a starting area. Each gladiator has a set of free abilities including movement, defense, recovery, and basic attacks. In addition, each gladiator has 3-4 special &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; they can perform at the cost of maneuver points and a short cool-down. Every turn, a gladiator can take up to two basic actions or a basic action and a Maneuver. Game-play begins with just the gladiators going up against each other in turn-based combat. Play continues in a circle until a full round goes by and no player takes damage. At this point, a random event card is activated that can activate traps, summon monsters, or drop potions on the field. These events can greatly alter the field of play and players must adapt their play style to survive or finish off their opponents. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing on the arena floor. A big game-play mechanic in the game is the freedom of the players to make their own choices as to how to succeed. Players can team up with each other to tackle a bigger threat, stay on the move to avoid damage, betray the same allies they made earlier, and much more.&#10;&#10;Arcade Mode&#10;Challenge yourself with a single player game mode where you face down every threat in the game from goblins to spike traps to other gladiators (and sometimes a combination). Test your endurance with each round being more difficult than the last and make choices along the way that could help or hurt you in this challenging twist on the traditional game-play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ogres are natural Blood Bowl players, with a long tradition of playing for other teams who can afford to feed them (woe betide the coach who fails to account for their appetite). Ogre teams, however, bring a new level of violence to the game, as their rosters feature not just one or two of these massive brutes, but often 4 of them! Of course, they're also accompanied by a veritable swarm of Gnoblars, tiny greenskin runts who have no natural athletic ability, but enough cunning and wit to know they're supposed to grab the ball from time to time whilst the Ogres are busy pummeling their opponents. Once in a while, the Ogres will give the ball-holders a little kick towards the End Zone, thus scoring some points with a bit of luck.&#10;&#10;If you want to play some smashy Blood Bowl, you can do no better than an Ogre team. They play unlike anything else, excelling at deleting the opposing team, one by one, until they can walk the ball across the pitch unopposed. You&rsquo;ll focus on hiring a handful of Ogres, and the utterly replaceable gnoblars fill out the rest of your slots. Ogres are a blast to play, and a nightmare to go up against.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you'll need to build the Fire Mountain Gut Busters, an Ogre team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 4 Ogres (1 of which can be built as a Runt Punter), and 12 Gnoblars with interchangeable heads! You'll also find a roster sheet, transfers, 2 turn counters and 2 coins, 4 Ogre-themed balls, and a mix of 14x 25mm bases and 4x 32mm bases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oom-Pah is a competitive speed game that combines Klondike Solitaire style columns, with snap style 'first in best dressed', with music theory.&#10;&#10;You get a deck of cards with notes on them. You put four of them in front of you, as your 'Arrange Columns'. You put aside 8 of them as your 'Score Stack'. Finally, the remainder are placed next to your columns as your 'Impro Stack'. You draw from your Impro Stack in groups of 3 cards like Draw 3 in Klondike Solitaire. When there is a card in your Impro Stack or Score Stack that is the card under one of the ones on the top of your columns (like E is to F), then you can place the card there. Alternatively, if one of your cards in your Arrange Columns, Score Stack or Impro Stack is the next note in the Chord/Interval/Progression/Scale that you're playing with in the joint Compose Stacks, (like C is to A if you were playing Am (A-C-E)), then you can place it in the Compose Stack. It is not turn based - you work as quickly as you can, meaning that the faster player can place their card before the other. When a player empties their score stack, they yell 'Oom-Pah!' and get 10 points. Then each player gets points per the amount of cards that they played to the Score stack.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 10 templates which have on them musical theory bits like Scales, Intervals and Chords. You can choose from any of them to play with, depending on the level of difficulty required, or what the players are trying to reinforce. So, for instance, you could play G Major, and require that players build G-A-B-C-D-E-F# in the score stack.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with beginner, intermediate and expert rules which allow tailoring the experience.&#10;&#10;From the publisher&#10;Oom-Pah! For music nerds &amp; legends&hellip; or those who wanna be! An addictive, fast-paced, brainfrying music theory card game that cleverly sneaks music knowledge into your brain!  &#10;For 1-4 players, think classic card games like Speed/Spit (if challenging friends), or Patience/Solitaire (if playing solo), but instead you build musical sequences! &#10;Oom-Pah!'s unique colour-coded learning tools help you understand music concepts systematically. So whether you're an absolute beginner or musical maestro, you can compete at a level playing field. &#10;With over 1,700 different game options to choose from you&rsquo;ll always be engaged, entertained, &amp; highly entertained! Other than making you really smart and an awesome musician, the best thing about playing this game is the thrill of shouting &ldquo;Oom-Pah!&rdquo; when you win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To win, one must be cunning and calculating.&#10;&#10;This step-toothed figurine is designed to be aligned, so that the artwork matches up. Players take turns assembling at their choosing and then take turns at moving the head or the body. As both pieces have different cog notches they can only align on special numerical combinations. The seemingly straight forward nature becomes abundant, without seeing the paths to alignment an infinite game is possible!&#10;&#10;The countenance bares resemblance to the prehistoric so-called Venus figurines, or could also be compared to Inca gold. Combined with authentic visage and mechanic rotatability Tressa has landed in the forefront of 21st century design! The etched tittering statuette is ultimately a tactile object: sits twisting ergonomically in the hand, mischievously perches on the desk, laughing about something no-one will ever know. Interestingly the form fits in the golden ratio - the height measuring approximately 1.618 of the width. The parts equally ascend in escalating measurements furthering this mathematic harmony.&#10;&#10;The game has 3 steps to the head and 5 to the body. At any moment a player can call &quot;Tressa&quot; and change the lower direction, and the other player calling &quot;Pympes&quot; and changing the upper rotation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As the Avatar, it is your duty to serve the reigning Lord of Britannia. It is your passion to strive for mastery of each of the eight virtues. It is your quest to tame the dungeons, each representing its own sin.&#10;&#10;The game consists of rounds, each round the player will do the following action items until the end game goals are reached.&#10; Roll four 8-sided die, and three 6-sided die [4D8 + 3D6] then: &#10;&#10;     Assign one D8 dice value to the list of CITIES. The number rolled represents the city which has called for aid. For example: if you assign a six,  Lord British has called for you to assist the city of Skara Brae. &#10;     Next, assign each of the three categories, THE TASK, THE VIRTUE, and, THE DUNGEON one of the remaining D8 values. For example: if you rolled a 2 and two 6s, you could assign the 2 to THE TASK, and each of the 6s to THE VIRTUE and THE DUNGEON. This would mean that the Avatar is to complete the task of Deliver a Message, meditate in the virtue of Honor, and battle in the dungeon of Shame. If the dice results do not allow for further progress, simply assign a dice to an already completed option and do not record any outcomes. &#10;     To settle the task, refer to THE TASK and TASK RESULT tables, assign one of the D6 values to the result and record the outcome on the play sheet. When a task is successfully completed, the Avatar gains favor with the city from which the task was given. Fill in one square for that city on the map portion of the play sheet to track the progress. If the task is failed nothing is recorded. When all four squares are full the city will offer the Avatar a gift which will provide advantages for the rest of the play, these advantages DO stack. It is not required to complete one of each task. &#10;     To settle the virtue, the Avatar simply meditates and gains one point in that virtue. Record the added virtue on the play sheet by filling in a single square next to that virtue on the right side. When all squares are filled, the virtue has been mastered. &#10;     To settle the dungeon, refer to THE DUNGEON and DUNGEON BATTLE tables. Dungeon battles will increase in difficulty as they progress; the last stage of the dungeon is the boss. When a dungeon battle is won, fill in a square next to the associated dungeon to show progress. If the battle is lost, no progress is recorded. The dungeon is considered cleared when the final square is filled in. Refer to the Combat section. &#10;     A second D6 value is assigned to a randomizer, refer to the RANDOMIZER table. &#10;     The third D6 is usually a wildcard but may be used as a task additional result assignment.&#10;&#10;&#10;Fame and Karma are awarded or taken away depending on the results of THE TASK and THE DUNGEON. As the Avatar increases their Fame, they can use it to increase their power. For every 5,000 points of fame obtained, the Avatar can advance one stat to the next value shown. Refer to the Avatar section for more information. Karma can be traded for combat re-rolls or temporary bonuses, see Karma Allocation. Track the Fame and Karma in the allocated space on the play sheet paperdoll. Karma can be negative, but it does not affect the Avatar.&#10;&#10;After all records have been kept and any combat is resolved, start the next round of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CasTiles and Armies is meant to be a fast-paced tile-based Castle and Siege strategy game for 2 players. Players will build a castle wall, reinforce it as needed, and attempt to defeat the enemy Monarch with their troops.&#10;&#10;CasTiles and Armies consists of 2 phases. The Construction Phase and the Combat Phase.&#10;&#10;The Construction Phase:&#10;Starting with Player #1, the players will take turns placing castle tiles (dark grey) to construct their Castle Wall until it is 5-tiles wide. After placing a tile, the player may choose to discard one tile, placing it in a Rubble Heap, and then draw back up to 5 tiles in their hand. The Rubble Heap is a separate mass of tiles which can no longer be brought back into the game.&#10;&#10;After the 5th tile is placed, 2 more tiles (a total of 6 additional tiles after the Gatehouse) may be placed in the Army Reserves Zone and/or the Offensive Line Zone. Be considerate of the numbers on the tiles during placement, the numbers all mean something! Once the castle is fully constructed, the final step in this phase is to calculate the strength of the wall. The Gatehouse icons count as wild cards and will conform to the number placed adjacent. We recommend placing dice at each of the 4 wall junctions with values that represent their strength. Dice make it easier to track damage on the castle wall. You will likely need a range of dice from D4s to D20s.&#10;&#10;Tile placement is a key consideration! Your strategy during this phase of the game will determine your success as a defender or conquer. Tiles must be placed so they read left to right or top-facing-right (from the player&rsquo;s perspective). See the possible scenarios below to determine how to calculate the strength. The higher the number, the stronger the wall. Once a tile is down it is down.&#10;&#10;The Combat Phase:&#10;With the castle wall now complete and total strength calculated and marked on the playing field, it is now time to start combat!&#10;&#10;Each player should still have 5 tiles in their hand. At this time, ALL army tiles (gold-ish) in their hand can be placed in either the Army Reserves Zone or Offensive Line Zone, starting with Player #1. Hopefully, you didn&rsquo;t discard them all during the last phase. Then discard or draw tiles as needed to keep only 3 tiles in your hand. Like the wall junctions, place a die on the arrow side of the army tile to indicate the strength of the army.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yatzy is one of the best-known and most popular dice games there is. Langland Yatzy allows kids to join the fun even if they cannot count yet, because here players use picture dice and try to roll long animals in order to score: Three of the nine dice each show heads, three dice show waists, and three dice show tails. As usual in Yatzy, players roll up to three times and can set aside or re-roll dice as they see fit in order to score the required combinations. And while players usually compete with each other, Langland Yatzy also offers a team variant.&#10;&#10;Langland Yatzy is an easier accessible variant on the popular dice game that gets rid of the dice pips and replaces them with the cute, long animals from Langland. Players neither need to know numbers nor are they on their own, if they prefer to play the team variant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Historically, 78s and 33s were competing formats and available to purchase in the record store. In BB, players will focus on collecting albums from two genres -- Swing and Jazz. Players will acquire albums in two different speeds from up to 8 different band leaders. With respect to speeds, there are benefits in collecting 78s since they are worth slightly more than the 33s. However, the 33s offer collection powers to entice players to collect them instead. Furthermore, the rules for collecting albums are stripped down to just matching the genres. However, players must visit the front counter in order to earn collection rewards. To turn in a collection, the player must represent each of the four instruments in one genre. Depending on how many matches there are in the attributes will dictate what type of collection reward they will earn. Play continues until all the albums have been placed into the store. The player with the most points, in the end, is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Place a tile on the board and use maneuvers to make as many matches of the target symbol as you can. You have 5 maneuvers per turn, in which you can rotate, slide, or swap tiles that are Active, meaning ones that have the same color adjacent sides touching. Think carefully about each maneuver though, because any Active Tiles left at the end of your turn will be worth negative points! Play it too safe, and you won&rsquo;t make enough matches to score big points. Play it too risky, and you might end up losing more points in the process! The player that can think outside the box and attach the most matches will sweep the competition and win this easy to learn, hard to master puzzle game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
