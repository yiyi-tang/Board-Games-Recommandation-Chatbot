When one player completes five Sets, he calls MahJong and wins the Round immediately. He then uses the one card from each Set to calculate the score point.

Each player may swap any card (except Hades) for the face-up card or give any card they like &quot;including Hades) to the player on their left, taking a card in return. The aim is to make a set of four cards: Zeus, Hera, Artemis, Apollo; Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes; or Athena, Poseidon, Demeter, Dionysus.

WINNER TAKES ALL!&quot;&#10;&#10;Players move round by throwing four coins and progressing as many squares as they throw heads. If a player throws four heads, he moves forward four spaces and has another turn; if he throws four tails, he throws again. When a player lands on a + square, he collects money from the bank; equally, when he lands on a minus square, he pays the bank.&#10;&#10;The aim is to be the last solvent player. In order to achieve this, players try to eliminate the competition. Risk cards encourage players to pick on each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pond Hockey is an abstract, highly tactical game for 2 players that simulates an informal hockey match played by two teams of 6 players on a frozen pond.&#10;&#10;Each player acts as a coach for one of the two hockey teams.  Both coaches have a draw deck of 10 cards. A card drawn from the top of the deck at the beginning of a turn, determines the number of movements points the coach will have available to move one or more players and/or to move the puck (be it by passing or by shooting the puck on goal). After the draw deck has been exhausted, the drawn cards are shuffled to form a new one. The match ends after the draw deck has been exhausted for the third time; so, after 30 &quot;minutes&quot; or 3 &quot;periods&quot; of play. The coach whose team has scored the most goals wins the game. If the scores are tied, the game can go into &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime, where the first team to score a goal will win the game.&#10;&#10;The game's movement system was inspired by Corn&eacute; van Moorsel's StreetSoccer but adapted to handle the difference in how a soccer ball can travel versus how a hockey puck can travel: more than one player can be moved on a turn; players can move with and retain possession of the puck; the puck travels in a straight line and it may only change direction if it comes into possession of another player who moves with it or passes it again or if it is deflected off the boards bordering the ice surface. The game also adds rules to permit poke-checking, body-checking, and assessing penalties.&#10;&#10;",

With modern tanks from Czechoslovakia and modern artillery and planes from Italy, South America's first unit of paratroopers and a battalion of marines, Peru unleashed its blitzkrieg in July 1941. The war lasted for seven weeks, ending with a crushing Peruvian victory as Ecuador was forced to hand over half of the territory claimed by the Quito government.&#10;&#10;War on the Equator is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier system based on the battles waged between Peru and Ecuador in 1941. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin. There are six scenarios, each based on an actual battle and featuring tank assaults, parachute landings, amphibious assaults, horsed cavalry and river gunboat operations.&#10;&#10;War on the Equator is sold exclusively via PDF download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

During the game each player (or team-member when playing with 4) throw food at each other, trying to gain the least food cards in front of them (&quot;on them&quot; in theme).&#10;&#10;The game consists of 3 rounds. Each round begins with setting up the cafeteria table (2 stacks of cards to draft from). Each player in turn order chooses to one of three things: take 1 card, swap a card, throw food.&#10;&#10;Each option will result in adding cards to your hand or giving them to your opponent(s). At the end of the last round all players add up how many types of food they have on them. The player with the least amount is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in the &quot;Fuzzy Heroes&quot; world of FrolicHaven and pits Fuzzy Heroes vs Renegade teams for control of a folded paper football here called a Fuzzball.&#10;&#10;Published by Inner City Games Design - Sports Fuzz! uses a variant of the Fuzzy Heroes miniatures combat system which stats the players based on toy size, colour and other factors and tosses in a fairly elaborate rules set for Football as played by toys. The game is not though compatible with the other Fuzzy Heroes games. The playing field can be a large table, a bed or better yet the floor. The triangular paper Fuzzball is flicked across the playing field by the team &quot;Coach&quot;.&#10;&#10;",
