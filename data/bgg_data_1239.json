    "Description": "The Curse is growing stronger. The terrifying effects are noticeable by all. The Crown Prince has sent out a call for help and you are a commoner looking for adventure. You are one of few who become a &ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo;...those who decide to answer the call.&#10;&#10;The goal sounds simple enough: Make your way to Oakhaven Castle to meet the Crown Prince and hear his request. He believes there are ancient scrolls that uphold the Curse and by finding the scrolls, they can be destroyed and end the Curse once and for all. However, the last six ancient scrolls are guarded by Dark Guardians, ancient creatures transformed by the Curse to protect the scrolls. No one has been successful in retrieving these last six scrolls.&#10;&#10;As you journey through Oakhaven you will meet others and learn details that help you learn of Oakhaven's history, the Curse and ultimately reach a conclusion about what is really happening within the kingdom. The paths you choose will bring you to the final chapter where one last decision will change you and the kingdom forever.&#10;&#10;Dispel The Darkness is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players. Yes! You can play this solo! A cooperative, light-weight RPG, card drafting, dice rolling experience, with an end-game twist that will leave you speechless. This gateway RPG will introduce non-gamers to the fun, dungeon-crawling experience with a story to keep everyone riveted until the end. With high player interaction, downtime is nonexistent.&#10;&#10;As players progress through the story making choices presented by the 70+ page Story books, they gain XP by drawing cubes. XP is then used to purchase items and skills to level-up and protect themselves from the inevitable confrontation with the Dark Guardians. Drawing too many red Threat cubes will initiate a Threat Event, so be prepared to battle each time you level up!&#10;&#10;Story Battles introduced throughout the game will challenge players to strategic fights that aren't often found in most dungeon-crawling board games. Through Dispel the Darkness' serpentine battle system, characters must be well-balanced and thoughtful about how they approach each battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They can hold one weapon at a time apart from the ultimate weapon, bow and arrow which the player can hold both.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a Goblin card they battle it by throwing the dice and adding the number on the weapon card. Better the weapon, the bigger the number. The Goblin has a score of five, so the player throws the dice for the Goblin and adds five to the number on the dice. If they score more than the Goblin, they steal the Gold.&#10;&#10;The battling begins each time a battle card is turned over, and the player chooses someone to battle using the dice. The highest score wins, with weapons, shields and injury cards taken into account.  The winner can steal the Gold plus swap weapons and steal a shield. Shields reduce the opponents score in a battle by one. If a player falls down a hole or loses a battle they hold an injury card, which can be healed by drawing a Hospital card. If during the game the holder of the Gold card turns over a Home card they win.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On October 6, 1973, the Arab forces of Syria and Egypt attacked Israel.  The attack took place on the most holy of days for Jews in an attempt to catch the Israelis as unprepared as possible.  At first, it was a massive success.  Syrian forces marched through the weak and scattered forces in the Golan Heights while Egyptian forces easily crossed the great Suez Canal and set up a strong defensive line along the east bank of the Canal and, under their strong umbrella of Surface-to-Air missile support, awaited the inevitable Israeli counterattack.  And counterattack the Israelis did &ndash; only to be shocked at the effectiveness of new Soviet weapons and surprising Arab resolve.&#10;&#10;The battle would take unexpected turns as the Israelis finally found answers to the new technology of the Arab army and fought off the challenge &ndash; even attacking into Syria and Egypt in the final stages of the battle.&#10;&#10;But both sides could claim victory in this war.  The Israelis were still king of the battlefield, but their throne was more uneasy than ever before.  The Arabs proved they could defeat the Israelis in open battle and now were a force to be recognized and respected.  The war had changed everything in the region.&#10;&#10;A Test of Faith is a new game in the Operational Scale Series using the new added rules from the Doomsday Project to show this war in a way that has not been seen before.  Highly playable but with an emphasis on command and equipment, OSS uses an impulse system to create a test and challenging game to play, but also with new research, plenty of historical narrative.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 7 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 day per turn&#10;Unit Scale: Battalions/Regiments&#10;Scenarios: 7&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Three Maps at 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; &ndash; one for the fight in the Golan Heights and two for the fight in the Sinai&#10;Five 5/8ths inch Countersheets&#10;Six Player Aids and Charts&#10;One Rulebook&#10;Two Six-sided dice and two ten-sided dice&#10;One Box and lid&#10;&#10;Designer: Adam Starkweather&#10;Graphic Designer: Nadir Elfarra&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Panzerkrieg, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of a true wargaming classic by John Prados, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. John Prados introduces some discrete but friendly changes to the system to improve his classic design covering operational warfare in Southern Russia during WWII.&#10;&#10;Panzerkrieg is an operational level simulation of the various Axis and Soviet campaigns in southern Russia during the period 1941-1944. &#10;The game is played on a map depicting southern Russia from its western border with Rumania and Poland in the west to the Caucasus mountains in the east. &#10;These operations, more than any others, display the large forces and vast distances that characterized the protracted warfare between the industrial giants Germany and the Soviet Union. The simulation presents ten scenarios (including one learning scenario), each modeling a different period of the war. Each scenario is played as a separate game and all scenarios use the same rules and components.&#10;&#10;The game is an examination of the battles which shaped the campaign and is based upon evaluation of the combat forces, the leaders, the logistical limitations, and the terrain over which the antagonists struggled. &#10;Panzerkrieg has been designed primarily as a two-player game, with one player commanding the Axis forces and the other the Soviets. It is well-suited for solitaire play, however. When played solitaire the competitive value of the game will be missed, but its value as an historical tool will be undiminished.&#10;&#10;Some of the game rules include armor superiority, breakthrough and exploitation, leaders, supply, fortifications, bridgeheads, special units, combat reserves, rail and naval movement, air power, and Axis satellites. The game consists of ten separate scenarios, each depicting an important operation, along with the learning scenario.&#10;&#10;Rather than being a simple retread with nicer components, this new edition incorporates additional markers and introduces limited intelligence and fog of war, suitable for two players, along with other changes and enhancements to the system that are fully detailed in the Designer's Notes. Enhancements have been made pertaining to the combat system, air bombardment, effects of leaders, changes to &quot;stalemate&quot; combat result, changes to anti-tank units to more properly reflect the tactical doctrine, altered Battlegroup/Replacement rules, changes to Exploitation Segment, and more. As fully noted by the designer, these are all key enhancements to improve the historicity and play experience of this classic design.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;     Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;     Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&#10;     Time Scale: one week per turn&#10;     Map Scale: 14 miles per hex&#10;     Unit Scale: divisions and corps&#10;     Players: one to two, best with two&#10;     Playing Time: 2-5 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The definitions of a range of weapons were based on historical sources and serious publications. Likewise, the rules for combat formations and the historical characteristics of each army were also the target of research in specialized bibliography on the subject.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Fall of Tobruk: Rommel's Greatest Victory is a recreation of the Axis attack on the heavily fortified Gazala-Bir Hakeim line in May-June 1942. &#10;Participating in the attack were three corps of Italian troops and the vaunted Deutsches Afrika Korps, all under the operational command of General Erwin Rommel. &#10;Opposing the Axis forces were two corps of the Eighth Army, manned by a polyglot Allied force made up of British, South African, and Indian troops, along with a force of Free French troops, all under the command of General Neil Ritchie. &#10;The battle was pivotal in the Western Desert campaigns that had see-sawed back and forth across Cyrenaica since the winter of 1940. The battle has been described as Rommel's greatest victory, leading to the Axis capture of Tobruk, the British abandonment of Libya, and subsequent retreat to El Alamein.&#10;&#10;Players represent the two army commanders, Rommel and Ritchie, maneuvering the various brigades and regiments under their command in order to control the vital port of Tobruk and defeat the enemy forces while still preserving his own army as a force in being.&#10;&#10;This is complete revision of the Conflict Games edition designed by Frank Chadwick and first published in 1975 &mdash; consider this a completely NEW game and not a reprint of a previous edition. This new game features extensively researched and revised orders of battle, conversion to a d10 resolution method, all-new weather rules, all-new air rules showing the army-air force coordination that was being perfected by both sides, an all-new map at half of the original game's ground scale (1.5 mi/hex vs 3 mi/hex), and a switch from an Igo-Yugo to a chit-pull formation activation mechanism. But the most exciting change is a dynamic Operations Phase wherein players can decide exactly when and with which units they want to move, fight, barrage, or call in an air strike. No fixed Movement Phase, Combat Phase, Indirect Fire Phase, or Air Strike Phase...it's up to players how they want to construct their own turns. Neatly reflects the chaos of desert warfare in North Africa.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 7 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: 1 day per turn (two operations phases per day)&#10;    Map Scale: 1.5 miles per hex&#10;    Unit Scale: battalions and companies&#10;    Players: two (playable solitaire)&#10;    Playing Time: 8 to 10 hours&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players do that by drawing a card and performing one of five actions on their turn.&#10;&#10;The five actions are:&#10;Play (face up):&#10;1. Location&#10;2. Couple: &#10;1 Lady + 1 Gentleman of equal or lesser value to your locations&#10;With a Church - they Marry and can attempt High Romance&#10;Without a Church - they Elope and discard the lady and can attempt High Romance&#10;3. Gentleman: Steals a tabled location of the same value.&#10;4. Lady: Steals a tabled Gentleman of lower value and his location. Must immediately Elope or Marry&#10;Steal:&#10;5. Steal: Take a Person Card from opponent's hand&#10;&#10;There are also two free actions you may perform:&#10;6. Meddling Aunt: cancels Gentleman, Lady, Steal, or Meddling Aunt played by another player. The card played by the other player as well as the meddling aunt is then discarded.&#10;7. High Romance: Play a matching negative on an attempted High Romance card to make that player discard the couple and the points they would've gained.&#10;&#10;When a player marries or elopes they may High Romance the couple as said above. Each High Romance card doubles the points gained from the couple and previous High Romance cards. So if you have a couple with a value of ten and they High Romance, their points would go to twenty. If you doubled it again it would go to forty. Whenever you play a High Romance card everyone on the table has the opportunity to play the corresponding negative from their hand. If someone does this your High Romance has been sabotaged with dire consequences, and all of your points are gone!&#10;&#10;Collect Locations / Pair off for Points / Sabotage your Rivals in To Marry For Love!&#10;&#10;-Description from Publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fightdrome: Panama Rose is a fast-paced combat card game based off of the 2002 cyberpunk Altered Carbon novels by Richard K. Morgan.&#10;&#10;This game places gamers at the heart of the infamous Panama Rose combat arena, with Panama Rose being the first in a planned series of Fightdromes. Players take on the role of competitors who fight it out to determine which of them is superior. Before starting a game, players agree how to be declared winner: by playing until one player is out of cards, or by being the first player to reach an agreed number of &quot;fame&quot; points. Each round is referred to as a bout, and playing for &quot;fame&quot; points involves a series of bouts.&#10;&#10;Each player has their fighter's digital consciousness (known as a stack) placed in an engineered or augmented body (known as a sleeve) for each bout. Your card deck will be customized depending on which combination of stack and sleeve you are using. Competitors must then kick, punch, and grapple their way to the top, attempting to outwit their opponent, place killing blows, and become the champion of the Fightdrome.&#10;&#10;",

Two are used to form two numbers, which fill in spaces on ships to build them, although the numbers must ultimately fit in ascending order. The unused die is then used to build academies or fuel stations to produce more supplies to get the ships running. Smaller ships are finished faster, but need more supplies, while larger ships are worth many more points but need a lot of turns to get going. Once one player builds three of their five ships, the game ends, and players score based on their completed ships, incomplete ships, and surplus supplies.&#10;&#10;As a roll-and-write, players will use the same dice as part of their turn, but each player will take different paths to victory.&#10;&#10;This game was the winner of the 2020 Design Machine contest under the theme 'social distancing'.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Great War: Tank Battles is a table-top game from Exile Into Imagination that combines strategy with history to make a compelling game based on the armored cavalry of the first World War!&#10;&#10;TANKS! First introduced on the field during World War I in the Battle of the Somme, these engines of extermination changed warfare forever. 1916, 1917, and 1918 saw many of these juggernauts introduced. During the War to End All Wars there were 16 different types of tanks created by the Allies and the Central Powers that made it onto the battlefield. The Great War: Tank Battles basic set includes each and every one of those behemoths! &#10;Game play is FAST and EASY to learn! Set-up takes mere minutes. Game play usually takes less than an hour, but the players can adjust the game to last far shorter or far longer depending on time constraints. Since only basic reading and math are required, the game is suited for ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;Thoroughly analyzed and using equations based on armor plating, speed, and destructive capabilities, Damage Points determine what it takes to bring one of these monsters down and Value Points dictate scores at the end of the game.  The basic set comes with 54 tank cards with distribution reflective of the actual numbers of each type of tank employed in battle.&#10;&#10;Players utilize their Action Cards to fire weapons at the formations of their opponents, send in Air Strikes and Infantry Attacks, plant Mine Fields against their enemies, repair their tanks with Damage Control, use Evasive Maneuvers to avoid incoming fire, protect themselves from above with Air Cover, and even Retreat from battle entirely. When the going gets rough, players can also use Additional Tank cards to strengthen their formation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you draw a Monster or a trap, resolve combat. &#10;     Discard: you may not hold more than five cards in your hand by the end of your turn. &#10;&#10;&#10;Players take damage to their Character from battling Monsters or by encountering traps. Playing cards allows you to buff up for battle, avoid dangerous situations, or heal lost health.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing cards and fighting Monsters, while strategizing for best advantage. The last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It features a random setup of twenty one companies that have four different kinds of licenses, and appear in different orders through the game. Additionally, it has both major company and minor company scenarios, as well as differing starting cash values that create major differences in play styles.&#10;&#10;Major and minor companies get pooled board actions to determine tile and station placements and upgrades.  All track tiles are unlimited.  Major companies may place up to twelve stations which can also be acquired from bankrupt companies via auction.&#10;&#10;In the historical game, French major companies receive extra track actions, Germanic major companies (based in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium) receive industry markers that increase the value of one Germanic city, and Southeastern major companies (based in Italy, Austria Hungary, and Switzerland) receive extra warranties that allow their trains extra staying power. These simple differences in setup present the players with major strategic decisions in what railroads to found, as well as how their companies will best be developed and operated.&#10;&#10;Mergers, refinancing, bankruptcy, chartered and non-chartered corporations all function in exactly the same ways as 18EA/62.  Finally, 18WE will support solo play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naval War is a Tabletop Naval Miniatures Game designed to be played on a table-sized battle area with World War Two ship miniatures. The rules and any gaming aids needed for play are free and available for download on the site. The game is not tied to a specific miniatures line and is suited for many different game scales (1:1800 - 1:6000)&#10;&#10;Naval War is a game, not a simulation. The aim of the game is to recreate the feeling and immersion you get when reading the battle reports of famous sea battle like the Battle of the Coral Sea or the battle of the Java Sea. The focus lies on the action and on the ships on the table, so a lot of the technical details have been worked into easy to read datacards and quick game mechanics.&#10;&#10;The heart and soul of the game is your fleet's Command Station which is used to issue order to your fleet and activate the different squadrons of ships, planes and subs. Let your fleet perform actions like maneuvering, attacking and launching carrier aircraft but also special Command station actions that will allow your fleet to perform above and beyond the call of duty: Perform evasive maneuvers as a response to enemy fire or appeal to the British sense of duty to keep your ship in the fight when others would have broken off. Try to place that one critical hit or lay down smoke to shield your carriers from enemy fire.&#10;&#10;You are however not the only hero in this game; your opponent may (and will) try to disrupt your actions which may result in your attempt at flank speed backfiring because of an engine malfunction! This dynamic, in combination with the activation-based game sequence makes sure both players stay continually involved in the game. It also allows the players to have just that little bit of extra influence on Lady Luck. Underlying all this are solid game mechanics for modeling surface combat, air attacks and submarine actions with a balance between simplicity, gaming comfort and realistic outcomes.&#10;&#10;Naval War is a so-called &lsquo;living rule-set&rsquo; so any suggestions, feedback and additions are taken very seriously resulting in regular updates and expansions. Crowd-sourcing is also one of the strategies employed to generate content, so if you got this special ship, scenario, campaign or other contribution to the system, join the community and make it part of the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Available in both hard copy and print-and-play formats, its the perfect fit for any game collection!&#10;&#10;Fury Hardball has elements of baseball, cricket, and plastic vent-ball. Set up is simple. One or two players select a slinger (pitcher), two fielders, and four batters for each team.&#10;&#10;The game only lasts for one inning of nine outs for each team. The visiting team bats first and scores as many runs as they can before the home team comes up and tries to outscore them and win the game. The slinger can throw heat, junk, stuff, or try to catch a person on base who is stealing. The batter chooses between no swing, a reach swing, or a big swing. A roll of a d10 determines the result of the play either from the main game card or from one of the players: slinger, fielders, or batter.&#10;&#10;There are ways to score multiple runs on the same play and to record multiple outs. The action is fast and furious. If the home team can score more runs in the bottom half of the inning than the visitor managed in the top half, they win the game.&#10;&#10;",

MacArthur&rsquo;s campaign had earlier stumbled out of the gate, with bloody battles at Buna and Sanananda along the Northeastern coast of New Guinea in late 1942 and early 1943. Shocked at the butcher&rsquo;s bill run-up in those fights, MacArthur initiated an &ldquo;island hopping&rdquo; campaign that bypassed Japanese strongholds and not attacking the dug-in defenders head-on. From mid-1943 to early 1944 the US and Australian forces outmaneuvered their Japanese opponents, reducing and cutting the supply lines to the massive defensive works of Rabaul and Truk. This trapped thousands of badly needed Japanese defenders who would spend the rest of the war amid growing squalor and mounting privation. However, a risk run with each island &ldquo;hop&rdquo; by the US would be if the Japanese navy and air forces mounted a sustained counter-attack that would cut-off the American spearhead. Such an operation by the enemy could turn the tables and change MacArthur&rsquo;s bold gambit into a costly defeat.&#10;&#10;By early 1944 General MacArthur feared the upcoming US Navy offensive to take the Marianas to the north could lead to a strategic switch in offensive operations that would jeopardize his ambition and promise to retake the Philippines (as well as taking away the spotlight his operations commanded to this point in the war). In early 1944 MacArthur proposed the capture of Biak Island to not only end the New Guinea campaign, but also to provide a forward base of operations for his planned return to the Philippine archipelago. He also argued his attack and capture of Biak would provide valuable protection and early warning along the navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;southern flank&rdquo; in the Marianas, giving a base for operations against any moves by Japanese naval and air units based in and around Borneo.&#10;&#10;The plan to take Biak island was accepted over the objections of the US Navy as only a handful of ships could be spared from the Marianas offensive to support the Army&rsquo;s attack.  Expecting only light opposition two regiments of the US 41st Infantry Division landed on May 27th. After a relatively easy landing the GIs encountered fierce opposition by the veteran Japanese 36th Infantry Division, supported by garrison troops and tanks. Things for the Americans quickly went from bad to worse. Perhaps you can do as well or better?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Gain victory by one of two paths: capturing all your opponent&rsquo;s Moons and Stars, or reaching your opponent&rsquo;s Treasure Stone. Use Paths, Safes, Pits, and Traps to change how Moons and Stars move around the board. Once the board is set, choose from a number of Deity Figurines that progress along notches in the board and unlock a variety of bonus abilities.

They will be tasked with hiring performers and directors as well as sourcing the best scripts for their projects.&#10;&#10;The game consists of six years, with each year containing four seasons (which are represented on the board, thus a full game moves around the board six times). During each season, play proceeds through three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Progress films towards release (each film takes two years from launch to release). If the film reaches the final stage and is released, it will then be scored using the cards that make up the film (script, director and performers) as well as any other bonuses that have been applied. Dice will also be rolled, which may impact the final score.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take actions. Primarily these will be used for gathering resources such as money, directors, performers and scripts. Other actions include trading with other players and playing special cards that provide bonuses.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Put films into production. Each film requires a script, director (whose genre matches that of the script) and a minimum of two performers (a maximum of four performers).&#10;&#10;&#10;Points and additional advantages are generated when a film scores well with the audience, award ceremonies, critics or simply makes a lot of money.

    "Description": "The game is a turn-based operational level 2-player contest based on the battle for LZ X-Ray during the larger &quot;Battle of the Ia Drang Valley&quot; in Vietnam, 1965. There was a successful movie starring Mel Gibson made about this well-known battle for the Landing Zone.  The game is challenging for both sides and historically accurate, but only takes a few hours and can be played at one sitting.&#10;&#10;They Were Soldiers: Battle of the Ia Drang Valley lasts 15 turns. Each turn, players alternate moving and attacking each other&rsquo;s forces on the game map, which is divided into hexes. Combat can include small arms firefights between adjacent units or fire missions that target hexes with artillery, airstrikes, helicopter gunships and mortars.&#10;&#10;At the end of the combat phase, once all fire combat is complete, adjacent units may conduct close quarters combat (CQC) to decide which force will occupy contested hexes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, after all movement and combat is completed, both sides draw cards to determine special actions for the future turns and may get reinforcements according to a preset schedule based on the history of the battle.&#10;&#10;History - At 10:48 A.M. on the morning of November 14th, 1965, the first 80 soldiers of the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 7th Cavalry landed in a small clearing at the foot of the Chu Pong Massif in central Vietnam near the Cambodian border.  The Americans had landed in the middle of the base area for an entire North Vietnamese division, and were almost immediately attacked from multiple sides of their small landing zone - called &lsquo;LZ X-Ray&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The battle raged over the next several days, with high losses on both sides.  In the end, the Americans had proved their new airmobility tactics and had inflicted high losses on the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers they faced.  The NVA had also learned how to fight the Americans - and had inflicted serious losses on a high-tech superpower enemy  by using classic light infantry tactics with only a fraction of the firepower available to the Americans.&#10;&#10;This game challenges the players to re-fight the first day or so of that battle - the critical time when the NVA forces had the chance to overwhelm the Americans and overrun the landing zone.  Can you, as the U.S. player, hold your ground and repeat history?  Or will the NVA player triumph and overwhelm the perimeter - cutting the Americans off from supply and reinforcement?  Get ready to re-live or re-write history in the battle for LZ-Xray!&#10;&#10;",

You are trying to have your design chosen by the Elitist of Elites to have your Hedge Maze used at their new vacation home.&#10;&#10;Everybody is given a player board with a cover so that your design is kept secretive. There is a draw bag where X amount of Hedge pieces are in the bag. Every round 5 pieces are drawn from the bag and placed in the center of the table. Starting with the 1st player of that turn you will select a tile from the center followed by everyone else. Once everyone has placed the tile on their player board it remains there and can not be moved. 1st player token is passed to the next player and the round repeats until there are only 4 pieces in the center in which end game is triggered. This will be the last piece placed on the board and the game is over. Time to score.&#10;&#10;Victory points will include different objectives that will be met as a whole and individual objectives as well. Most Dead Ends. Most Turns. Shortest distances from start to finish. Longest distances from start to finish.&#10;Certain tiles may be worth certain points as well. Say if they are harder to place tiles and only limited to one or two in the bag.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Multiple players may choose the same D12.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Once per round, players may use the Black D6 to modify the result of their chosen D12. (see &quot;Modifying the Dice&quot; in the rulebook). &#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; The numbers in a row must remain in ascending order from left to right. (blank fields and the number 0 are okay)&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Number 0 can be written anywhere in the respective color.&#10;(E.g.: The dice is rolled and there&rsquo;s &ldquo;5&rdquo; with the red die and &ldquo;5&rdquo; with the black die, players can write &ldquo;0&rdquo; anywhere in either red row.).&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; No duplicate numbers are allowed in any row or column. &#10;Number 0 is an exception to this rule.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; You may only write the values inside the icons (Hearts and Xmas Icons).&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; If the players can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t enter a number, they mark (X) the leftmost Gift Box on their scoresheet. These are considered as penalties.&#10;&#10;When any player has all the Gift Boxes marked or has filled four rows on their scoresheet, the game ends at the end of that round. Players then tally their points:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Each Fully Complete Row: &#10;Points equal to the number in the rightmost heart. &#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Each Incomplete Row: One point per entered number.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Xmas Icons: Sum of the numbers in all three matching icons. &#10;(E.g.: A player has &ldquo;18&rdquo; in one of the trees, &ldquo;2&rdquo; in another trees, but he doesn&rsquo;t have a number in the third tree, he scores &ldquo;0&rdquo;.)&#10;(E.g.: A player has &ldquo;4&rdquo; in one of the hats, &ldquo;10&rdquo; in other hats and &ldquo;6&rdquo; in the third one, he scores &ldquo;20&rdquo;.)&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Gingerbread Man Bonus: If you managed to write the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; five times, you get +10 points.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139; Each Gift Box: Sum of the marked points from left to right (max -30)&#10;&#10;Whoever has the highest score wins. In case of tie, the player who has the least number of marked Gift Boxes wins the game.

It also makes different players more powerful and different abilities and cards much more useful. It actually gives it the feel of the real pro tour in that, if you play with the same character across each of the courses, you will be faced with significantly different challenges. There is tons of OB. You've got to do some serious strategery to get through unscathed.&#10;&#10;",

Within it are rules for the use of many of the models produced by forgeworld in Apocalypse games.&#10;&#10;The book has 112 pages and the cover and contents are printed in colour.&#10;&#10;This book serves three purposes. First, it provides rules for Imperial Armour models. The arrival of Apocalypse has made it necessary to update the rules for some of our models, which were previously published in our large Imperial Armour volumes and Update books. In fact this book now replaces the Imperial Armour Update 2006. Rules changes are especially important for super-heavy vehicles, aircraft and gargantuan creatures. All of these troop types have new rules in Apocalypse rulebook and obviously our rules needed to fit with these. Secondly, Apocalypse has introduced several new blast marker templates, which did not exist when our original rules were published. Where appropriate we have used these new templates for our models (for example, the Manticore). Thirdly, we have incorporate many Imperial Amour models into new battle formations. All straight forward enough... or is it? The arrival of Apocalypse provides players with a perfect arena in which to use their Imperial Armour models, and as such serves as an examples of how these models can be used in different styles of Warhammer 40,000 games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Never mind the Billhooks is set at the Big Skirmish/Small battle level, the sort of thing that probably went on a lot of the time, particularly up around the Scottish borders, without ever troubling the chroniclers. &#10;My original inspiration was Nibley Green, Gloucestershire, fought in 1470 between the private armies of Lords Lisle and Berkeley, with no more than 1,000 men a side.&#10;&#10;Billhooks is a card-activated game with points-based random army generation and using only good old D6s. &#10;You roll dice to hit and dice to save (depending on armour) so it&rsquo;s very familiar Old School in that respect. &#10;Longbows are deadly but not dominant since their arrow supply is limited, so to win a battle you have to get stuck into Melee. &#10;Cavalry and skirmishers have their uses but it&rsquo;s the heavy infantry &ndash; Men at Arms, Bills and Pikes &ndash; who will win the battle for you.&#10;&#10;All the key rules are on a short Cribsheet (with no confusing tables of plusses and minuses) and you should find yourself playing along without too much reference to the main rules after only a few turns. A typical two-player game with about 100 figures a side will play out in 1 to 1 &frac12; hours but it will easily expand to a bigger, multi-player set-up once everyone is familiar with the common and easily-memorized mechanisms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer at WI&#10;&#10;",
