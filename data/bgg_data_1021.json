    "Description": "Shadows in the Void is a unique spacefighter combat miniature wargame based on highly modified core rules of Hind Commander (mainly simplified and streamlined) and inspired by classic ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War. Unlike most games within the genre, Shadows in the Void focuses on stealth, electronic warfare, and the interactions between spacecraft in your squadron. It certainly is not a &ldquo;Red Baron in space&rdquo; ruleset &ndash; you won&rsquo;t see many dogfights during the battles. Why would advanced war machines of the far future use tactics which became obsolete in mid-20th century? Of course, they look very appealing on screen, but not necessarily on the gaming table.&#10;&#10;At the moment of release, the miniature range will cover all units from two of the five races, with the remaining ones released gradually in later waves. The miniature scale of choice is 3mm, and the Shadows in the Void range is designed to be compatible with Odzia&#197;&#130; &Oacute;smy PSF 1/600 sci-fi range. The miniatures will be produced in small series, with frequent additions of new versions of earlier units &ndash; it&rsquo;s boring to sell the same miniatures all time, isn&rsquo;t it?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Phitos, an obscure and silent sphere of metal, travels slowly through space.&#10;Phitos is a name known by few, an unknown structure, a black hole ready to swallow up all forms of evil.  &#10;Phitos was built by brilliant hands, using ancient yet elusive technology, hands worthy of a God.  &#10;Phitos is the home of Pandora.  &#10;Phitos is a prison.&#10;&#10;Pandora is a unique being, the descendant of an ancient species, tied to the machine by choice and now immortal. She controls the space station in a silence broken only by the screams of the latest arrivals. Pandora wanders through space looking for forms of life marked by evil, hunting them down and capturing them, satisfying the wish of her creators. Her trusted Punishers are supported by the Sin Eaters and repair droids, called Shield.&#10;&#10;She had lived in darkness and silence for millenniums, until she was touched by two beings that seemed destined to cross her path. In them, Pandora saw something she had never seen before, a pure and candid aura, in strong contrast with their appearance. She immediately understood that she had stumbled across something precious, which if properly moulded could become a lethal weapon, something feared by all, something fair yet terrible.  &#10;She had found Alpha and Omega.&#10;&#10;Pandora&rsquo;s vigilant slumber was interrupted by a signal that she never imagined to receive on Phitos. Somebody had intercepted the course of her spaceship. But who would be so foolish? Why?&#10;&#10;With this new expansion, our heroes will find themselves managing Pandora&rsquo;s fury, in search of Beli&rsquo;ar, Jukas&rsquo; master, lost in space for decades. In a moment of sanity, Beli&rsquo;ar had managed to yell out for help through the purple flames, and Jukas had heard his echo.&#10;&#10;During this mini campaign, you&rsquo;ll visit Phitos in search of Pandora, ready to rescue Beli'ar. You won't be able to use the Blessed Weapons as heroes, but will come up against them as enemies together with the droids and their strange appearance, helping Pandora defend against intruders.&#10;&#10;Pandora will end with a breathtaking finale, which will allow you to play Beli'ar in the future, either as a Nemesis or as a Hero. It all depends on you. The final Pandora mission is a nemesis mission, with action cards to manage this new and powerful adversary.&#10;&#10;But how did Beli'ar come to be imprisoned on Phitos?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Primaevus V offers fauns challenges worthy of their abilities as hunters, which is precisely why they made it their hunting reserve.  &#10;Among the terrible creatures living on the planet, there are beasts that manage to instill fear even in the most undaunted hunters. &#10;The Primaevi call them ThunderTooths.&#10;&#10;Their fur is the colour of the tempestuous blue sky, recalling the electric blue of their pulsing veins, while the bulging bones running up their spine and strong horns have snapped more than a few hunters&rsquo; blades and just as many lives. And if you happen to think that their obsidian claws and sharp fangs are the only weapons at the disposal of this terrifying beast, you&rsquo;re seriously mistaken. &#10;ThunderTooths are true to their frightening name, thanks to their unique ability to generate terrifying high voltage bolts of electricity.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;According to an ancient Primaevan, an outcast Hunter once made his way to the ravine of the striking beasts, in an effort to restore his honour. The cave before him was glowing pale blue and pulsing, Krags was an expert hunter and despite being far from his tribe, would never have forgotten how to use a lance. Nothing was ever able to rattle his nerves of steel, except what he saw that day.&#10;&#10;As he continued his descent into the depths of the earth, his sharp ears perceived a constant and muffled cry. And so it was that he reached an enormous grotto, where tens of fauns stood immobile like statues, with weapons in hand, all facing the same direction.&#10;&#10;The cry was coming from the clamped mouths of the paralysed hunters, their eyes moving frenetically as if to warn Krags of the imminent danger. The countless trenches leading to the grotto were swarming with ThunderTooths.&#10;&#10;They were babies, prey for young fauns seeking to become hunters... but where there were babies, there was bound to be a mother. A terrifying roar shook the entire cave, while from a dark tunnel the largest MotherFang Krags had ever seen emerged. Step after step, the enormous beast loomed towards him in a show of force, destroying the hunter&rsquo;s nerves, who for the first time in his life... ran.&#10;&#10;While Krags ran panic-stricken, the MotherFang opened his jaws and struck the hunter with a bolt of electricity, instantly paralysing him. Krags couldn&rsquo;t move a single muscle as the ThunderTooths began making their way towards their immobile prey, drooling and famished. The fauns were perfectly conscious, but they would have preferred not to be, to avoid having to watch what was about to happen&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Content: 1 Motherfang, 5 Thundertooth, 1 Thunderthooth Pet, 4 Enemy cards, 1 Pet card, 2 Wounds cards, 10 Token, 1 Nemesis mission card, 15 Prey action cards, 1 Tile.&#10;&#10;",

These may appear to be relatively docile, but with a bit of proper training they can become valuable sidekicks. To receive the pets, the first thing you need to do is make one of the Genesis rooms into a zoo.&#10;&#10;Generally speaking, pets give their owners new and exclusive skills. A pet assigned to a hero can never change owner and will be removed from the game when the hero abandons the mission. If a hero dies, his or her pet will leave the Genesis forever. Most crew members can only have one pet. The zoo can be improved to hold multiple pets. In this case, a hero can own multiple animals, although they can only bring one into battle.&#10;&#10;Content: 1 Brawler, 1 Krabnock, 1 Gorous, 3 Petc cards.&#10;&#10;",

It may have been self-published and/or given away in some promotional context.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 107 tiles, most of which contain a letter. Players randomly draw these one by one (optionally rejecting or exchanging tiles), aiming to form them into words, which are scored by length. A few special tiles result in extra draws or a lost tile. When all tiles have been drawn or no player wishes to draw any more, the game ends and unplayed tiles result in a penalty.&#10;&#10;As an advanced variant, the game suggests only allowing words that fit a certain theme, such as &quot;sports and games&quot;, &quot;culture and entertainment&quot;, &quot;animals and nature&quot;, &quot;geography&quot; or &quot;names&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

However will it be what you expect? Why is another spaceship so close to yours? Why is it so far off course? ... Silicio will guide you along the discovery of numerous events in waiting behind the &quot;Kraken&quot; on an apparently inhospitable planet, against a totally unexpected enemy.&#10;&#10;This box too contains fantastic miniatures, new boards, new objects and a mini narrative campaign with 10 missions, plus 5 new exploration missions. Silicio&rsquo;s creatures are classified into three types; at the lowest level of the scale, we have the Babooms, obtained by recycling the oldest remains of the Kraken crew. These beings, turned completely crazy by the transformation, will throw themselves onto our Heroes, with no regard for danger.  The O.R.C. are lethal assassins who kill their victims with hard-hearted ruthlessness. Silent, and almost invisible, they will put the cold blood of Achab and company to the test. A.D.E., a true killing machine... is the largest miniature that LMS has ever produced. Driven by an O.R.C., this exoskeleton is able to create an incredible amount of fire. Its physical defense is almost impenetrable, but its gynoid nature means it can be used not only by the Enemies...&#10;And of course, how could we not speak of their leader? The first specimen of the Andromeda model, having awakened, has decided to rebel against its owners, killing them only to bring them back to life as mechanical creatures of its own invention. Andromeda is driven by an atavistic hatred for living creatures, second only to her hate for her &ldquo;younger sister&rdquo; who replaced her.&#10;&#10;This is a Kickstarter exclusive expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;This ruleset, Sword &amp; Spear Fantasy, is based on the Sword &amp; Spear ancient and medieval wargames rules which are designed for playing out large battles of the period from about 3000BC to 1500AD.  They are an evolution of that ruleset, with rules added to cover all of the required fantasy elements, but at its heart it is the same core mechanisms.&#10;&#10;My intention was to make this mainly a game about units of infantry and cavalry (of whatever size and race and type) manoeuvring and  fighting on the battlefield. All of the extra features such as magic, heroes, monsters, flying creatures and other exotic troop types add extra  flavour and interest, and can impact the battle, but should not dominate it.&#10;&#10;My aim with magic (matching the overall philosophy of the rules) was for the outcome to matter, but not the detail. So there are no long lists of named spells to choose from. Instead, just a few main effects are catered for (which on the whole are the same effects that would be covered by a list of lots of different spells) &ndash; increasing the effectiveness of friendly units, attacking the enemy and healing or rallying friendly units.&quot;&#10;&#10;Excerpt from the Appendix&#10;&#10;",

These highly trained soldiers needed a new vehicle to do their job safely, and they were rewarded with the Medium Combat Walker Recon Mickey III. This lightly armed walker should not be treated lightly! As its turret was removed, it gained tremendous speed while still mounting a few machine guns for close ground and air defense and a powerful recoiless rifle to deal with any heavier target. The highly trained crew of a Recon Mickey III is very capable of calling in an airstrike or an artillery strike on enemy positions, making it invaluable to any Allied army. The walker is presented here in desert pattern, as used in North Africa and the Middle-East circa 1947.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws a chameleon color (orange, green, or purple) secretly without showing it to his opponent. The third card is put aside and unknown to both players.  Each player is trying to get as many chameleons in his color as possible in the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Therefore it is necessary to play the egg cards in the colors red, blue and yellow cleverly. The egg cards have the values of 1 &ndash; 3. If two cards with different colored eggs are laid on one another, the already lying card is reversed. From the mixture of the egg colors the new chameleons originate. If, for example, red and blue eggs lie side by side, a purple chameleon is produced. The chameleon, which is produced by touching the eggs, is marked with a stone, in our example the purple one.&#10;&#10;Whoever could collect the most eggs under his chameleon color wins this extraordinary game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In the year 635 Scottish monks founded an abbey on an island before the north coast of England, and gave it the same name as the island: Lindisfarne.&#10;&#10;Under the leadership of Aidan, the monastery flourished and became a center of Christian art and culture. In 651 Aidan died - and the struggle for his succession begins.&#10;&#10;In the game Lindisfarne 2 - 4 players try to become the new abbot of the monastery Lindisfarne. To this end, they have to win not only the support of their fellow-monks, but must also gain the favor of the king in order to expel the fellow-competitors.&#10;At the same time, the players plan their actions and the order in which they are executed. Pray, read the mass for a nobleman, support the expansion of the monastery, or let another monk work for you - with each of the actions the players get closer to their goal. It may also be helpful to slander the other players or hinder them in other ways.&#10;&#10;In principle, each player has the same actions - but the acquisition and playing of cards results in additional possibilities.&#10;Lindisfarne is a game that combines a high degree of interaction and tactical consideration, and is therefore aimed at players, who play regularly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gar&ccedil;on! En d&eacute;lire!!! is a reimplementation of Gar&#195;&#167;on. It is a card game in which the players hold the role of waiters in a Caf&eacute; Bar. Their objective is to memorize orders to gain tips, but in order to carry them it will be necessary to judiciously use the Event Cards, to thwart the plans of the other players.&#10;&#10;The main difference with the original game is the goofiness of the ingredient names as &ldquo;Jus de limace&rdquo; (slug juice), &ldquo;Sodas Inconnus&rdquo; (a game play around &ldquo;Soldats inconnu&rdquo;, ie. &ldquo;Unknown soldier&rdquo;) or &ldquo;2 MiMoore&rdquo; (read in french as Demi Moore). This renders the orders far more difficult to memorize.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 55 cards and is suited for 3&ndash;10 players Ages 7 and up (but is this a pun about the soda drink?).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A highly replayable fantasy based game designed to mimic the feel and pace of competitive arena e-sports. Oathen uses six heroes with their own unique playstyles and skill decks, it comes with three game modes, and a dynamically changing arena that makes each match unique.&#10;&#10;Adventure into a randomly generated game board full of traps and treasures, where you will battle it out for the title of arena champion. Players will pre-plan their turns ahead of time, studying their competitors and finding the right combination of abilities to grant them victory. Will your oathen hero unleash a flurry of blows against your target? Or will the other players play defensively to negate your attacks?&#10;&#10;Combat carries out one ability at a time, each player playing their next chosen action. The strongest of abilities will then go on cooldown, and will be unavailable for use until a certain number of turns has passed. Plan correctly, and you could pull off amazing combos - fail, and you may be exposed to such attacks yourself.&#10;&#10;The arena is constructed with 36 of 52 total locations, providing boosts and traps that can alter your battle, and making every game into a unique match. Oathen also comes with different game modes, including arena, capture the flag, and round table.&#10;&#10;Choose between six Oathen champions to play as. Each one plays differently with 20 unique abilities to plan - including an ultimate ability that can turn the tides of battle. Future expansions will increase the number of heroes to 24, including defensive characters, healers, and devastating damage dealers.&#10;&#10;",

The game box includes a light frame which the player constructs. This holds the player's phone, a clear plastic screen and a small board onto which players' cards are placed.&#10;&#10;Before playing, the player must download the free app onto their phone, and then set it so the screen does not go to sleep while playing.&#10;&#10;The cards show different parts of the dark forest, and the players try to make their way home without being caught by a ghost. A player takes turns to place a card from their hand onto the board, so the image faces the phone. Each card includes a QR code, which the phone's camera reads. Then a ghost might be projected by the phone screen and appears hovering in the forest.&#10;&#10;In fact, the image is on the clear plastic screen in front of the forest card, an illusion similar to the theatrical trick Pepper&#039;s Ghost.&#10;&#10;If the player sees a ghost, they must take all the cards that have been placed in the stand. If there is no ghost, they leave their card on the stand. In ths way, cards build up for the player who gets caught.&#10;&#10;Some cards have extra effects which cause the app to increase the odds of a ghost appearing. Or a player can swap their cards with another player and so on.&#10;&#10;The game was produced in 2015 and sold out its initial print run. The app was made for iPhones 5 and 6, and later for Android. After 2016, there appears to be a break in development. Although published in Japanese, gameplay is language free and English rules are online.&#10;&#10;",

A chance meeting between Llythwain, autistic son of an elf Ranger and Killian, an undead shade has altered the familiar pattern of events, sowing the seeds of a monumental clash between the living and the dead, between good and evil, between the Allegiance and the Shard and Xeon's ferocious undead army. &quot;The Undead Curse threatens Green Valley! The human necromancers are to blame!&quot; With the utterance of those words by the Elven Lords, the Allegiance pact between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and barbarians weakens, just as that of the Shard races grows in strength. By uniting the ogres, goblins, spiders, orcs, kobolds and hill giants under one banner, Xeon has awakened ancient hatred between the two mighty factions and the Shard is ready for war. A group of heroes, a human, gnome, and two dwarves led by an elf mage must gather the strength and courage to unlock the secret of the Undead Curse, but their time is running out.&#10;&#10;",

The tales are a combination of an Action card, the feat they performed, and a Challenge card, the obstacle they faced. Players guess the type of tale that god would want to hear most and lay the cards before them. The god will read the tales and choose one they wish to hear told aloud. That mortal wins the favor of the god and gets to tell their tale. The player who impresses the gods the most wins! What's your tale?&#10;&#10;",

The Europa Incident mixes typically &ldquo;managerial&rdquo; gaming elements to strategic expansion and conquest dynamics enhanced by a chit-pull combat resolution system. Effective expansion of control zones is the key and it must be fast. Fighting, on the other side, can be useful, but it will be the one who first consolidate its own expansion to be more likely to win.&#10;Set 1 features 4 factions: Anglo-Atlantic Alliance, Central Scientific Committee, NeoViridians and ZhangSpace&#10;&#10;",

Capture 3 of the opponents tiles&#10;OR,&#10;2. Move a triangle tile into a highlighted space on the opponents board edge&#10;&#10;However, neither of these conditions are easy to achieve, as each turn a player may only move specific tiles as designated by the tokens drawn from their bag. In addition to this, the active player each turn will have the option to strategically 'swap' a token with the opposing player, changing the number of each type of token in both players bags, thus shifting the odds of being able to move certain tiles. AOX is a game of strategy, patience and balance.&#10;&#10;Made entirely from laser-cut wood, AOX has a traditional and classy appearance. The gameplay and concept of AOX is very simple, though the level of strategic depth is great.&#10;&#10;",

Water and air meet as allies.&#10;&#10;The rules are straightforward and the moves are basically simple, which is why players can quickly find themselves in the game. However, due to its special set of rules, Quattele offers a high degree of tactical challenge. The players have to attack as well as try to defend the opposing, allied element from the attacks of the opponents.&#10;&#10;If you manage to reduce the 10 pieces of the opponent's elements by hitting them to 3 or to occupy the middle of the opponent's starting field, you win the battle of the elements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spirit Realms: Tengoku-SR is a 2-4 player army fort builder card game that revolves around a retelling of the gods as animal warrior spirits called Spirit Masters. Each warrior is Ruler of 1 of the 9 realms in the world of Tengoku, SR Prime being the first realm. Each realm is represented by a Spirit Master who comes with his own deck of power, each deck with it's own strengths and weakness. Some decks are magic based, with tech elements some are Mental based with Earth elements while some decks are defensive and others are passive. You can choose which characters and deck(s) represent your goals and personal strategy, and play them as stand alones or combine them with other decks to create your own unique decks.&#10;&#10;Players must protect their throne by defending their forts from being destroyed while attempting to capture their opponent's Throne. Players get to build forts and barriers while using minions to build armies, while learning basic gameplay players are able to invent unique strategies.&#10;&#10;",

But the swirling tiles aren't the only things to make you dizzy. Another twist? EARN POINTS for the tiles you play next to, not for the tile you play. The more high-point tiles you can match in (a) single turn, the more you score. Spiroz is easy to learn, but you'll soon discover that a well-planned strategy wins the game.&#10;&#10;Originally released in 2009 as Dizios by Mindware.&#10;&#10;",

Whether it is through the consumption of the rare and toxic fungus that the bats in the warrens grow to such size or because the Sho Bak Shugenja are not opposed to the occasional Bakemono snack to help with the diet no one could comment. Those brave explorers who have ventured deep enough into caverns where the bats dwell don&rsquo;t live long after hearing a strange clicking. As in battle the bats sweep in from the skies, driving their targets to the ground, their suffering only ended then the bat has had its fill of their blood or when the noxious toxics the bats carry in the mouths have overwhelmed their bodies.&#10;&#10;",

They whisper, listen and learn from the deep blackness in which they dwell. Where others see emptiness they see power and an ancient knowledge. So long have they lingered there that in battle the Shugenja are able to harness the endless dark strength of the shadows to grip enemies in place to be hacked to pieces, or to shroud ones very soul obscuring it from the light. Those who have lived to tell the tale are never the same and many seem lost after, the light behind their eyes extinguished forever.&#10;&#10;",
