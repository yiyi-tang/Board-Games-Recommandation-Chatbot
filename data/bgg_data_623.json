    "Description": "This is an attempt to make a game like Seega which is less subject to draws.&#10;&#10;This game is played on an empty 5x5 square board. There are 24 double-sided pieces. The game is played in two phases. In the first players alternate placing two pieces at a time with their color showing; any squares may be occupied except the center. In the second phase players alternate moving one piece into the empty square.&#10;&#10;A capture is made by sandwiching a single opposing piece between two of one's own. The captured piece is turned over. If at least one capture is made the moving piece may be moved back to the space it came from if that will result in additional captures.&#10;&#10;There are two different versions of the game, depending on which rule one uses for the case where a player cannot move because they have no pieces adjacent to the empty space. In version one the player may take any of their pieces and place it in the empty space, but even if they capture they cannot then move it to its original space. In version two the player may turn over a piece adjacent to the empty square; in this case if captures are made the piece may be moved into the empty square if it can make further captures.&#10;&#10;In either version the game ends when a player loses by having fewer than five pieces.&#10;&#10;The game may also be played by three players using cubes with three colors on them; each player starts with eight of these.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a traditional 2-player game from West Africa, played on a 5x6 rectangular board. Each player has 12 game pieces in her own color, which start off the board; traditionally one player uses small sticks, the other uses pebbles.&#10;Players initially take turns to place ('drop') one of their pieces on the board.  Each must be dropped on an empty space on the board.  One source states that this must not be adjacent (orthogonally) to a friendly piece, but the original descriptions by Monot [1950], translated by Murray [1951] only state that - during this stage - no player may form a row of three of her own pieces.  If a player cannot make a legal drop, she must pass. This continues until all pieces are placed on the board, or until no more pieces can be placed.&#10;After that, in each turn and starting with the player who began the game, each player moves one of their own pieces to an empty adjacent (orthogonal) space on the board. If, by so doing, she is able to make an orthogonal  row of exactly three of her own pieces, she may capture one enemy piece (of her choice, presumably).  The player who captures all of her opponent's pieces wins the game, and scores two points if this is achieved without any of her own being captured, or one point if she has lost at least one of her own pieces.  A series of matches is played, and the series is won by the first player to score 10 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules:  &quot;In the course of the cruel Thirty Years' War, the people inhabiting the Czech Lands were subjected to many invasions by Swedish mercenaries who looted burghers' houses, aristocratic palaces, churches, libraries and monasteries.  Regardless of whether they were led by Generals Baner, Torstenson or Wrangel, the Swedes always wanted to take away as much as they could . . . On the night of July 25, 1648, the Swedish cavalry tried to conquer the Stone Bridge (today's Charles Bridge) and penetrate the Old Town through the gate in the Old Town bridge tower . . .The people of Prague, and particularly students led by Father Jiri Plachy, quickly took up arms and rushed to help the tiny unit of the tower guards.  A fierce hand-to-hand fight ensued, with the fighters on both sides hiding behind the the statues on the bridge.  The battle took the toll of many dead and wounded on both sides.  The present game is based on this particular battle with all its snares and personal fights.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules are in Czech, English, German and French.  The board is a simple checkerboard-type surface on medium-weight cardboard.  The only other components are 28 small wooden blocks, 14 dyed red, 14 in their natural light brown coloring. There is a coin on the front of the box that is tossed at the start of the game to determine how many moves the Swedish player gets.&#10;&#10;Each player places their 14 men on the first two rows of squares on each side of the board. The men can move one square in 12 possible directions.  You eliminate your opponent's men by landing on their square and can take another turn provided you can eliminate another man with that move.  All men can jump over each other.  The player who has more of his men on the starting line of his rival when no one can make any more moves wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players are rival daimyo in Sengoku era Japan attempting to cleverly outwit eachother to gain control of various locations scattered across Japan's four main islands.&#10;&#10;Unlike the original, each card represents one to three (1-3) samurai belonging to one of four clans and one of the following locations: temple, pagoda, or castle on one of the four islands of Japan.  Players secretly assemble armies comprised of Samurai from one of four clans to conquer new locations.  Armies constructed of Samurai from the same clan are more powerful than armies using various clans.  Additionally, players can persuade locations to rally under their banners or attempt to conquer another player's locations.&#10;&#10;Players are awarded points at the end of the game for the locations they've conquered, with additional points being awarded when various conditions are met.&#10;&#10;",

The color of the landing space indicates if you get to move your bait closer to a fish, move back, lose bait, spin again, etc. Once you get your bait far enough it goes in the net and you catch a fish.  There are 5 fish to catch at a time and 8 total for the game.  Your bait is limited, so if you lose too many bait pieces you are done.&#10;&#10;",

Therefore Batalj could be considered a &quot;cousin&quot; of Stratego. Designed by Count Sigvard Bernadotte, an uncle of H M King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and illustrated by Lars-Olof Jerhammar.&#10;&#10;In the game you try to defeat your opponents army with your own. You only see the back of your opponents pieces so you don't know what piece is where. You try to use your stronger pieces to defeat your opponents weaker ones while protecting your weak ones. .&#10;&#10;Differences between Stratego and Batalj:&#10;&#10;-Batalj has 48 (2*24) pieces on a 64 square grid (8*8). Only the first 3 rows are filled in the initial setup.&#10;-Instead of 'Bombs' Batalj has 'Cannon'. Cannons can only be defeated by the value 3 piece (Corporal).&#10;-There are no 'Scouts' and the unit mix in general is slightly different.&#10;-There are no 'lakes' nor any other obstructions on the board. &#10;-Striking is mandatory and happens immediately when a player moves a piece to a square directly in front (but not on the sides or back) of an opposing piece. A victorious striking piece does not occupy the opponent's space.&#10;-There are no 'Flags'; winner is the first player to either eliminate or block all opposing pieces. In case of an impasse, the value of remaining pieces on both sides is counted and the higher total wins.&#10;&#10;",
