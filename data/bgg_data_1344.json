It can be a valuable mushroom or berry or a poisonous mushroom can be caught, which will take away victory points from you at the end of the game, or it can be nothing at all.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been picked up, points are totalled and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#208;&#157;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#143;

    "Description": "While the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere decimated each other over the shattered remains of the Star League and slid into the technological dark age of the Succession Wars, the Clans of Kerensky entered into a golden era of prosperity. Bereft of Nicholas Kerensky&rsquo;s leadership, the Clans pushed their technological capabilities to their limits, developing devastating new weapons and technologies and flooding the battlefields of the Pentagon and Kerensky Cluster with powerful war machines as they trialed each other for supremacy.&#10;&#10;Technical Readout: Golden Century unveils the weapons and technologies developed during a pivotal era in Clan history, when the Clans came of age and matured into what they are today.

After a brief stay in L&oacute;rien, your party is on its way back to Thranduil when they see smoke billowing up from the eaves of Mirkwood. The black plumes lead you to the smoldering remains of a Woodman village, with bodies strewn about and black-feathered arrows sticking from their backs. This is clearly the work of Goblins, and the pained gasps of a dying Woodman tells you that the survivors were taken by the fiends to their lair within the forest. You swear an oath to rescue them if you can, or avenge them if you cannot, and so you draw your weapons and follow the trail into the woods.&#10;&#10;This standalone scenario pack contains two adventures: The Oath and The Caves of Nibin-d&ucirc;m. These scenarios were originally released as part of the Limited Collector&#226;&#128;&#153;s Edition for The Lord of the Rings LCG. Now, with the inclusion of new boon and burden cards and the onset of the Revised Core Set, you and your fellow heroes can take on these two challenging scenarios as their own two-part adventure or as an extension of the core set&rsquo;s Mirkwood Paths campaign. Will you track down the Goblins and rescue the captives? Or will you become lost in the dark of Mirkwood?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game emotions, tension, but also joy and well-being await you, just as you like it during real races. In the game you will start training the physical and mental qualities of your jumper. You will manage its energy, which will be important in racing. Of course, you will jump from a ski jumping hill with a realistic-looking jumper figure. &#10;As in real jumps, you will solve not only the length of the jump, but also the style and point evaluation of the judges. Your jumps will also be affected by the wind and also the equipment in which you will jump. &#10;The aim of the game is to place as best as possible in the individual races of the cup tour and become its overall winner.&#10;&#10;At the beginning, each player slides the jumper's figure from the hill, and based on the distance determined by the rollers, we determine the order in which the player's cards are selected. Each of them have certain predispositions such as psyche, speed, technique, etc. Once we have chosen the player's card, we go to choose the flag of which nationality you want to represent. There is also a card draw on which hill we will jump. They are shuffled, then turn. So let's say it's going to be Japan, for example. This card is placed on the 3D hill and indicates to us what nation we jump in. Based on that, the home jumpers will benefit from a better meters rating simulating crowd support. And then the size of the hill is randomly selected by turning over the top card of the bridge and finding out that we are racing on the K90 hill, for example. Then we can go into the training of our ski jumper (players cards). Based on the different predispositions of individual jumpers, we can improve individual training skills, which happens in specialized rooms in gyms on the board and therefore we can choose which ability we want to improve. They are on special cards. This gains points on the player's card, but we lose time and energy while we train. And as we lose time, we gradually get closer to the day of the race, and as soon as we get to the seventh day, we can go jump from the hill. Before the race starts and we go jumping, we calculate the points we have gathered in training and then we will find it on the spinner table. According to the hill on which the race is held. And if we had the same nationality as the flag on the hill, we would get more bonus meters. Which is like fans support us. So, after entering the values, you can jump. Jumping is made by putting your plastic figure down from the hill. At the edge of the hill there are two rollers which are triggered by the plastic figure and there have plus and minus symbol and numbers. These rollers simulate so-called random weather factor such as the Wind, or the current mental state of the jumper, etc. If we jumped +1 point. We will write down all those things in a notebook and in the final evaluation of the jump, in addition to the points gained in training, the place where the jumper finished will also be recorded. We have different point areas. The possibility of falling is incorporated into the game. If the jumper does not reach the point area or fall, he will not get any points. But he also has another way to get points for style as in real, and these are the cards that represent the points we know from ski jumping. The points work by dealing 5 cards to the player, he does not look at them. Another five cards are dealt in front of him, and after turning the hourglass, which has a limit of 30 seconds, the player tries to find the best possible numbers in order to get the best points for style.

    "Description": "Big washes, little washes is a game about washing clothes carefully. The right washing powder, the right temperature and the right speed. That is not easy because you can influence only one of those three factors, the others are determined by your opponents. On your turn, you determine one of those factors (i.e. washing powder) and play a card ( a piece of clothing). The others decide to join in (play a card) or pass. Then the next player determines another factor (i.e. temperature) and playes a card. Then, if also the spin cycle is determined the cards are turned and scored.&#10;&#10;In Big washes, little washes you play 1 of 11 characters, each of which gives a different game experience. In addition, it has an expert mode where you can use your clothing cards in multiple ways and a solo campaign where you play all 11 characters, each with their own goal.&#10;&#10;If you succeed, they can go clean in your wardrobe and you will receive your honestly earned points. But if your wardrobe is full, you have to make space by selling sets or outfits. Of course you also score points with that.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player reaches 75 points. After that everybody can sell remaning sets/outfits from their wardrobe and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Grote wasjes, kleine wasjes is een spel over het zorgvuldig wassen van kleren. Het juiste waspoeder, de juiste temperatuur en het juiste toerental. Dat valt niet mee omdat je zelf maar &eacute;&eacute;n van die drie factoren kunt be&iuml;nvloeden, de andere worden bepaald door je tegenspelers. In je beurt bepaal je een factor (bijvoorbeeld temperatuur) en speel je een kledingkaart. De andere besluiten mee te doen (door ook een kledingkaart te spelen) of te passen. Daarna bepaalt de volgende speler de temperatuur, speelt een kaart en de andere besluiten weer of ze nog meedoen. Als ook het toerental is bepaald draaien we de kaarten om en scoren we het resultaat. Als het lukt mogen ze schoon in je klerenkast en krijg je je eerlijk verdiende punten. Maar als je klerenkast vol is (er kunnen 8 stuks in je kast) dan moet je ruimte maken door sets of outfits te verkopen. Bijvoorbeeld een set van 5 paar sokken of 3 overhemden. Natuurlijk scoor je daar ook weer punten mee. Veel punten zelfs als het je lukt om bijvoorbeeld een complete zwarte of vintage outfit te verzamelen.&#10;&#10;In Grote wasjes, kleine wasjes speel je 1 van de 11 karakters die elk weer een andere spelervaring geven. Bovendien heeft het een expert-modus waarbij je je kledingkaarten op meerdere manieren kunt benutten.&#10;&#10;Het spel eindigt als de eerste speler 75 punten bereikt. Hierna mogen alle spelers nog sets/outfits uit hun kledingkast verkopen en de speler met de meeste punten wint.&#10;&#10;Ten slotte is er solo-campagne waarbij je alle 11 karakters speelt die ieder hun eigen doel hebben.&#10;&#10;",
