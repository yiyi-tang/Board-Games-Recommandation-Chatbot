    "Description": "A Solo Game by Scott Almes.&#10;&#10;You own the only inn within a hundred miles: the questionable prestigious Ugly Gryphon Inn. Your patrons are rowdy and rude, but they are the only ones around. In order to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.&#10;&#10;In The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you&rsquo;ll be tasked with managing your patrons&rsquo; various needs to ensure they all get a good night&rsquo;s rest. Each turn, you&rsquo;ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something&rsquo;s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there&rsquo;s no trouble. There&rsquo;s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!&#10;&#10;After you've run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. Do not include patrons in the bar. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you&rsquo;ve won! If you have less than 7, then you have lost.&#10;&#10;",

To make the magic work to its fullest, they all wish to land in specific locations to fulfill specific conditions.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, they haven't coordinated their wishes among the flock, so it's up to the players to sort out the puzzle so that as many dreambirds as possible have their wish granted.

Each unfulfilled wish results in a penalty point for a player. Play proceeds over several sundowns, and the winner is the player who in the end has received the fewest penalty points.&#10;&#10;The game includes variable difficulty levels so that everyone from children to seasoned gamers can compete together and be challenged.&#10;&#10;Uluru: Tumult am Ayers Rock can be combined with Uluru: Neuer Tumult am Ayers Rock to add further variants and combinations to the game.&#10;&#10;",

In this press-your-luck bluffing game of simultaneous play where no player has to wait for their turn, you play the part of a captain of a Russian Roulette team competing against the world's best Russian Roulette teams.&#10;&#10;The first team to accrue 15 victory points or the last team with their brains still intact wins. You earn victory points by bidding on how many pulls of the trigger you will survive. Any time you lose a teammate, you earn a severance package in the form of an action card. Action cards allow a player to peek at the top three cards of their gun deck before bidding, shoot at another player instead of at themselves, change a bid, and more.&#10;&#10;But there's more! World Championship Russian Roulette is also a bluffing game. At the beginning of every round, players place one of their gun cards into their &quot;pocket&quot;, providing them the opportunity to cheat by pocketing their bullet card. Careful though. Get caught cheating and the penalty will blow your mind.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to find out which two players have the same card &mdash; that is, which two players LINQ &mdash; by listening to the clue words that all the players give. For example, if the LINQ word is blue, a player holding that card might say ocean. A player who is bluffing might follow by saying shell. It's not yet clear who has the LINQ, until the other player can describe blue in a different context.&#10;&#10;After round one has been completed, players can guess who they think has the LINQ, or pass on guessing until after round two. When the LINQ is revealed, players earn 2 or 1 points for correctly guessing after, respectively, round one or round two. (The two players who are LINQed score only if they both identify one another.)&#10;&#10;The first player to score 10 points wins.

All of his subjects from cobbler to cook, painter to paladin, debutante to duchess bustle about the castle in preparation for the succession. One of your favorites can attain the throne. But, beware! It will require clever maneuvering and selective positioning to be in the right place at the right time to achieve the crown!&#10;&#10;Vive le Roi! is a bluff and deduction game. Players receive a card that lists a number of characters, and they keep this card hidden from the other players. The game is won by points, and players gain points depending on how &quot;high&quot; up in the castle their characters are located. Lower floors are worth fewer points, and higher floors are worth more. At the beginning of the game, players take turns placing one of the 13 characters on the board, honoring the limit of 4 people per floor.&#10;&#10;Once this initial setup is done, a turn is simple: move a character of your choice up (never down) a floor. Easy. The king's throne on the top floor is worth the most points, but every time a character is moved to that spot, the entire group simultaneously votes either &quot;Yes&quot; (of which they have an unlimited number of &quot;Yes&quot; cards) or &quot;No&quot; (and each player has a limited number of &quot;No&quot; cards). If there is even one &quot;No&quot; vote, the character in question is removed from the round and won't be scored. When everyone eventually votes &quot;Yes&quot; (usually by accident but sometimes because everyone is out of &quot;No&quot; cards) for a proposed king, the round ends and scoring takes place. At the end of a few rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Admin note: Most editions of King Up! are for 3-6 players, whereas the 2025 edition accommodates 2-8 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a Spanish card game born in Basque Country. The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).&#10;&#10;It is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 &quot;3&quot; cards count as kings and all four &quot;2&quot; cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.&#10;&#10;In every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:&#10;    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.&#10;    * Peque&ntilde;a or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.&#10;    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.&#10;    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.&#10;At last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.&#10;&#10;One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cataclysm: A Second World War&#10;&#10;It is the 1930s and the world is still recovering from the Great War and the Great Depression that followed it. A second world war can break out at any time. Can you stop it? Will you start it? Better yet, can you win it?&#10;&#10;Cataclysm&nbsp;is not your typical game about World War II. The game begins in 1933, not 1939, and is global in scope. Germany is far from dominating Europe. Japan is on the march in Asia. Every crisis is an unexpected opportunity. There is no hindsight and anything can happen.&#10;&#10;Truly grand strategic in scope,&nbsp;Cataclysm&nbsp;requires players to lead nations, not just armies or fleets. You must craft a diplomatic strategy, develop political support for your policies at home, shift your economy to a war footing, and build up the forces you need to deter or vanquish your enemies.&#10;&#10;There is no traditional I-go-you-go turn structure in Cataclysm. Counters representing political actions, military actions, units, and possible events are drawn at random from an action cup. As each counter comes out, the owning player resolves it, and play swiftly moves on to the next draw. You have to make plans to execute when your chance comes up, but you have no idea when, or in what order, events will transpire.&#10;&#10;A game about global war gives every nation armies, air forces, and fleets. But in&nbsp;Cataclysm, military pieces have no numeric values. You know what forces you have and where they are deployed. To resolve combat, each side rolls up to three dice and compares their single highest die.&nbsp;You can devote more resources to a campaign (generating more dice or bonuses), but that does not guarantee a favorable outcome. Your efforts can lead to triumph&hellip; or to disaster.&#10;&#10;In&nbsp;Cataclysm, you are free to explore alternatives. The Soviets can construct a massive long-range bomber force. Japan can build powerful armored forces to overrun Siberia. Germany can invade Britain, or France can take Berlin, provided you craft a strategy that gets you there.&#10;&#10;When you play Cataclysm, you write your own history of a second world war.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is my most anticipated wargame of 2018.&quot; --Ananda Gupta, co-designer of Twilight Struggle.&#10;&#10;&quot;I WOULD EAT A KITTEN FOR THIS GAME&quot; --Kuhrusty&#10;&#10;",

Those lucky enough to have found protection are able to fight Otis with a dice roll. Better  weapons mean higher value dice and a greater chance of success. Beat Otis and he disappears form the board until re-emerging from the woods on his next turn.&#10;&#10;Be warned, as the body count rises, Otis gains strength, moves faster and becomes more deadly. Just when you think you're safe, you may find him waiting right in front of you!&#10;&#10;If that's not bad enough, players must draw Cabin Cards which have a wide variety of game changing effects, both positive and negative. They contain Plot Twists, Cameos, weather changes, special Otis cards, clever Campers, helpful Weapons and Items, and fate tempting &quot;foolin' around&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;The Counselors won't give up so easily. In addition to their own inherent talents, Survival Cards grant the players unique abilities and tactics to help elude or confront the killer.&#10;&#10;Who, if anyone, will survive?&#10;&#10;",

The players build tunnels in the mountain, establish stations in the mountain and in the city, discover veins of precious stones, acquire precious stones, and sell them. The players get points for stations in the city and for selling precious stones. The winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The board is a hex grid, with city spaces along most of the edges. The center hex is a vein of yellow gems: place all 9 in a stack there. The rest of the gems go in their individual market areas (priced 1-9 based on supply).Each round (3 in game), add 5 contracts (showing gem combinations; score big VP if completing them; lose some VP if cannot) to the display. Then auction (using VP) turn order chips 1-4. Players then each get the same set of tiles (hexes with various numbers of track exits, prospecting tiles, veins, option tiles, etc.) plus a dynamite hex based on their turn order chip. Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.&#10;&#10;Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price. The last action is prospecting, where you create a path from one of your stations to another, passing through as many veins as possible: take one gem from each vein.&#10;&#10;After everyone's 12 actions are used, any exposed dynamite tracks explode and take the adjacent tracks as well (all these are placed in the Buy Pool, which can be accessed by turning in Option tiles)! You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.&#10;&#10;At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.&#10;&#10;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...&#10;&#10;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.  And the illustrated examples make it easy to jump right into the action.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 90 Minute Game Turns &#10;MAP SCALE:  425 yards per hex &#10;UNIT SCALE: mostly companies; some sections and platoons &#10;PLAYERS: 1-2 &#10;COMPLEXITY: Moderate&#10;Playing Time: 20 minutes to 12 hours, depending on scenario&#10;&#10;",

Your personal board represents your business and the dice your workers. In each of the columns of the board you can carry out one specific action; create new recipes for cupcakes, open new stores, serve customers, hire new workers, etc. On each turn you will have to decide which column you are going to activate, taking into account that the more dice there are and the more specialized they are, the more effective the action will be. Through these actions you will increase your level of sales and production, trying to get them to grow in equal measure since at the end of each of your turns your Income will increase by the amount indicated by the marker that is the furthest behind i.e. that has made the least progress.&#10;&#10;",

Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.&#10;&#10;Players can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Eldar, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.&#10;&#10;Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.&#10;&#10;Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.&#10;&#10;Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher.

In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in front of them, whether in hand or on the table. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply.

He can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fight against the advancing enemies (orcs, trolls, and &auml;lfar [Ger. albae], i.e. dark elves).&#10;    Travel to other locations.&#10;    Lobby the dwarven council to give advantages to all players &ndash; and without the favor of the dwarven council, everyone suffers disadvantages.&#10;    Solve a minor quest for rewards.&#10;    Take on the current major quest, revealing the next major quest if successful. Completing these quests is the only way to win the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;For most of these actions, a player must succeed in a dice-driven challenge.

    "Description": "Inspired by the hit video game that sold over 15 million copies worldwide, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game brings three &lsquo;M&rsquo;s and four &lsquo;C&rsquo;s to your tabletop: massive monster minis in a cooperative, choose-your-own-adventure-style combat campaign!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time to journey to an uncharted land, because the Astera basecamp needs YOU. Become a hunter of the Fifth Fleet to track down and slay the fearsome monsters roaming the New World. Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts! Gather your party of 1-4 hunters* and venture out on quests made up of three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;         First is the gathering phase, where you&rsquo;ll trek through the lush jungles of the Ancient Forest&mdash;or the arid dunes and fetid swamps of the Wildspire Wastes&mdash;gathering resources and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment. Just like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. In this phase, you&rsquo;ll use a choose-your-own-adventure style quest book to determine what state you encounter the monster in and how you&rsquo;ll make your approach.&#10;         Next is the hunting phase, where you&rsquo;ll attempt to slay the monster in fluid and dynamic combat that makes full use of the board and miniatures to bring your experience to life.&#10;         And, finally, the HQ phase, where you&rsquo;ll craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles!&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The choose-your-own-adventure element will immerse you in the New World, giving five unique ways to approach each monster before engaging in combat. Enjoy the beauty of the landscape as you would in the video game, and feel your tension build as you get deeper into the hunt&hellip; ...Because it&rsquo;s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these. Enter dynamic and dangerous combat where positioning and teamwork are vital to success. Leap away from devastating attacks and strike when the opportunity presents. It&rsquo;s vital you manage the threat, juggling which of your party members is drawing the monster&rsquo;s attention at any given moment. One wrong move could spell doom! Where you strike matters, too. Earn the loot you need for the weapons you want by targeting different areas of a monster and wearing it down over time.&#10;&#10;Speaking of weapons, use your player board to track your health, stamina, and equipment. Just like in the video game, your weapon is essentially your hunter class, with a unique deck of cards and upgrades you can swap out by crafting to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks. As for using those weapons? Combat is controlled by cards which you&rsquo;ll use to create combos, meaning you&rsquo;ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina. Keep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!&#10;&#10;&#10;    Want to play solo? No problem. Monster Hunter World: The Board Game includes solo mode, where you can control a pair of hunters and quest to your heart&rsquo;s content.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black Gold is a reimplementation of Giganten, with the additions of support for a 5th player (with special rules involving additional auctions), several official variants in the rulebook, a modular board, two new special actions, and a different deck balance.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The year is 1922 and the Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&rsquo;s train reaches the last track.&#10;&#10;To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?&#10;&#10;The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.&#10;&#10;Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.&#10;&#10;",

From that point on, you get to decide where to travel, when to battle, when to negotiate, and when to seek out divine prophesies to guide your actions.&#10;&#10;You are supplied with soldiers and advisers to help you navigate the dangers of the battlefield and the negotiating table. These include Infantry, Archers, Phalanxes, Cavalry, Advisers, Scholars, Courtesans, and Spies. You will craftily combine these resources with your own plans to achieve victory, and glorification. And if you do well, you will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders ever to walk the earth.&#10;&#10;The life of Alexander is divided into several campaigns, each spanning several years. During each campaign, you are given goals, but how you achieve those goals is up to you. Do you enter into battle? Or negotiate? How strong are you? How strong are they? What can you gain? These are all decisions you get to make, and must make well, if you are to live up to the immortal standards set before you.&#10;&#10;The campaigns can either be played stand alone, or linked to play through his entire life. When played as one on-going life, the outcome of one campaign affects your starting situation in the next campaign.&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Put on your captain's hat and navigate the 3D pirate ship using sand timers in this unique real-time cooperative game.&#10;&#10;As a member of an adventurous pirate crew, your goal is to be crowned Admiral of the Black, the most feared pirate ship in the Caribbean. To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.&#10;&#10;The players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players. Unlike some other real time coop games the stress is present but not dominating. The thirty-second delays, in addition to the intermittent rounds, always allow you to catch your breath!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is not World War II. Progress during &quot;The War to End All Wars&quot; was measured by yards, not miles. The Italians were on the side of the Allies, while Turkey &ndash; then at the center of the Ottoman Empire &ndash; was one of the members of what was known as the Central Powers. Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.&#10;&#10;The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia. The alliance included other historical members, but they more or less fell under the command and control of one of these great powers. In fact, had General Pershing not insisted that its integrity be maintained, even the American army would have found itself as simply being replacements for French and British.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies: WWI 1914 puts players in charge of one of the major powers, each with its own infantry sculpt; other sculpts represent the artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval line-up of either the Allies or the Central Powers.&#10;&#10;As designer Larry Harris notes, &quot;While playing this game, you will quickly realize that this is not World War II. There are no massive sweeps across continents with blitzing armored divisions and aircraft. Instead, there are a series of determined offensives resisted by equally determined armies dedicated to holding the line. You will find that your depleting resources of men and artillery must be deployed with great thought and efficiency. You will be fighting pretty much the way man has been fighting with each other for thousands of years &ndash; only this time the ability to kill your enemy, and for him to kill you, has become intolerably efficient.&quot;&#10; Despite what the back of the box says about the playing time (1-3 hours) the Avalon Hill website correctly states 8 playing hours for this game!&#10;&#10;",

It's part of a line of combined dice-and-card games that publisher AMIGO Spiel introduced in 2012.&#10;&#10;As you might expect with a game titled Piraten Kapern, players must set off in search of treasure, pushing themselves to find as much as possible without losing their heads.&#10;&#10;At the start of a turn, the active player rolls the eight special dice. He must set aside any skulls rolled, and his turn ends immediately with no score if he rolls a third skull. The player is free to set aside any number of other dice, rerolling the rest. He may continue to do this until the skulls get him or he stops. He then scores for dice combinations, with a three-of-a-kind earning 100 points, a four-of-a-kind 200 points, and so on all the way up to an eight-of-a-kind earning 4,000 points. Each gold or diamond showing is worth 100 points on its own. A player earns a 500 point bonus if all eight dice score.&#10;If a player is not able to set aside any valid dice, all points are lost.&#10;&#10;If a player rolls four or more skulls on his first roll, he heads to Skull Island for the turn, setting aside those skulls and continuing to roll as long as he sets aside at least one skull each time. Once he stops, all other players lose 100 points for each skull showing.&#10;&#10;Before a player starts to roll for his turn, however, he draws a card from the pirate deck, which affects what's possible on that turn: He might score double for the treasure he collects, or need to roll sabers to fight off other pirates, or receive a free diamond or gold coin, or be able to score treasure even if he collect three skulls.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches 6,000 points, all other players take one final turn, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in 10 rounds, each with four phases.&#10;&#10;&#10;     High Council Phase -- This is a negotiation phase where Nations will convene to decide how they will respond to an event occurring back on Earth or on the Exoplanet. The top card is drawn from the High Council deck. Nations then decide to respond to the event by assigning the specified Team Member to the event, keeping them from use during the rest of the round. If all Nations respond then everyone gets the bonus. If not, there's a penalty for those that ignored it.&#10;     Supply Depot Phase -- This is an auction phase where Nations bid on Supply Depot cards or the first player marker. Players choose cards in the order of their bids. The player with the highest bid may take a second delivery. &#10;     Action Phase -- This is a worker placement phase. Nations place Team Members in Action Spaces to take various actions and earn prestige. &#10;     Resolution Phase -- In this phase, the Nations produce new resources and return their Team Members home. &#10;&#10;&#10;Points -- Prestige is gained on 4 tracks (Defense, Exploration, Commerce, and Infrastructure) and your position on these tracks gains you points at the end of the game. You may also gain points by achieving Civilization Milestones (only 1 Nation may claim each Milestone), completing Lunar Season scoring cards (any number of Nations may complete these), building ancient XenoRelics, completing special objective cards, and for left over resources.&#10;&#10;The Nation with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Union and Confederate players each have their own card decks, reflecting the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. The Union player must do all the running to win the game by the time they have cycled through the Union card deck for the third time, having accumulated the required amount of victory points by capturing Confederate controlled areas, as well as squeezing the Confederate player with a naval blockade. The Confederate player must hold on and thwart the North's victory ambitions to win!&#10;&#10;Each time the decks are cycled, the Union player adds some better quality cards, becoming stronger as the game progresses, where as the Confederate player adds lower quality cards, becoming weaker. The underlying game mechanism is one of &quot;deck destruction&quot; rather than the more normal deck-building.&#10;&#10;Cards have multiple uses and can be recycled if used one way but during the course of the game you have to decide which cards are going to be permanently sacrificed from your deck cycle to allow you to build units.&#10;&#10;",

Martial Law brings you a complete new set of cards with special powers, and features all-new vampires, werewolves, hunters and ghouls. Martial Law also introduces the feeding mechanism: Feed your chained orders to give them greater effect!&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;",

The player who takes care of their beloved dogs best will score the most victory points and win!&#10;&#10;In more detail, you start the game with a random dog card &mdash; which come in small, medium, and big sizes &mdash; as well as a random &quot;special trick&quot; card. Shuffle the game cards, then lay out the top nine cards in a 3x3 grid. Next to that, lay out three dog trick cards in an adjacent column and three rescued dogs in another column. The player farthest from the start player places the watch dog token next to one of the rows or columns, then the game is ready to play.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose one of your trick cards, rotating it as you desire, then collect cards from the 3x3 grid that match the pattern on the trick card, e.g., common polyomino shapes. You can take at most one card in the row or column under the protection of the watch dog. You can play and tuck cards both before and after you collect cards from the grid. What do you do with what you collect?&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dog cards sit in front of you immediately. Good boy!&#10;    Food cards are exchanged for one of the four types of food.&#10;    Adoption cards go in your hand, and you can exchange two for a rescued dog, which comes with a special power or endgame bonus.&#10;    Favorite Things cards are dog toys that are more valuable when you collect them in sets.&#10;    Training cards can be tucked under a dog for bonus points, or you can exchange several of them to gain a new trick, which gives you more card-grabbing options each turn.&#10;    Walk cards are worth bonus points when tucked under a dog.&#10;    Bone cards give you a bonus for fed dogs if you collect enough of them.&#10;    Trait cards give an ongoing power and an endgame bonus, but you must attach it to a dog the turn you claim it; otherwise, you must usually discard multiple cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the &quot;End Game&quot; card appears in the deck, you complete the round so that each player has the same number of turns, then you tally points. Each dog has a food requirement. If you meet that requirement, the dog and all its traits and tucked cards will be worth points. However, if you don't give the dog the right type and amount of food, you score -2 points for that dog and ignore all tucked cards that would otherwise give you points (Don't let your dogs go hungry!).

    "Description": "Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel&#10;&#10;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.&#10;&#10;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes 125 tokens, with each token showing one of five colors, one of five symbols, and one of five numbers (1-5). The scoring boards show conditions that you must meet in order to earn the points listed on that board, e.g., the numbers 1-5 in sequence, tokens of the same color, tokens with different symbols, three tokens of one color and two tokens of another color, etc.&#10;&#10;To start the game, draw two tokens from the bag and place them at the bottom of your playing board. Place one of these tokens in an empty space of your grid, then choose a scoring board and place it in the row, column, or (if appropriate) diagonal line in which that token was placed. On each subsequent turn, draw one token, place it on your game board, then choose one of your two tokens to place. If this newly placed token doesn't have a scoring board pointing at it, choose one of your unplaced scoring boards and place it in the row, column, or diagonal.&#10;&#10;As soon as a line is filled with five tokens, if you have met the conditions on the scoring board for this line, flip it over to the side that shows points; if you are the first and only player to complete this scoring board this round, take the associated 3-point bonus tile. If you complete and score multiple lines on the same turn, take 5-20 bonus points depending on whether you scored two, three, or even four lines at once.&#10;&#10;If someone drew a lucky charm token at the start of the round, they draw a replacement token, then all players can choose to use and discard one of their lucky charm tiles. These tiles allow you to exchange the tokens in your reserve, place a token on the board as a joker, swap an already fulfilled scoring board for another one, and so on. Each unused lucky charm tile is worth points at game's end. After 25 rounds, players tally their points for scoring boards, first tiles, lucky charm tiles, and bonuses to see who has the highest score.&#10;&#10;",

Game ends when all cards have been auctioned and clayers with the highest total of good cards wins. Cards are both: money on your hand for bidding and points for scoring in each set sold.&#10;&#10;Goods cards and merchant cards are shuffled together and form the stack of goods to be auctioned. Depending on number of players offer cards from 1 to 6 are used (eg 4 players, cards 2,3,4,5) with the highest card on top. The highest offer card is used to draw that number of goods to make the actual offer on the table. Players start with 4 goods cards in their hand as money for bidding. Players bid in clockwise order increasing their bid at least by 1 - or they pass. Last player with a bid will win the total offer. The bidding cards (= good cards from the players hand) will be placed face up and sorted by kind into the market. Also one of the cards of the offer he won has to be paid as &quot;tax&quot; to the market also- players choice. Than he takes all the other cards of the offer into his hand and he also places the offer card of the actual bid in front of him. He is not allowed to bid again in this round.&#10;&#10;Game goes on with the next highest offer card giving the number of goods making the new offer. So each round each player win different a decreasing number of good cards. When all offers are gone the open market is usually filled with goods. Than the player with the lowest offer card - the same player who won the most less good cards - has free choice to take all cards of one kind from the goods in the market. Often this is a really great grab!&#10;&#10;Following rounds are played the same way until all goods have been auctioned. Players can also sell sets consisting of exactly 3 cards of the same good from their hands whenever they want. That is no real sale but players hold the highest card of each set for scoring. Merchant cards can be used as a joker - even two merchants are allowed in a set of 3 goods. Although merchant cards have a value of 0, a set of 3 merchants will score 5 points!&#10;&#10;96 cards with 6 different goods (eg cloth, wine, spice)&#10;   - each good with values 1 (6x), 2 (5x,) 3 (3x), and 4 (2x) &#10;16 merchant cards value 0 but replacing any card you want in a set&#10; 6 offer cards (from 1 to 6) showing the number of cards to be auctioned&#10; 2 market cards where to place cards spend for bidding and &quot;tax&quot; cards&#10;&#10;",

During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again.&#10;&#10;",

To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&#10;&#10;In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Blood Bound, a deduction game played in 15-30 minutes, players assume the roles of members of two clans &ndash; the brutal, animalistic warriors of the Clan of the Beast and the graceful, deadly members of the Clan of the Rose &ndash; and (with an odd number of players) the human inquisition. Disguised by a secret identity, they try to kidnap the Elder of the opposing clan or give their lives for the benefit of their own Elder. Malicious attacks, aimed indiscretions, and assistance from others will slowly uncover the truth: Who fights for whom? And who is the Elder?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player knows three things:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Who they are and to which clan they belong&#10;    That a few other players are allies, while everyone else is the enemy of both themselves and their clan&#10;    The clan to which one of their neighbors belongs &ndash; although some characters can lie about their clan identity&#10;&#10;&#10;Now the players have to figure out who the Elder of the opposing team is (if there is one) and capture him. To do this, players need to attack, negotiate and deduce, with an attacked player being required to reveal information, such as his rank or clan affiliation. Each player has an ability unique to his character, and this ability can be used only at the moment that he reveals his rank. The Assassin forces players to suffer wounds, for example, while the Guardian protects a player of the character's choice.&#10;&#10;In the end, if you capture your rival clan's Elder, you win &ndash; but if you capture the wrong vampire, you've fallen into the enemy's trap and lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes their warband of Citadel Miniatures and pits them against their rivals on the hidden battlefields of the Mortal Realms.&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband &ndash; 2 are included in this box (Skaeth's Wild Hunt and Grashrak's Despoilers) &ndash; and build a deck of power and objective cards. After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions &ndash; movement and attacks &ndash; until 3 rounds are played. Between actions, you can use your power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe. Merely vanquishing your opponent&rsquo;s warband does not guarantee victory &ndash; capturing objectives, standing your ground, making the best tactical choices and deploying the right cards at the right time will gain you the glory points you need to win!&#10;&#10;Everything you and a friend need to play games of Warhammer Underworlds is included in this box, and once you&rsquo;re familiar with the rules, games will take around 30 minutes &ndash; meaning you&rsquo;ll always have time for a rematch.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.&#10;&#10;",

These nine worlds are represented on a three-level, 3D game board, with the board having locations for artifact cards, creature cards, hero pawns, elf pawns, anonymous pawns, and more. Each level of the board depicts three worlds on it, and the middle board rotates.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player places the top card of their enemy deck on the &quot;Wheel of Enemies&quot;. Players can take turns in any order. On a player's turn, they first reveal their enemy card. If this is the first appearance of this enemy this round, the player continues their turn; if not, then the enemy is activated, typically moving to a different world, then taking some action. If the enemy can't move, e.g., Surt is supposed to move up a level, but is already on the top level, you lose the game. If the enemy can't take its action, e.g., Loki needs to place an Iotunn pawn, but none remain in Iotunheim, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;While normally you hope to avoid duplicating an enemy, you want to double up on Nidho&#204;&#136;gg as that enemy starts on the leftmost space in your saga book, and if Nidho&#204;&#136;gg moves all the way to the tree icon, you win the game. (Nidho&#204;&#136;gg might also trigger effects when moving to a new location.)&#10;&#10;If an enemy moves to where another enemy is located, that world is devastated and no action is possible there except for healing the world tree.&#10;&#10;Whether or not an enemy is activated, you can then move &mdash; either to a different world on the same level or a different level above or below your current location &mdash; then act, either performing the action of the world in which you're now located or fighting. Powerful god that you are, you always win a fight, but you suffer &quot;risks&quot; equal to the strength of the enemy. You can sacrifice heroes in Valhalla to remove risks or make saving throws on dice, possibly with an elf assist, but each risk you don't prevent costs you 1 life point &mdash; and if any god runs out of life points, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As for performing world actions, you can collect elves, heroes, artifact cards; remove Hel's anonymous minions or Surt's fire giants; or receive help from worldly creatures. If another god stands in this world, your action is improved; if an enemy stands in that world, then your action is penalized.&#10;&#10;In addition to that base game, you can play Yggdrasil Chronicles on the hard mode, which increases the challenge of gameplay while giving each god unique powers. The game also includes a six-saga &quot;Ragnar&ouml;k campaign&quot; that begins with Baldr's murder, then carries on from there.&#10;&#10;",

Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.&#10;&#10;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. &#10;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.&#10;&#10;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The living dug out cities for their dead: necropolises deep within the earth. They filled the caverns with bodies and locked them away from the upper air. Eventually the dead forgot the living &mdash; if any remain.&#10;&#10;But in death, a new life began. The breath of evil from the darkness of complete shadow stirred corrupted flesh. In their middens and pits, the dead awakened, swarming through slime-fluxing tunnels, seeking chthonic power, warring with demons and denizens of the deep. Animated by the black flame, necro-ecologies rose and collapsed in the crypt-universe.  Now, cloistered undead lich-wizards have discovered the primordial opening to the shadow source, the doleful horror-hole where the Eternal Evil Emperor watches and waits....&#10;&#10;The necromancers have dug their Lairs deep into the ground. They must gather precious resources and body parts to assemble an army of minions, while defending their own lairs from the excavations and intrusions of others. In the end, the only route is into the demon path...&#10;&#10;Then depletion of your essence leads to spending another eternity in foul sepulchral darkness awaiting the next Awakening of Death.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Cave Evil, each player takes the role of an ancient Necromancer. Located deep within an earth, their Necropolises have now merged, each seeking the Darkest Pit, the location of all evil. The dark wizards must build minions with precious resources from their Lairs to send forth and destroy, or dig further tunnels to locate other creatures, resources or to ambush another sorcerer.&#10;&#10;The game is won when only one remaining Necromancer stands. A Necromancer can either be destroyed by combat, or an enemy minion may venture into their Lair and crush the wizard's shadow power, a Chthonic Crystal. BUT an even greater darkness may befall the players. As they build and destroy creatures the Dark Pit absorbs the shadowflame and may awaken the ultimate cave evil...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The beloved king Shapiro has perished in a freak catapult accident, but not before his most suspiciously named and irrefutably trusted adviser, Evil Wizard Mordak, claimed credit for his &ldquo;murder&rdquo; and legged it through a hastily conjured portal to the WORLD OF ETERNAL AND UNCARING DARKNESS. Mordak promised the kingdom he&rsquo;d return in 8 days with semi-phenomenal cosmic powers to take his rightful seat upon Shapiro&rsquo;s ruined throne! A lofty promise for an amateur Wizard&hellip;&#10;&#10;Valor &amp; Villainy: Minions of Mordak is a one vs many roleplaying board game for 2-6 players. One of you plays as the comically evil wizard, Mordak, and the rest form a band of Allies called the &quot;Order without Borders&quot;, who must halt his path of destruction!

Every player will appreciate satisfying character progression. Spending Experience Points their team has earned and locating powerful Treasures to make their characters mightier with every passing turn!&#10;&#10;Mordak has vanished into the WORLD OF ETERNAL AND UNCARING DARKNESS!

They must hold nothing back, drawing upon all of their cunning and evil genius to win the game for themselves!&#10;&#10;The Allies must locate three Ancient Shrines hidden among the land. For each of these Shrines diminishes Mordak's power. Finding them all will reveal his location and commence a final battle for victory. They can explore the map at their own pace, however they will learn they must balance their ambitions with what they can handle!

Ultimately the winner of the game is the victor of the final showdown between the Allies and their nemesis Mordak! Only the party which is better prepared and utilizes superior tactics will win the day!&#12;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1954, with an explosion over a hundred thousand times more powerful than even the wildest estimates, the Castle Bravo nuclear test obliterated the Bikini Atoll, and ruptured the Earth down to its mantle.&#10;&#10;As water levels rose in the aftermath, the remnants of humanity fled their homes and took to the sea. World leadership came together to build a massive Flotilla, mankind&rsquo;s last bastion of civilization.&#10;&#10;Now, ten years after the disaster, the Flotilla is home to the very last of us.&#10;&#10;Flotilla features two distinct and interwoven modes of gameplay, as you try to outpace your opponents in bringing prosperity to humanity&rsquo;s new home. You begin the game as a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; Fleet Commander, commissioned by world leaders to explore the new face of the ocean, scour the depths for resources, and rescue any survivors you come across. At any point in the game, you may choose to turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; by selling your skiffs, and leaving your seafaring life behind to now grow the Flotilla itself.&#10;&#10;The choice of if or when to switch from a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; explorer to a &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; settler defines the very core experience of Flotilla. They represent two similar but distinct game experiences, utilizing the same game components, seamlessly intertwined among all players. If you switch, you&rsquo;ll flip over all of your accumulated game components, watching your crew grow into new roles with new art for the same characters, while finding entirely new uses for your ocean tiles and resources, and beginning to trade with the &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; players as you go after new objectives. As players turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; different niches are filled, forever changing the game&rsquo;s economy. Mastering this ebb and flow will be critical if you&rsquo;re to shape the new face of humanity!&#10;&#10;As a &ldquo;Sinksider,&rdquo; you will explore the ocean with your skiffs, pulling some of the 92 hexagon-shaped ocean tiles out of a bag, and arranging them to help you effectively collect resources, discover valuable artifacts from the sunken civilization, all while trying to avoid toxic radiation left from the disaster. You&rsquo;ll dive for supplies, rolling a pool of custom dive dice that vary based on the depth level of your skiffs. You&rsquo;ll also carefully manage your resources, trading them on the open market for the currency you can use to buy more skiffs and outposts, or stockpiling them for when you turn &ldquo;Skyside.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;As a &ldquo;Skysider,&rdquo; you will use your resources to build an expansive network of watercraft and docks, using the &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; of your ocean tiles. Your divers will also have new jobs as researchers, rolling custom, multicolor Research dice, to discover new technologies that allow the Flotilla to manage a growing population. You&rsquo;ll also build Sonar stations, making life a little easier for the &ldquo;Sinksiders&rdquo; still out exploring the unknown, while earning quite a few points for yourself.&#10;&#10;On both sides, you&rsquo;ll also grow your relationships with the four different governing guilds, each giving you unique bonuses and more powerful crew. The players with the strongest relationships will also earn valuable points at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;The components in Flotilla are unique, immersive, and interconnected. Your skiffs will be able to actually carry up to four resource barrels, and come in a unique shape for each player color. Artifact tokens slot into matching spaces in a double-layered hub board and art on the ocean tiles lines up to create a unique layout for your growing Flotilla each time you play.&#10;&#10;In Flotilla, you&rsquo;ll find significant strategic depth and variety, while giving players the freedom to tell their own story. Will you build the Flotilla by being the first to go Skyside, or stay Sinkside for the whole game, becoming the most powerful seafarer of them all?&#10;&#10;",

For the faithful, they instill horror. For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity!&#10;&#10;In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?&#10;&#10;Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!&#10;&#10;So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims' sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury?&#10;&#10;",

If you can't set any dice aside, the throw counts as a miss and you lose the best dice you laid out previously.&#10;&#10;When you stop, use the set-aside dice to capture monsters from the wilderness and improve your supply camps, possibly calling on abilities from monsters already in your collection.

    "Description": "When war in Europe broke out in 1914, the Ottoman Empire, pursuant to secret protocols, agreed to provide shelter to the fleeing German Battleship, Goeben, which was renamed Yavuz. After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s entrance into World War One.&#10;&#10;Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.&#10;&#10;After many years of being the &ldquo;Sick man of Europe,&rdquo; by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.&#10;&#10;This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.&#10;&#10;The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.&#10;&#10;Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered. Can you lead the Ottomans in the Great War and achieve victory where your historical counterparts failed?&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Allied Front, and each turn is a few weeks of real time&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 24-page full-color Rules booklet&#10;&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game map&#10;&bull;    50 cards  &#10;&bull;    57 thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces&#10;&bull;    One six-sided 12mm die&#10;&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; mounted, jigsaw-cut game map &#10;&bull;    One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull;    One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull;    One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull;    One charcoal dessicant packet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Serenissima is the new Ystari edition of the 1996 game (M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e in France). The rules have been updated and the game is more fluid.&#10;&#10;In Serenissima players represent a merchant family during the Renaissance. Players attempt to balance the need of trading and open commerce versus the cut-throat economic piracy of the day. Players create a fleet of ships to purchase and move various commodities around the Mediterranean while also keeping well manned ships to attack and defend against other player's fleets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(block of information submitted by user in comments not included in game entry)&#10;Board&#10;The maritime areas are bigger and there are fewer of them. Starting ports are different too: Alexandria is one of them in the new version.Resources and Trade&#10;One of the resources has changed (marble replaces gems) and the ports produce different resources compared to the 1996 version. In the 1996 version, when buying goods from a port owned by another player, you had to bargain. It could be hard. Now, you just pay them 1 ducat, instead of paying the bank.&#10;Wine is now special: one port with wine in its warehouse is worth more VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Flow (big point)&#10;In the 1996 version, all the players used to bid for turn order. Then, they all played the phases according to this order: they loaded, built and bought, then they all moved their galleys, they fought and finally they took over free ports and made money.&#10;There's no bidding anymore. Now, the galleys you build are numbered, and when it's the turn of one specific galley, its owner can perform their actions (load, move and fight, or build), before the next galley is the active one. If your galleys have successive numbers, you can play several times.&#10;The little flags that used to be awkwardly fixed on the galleys are now useless, and the men have to be in the player's colour (instead of being a nice bunch of nice Sailor Smurfs).&#10;This is a major difference, the game is radically altered.&#10;&#10;Counts and Victory Points&#10;There are several counts in the game, and not only one at the end of the game. What's more: another kind of count can bring players money if they have wine in their warehouse. All of that depends on the drawn cards at the end of a galleys' turn. The pace of the game may be altered by those cards, too.&#10;There is no card in the 1996 version.&#10;In this old version, the only way to have your port well valued at the end of the game was to have its warehouses full. It's now different too: a port with one good is better than one with none, but worse than one with two, etc.&#10;&#10;Other Changes&#10;There's a building more: basilic. It brings more VP.&#10;Galleys are easier to build but the price is not the same.&#10;Combat rules are very different, the fort has a different power. Dice are different too.&#10;Port limits to recruit sailors are different.&#10;2 and 3 players rules are different.&#10;...and this list is all but exhaustive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quodd Heroes is a fast-paced modular, scenario-based adventure board game that plays like a combination of Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart and Legend of Zelda all wrapped into one. Whether it&rsquo;s a simple point-to-point rally-style race, capture the flag or a quest to uncover hidden secrets each game is filled with unexpected events, lots of player interaction, ever-changing boards and a dash of mayhem.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism in Quodd Heroes is something you&rsquo;ve never seen before. Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.&#10;&#10;While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own, cooperatively, or against other players, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.&#10;&#10;As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards. These cards enhance your abilities, slow your opponents and modify the world around you. If you use your movement skills and cards strategically you'll emerge as the greatest of the Quodd Heroes.&#10;&#10;Player Turn Structure:&#10;&#10;1. Play cards (power up): Play as many cards as you like from your hand. Power up and alter the board prior to movement.&#10;&#10;2. Movement Phase: Perform your natural tumble by turning your hero miniature over into an adjacent space, activate any board elements on that space, then activate the movement skill associated with the side of your character that is now facing up. Move up to your maximum distance with that skill in any direction you like.&#10;&#10;3. Play card (recover phase): You many play any additional cards you like during this phase.&#10;&#10;4. Exploration phase: draw cards from the lineup of cards or the top of the deck equal to your exploration value&#10;&#10;At the end of each round an upkeep phase includes:&#10;&#10;- moving board elements and animals&#10;- play a world event card that effects all players&#10;- Adjust round tracker (in timed scenarios)&#10;- all heroes upgrade their hero by selecting an upgrade tile and placing it in their upgrade track.&#10;- First player mark passes to the left&#10;&#10;",

The campaign world is easy to ignore, however, should players rather keep things generic.  Advanced HeroQuest also includes rules for using the characters and monsters from HeroQuest, should players want to do so.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with Skaven figures that make up the quest within the rulebook. The exact same Skaven, henchmen and hero miniatures were also included in Mighty Warriors, also by Games-Workshop.&#10;&#10;The following White Dwarf issues contain adventure scenarios, spell lists, or other information for Advanced Heroquest:&#10;&#10;Issue #121     The Quest for Sonneklinge (scenario and Jade spell list)&#10;Issue #122     The Priests of Pleasure&#10;Issue #125     The Dark Beneath the World (scenario and Amethyst spell list)&#10;Issue #134     The Trollslayer's Oath&#10;Issue #138     Henchmen (new followers for AHQ: the Dwarf Trollslayer, the Elf Wardancer, the Human Captain, and the Wizard's Apprentice -- this material is duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #139     Treasure (This material is also duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #145     The Eyes of Chaos (has rules for both AHQ and HQ)&#10;Issue #150     The Changing Faces of Tzeench&#10;Issue #159     Rivers of Blood&#10;&#10;Advanced HeroQuest: Paint Set has replacement heroes and additional minis.&#10;&#10;",

The only large land mass still held by the Allies was Australia, which they desperately needed as a staging area for a planned U.S. led counter-attack. The Japanese knew of the importance of Australia, but lacked the resources to conquer it, so they decided on the next best thing: Isolate Australia from the United States by building an airfield on the island of Guadalcanal, from which planes could disrupt the Allied supply lines.&#10;&#10;The United States, ill-prepared as it was for any offensive actions, immediately attacked with the 1st Marine Division under the command of Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, caught the Japanese by surprise and easily took control of the airfield. The Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Lt. Gen. Harukichi Hyakutake, counterattacked with an ever-increasing number of troops. For the next four months a titanic struggle took place in the air, on land and on sea as the isolated Marines and U.S. Army fought for their lives to hold their tiny perimeter around the airfield against the might of the Japanese Empire.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes: Guadalcanal &ndash; Pacific Ocean 1942 recreates this struggle on your tabletop and includes gorgeous beach and jungles maps of the South Pacific, amphibious landing craft, the USMC, Japanese Banzai Charges, night combat, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

The rules have been revised, and are available in book format and free PDF downloadable files.&#10;&#10;As of 2013, the ships are no longer available from Games Workshop or Forgeworld.&#10;&#10;The game is expanded by Battlefleet Gothic Armada Armada supersedes the BFG rulebook, often referred to as 'the blue book.'&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gambit Royale, first released under the name Ruse &amp; Bruise, is a fast-paced card game in the tradition of Citadels. Magicians and dragons, kings and princesses populate the land and want only one thing: the greatest fame. The players try to use their royal household to cause problems for their opponents and trick them with underhanded chess moves.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts six rounds, and at the start of each round, each player reveals a random goal card worth 1-5 victory points (VPs), each with one of six symbols printed on it. Each player has a deck of influence cards and starts with a hand of three cards. On a turn, a player plays a card face down in front of a goal card, then draws a replacement card; if a face-down card is already present at this goal, the player reveals in and executes the action on it, if any. As soon as all goals have as many cards below them as their VP value, the round ends. Reveal the face-down cards without executing their actions, then carry out the actions of any mercenaries, wizards, witches, and princes/squires in play. Whichever player then has the most influence on a goal (as determined by the values on their played cards) claims that goal, with ties being broken in favor of whichever tied player played on that goal first.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, players tally their goal cards to determine their final score; alternatively, if they have a set of six goal symbols, they can sum those six cards, double that value, then subtract 1 VP from that total for each goal card they have that's not part of that set. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;The 2018 edition of Gambit Royale contains five more cards than the first edition of Ruse &amp; Bruise.&#10;&#10;",
