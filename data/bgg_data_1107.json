    "Description": "Legion Atlantica is a Strategic level two player board-wargame set in an alternative history second century CE in which the Roman Empire discovered the New World 1300 years before Columbus. Game turns represent months, hexes are roughly twenty miles across and Strength Points correspond to approximately 500 men. The player who controls their opponent&rsquo;s capital first or the player with the largest number of city points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Roman Player controls the Invading Roman forces attempting to establish &ldquo;New Rome&rdquo; and extend their control over nearby Mesoamerican city states. The Tikal player controls the principle Maya kingdom trying to stop them. Both sides may attempt to conquer or win the allegiance of other Mesoamerican city states that start the game neutral, these include small independent city states as well as larger regional powers.&#10;&#10;The game features Leaders who command armies but are also needed to conduct negotiations. Roman fleets and Mesoamerican canoe transports, low levels of transatlantic Roman reinforcements, cities that can be fortified, pillaged or destroyed, slave workers, supply and attrition, cavalry (Roman player only) and human sacrifice (Tikal player only).&#10;&#10;By necessity almost all of the forces and characters represented are fictional, however the map is a realistic representation of the actual Mesoamerican terrain and the city states are those that there is evidence for at this time. The game represents the importance of food and river transport to the Maya and the key influence of superstitions and festivals. Celestial markers for the Moon, Venus, Mars and Jupiter are moved on a night sky track causing increasing unrest or even rebellion and changes of allegiance amongst the regional powers and city states, especially when 2 or more markers stack together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To do so they need to collect all of the pages of the powerful book that once belonged to their father. However, they have different views on what to do with the book. Should they destroy it or should they use the power that its pages unlock?&#10;&#10;Players: 2-4 players, Competitive and co-op experience.&#10;Type: Exploration, Strategy, War, Area Control, Set Collection, Resource Management, Negotiating/Trade&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;In Grendha you take on the helm of one of four powerful heroes.&#10;There is an ancient tome, and it is said that the hidden secrets of creation were locked inside its pages. There are also whispers that the same book turned a once benevolent god mad and caused him to turn on his own people. There is no way to know if the powerful tome can be wielded for good and restore order because the pages were torn from the binding and scattered through time and space. The book could not be destroyed, but it could be hidden. It is time for the book to be restored.&#10;&#10;The objective is to search the map, collect those pages, and reform the lost book Grendha. The game can be played in a purely competitive mode at two players, or a cooperative team play mode at four players.&#10;&#10;At all player counts, each player will choose a hero and take command of them and their armies. During the game, you will explore the mythical lands, command your warriors, collect items, discover clues, and gather resources. Your hero will need to slip through time, enter the celestial city, and discover the location of the lost pages. Quick! Your hero must restore the book before it is too late.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Power to the Meeple is a complex, euro-styled strategy game where you attempt to become the mayor of Meepletown. The primaries have just ended and up to five candidates must fight to become the winner of the general election. Whether you choose to be a punk, a Democrat, a Republican and Independent or Green party is secondary to how well you organize your campaign and come up with a lean, effective strategy to win the most votes.&#10;&#10;Power to the Meeple has three main gameplay phases. First the players participate in an augmented draft where they will be selecting resources. Most resources are just what they are, face value additions to a player's coffers. Alternatively, a player can pick lower valued resources that have abilities attached to them, which brings another balance to the player's strategy. Throughout the draft (which consists of as many rounds as players) each player is required to select one issue card which will stay with the player for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;The second phase consists of each player, in turn order, deploying their five campaign tokens to the areas of the modular board they want to canvass (Urban, Estates, Eco-Buildings or Suburban areas).&#10;&#10;During the third phase, tokens are revealed and the costs of the campaign are paid with the resources drafted earlier. Players who score in the top 3 positions on an area are usually awarded votes or other bonuses. Scores at individual locations are resolved by the key value comparisons printed on the areas, and the tie breakers are done according to who drafted the tie breakers such as Megaphone, Billboard, Scandal or Town Hall.&#10;&#10;Once votes are counted, any money earned during that round are counted, players move up on their respective Urban, Suburban, Estate and Eco-Housing tracks, and lastly, discard all unused resources (besides money). All players also keep their issues.&#10;&#10;Rounds 2 &amp; 3 are similar to the first round, with the major difference being the advantages each player may have gained in the previous round.&#10;&#10;After 3 rounds the players resolve any pending end of game awards or penalties for the last bit of votes and a winner is declared.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Enjoy the new rules, new Sectorial Armies and Fireteams.&#10;&#10;This book covers the events that took place on the planet of Paradiso and makes clear that the alien threat is becoming very tangible and real. The Combined Army is not going to surrender, and Paradiso is only a bump on the road towards conquering the entire Human Sphere. In terms of where it lands within the Infinity narrative, it takes place directly after the events of Campaign Paradiso.&#10;&#10;Paradiso lives up to its namesake: an astonishing paradise full of exquisite flora and fauna. In the past, this planet was inhabited by an alien race, though not much is known about the native sentient species. Their presence still lives on by the way of vast construction sites that can be found all over the planet, known as cosmolitos. It&rsquo;s widely believed that these structures were the treasure that first caught the attention of the EI.&#10;&#10;The high commanders of the various factions of the Human Sphere are trying to stop the EI from entering their systems by installing sophisticated blockades, but the Combined Army is managing to overcoming them with increasing frequency. In Third Offensive, you can read how they&rsquo;re managing to smash through the different blockades and jeopardize the human hegemony on Paradiso.&#10;&#10;The real objective of the EI will be also unveiled in this book.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s in the book?&#10;&#10;As already stated, a lot of new background material that develops the narrative of the Infinity Universe, and it also provides several new locations to set the stage of our favorite wargame.&#10;&#10;In addition to this, two new sectorials will be added to the roster of new releases - the unyielding Invincible Army of Yu-Jing and the Varuna Intervention Division for PanOceania. These will join the new armies most recently added with Operation Coldfront (Tartary Army Corps for Ariadna, and Operations Subsection for ALEPH)&#10;&#10;",

We know we sweat, we don&rsquo;t glow.&#10;&#10;Persist calls bullsh**. By asking women, their friends and allies to put all the cards out on the table&mdash;by being real, Persist invites women to laugh, learn from each other, connect meaningfully&hellip; and get up to fight another day.&#10;&#10;How to Play Persist: Be the most persistent by earning three cards of the same life value (career, health, leisure, or relationships) to achieve a milestone. Collect three milestones to win.&#10;&#10;Cards fall under six categories of gameplay: truth, would you rather, trivia, sharing, roadblocks, act it out, and the occasional wild card. Each category requires a different kind of action for the player to perform individually, with others, or even the whole group. Once played your cards may not be safe! Other players may steal your cards if they are going after the same values. This is where things get fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players take the role of businessmen during the 14th through 16th century in coastal Europe.  They can explore the seas and new lands, establish trade routes with foreign villages, gain influence in government through bribes, fight naval battles, trade shares of stock in maritime and colonial companies, engage in piracy, and invest in government and company bonds. They will also compete in score with 3 NPC factions: the mainland Europeans, the moneylenders, and the natives.&#10;&#10;SHARES OF STOCK&#10;The stock market system is pretty standard. Companies have 10 shares each and the player that owns the most shares controls the company. However, share price is not impacted by buys and sells, but only value of the company. One key difference in this to most stock market games is that not only can players own shares of stock in companies, but other companies and governments can own shares of stock as well. For example, if a government owns majority of shares in a company the player that controls that government then manages the company. A key difference compared to most other shareholding games is that the company can require shareholders to contribute further funds if the company is low on money. This was often the case in the early days of shareholding.&#10;&#10;COMPANIES&#10;Companies can build trading vessels that allow them to explore the sea and try to find overseas villages to trade with. They can also buy bonds released by governments or other companies. They can also build factories (old term for trading posts) in newly discovered lands as well as explore land. Companies do not start with any money, so they need to raise investments from players, governments, and other companies (or borrow from the moneylenders).&#10;&#10;PORT CITIES (GOVERNMENTS)&#10;Port cities are controlled by a magistrate. Players can become magistrates by bribing to gain prestige in the port city. Port cities are able to construct warships. Magistrates can also decide which companies can build vessels in their port city, as well as determine any tax on incoming trade brought by trading vessels. Magistrates can also ban the moneylenders to forgive all debt related to the magistrate, but this will make the moneylenders unavailable for the rest of the game to them.&#10;&#10;EXPLORATION&#10;The map is almost completely undiscovered, and as players move their watercraft into unknown territory 1 of 3 things can happen, 1: they discover empty water 2: they discover land, sometimes with a native village and sometimes with out 3: they run encounter a storm and sink. As all this happens map tiles are placed.&#10;&#10;MONEYLENDERS&#10;The moneylenders are the international banking community and are extremely important in the game. Players and governments start out with very limited funds, so the moneylenders are almost always needed. This mechanism is unique, and different than almost all other banking systems in games. The moneylenders themselves have limited funds, but practice fractional reserve banking. This means they lend out more money than they have, so it is possible that they will go under if other entities are unable or refuse to pay debts.&#10;&#10;COMBAT&#10;Combat in the game is simple and based on dice rolls. Players can go to war with each other and the natives. Cargo and other watercraft can also sometimes be seized.&#10;&#10;BONDS&#10;Governments and companies can issue bonds to raise funds. Companies, players, and governments can invest in these.&#10;&#10;MAINLAND POWER&#10;At the beginning of each turn the mainland power may attack a random port city. The mainland power represents mainland Europe. Tribute can be paid to avoid a possible attack. The mainland power may become powerful, but can also be reduced to nothing.&#10;&#10;TRADE&#10;The trading mechanism is simple, and is the main way to generate wealth. Company vessels transfer numbers that represent cargo back and forth between overseas villages and port cities.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;The final score is based on the wealth of the player's family at the end of the game. The score of the mainland power, the moneylenders, the natives, and all ports and companies are also included. Players must attempt to get as much wealth in the hands of their family as possible, because at the end of the game the companies and ports they manage to contribute to their own score.&#10;&#10;SOLO GAME&#10;The solo game is the same as the normal game. It is able to function as so because of the NPC entities that have a final score, it is not meant for serious gaming. Its main purpose is to get a player accustomed to the peculiarities of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s designed to be easy to play. You choose a family and build the family.&#10;&#10;Homia is a Memory-style game, where you look at a face down card and try to remember what kind it is. Until you find a homestead tile (also called a &quot;family pad&quot;), you will only memorize where the various tiles are, and put them back face down on the table. Once you finally discover a family pad, you take it into your area. The family pad has various symbols that represent different parts of a household, such as fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, and pets. The color of the symbol tells you what kind of other cards you will need to complete your family pad. If your family pad has a green symbol, for example, you need to collect one &quot;father&quot; (green background) card to add to your family pad. If there are three yellow symbols on the family pad card, it means he has three daughters, so you'll need to find three of the &quot;daughter&quot; (yellow background) cards to complete your family. If you have a good memory of the cards you looked at before finding your family pad, it will be much easier to find the members of the household required to complete your family pad. Whoever completes their family pad first is the winner!&#10;&#10;",
