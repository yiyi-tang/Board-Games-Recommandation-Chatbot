The game is equally suited for pro-gamers and casual gamers and is a fun way to get an overview over this fascinating period of history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What&rsquo;s the funniest thing about elephants? Their poop! Especially if it is on the loose side. But not everyone is into classic humor. Besides, we&rsquo;d then be talking about&#10;Elephant Runs, which we clearly are not. So, what&rsquo;s the second funniest thing about elephants? The way they squash anyone who doesn&rsquo;t get out of the way fast enough! This, too, is classic humor, but will not be offensive to the scatologically challenged. So, let&rsquo;s enjoy a few minutes of elephants squashing people!&#10;&#10;In Elephant Run, one player is an elephant that&rsquo;s big, strong, and equipped with a good memory and a huge appetite. The other player controls a group of six rice patty&#10;farmers in India trying to eke out enough sustenance to support their huge households. Things are tough enough for the farmers until one day the elephant decides to use the&#10;shared rice patty as the lunch buffet. While local statutes prevent the farmers from hurting the elephantine freeloader, it is perfectly legal for the farmers to starve to death should they not find some nonviolent way to save their crop. So, they run into the patty and try to herd the elephant  but. Assuming they can avoid getting stepped on, will they&#10;be able to save enough of their rice patty for the upcoming harvest?&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;&#10;     The tiles are laid out face-down in a 4x6 grid. You may want to leave a little space between each tile, as you will be removing tiles throughout the game. &#10;     The elephant player takes a pawn and places it on any tile they wish.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Next, the farmer player takes six coins and places them face-down anywhere on&#10;the board, one coin per tile.&#10;&#10;Sort of a fox and geese game with a twist. when the elephant moves off a square it is because he has eaten all the rice and the square is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;",

The only bad part was having to say &quot;Crap-ola, we're out of orange juice.&quot;  And &quot;Oh why does the show have to end at 10AM.  I wish we could have Radio From Hell with us all day and at night too.&quot;  Well, now you can with the Radio From Hell Home Edition.  We've boxed up all the excitement of a broadcast and turned it into a fast-paced boardgame.  That's what you're holding in your hand right now.  So quit staring at it, get your wallet and buy one for yourself and give one as a gift.  Then take it home and play.  The Radio From Hell Home Edition: a great way to waste time when you should be doing something else.&#10;&#10;ENJOY!!!!!&quot;&#10;&#10;Based on one of the most critically-acclaimed morning shows in the country, Radio From Hell: Home Edition lets you take the role of any of the four members of the show and compete to see who has the most listeners after a week of broadcasting.  Cards let you take listeners from other hosts, help segments get closer to being completed for points, or for whatever special ability is on the card.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pawns Crossing is an abstract game that combines a requirement for tactical skill with a modest luck element. Players race to move tokens to their destinations over a tile and domino board. The game incorporates three separate movement mechanics which players must choose between at the beginning of each turn: a) Tokens move along the surfaces of dominoes and tiles, b) pawns move between holes that exist in the board at domino intersections, c) The rows and columns of the board shift. A complete game typically takes 20-40 minutes. The game may be enjoyed by two to four players but a 2-player game feels different from a 4-player game. As with many multi-player abstracts, the 2-player version is more strategic.&#10;&#10;Requires a piecepack and a set of double six dominoes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the Second World War, Italian tank units matched brave crews with decrepit vehicles. Thanks to the monopolies held by the fascist state's favorite corporations, badly outdated tanks caused the deaths of hundreds of tank crewmen trying to combat much more capable Allied tanks with their Italian &quot;iron coffins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Better machines could have been made available: the P26/40 &quot;heavy&quot; tank (actually a medium-sized vehicle) that failed to enter production in time for the campaign in North Africa, or the German licenses that Italy never sought.&#10;&#10;Divisione Corazzata is a supplement based on Italy's planned but un-built vehicles, drawing on pieces already provided in our Desert Rats game and Gold Club supplementary counter sheet, but until now never used in scenarios.&#10;&#10;There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, exploring the potential use of these vehicles. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of our Eastern Front, Battle of the Bulge, Afrika Korps and Desert Rats games.  It also requires the 2007 Gold Club Coutnersheet or the downloaded counters from Avalanche Press.&#10;&#10;Divisione Corazzata is sold exclusively via PDF download. The scenario book comes as a PDF file that you'll need to print (or read off the screen) in order to play the scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Players are given a supply of tiles for use in completing patterns such as diamonds, windmills, and arrowheads.  Points are assigned based on the color(s) of the tiles.&#10;&#10;The game is a nice quality wooden game.  The tiles themselves are laminated wood.  The 10.5&quot; x 17.5&quot; redwood frame is unusual in that it has a removable plexiglass cover.  Completely assembled it looks like a piece of abstract art.&#10;&#10;",

Each rombo has twelve identical faces.&#10;&#10;Start: The game starts with two White and two Black rombos joined together in a cluster.&#10;&#10;Play: Each turn the current player must add a rombo of their colour to the cluster. The new rombo must exactly meet at least two faces of existing rombos. It is not allowed to form closed holes which would make the cluster hollow.&#10;&#10;Aim: A player wins by splitting the visible enemy faces into two or more disjoint sets. If neither player achieves this before the pieces run out then the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",
