    "Description": "This is a matching game for children that uses a Chutes and Ladders theme. The top of the gameboard depicts 2 ladders which players start at the base of. Certain ladder rungs have chutes that lead down to lower rungs of either ladder. The lower section of the board has spaces to lay out the game's cards. These cards are either placed picture or number side up depending on which game your playing. The video tape is inserted into your VCR, cued to a game, and played.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you watch the screen and listen to the story. A visual clue (either a picture or number) will appear accompanied by an audio signal. You must then quickly find and remove the card that matches the clue. If the picture beneath the card is a ladder, you move your piece 1 rung up the ladder. If a chute is revealed, and the rung of the ladder your piece is on is connected to the top of a chute, you must move down the chute to a lower rung. If your piece is on the top ladder rung when the story ends you win the game. You also win immediately if you move your piece &quot;over&quot; the top rung of the ladder.&#10;&#10;",

In another game, counters are put in the box lid and players shake both dice.&#10;&#10;Whichever game they play, young children will have endless hours of fun.&#10;&#10;",

Players are given tons of little army units to place onto the map of the world.  When it's your turn, you use your units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers.  Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Risk (1959)&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    War II (1981)&#10;    War J&#195;&#186;nior (2000)&#10;    Angus: Batalhas Medievais (2004)&#10;    War: Imp&#195;&#169;rio Romano (2007)&#10;    War Cards (2010)&#10;    War: Batalhas Mitol&#195;&#179;gicas (2012)&#10;    War Vikings (2017)&#10;&#10;&#10;description last edited on 2018/10/06&#10;&#10;",

From across the stars a great threat descends upon Earth. The Machine Horde &ndash; relentless in its determination to consume and expand &ndash; now threatens to exterminate Mankind. The Ancients, hyper-intelligent beings of unknown origins, manipulate the schemes of both human and machine to achieve their mysterious machinations. All that now stands between annihilation and survival for the human race is the Emergency Earth Coalition: a fragile unified human government rooted in fear and subjugation. Now's the time to choose your Faction Commander and lead your armies to total war.&#10;&#10;PURGE: Sins of Science offers players a full strategy setting which eliminates luck of the draw and lack of resources. Inspired by traditional Real Time Strategy (RTS) computer games, PURGE allows players to upgrade their armies in various ways depending upon chosen technologies, Stronghold attachments and unit choices. Each player controls the flow and pace of army building through a one-of-a-kind gameplay system formulated to deliver a full strategy experience.&#10;&#10;Players win the game by reducing their opponents' Stronghold Population to zero. But beware, the tide of battle can turn quickly as the unique game play allows for quick responses and counter-measures to almost every strategy.&#10;&#10;PURGE: Sins of Science comes with six 50-card pre-constructed and expertly play-tested decks. Each 50-card deck is represented by a different faction Commander from the three (3) factions available to players. Each Commander has unique playing styles and abilities which offer players a wide range of playable deck types (Offense, Defense, Support).&#10;&#10;",

Whether you've earned a Ph.D. in the science of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; or are discovering the world of Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and their neighbor Penny for the first time, you're guaranteed to be laughing and having fun.&#10;&#10;In each round, one player serves as Referee, flips over a Red card, and reads it aloud; if it has a green background and says &quot;Experimental Formula&quot; on it, the Referee indicates that as well. The other players &ndash; who have seven cards in hand &ndash; each submit one or two cards face down that they feel best describes the category or description on the Referee's card. For example, if the Red card says &quot;Often Leads to Disaster&quot;, you could submit a Blue card such as &quot;Killer Robot&quot;. If the Red card were an Experimental Formula, such as &quot;Hilarious Battle&quot;, you submit two Blue cards using your envelope, such as &quot;Horny Engineer&quot; and &quot;Giant Rabbits&quot;.&#10;&#10;If any player has a &quot;Bazinga!&quot; card in hand and wants to play it, he must do so after each player has made a submission, but before the Referee has revealed them! The Referee then reveals cards from the Red Deck until he reveals a card of the same type (either Basic or Experimental Formula) as the original card, thereby creating entirely new criteria by which to evaluate those same submissions.&#10;&#10;Next, the Referee mixes up the submitted Blue cards or envelopes so that no one knows who submitted what. Then, the Referee turns all of the cards face up, reading each card name aloud. He then ranks each card (or pair of cards) in the order he feels best matches the criteria on the Red card. The first place submission is awarded the highest numbered point chip, which is taken from the pile, the second place submission is awarded the second highest point chip, and so forth. The player to the left of the Referee becomes the new Referee, and you start a new round. Whoever ends up with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world where cause of death is known to create various game modes.&#10;&#10;The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:&#10;&#10;     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and extra Intel details, such as things they particularly like or dislike &ndash; to help predict their behavior).&#10;     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. These are the items they are allowed to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.&#10;     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. Each Black Market card provides an item to be used in an Action. Three actions should chain together in some way that results in the death of the target. &#10;     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. &#10;     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that Action, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for each card. &#10;     The skull face on the die also adds a frantic element (replacing the 1 face, if the skull is rolled it prompts the flipping of a Fate Coin to add additional randomness). &#10;     In case of failure of any die roll, that Action didn't work, and the plan must be revised. While the timer continues running, the assassins draw a new Black Market item, amending their previous plan and rolling for a new Action. They may also call in &quot;Specialists&quot;, who are characters with special skills (earned in previous rounds).&#10;     If any three Actions are successful before the timer runs out, the target is killed. With the remaining time, the players may roll for Aftermath tasks (such as fleeing the scene or destroying the evidence). Completion of these tasks earns Specialist cards to be used in later rounds. This is the only way to replenish the group's overall Budget of playable cards.&#10;     If the timer runs out before three Actions are completed, the target escapes. This is the end of the round.&#10;     In the published rules, this also ends the game. This rule was subsequently revised, allowing players to make another attempt on the same target, or take the loss and move on to additional targets. Hard-core players may end the game at this point.&#10;     The team wins if they can accomplish four successful kills before their total Budget of Black Market cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Variants:&#10;&#10;     Chief Mode is where one player takes on the gamemaster role of the Chief, answering questions and deciding on the difficulty of the plan being created by the other players. Groups of 4 or more work best in this mode. In groups of 2-3 players, each player states their opinion, and the hardest value is the one used.&#10;     Psychopath is similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. Each player holds a hand of Death Prediction cards that represent hostages. One psychopath announces a murder weapon (based on a drawn Black Market card), and players each toss in the hostage they believe will be most likely to be killed by that weapon. Designed for 4+ players.&#10;     Speed Round is faster-paced and useful for introducing players to the death prediction concept. One Chief presents the Death Prediction Card of an assassination target, and players rush to play a Black Market or Specialist card that they think can kill the person in the predicted way. The Chief assigns a difficulty value to the fastest player's proposed plan, and the player rolls to see if they can pull it off. If they do, they earn that Death Prediction Card as a point; if they fail, another player may propose a plan. &#10;     Mechanical Chief uses 14 regular playing cards to replace the subjective judgments of the Chief. Each Black Market card is dealt with a playing card, the value of which is kept hidden until the die is about to be rolled. This variant is good for faster play, and directs discussions toward justifying the revealed values within the story, rather than debating the merits of various plans.&#10;     Teams is useful for very large groups. The players split into two rival assassination teams, and alternate attacking targets, with a single Chief moderating. Teams operate under spelling bee elimination rules (one team's failure, followed by the victory of the other, results in the first team's elimination). A target that a team fails to kill must then be attempted by the other team, and a continuous narrative persists throughout the entire game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If so, HUNGER is searching for self-reliant contestants to attempt this bold adventure.&#10;&#10;HUNGER: The Show is a fast paced family game with rich player interaction. To win, you have to predict your opponent&rsquo;s actions. On the island, you can gather fruit and catch chickens to get more food. But to win, you also have to collect raft pieces. It's a good thing that no one would ever think of stealing food and raft parts from other participants...&#10;&#10;HUNGER is a family/filler game for 2-6 players, ages 7 and above, lasting 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Story: Welcome to HUNGER Reality Show! There is a 1 Million Dollar Prize and there can only be one winner. Alongside other participants, unfortunately not your best friends, you are cast onto a desert island. There is some food provided by the TV crew but it will not last long. You will be hungry very soon and will have to start picking fruit or catching chickens. You will also need to build a raft if you are serious about winning the prize. The first person to leave the island will be declared as winner. You will need rope and raft wood, which are hard to find. Well, you could always try to steal from the others, but would you?&#10;&#10;Mechanic: Players simultaneously choose their next action and destination on the island. To be successful, players need to predict the other players' actions but also stay focused on their goal: having enough food to survive the next day (or otherwise being evacuated by the film crew according to the principle &lsquo;your safety is our highest priority&rsquo;) and building the raft as quickly as possible. Balancing those needs is key to winning the game. This is what makes the game so broadly appreciated among gamers but also non-gamers, families and children. The game is fast, smooth and easy to play and has no downtime, while allowing for a lot of player interactions. The better player will on average usually win most games but it is possible for a 7-year-old to win on occasion too, which makes the game a fun experience for everyone.&#10;&#10;",

Share some hilarious and suspense-filled moments as players of Toilet Trouble take turns spinning the toilet paper roll, flushing the toilet handle, and hoping they don't get sprayed with water! The number that turns up on the paper roll spinner dictates how many times each player must flush. Players are safe if they hear the flushing sound, but no water is sprayed. Who knows which flush will be the one that sprays water, eliminating that player? Continue taking turns spinning the roll and flushing until one player has not been sprayed.

In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.&#10;&#10;Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Northeast China, 1932: A new government has disarmed its people, and condemns assembly as intent to undermine the state.&#10;&#10;In this troubled time, you are a respected teacher and Sifu in a Manchukuoan town. Under the watchful eye of the occupying garrison, you must fight to keep your way of life alive, lead your students to help your community, and continue to secretly practice your arts. Only one school's style will emerge from these troubled times as the most prominent...will it be yours?&#10;&#10;Manchukuo is a worker placement game played over a series of rounds. Each round consists of a day phase, where you assign your students to tasks about town, and a night phase, where you recruit new students and train with them in secret.&#10;&#10;The day phase works similarly to a traditional worker placement game. You'll assign groups of students to different locations, and take the action at that location to scale with the number of students you assign. Certain spaces will allow you to gather resources like food, tools, and coins. Other spaces will present opportunities for you to invest those resources back into your troubled community--either by rebuilding, or by helping families in need.&#10;&#10;At the end of the day phase, the students you assigned to different locations on the board will count towards your influence in the area. If you have the most influence in an area, you will recruit the students in that area's residence, and then the students you assigned to that area will replace them in that residence. All other players' students in that area return to their schools.&#10;&#10;Managing the flow of students you recruit is the key to Manchukuo's gameplay. Recruit too few students, and you may not be able to take as many actions in the next round. Recruit too many students, and you could end up drawing unwanted attention from the garrison, who may enforce extra rules for how you can assign your workers.&#10;&#10;Recruiting students is also important for the night phase, when you'll train together. The numbers and types of students in your school determine how you can level up your disciples, who can provide big bonuses to your actions, and who can eventually be promoted to Masters themselves. New Masters can take students with them to open their own schools, spreading your reputation farther than ever before.&#10;&#10;At the end of the fifth round, the school with the greatest reputation wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to gain control of 3 &quot;hotel rooms&quot; on the board.  To do this, the player fights a monster whose stats are drawn from a random pile.  There are other complications, like Judgment cards that can be used to help or hurt a player, pitfalls on the board, Mystery Room cards that alter game play when a certain room is entered, and Feral Monsters.  The Feral Monsters are only found in the expansion packs and can be controlled by the players to attack other players.  Also, players can steal control of rooms from other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.&#10;&#10;The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent &quot;fear&quot; that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;Wesley Snipes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.&#10;&#10;Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.&#10;&#10;In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.&#10;&#10;",

They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintin&rsquo;s dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste. Once there, traces of a struggle were found that indicated that, without a doubt, the Professor had been kidnapped! Speculation is that the kidnappers intended to wrest the secret of his invention from the Professor.&#10;Immediately, Tintin and his friends launched themselves in pursuit of the kidnappers.&#10;&#10;The players move on the board trying to gather as much information as possible. They are trying to find out in which house Professor Tournesol is being held, and by whom.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds by elimination of possibilities, as one must rule out all other possible houses and suspects before reaching a conclusion. For example, the proof-cards (orange backed cards) show the following objects: a hat, sunglasses, a mustache, a crowbar and shoes. The two proof-cards on the board indicate which objects the kidnapper lost while fleeing Professor Tournesol&rsquo;s laboratory. The kidnapper will therefore *not* have those objects on him.&#10;&#10;The game won a parents' prize in Qu&eacute;bec.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World War 3- 1976-1984, is a simulation on an army/fleet level scale of a hypothetical, world-wide, conventional conflict at the height of the cold war (1976-1984). The simulation is primarily of land and naval conflict with the secondary influence of air forces. The game covers five years in seasonal (quarterly) turns. Optional rules allow Players to choose from several levels of complexity.&#10;&#10;With the increased number of small scale conflicts throughout the world had come increased tension and strain in relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Each superpower felt it necessary to choose sides in the local, &quot;conventional&quot; wars that proliferated in the late 1970's, until each felt small pressures from all directions. Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America were involved to various degrees, in conflict.&#10;&#10;Then, one side (we're not saying which) began to feel its position slipping, as its favored side in war after war became threatened, with the scale of the conflicts ever more violent. Warnings and violent talk were followed by the commitment of the first conventional land forces by a superpower. This was followed immediately by an even greater commitment from the other side, and the war of escalation was on.&#10;&#10;The Soviet Union struck first in Europe, and overran Germany and France in a matter of weeks. Italy and the smaller countries of Western Europe were cowed into submission, and Leftist regimes came to power in each of them. However, with the larger Gross National Product, and thus, with the larger capacity to make war, the United States was in a better position to wage a prolonged war. The United States struck back in outlying areas, consolidating its gains in areas that, without a sufficient fleet, the Soviet Union could not maintain proper contact with. &#10;Of course, the question of decisive victory was quite impossible. Because the war had &quot;crept up&quot; upon the superpowers, there had been no nuclear exchange, and, so far, the threats to resort to nuclear warfare had remained unfulfilled. But, if either power should become directly threatened, the possibility that it would use nuclear weapons would become a near-certainty. Thus, both sides kept their military goals small. The United States hoped to use its greater war making capacity to wear down its opponent, while the Soviet Union attempted to use its overwhelming strength to achieve lightning victories in short campaigns.&#10;&#10;As the futility of the war became apparent, and the populations and their economies began to show signs of fatigue, the war gradually wound down to a sort of &quot;cold war&quot; stalemate, and, although there were thousands of miles of front lines, the unofficial orders of the frontline troops were not to provoke the enemy. And because of this unsatisfactory, but inevitable resolution, the responsible parties in the governments of both superpowers were overthrown, allowing for a gradual withdrawal of troops from the battlefields across the globe.&#10;&#10;This game is a simulation of a hypothetical conflict. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the entire world. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units which might take part in such a conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the units involved are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game &mdash; just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;World War 3 is basically a two-Player game (an Optional Rule provides for an independent Red Chinese command). Each Player moves his units and executes attacks on Enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions .of victory. To move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. Naval Transport and Amphibious Movement allows the transfer of land units across bodies of water. Combat is resolved by comparing the Combat Strength Points of opposing units and expressing the comparison as a difference (differential) between Attacker and Defender. A die is rolled and the outcome indicated on the appropriate (Land or Naval) Combat Results Table is applied to the units involved.&#10;&#10;Rules and map are similar to Dunnigan's (Global War: The War Against Germany and Japan, 1939-45) game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3 months&#10;Hex: 500 miles / 804 kilometers&#10;Units: Army/Fleet&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; four color mapsheet or Two 17.5 x 22.5&quot; mounted mapboards (Designer box version)&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page World War 3 rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed player air cards&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;One counter storage tray (Designer box version)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6 hours&#10;&#10;",

The true story and actual appraised value are then revealed. All players who guessed the correct value can discard the value card they used for their guess.

To quote that eminent sage George Carlin, &quot;It's all about 'doing the dozens.'&quot;&#10; Written and designed by Greg Stolze, with graphics by Samuel Araya, Abuse is easy to learn. Each player aims to destroy the ego (not really, it is only a game!) of the other players, by laying down insults created from cards in one's hand. The objective: get as many of your cards out of your hand before the end of the round (brought on by someone emptying their hand), so as to have as few points as possible. At the end of the game, whoever sinks the lowest (in score as well as insults) wins!&#10;&#10;Just to make things even more interesting, there are blank cards (helping you to put your own personal touch on your insults) and snappy retorts, which allow you to turn the tables on someone who's just insulted your mother.&#10;&#10;Abuse is a non-collectible card game with eighty cards in a deck, good for four players per each deck in play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Personally Incorrect is the appropriately inappropriate party game that will make you hate what you think and love what you play.&#10;&#10;Playing Personally Incorrect is a way to connect, break the ice, and interact. Simply put, Personally Incorrect makes things personal and lets players have some real fun, where they don't have to worry about being judged or offending anyone. Personally Incorrect does this by directing the questions at the individuals playing the game instead of just offering a fill in the blank question&#10;&#10;The player with the most 'Question' cards at the end of the 10th round is the winner. Players begin the game with 10 'Answer' cards, and receive a new one each turn. Every turn a player will read a 'Question' card aloud submitting another player's name into the &quot;Insert Name&quot; quotations. The rest of the players will simultaneously select answers and submit them to the player who read the question.&#10;&#10;The active player now shuffles all of the answer cards together and reveals them 1 at a time. All of the other players present quickly vote for the most appropriately inappropriate answer. It is important to vote quickly as the last vote will not count that way players don't base their vote on another player's vote. In the event of a tie, the active player/reader is allowed to cast their vote in order to break the tie. The player whose answer received the most votes now claims the question card, ending the round.&#10;&#10;At the end of 10 rounds the player with the most question cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If the game is played for a prize of some kind, he will receive from the other players as many tokens as there remain parts for them to complete their pig; the tail is worth 5 tokens and players who were unable to complete the body must pay 15 tokens. (Tokens not in the box).&#10;&#10;+ If the 6 is accompanied by one or two aces, take the body, place a part or the tail, and throw the dice again.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Cootie&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first player (or team) to win six sets claims victory.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two separate decks of cards: the Serve Deck and the Play Deck. Each player is dealt ten cards (or seven, when playing doubles) from the Play Deck. Players must use these cards wisely because they can not replenish their hands until the winner of the set is determined.&#10;&#10;The serving player reveals the top Serve Deck card to get the game started.

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&quot;The S&rsquo;mores card game is designed for up to 6 multi-level players, and incorporates both strategy and good old fashion fun. The object of the game is to build an edible s&rsquo;more before your opponents. Players get a higher point value based on the quality of s&rsquo;more ingredients. First player to collect all 4 ingredient cards and call out S&rsquo;more!, wins. The S&rsquo;more card game includes 70, 3x5 sturdy playing cards, and retails for $5.99. Sure to be a big hit at home or on your next family outing. Printed with Soy-Based Ink on Recycled Paper.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cards consist of ingredient cards (graham crackers, marshmallow, and chocolate), bonus cards to increase the point value to your hand, action cards that decrease your point value, and filler cards which have no value. Players start with 5 cards each. On one's turn, a player has two choices: either take a card from the deck and discard one from one's hand; or, ask any player to fan their cards, then pick one of their cards and replace it with one from the active player's hand. The first player to get all four ingredients to create a s'more (2 graham crackers, 1 marshmallow, and 1 chocolate) shouts &quot;S'MORE!&quot; to win the game. If two or more players shout s'more at the same time, the player with the highest point value wins.&#10;&#10;",

Fearless adventurers from throughout the kingdom gather forces under their banners, while prominent lords fortify their castles to withstand a siege. The whole world has turned upside down in the fever of war: dwarves have been seen defending the elves&rsquo; woodland strongholds against legions of the undead, great dragons have razed ancient obelisks to the ground, while heroes have used both brute force and cunning to capture enemy castles. The King can barely keep up with awarding commanders their well-earned titles for valor and heroism on the field of battle, and there&rsquo;s not a single distinguished title that hasn&rsquo;t already changed hands at least a dozen times. After all, it&rsquo;s not the strength of your castle or the size of your army that counts &mdash; only the favor of the supreme ruler will decide who ultimately merits receiving the King&rsquo;s Bounty.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Based on the bestselling video game of the same name, King&rsquo;s Bounty is a board game that&rsquo;s played with cards. The players take control of one of five races &mdash; elves, dwarves, orcs, humans or the undead &mdash; and use their armies to capture castles and obelisks, earning victory points in the process. However, the main battle will be fought over titles, which are far more valuable than land in ensuring victory. At the end of the match, the players who have completed the required objectives earn the titles and the victory points that go with them. Finally, the scores get tallied up, and a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Game contents:&#10;&#10;&#10;    48 Troop cards of 5 races &#10;&#10;&#10;Every race except for humans has 9 troop cards: 3 archers, 2 fighters, 2 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster. Humans have 4 archers, 3 fighters, 3 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster.&#10;&#10;&#10;    36 Property cards, including 24 Castle cards &amp; 12 Obelisk cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Castle cards. Every race except for humans has 6 castles: 2 towers, 2 fortresses and 2 citadels. Humans don&rsquo;t have any castles.&#10;&#10;Obelisk cards. The game has 4 obelisks with powers 1, 2 and 3. All obelisks are neutral (meaning they don&rsquo;t belong to any one race) and each yields 2 victory points.&#10;&#10;&#10;    21 Title Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 Last player card&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on a popular spanish flash animation, &quot;C&aacute;lico Electr&oacute;nico - El juego de cartas&quot; is a dungeon crawler in which the players take the role of C&aacute;lico Electr&oacute;nico himself or one of his clones to prove that they are the strongest by completing two episodes.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are very similar to Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord. Players are dealt one of the four characters; each one has a power and a charisma value and a special hability. Also, each player receives an episode to complete in a determined city area and three calico cards (action cards). Then, the initial city is built: each player places one city card that matches with the starting one or with one that has been already placed.&#10;&#10;Each player in his turn can spend &quot;calikillos&quot; (action points) to do several things:&#10;&#10;    1 Play a card: Each card has different costs and effects&#10;    2 Move to an adjacent city tile: Each tile not only has a different cost, but also, you receive &quot;anticalikillos&quot;, wich other players will use to play monsters, special effects...&#10;    3 Place a new city tile: Spending one calikillo, you can draw a city tile and place it on a legal spot&#10;    4 Heal yourself: By spending five calikillos, you heal yourself (each character has two status: hurt and unhurt, so by healing you revert to unhurt)&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player resolves an action, other players may, clockwise, spend that player's anticalikillos to play action cards on him.&#10;&#10;If a player at any time in his turn is at the same city tile of a monster, he will fight it. Fights are simple: you choose a characteristic, roll a die and, if the result of the die plus the characteristic is higher than the monsters value, you defeat him, if it's lower you are defeated and turn to hurt status. Players can fight each other, but the characteristic is determined by the player who wins a rock-paper-scissors game.&#10;&#10;When all the players complete their turn, a new round begins:&#10;&#10;    1 Players can discard cards and draw until they have five&#10;    2 Set their calikillos to five&#10;    3 Set their anticalikillos to zero&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game features graphics and pictures taken from the movie. Players alternate in leading Lyra in her journey to rescue her friends, as she escapes from the Magisterium's clutches. As each turn unfolds, players collect items and clues, and help Lyra to understand the Alethiometer - the truth-measuring Golden Compass. During a turn a player uses the Alethiometer spindle: the spinning action reveals the two actions the player is allowed to choose from. A typical move involves playing or drawing Lyra cards, played in sets to collect Item tiles from the board (representing Lyra and Pan's actions and investigations) or placing Symbol tokens that will later let a player draw valuable Truth tokens (representing the interpretation of the Alethiometer). Character cards, showing the main heroes and villains of the story, can be used by players to alter the gameplay by applying their special abilities. The winner is the player that scores the most points by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to play Actors to the scenes to try to steal them. The active player plays actors and/or special effects to a scene then the inactive player does the same.
