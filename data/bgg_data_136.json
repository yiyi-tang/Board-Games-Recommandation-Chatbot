The choice of the equipment and the Brute unique special power determine how many cards the player can bring to the fight.&#10;&#10;The cards let you attack the player or perform special actions.  The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent's Brute.&#10;A succesfully landed attack (not prevented with special cards, armours or shields) forces the target to discard cards from his hand, If the target has no more cards to discard he must draw a card from the damage deck. &#10;A damage card is often a bad thing (a wound a mutilation, or even a sudden death) but can give bonuses (like going berserk) as well.&#10;&#10;Contents of the box:&#10;116 Combat cards&#10;20  Characters cards&#10;7   Special characters cards&#10;44  Gruesome Damage cards&#10;42  Special Objects cards&#10;24  Equipment minicards&#10;16  Mystical Invocations minicards&#10;12  Condition minicards&#10;6   Movement minicards&#10;20  Mocking Gods cards&#10;16  &quot;Ears&quot; minicards&#10;24  Special Abilities minicards&#10;1   Boardgame&#10;1   Game Rules&#10;&#10;",

Your enemy also choose actions with varying time costs so the strategy comes in choosing actions wisely to best deal with impending threats.&#10;Attack actions can also be hasted, which reduces the time cost but incurs a penalty to their accuracy - the more hastily you execute an attack the more erratic your aim will be.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;Attacks are resolved by throwing a number of dice equal to the power of the attack - each dice which exceeds the armour value of the target causes a point of damage. The performance of your 'mech will degrade as damage is received but you get the opportunity to repair in between enemy waves.&#10;&#10;There are currently 13 weapons to choose from, with 4 mounting points on your 'mech so there is plenty of variety to be found - you can also beef up the armour on your legs and torso but watch out for your overall weight! If you exceed the maximum it will slow down all your actions.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules and play sheet, you will need the following to play the game:-&#10;A pencil&#10;An eraser&#10;12 cubes (3 each of 4 different colours)&#10;1 dice of a particular colour (suggest red)&#10;1 dice of a different colour (suggest blue)&#10;Several dice of another different colour (ideally 6-8, suggest white)&#10;&#10;This was an entry into the 2016 1 Page PNP Design Contest:-&#10;Winner 'Best Overall Design'&#10;2nd Place 'Most Innovative Mechanic'&#10;2nd Place 'Best Written Rules'&#10;2nd Place 'Most Thematic'&#10;&#10;",

Each senator watches over his personal agenda, increasing its value through projects that favor it. The senators will propose bills that will be put to a vote, being able to buy votes through blackmail, bribes, lies and tricks. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.&#10;&#10;The main objective is to modify the value of the Departments and gather the most valuable Projects in the Secret Agenda. Each turn, the Senators will propose Project cards from their Secret Agenda and relocate the Public Officials of the board. These proposals are put to a vote, so it will be necessary to buy the votes of the opponents. With each new Project, the number of Officers per Department will change, increasing or decreasing their value. At the end of the game, a Table of Values will be formed according to the number of Officials in each Department. With this Table, common to all the Senators, it is calculated how much the Projects of the respective Secret Agendas are worth. The Senator with the most points in his Secret Agenda will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the 1920s, a time of much industrial building and growth. In Titans of Industry, you must invest in building factories and businesses in order to produce goods and sell them to gain victory points (VPs). Game play involves a delicate balance of money, production, and goals. The person who can best manage his buildings and meet his goals in seven years will win.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with four workers and $6,000. Every turn, players first buy buildings, then place workers on those buildings or on the board. Factories allow you to produce goods, while Businesses allow you to sell those goods for money or VPs. A good player needs to balance production and sales, and encourage other players to sell with them to maximize sales. Board elements allow players to take advantage of bonuses, such as extra production, building improvements, and Corporate Strategy cards. Corporate Strategy cards help give players additional goals and direction, by specifying additional ways to gain victory points.&#10;&#10;Three times during the game &ndash; years 1923, 1925, and 1927 &ndash; upkeep will be due, and players must pay to maintain their buildings, or will need to take out loans. Players will need to sell enough goods before then to have enough money to cover the costs, as loans are worth negative victory points at the end of the game. After year 1927, whoever has the most victory points from combined sales, buildings, and Corporate Strategy cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Titans of Industry, which allows 3-6 players and plays in approximately 20-25 minutes per player, is a rich worker-placement/resource-management Euro-style game.&#10;&#10;",

They choose two of the non-white dice, then write the value on each die in an empty space on their player sheet matching the color of the die. (The player sheet shows scoring blocks made of four colored squares; each block has a value in the center, e.g. 6, 14, or 20.) All other players write the value on the white die in any empty space on their player sheet.&#10;&#10;If you fill the four colored squares of a block, and the sum of the numbers you wrote matches the value at the center of that block, circle that value; you'll earn that many points at game's end. All other players must X out this block and no longer write in it. If you fill a block and the numbers sum higher than the value, cross out the value; you'll lose 10 points for this block at game's end, but other players can continue to try to score it.&#10;&#10;If you complete and score adjacent blocks, mark out the bridge that connects these blocks. Each marked bridge is worth 5 points. Twice during play, you can discard a number instead of writing, but you lose points equal to the discarded numbers.&#10;&#10;When a player has no more open blocks, each other player takes one final turn rolling solely for themselves, then they cross out the value for all blocks with open spaces, losing 10 points for each one. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Colour Square includes two types of player sheets with different values and slightly different rules.&#10;&#10;",

From foreign invaders to highways in your yard, from Chernobyl to communism, who knows what destiny will throw your way? Fortunately, the Fate cards have your back, giving you powers to make villagers Musicians, improving wedding chances, cause Bar Fights to eliminate your competition, or simply make (and drink) traditional moonshine liquor! Survive the Hard Times and become the richest Boyar of the land!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: You earn money from working the Land, but you also get new babies that turn into villagers that need feeding. When villagers produce too many kids, you should try to marry them off to turn them into productive couples, or risk selling Land to pay for their food and ultimately starve to death.&#10;&#10;Marriage is consensual: roll the dice to see if the villagers want to get married, and use Fate cards to improve your odds (example: Bad Eyesight - improve wedding chance), or reduce them on your competition (example: The Village Idiot - reduce wedding chance). Various Fate cards also have interesting, highly interactive effects on the game: players must congratulate you by paying money when you play the Just Married card, other times they can Steal The Bride, and even break couples using the Trouble In Paradise card. If you make enemies, you can Unleash The Dog to eliminate a villager from another player (or yourself when having trouble feeding them...), and the Village Preacher will gain some income everyone someone dies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For instance, a monster in your hand may be spent to equip a powerful weapon or it can be summoned into the dungeon for you to fight on a later turn.

Jack encounters Cobs, a 437-year old clurichaun (don't call him a leprechaun) who lives alone in a creaky old mansion perched on top of a tree that grows within a tree. Soon Jack learns that his tampering with the long forgotten magic of Mourne has stirred something deep within the heart of the mountains. An ancient wall encircles the center of the Kingdom, a wall that has held strong for centuries, but now the evil it was built to imprison has a plan to escape.&#10;&#10;The Nightmares &mdash; the deepest fears from the darkest corners of Irish Legend &mdash; are being called from their slumber. From the four corners of the Kingdom they come. Their one aim: to tear down the wall and set the Old Ones' Shimnavore free.&#10;&#10;In MourneQuest, a 2-4 player cooperative board game based on the novel MourneQuest by Irish author Garry McElherron, heroes Jack, Cobs, and their friends must battle to banish the Nightmares and save the Kingdom of Mourne. As they race towards their goal, they gather power from the land itself, with granite, blackthorn, flax and gold fueling their quest and magical items to boost their skills. But even the BogBeans, the normally elusive faerie folk of the dark forests and marshlands, seem set to block their path.&#10;&#10;Together the heroes face an epic struggle to escape the BogBeans, dispel the Nightmares, and finally defeat the Shimnavore.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Partizan is a two-player, intermediate-complexity, historical simulation of the struggle between the Communists and the Axis occupation forces for mastery of Yugoslavia from 1941 through 1944. It starts with the first uprisings against the Axis in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro in late 1941, and ends in late 1944 just before the Soviet Army entered the country. The game is won by the Partisan player by waging an aggressive guerilla war: harassing the occupiers and destroying infrastructure that may be of use to them: warehouses, fuel dumps, bridges, dams, depots, railroads, viaducts, motor pools, etc (each represented by variably placed counters). &ldquo;Resource hexes&rdquo; represent strategic mineral deposits, such as bauxite, copper and chromium, which the Axis player must protect, along with routes from them back to Germany, while also guarding possible invasion beaches along the coast.&#10;&#10;During the game, the exact strengths of Partisan units are mostly unknown by the Axis player (via &ldquo;tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;untried&rdquo; counter-sides). He must attempt to head off Partisan operations while never certain exactly where they&rsquo;re headed. The Partisan player must select his targets carefully in order to disrupt the occupation enough for him to win the game, while avoiding becoming surrounded and destroyed by the Germans in the process.&#10;&#10;The counter-mix includes the full German, Italian, Hungarian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ustashi orders of battle, as well as all the Partisan forces and Marshall Tito himself (the Chetniks are handled abstractly). The Partisans may even expect support from the Anglo-Allies if the guerilla war against the Axis is going well, including possibly an amphibious invasion by the Anglo-Americans (&ldquo;Operation Armpit&rdquo;). In fact, most of the main Axis' operations in Yugoslavia historically pertained to the protection of their coastal flank. Their primary anti-partisan offensives were intended to clear the guerrillas from the coastal areas where an Allied invasion was possible. In game terms, the &quot;Allied Landing Scare&quot; rule simulates the reality of German strategic fears in the Balkans.&#10;&#10;Axis forces, especially the Germans, are generally stronger than the partisans, but the partisans are elusive and difficult to catch, often forcing the Axis player to spread thin his forces. Partizan has been designed by Javier Romero (Triple Alliance War, Spanish Civil War) and developed by Eric Harvey (AETO, APTO &amp; AOI). It contains one 34x22&rdquo; extra-large-hex map and 228 iconic and NATO-style counters. Units of maneuver are brigades and divisions. There is one grand campaign scenario, which can be completed by two players in about five or six hours. Solitaire play is doable.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Thin Red Line is a detailed tactical treatment of Napoleonic warfare. Waterloo was the final and most decisive land battle of the Napoleonic Wards, and possibly the most famous battle of all time. Napoleonic warfare was complex in its variety, and victory or defeat depended on the successful application of such diverse factors as organization and command control, leadership and training, formation and position, firepower, combined arms tactics, luck, and, especially, morale. These aspects of the Battle of Waterloo are accurately modeled in this game. Can you, as the Iron Duke of Wellington, hold the French at bay until night or the Prussians arrive? Can you, as Blucher, old &quot;Vorwarts,&quot; drive forward in time to save the day?&#10;&#10;Every unit that participated in the historical battle is represented--British, Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian, Nassau, Brunswick, King's German Legion, French, and Prussian infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The rules cover all the key factors in the battle, line, column, square, and ordere-mixte formations, skirmishers, routing and rallying, leader effects and casualties, cavalry reaction and recall, artillery capture and recapture, hidden units, fatigue, the elan and mobility of the French infantry columns, and the firepower and staying power of the &quot;thin red line&quot; of British infantry.&#10;&#10;Scale: 300 yards per hex; 30 minutes per turn; brigade and division-sized combat units.&#10;&#10;",

By creating large Rooms of the same type, players will increase their chances to find clues about the Artifact position. Placing or not, particular game Rooms, from Library to Trap Rooms, or Treasure, Healing, Monster Rooms, will determine their chance of survival.&#10;Activating the Tombs Rooms, players will be able to fight mighty Bosses and find Clues. Combining Clues, they will discover the Artefact position, and if they will able to take it and escape from the Temple in time, they will win.&#10;Escape? Not so easy! After entering the Temple, the Entrance collapsed. So players must find a secondary exit. Different in each game, an ancient Map will reveal the path they have to take to find it. &#10;The game can last up to 14 rounds. In every round, the opponents will be stronger and more challenging to win.&#10;&#10;You can play the game also in PvP mode. In this case, one or more hidden players will try secretly to win alone, distract the rest of the party on a false path, and grab the Artifact. This kind of game adds a lot of RPG aspects to the game.&#10;&#10;Each Hero has their powers and abilities and can improve them during the game, gaining experience points, choosing how: by this way, each Hero is different in every game. Magic Items, potions, weapons will improve and differentiate each character more.&#10;&#10;The Lost Artifact is one of the 100 different Adventures of the game!

Each turn, players take an action and play a fate card that makes an event more likely to happen as well as a target more likely for the event. Actions include foraging for food, scavenging for valuables washed up ashore, and lighting the signal fire. Of course, it might be easier to forage for food in your neighbor's stockpile. Conflicts are resolved by comparing total size on each side of a fight. A random card is added to each side's total.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, look to see if a boat was sighted and the signal fire lit. If the players aren't yet rescued, Fate will deal a blow to somebody, then everybody must either eat food or take a wound.&#10;&#10;Secret love and hate determines victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Once all actions are resolved, players take back their action cards and a new turn begins.&#10;&#10;One of the action cards (the shopping card) allows players to spend money to buy special upgrades on the Summit Shopping Center board to help them achieving their goal. Those upgrades are available in limited quantities and can help you win in multiple ways.&#10;&#10;If one or more players accumulate or surpass 25 fortune points at the end of a turn, the game ends.

There are 6 scenarios and one to play as solitaire.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic is compatible with the games in the Cry Havoc series. Each counter represents one person with some of the Krobs taking more than one hex.&#10;&#10;Part of the Cry Havoc series.&#10;&#10;",

Such an object is so valuable that even the Daleks cannot agree how best to wield it, and have split into renegade armies, each as cunning and determined as the next.&#10;&#10;In Risk: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, you'll play as one of five different armies, either classic (black, bronze or silver) or New Dalek Paradigm (red or yellow) as you invade Earth seeking the ancient weapon. Only once all opposition has been wiped out can you begin the search. Will you be the last Dalek army left? Watch out for the TARDIS sweeping round the board to defend Earth!&#10;&#10;As you fight for supremacy, the Doctor will do his best to stop you, bringing peace to a different territory each turn, and if your army is not victorious by his eleventh regeneration, then the battle is over and all Daleks must retreat as the Oncoming Storm saves the Earth.&#10;&#10;With special power cards to boost your forces or destroy your opponents' plans, and special missions to defeat other invading forces, this game of Risk is an epic battle for control of the Earth...and the universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Namibia, players represent mining corporations who are looking to mine commodities - diamonds, gold, silver and copper - and attempt to transport them to ports to sell at the highest possible price. In order to achieve their aims, players have to bribe (via an auction) colonial government officials who control access to the interior and to the ports.&#10;&#10;1884: First sources of various commodities have been discovered: gold, silver, copper and diamonds as well. The colonial government has issued concessions to enterprises which shall build up the necessary infrastructure to deliver the commodities and transport them to the coast. Who will place their rigs in the right place? Who will be able to sell the commodities for the highest price? The game board shows a map of Namibia with a hex grid.&#10;&#10;Access to the interior allows a player to develop the country&rsquo;s rail infrastructure which is required to move commodities to ports in order to sell and make money. And money buys reputation, which gets more expensive to acquire as the game goes on. Players also need to construct and complete their mines and prospect for ore.&#10;&#10;However, too much bribery leads to a decrease in reputation which affects a player&rsquo;s position at the end of the game, but limited access to the transport and shipping infrastructure will seriously impact a player&rsquo;s ability to make money.&#10;&#10;Selecting the right time to ship and sell is the key, because the market can be manipulated by other players. The winner will be the player who can make loads of money while keeping a good market reputation. The player with the highest reputation wins.&#10;&#10;This is the second game of the &quot;Edition Bohrt&uuml;rme&quot; (after 'Schwarzes Gold') that uses the game pieces of 'Giganten' (Kosmos). It is the winning titles in the categorie &quot;more complex games&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Each animal is represented by a cardboard cutout that has a raised, second level to identify the animal's mouth.

The player scoops up some amount of food from the supply (which has a mix of red and green tokens), reaches out their hand, and tries to place the food in an animal's mouth. Any food that falls out or doesn't match the animal's needs is placed in the giant's intestinal tract. The die roll might let other players give advice (&quot;Move left! Pull your hand back!&quot;) or allow the player to recover one bit of food or otherwise receive aid during the round.&#10;&#10;",

To go forward, you&rsquo;ll need to elaborate your strategy, listen to each other, and trust the Captain of the turn.

To start the game, deal each player a row of eight cards face down.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take either the top card of the deck or the discard pile, then place the card in the proper place in your row &mdash; a 1 goes in the first spot, a 2 in the second spot, etc. &mdash; as long as the card you're replacing is face down. Reveal that face-down card, and if you can place it in your row &mdash; again, replacing only a face-down card &mdash; then do so. If you reveal a frog, it's a joker that can serve as any number. If, for example, you place a frog in the 4 spot, reveal a 6, then place the 6 and reveal a 4, you can place the 4, then move the frog to a different face-down spot. If you reveal trash or a number you already have face up, discard it to end your turn.&#10;&#10;If you have eight face-up cards in a row, each other player takes one final turn, then you start a new round, and all players who completed their row are dealt only seven cards instead of eight. Now you have to get only seven cards in a row to win the round, but all 8s count as trash for you, possibly making it harder for you to do so. Keep playing rounds until someone gets down to a row of only one card, completing it with a 1 or a frog. That player wins when they do so, and multiple players can win if they complete their one-card row in the same round.&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Players use colorful dice to represent armies of different fantasy species which battle to control essential terrain in this fast-rolling game. Although primarily played as a 2-player game, any number of players can join the struggle. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game, or you may try to obliterate your opponent's dice. Spells and layered strategies benefit certain races as you try to control the odds in this dynamic game full of surprises!&#10;&#10;Players build their initial forces based on a point system; 24, 30, 36, and 60 points are common point systems, with most standard constructed tournaments using 36 point army builds. Forces are composed of small (1-point), medium (2-point), and large (3-point) 6-sided units and 10-sided monsters (4-point), with 2 terrain dice representing the terrains being battled over, and a summoning pool with dragons, dragonkin, and minor terrains which can all be summoned into play during battle.&#10;&#10;'CHANGES IN FOURTH EDITION'&#10;This game system entry is for the fourth edition of the rules. The game is backwards compatible with all past dice releases except for the King's Die, the first promo die to be retired from the game. Here is a summary of changes from prior versions of the rules.&#10;- Charge and Routing rules have been removed.&#10;- Species abilities have been aligned according to the elements that make up a species and matching it with the elements of the terrain the units are at.&#10;- Death species abilities are now tied to having dead units in the Dead Unit Area (DUA)&#10;- Changes to Species abilities (see current rules for details)&#10;- Revised minor rules. Minors can be brought in if only one element matches the major terrain, and elements present in the minor terrain contribute to species abilities.&#10;- Overhaul of spells and Special Action Icons (SAIs). See the latest spells and SAI reference pages in the rules for new spells and SAI effects.&#10;- New dice have been added such as hybrid dragons and white dragons, new minor terrains, new major terrains, and new species.&#10;- The order of steps in a round has been revised.&#10;- Many force build rules have been removed. There is no longer a limit to the number of magic units or Eldarim Champions allowed in a build.&#10;- Army point costs to include items have been reduced.&#10;- Magic ID doubling has been removed.&#10;- 8th Face bonuses changed to double all ID results (and only ID results.&#10;&#10;",

By the same designer and uses the same system as Ironbottom Sound.  Gunfire is figured in factors, and an ordered-pair dice roll determines number of hits based on factors firing and range.  The location of each hit is then determined by another ordered-pair dice roll.  A hit on a location knocks it out unless the location has armor superior to the shell which hit it, and most destroyers have no armor.  Torpedos are handled similarly, but must travel to their target before possible hits are determined.&#10;&#10;Ship plan sheets for typical WWI and WWII turret layouts are provided.  Players must fill these out from the ship stat sheets prior to playing.&#10;&#10;Thirteen historical and two hypothetical scenarios are provided, along with extensive ship stats lists.

This allows them to fire torpedoes or lasers at the enemy, manoeuvre around the map, adjust their shields, and other actions unique to their chosen starfighter.&#10;&#10;Players must balance the pressure of real-time play while making good tactical and strategic decisions.  The game only ends when one starfighter is destroyed. The pilot that hits the finishing blow gets all the glory and is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Collect Flocks of Sheep, keep them safe from Attacks, and use Action cards to destroy anyone that gets in your way!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards to collect matching sets of disguised Sheep and a variety of powerful Action cards. When a player has collected 3 Sheep of a kind, they must be placed face up on the table immediately. This set of 3 Sheep is called a Flock. In a 4 player game, the first person to collect 4 unique Flocks is the winner.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player may use as many Action cards as they like by playing them to the Discard. They may also make one trade with the Field per turn. The Field is a constantly changing group of cards in the middle of the table that players can exchange cards with to help them build a strong hand. The Field guarantees that the game isn&rsquo;t completely luck of the draw and allows the player to strategize and build combo moves in order to progress their game.&#10;&#10;Players can also target an opponent's Flock by placing an Expose card on top of it. This Action exposes the Flock's disguise, leaving them vulnerable to an Attack! Players must choose to take the risk of leaving their Flock exposed or pay to remove the Expose card, ensuring the Flock's identity remains a secret. When an Attack card is drawn, all Exposed Flocks are destroyed!&#10;&#10;Be strategic and be devious. If you play your cards right, you can turn the Attack card into an extremely powerful tool to help you get ahead... otherwise, you may end up as the victim.&#10;&#10;If you find yourself falling behind, don't worry! All players are in it until the very end and one big move is all it takes to flip the whole game on its head!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Or sometimes after a long day of 18xx only few players remain, who want to play another short 18xx-game. &#10;Although there are a large number of 18xx-games already, there are only few 18xx-games for three players. &#10;Therefore I decided to develop this game. I chose Namibia because my little sister lived there several years and sent me a lot of information and historical maps. &#10;The main theme of this game is not complex railroad construction. The number of brown tiles is limited, so that there will be no useless delay in the end of the game (when everything has been decided). Many hexes of the plan probably won't be used, but this is realistic in view of the Namibian geography.'&#10;&#10;",

Will you be able to make the highest cake?&#10;The object of the game is to make the highest cake (10 layers) according to the orders you receive, keeping in mind that balance plays an important role.&#10;&#10;Players place their Plates on their hands. On top of these Plates, they will stack the layers of their cakes depending on the Order card (one layer, two layers&hellip;). In order to do so, each player draws 2 Sponge Cake cards and places them in a way they can put a Frosting card on top of the Sponge cake. In following turns, they will stack layers on top of the ones that are already on their Plates.&#10;&#10;The game ends when at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:&#10;&bull;    A player makes a 10 layer cake, without it collapsing, and rings the bell.&#10;&bull;    The Order deck runs out of cards. In that case, players tally their points. The player with the most points wins the game (Order cards grant points according to their difficulty).&#10;In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.&#10;Remember! There are 2 strategies to get the victory:&#10;&bull;    Stack the layers very quickly, with a high risk that your cake will collapse,&#10;&bull;    Or make the cake slowly in order to get the 10 layers.&#10;&#10;La pasteler&iacute;a del Chef Sweeter est&aacute; a todo gas.

Para ello, toman dos cartas plegadas de bizcocho, y las colocan de tal forma que puedan poner sobre ellas una carta redonda de cobertura. En turnos posteriores, construir&aacute;n pisos sobre los que ya tuvieran en su bandeja.&#10;&#10;El juego termina cuando se cumpla, al menos, una de estas condiciones:&#10;&bull; Un jugador elabore una tarta de 10 pisos sin que se caiga y pulse el timbre.&#10;&bull; Se terminen todas las cartas de pedido. En este caso, se cuentan los puntos conseguidos por cada jugador y gana quien m&aacute;s puntos haya obtenido. (Las cartas de pedido tienen puntos seg&uacute;n su dificultad).&#10;En caso de empate, se comparte la victoria. Recuerda que existen 2 estrategias para conseguir la victoria:&#10;&bull; Elaborando pisos de la tarta r&aacute;pidamente, con mucho riesgo de que se caiga, o&#10;&bull; construyendo la tarta despacio con el fin de llegar a 10 pisos.&#10;&#10;",

That era saw the beginning of a naval technology revolution that set the pace for Western expansion over the next two centuries. The game can be played by two, three or four, each representing a different nation: Netherlands, England, Spain and France.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents one year. Each operations phase represents several weeks of campaigning, depending on the overall tempo of operations at any given time. Each ship unit represents six to 12 vessels. Each regiment represents about 1,000 men. The game system is an evolution of the one used in our earlier games: 1066, Hannibal&rsquo;s War, andFrederick&rsquo;s War.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: initiative, revenue, negotiations, outfitting and reinforcements, fleet organization, fog of war, plunder, leaders, treasure fleets, founding colonies, pirates, ship ratings, gunnery, damage repair, forts, neutrality and belligerence, prize money, mercenaries, raking attack, line ahead tactics, marines, articles of war, company charters, honors of war, letters of marque, circumnavigation, the wind gauge, fire ships, admirals, and more.

Each player controls one or more ships, each of which have a &quot;Ship Systems Display&quot; (a la Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars).  The game contains statistics for most major classes of ships from Destroyer to Battleship from 1901 through WWII for several navies worldwide.  Ships are moved in impulses and may fire one or more weapons each impulse.  Hits are determined by dice, followed by checking armor penetration (which falls off by range).  If a hit penetrates, random ship systems are destroyed (rolled on a Damage Allocation Table).  Victory is by scenario.&#10;&#10;Battlewagon was originally released as a &quot;Pocket Game&quot; in 1981.  It was later released in a &quot;Folio&quot; Second Edition in 1984 with some development work.&#10;&#10;",

And the farther you get into the game, and the madder your cultists get, the less chance you have of the dice actually showing the results you need.

In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card they like, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as they like; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Haithabu is named after an important trading settlement located at the southern end of the Jutland Peninsula (on what's today the border of Denmark and Germany) that the Vikings used from the 8th to the 11th centuries. Its location on the Baltic and North Seas and on the trade routes between Scandinavia and the Frankish Empire led to goods from around the known world &mdash; such as the Baltics, Baghdad, and Constantinople &mdash; being traded here.&#10;&#10;The subject of constant wars and changes of power, as well as the progressive Christianization of those in the north, Haithabu &mdash; known as &quot;Hedeby&quot; in English &mdash; had a rich history that ended in 1050 when the Norwegian king sacked and burned the town in a conflict with Denmark.&#10;&#10;As Vikings, players trade with all the known world while also living through the changes and dark days at the end of the Early Middle Ages. In the game, players take turns performing individual actions on an action rondel, and what's most critical in the game is the timing of the actions because in each round each color of action can be selected only once. Players must react to market price changes and event dice that can cause complications.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Premise:Based on the classic Solitaire, Cavern Shuffle is a solo-player dungeon delver game where the player must level up their party in order to uncover the dark twists and turns of the dungeon. Using familiar mechanics, players will uncover useful Items, overcome Obstacles and defeat the Boss Encounter to win!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Setup:The setup is very similar to the Classic Solitaire with the seven piles ranging from 1 to 7 in front of you forming the Dungeon and the rest of the cards in the Explore (or Hand) pile. These will be introduced into the game by flipping up three at a time. The key difference in the setup is that the Minotaur will start face up in the first pile of the Dungeon, and the Short Rest will sit above it forming your inventory.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How it Works:Play will be centered around forming sequences with your four (4) Adventurers and leveling them up into the Party piles at the top. Leveling up your Adventurers will in turn help you complete different Encounters in the Dungeon until you are strong enough to beat the Minotaur and win the game!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Adventurers:Think suits in a standard deck of cards! There are four (4) Adventurers in the game that will make up your Party; Two (2) will be the Lawful alignment (&ldquo;suits&rdquo;), and two (2) will be Chaotic. Each Adventurer will have cards ranging from Level 1 to 10 that can be used in sequences and be leveled-up by being transferred to the top. Each sequence in the Dungeon will operate the same, alternating between Lawful and Chaotic.&#10;&#10;As you transfer these Adventurer cards to the top (Party pile) the highest card will indicate the Adventurer&rsquo;s Individual Level. The combined numbers are added together to determine the Party Level.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Items:In every good dungeon crawl there is bound to be loot. In Maze of the Minotaur, players will begin with one starting item, and three found as you traverse through the Dungeon.&#3;As you find items, you may set them aside and wait to use them when the time is right. Each item may only be used once. You will begin the game with a Short Rest.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Encounters:In Cavern Shuffle: Maze of the Minotaur, you&rsquo;ll have two kinds of Encounters, Obstacle Encounters, and Enemy Encounters. Obstacle Encounters leverage the unique skills of each Party member, whereas Enemy Encounters affect the entire party.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Obstacle Encounters:There are four (4) Obstacle Encounters tailored to one of the four (4) Adventurers. In order to move through the space, your party member must be a high enough level to pass. The difficulty is indicated based on how many times an Obstacle Encounter has been previously completed in order of Level 1/3/5/7. Once completed, place off to the side out-of-play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Enemy Encounters:On an Enemy Encounter, there will be a number located on the card that will indicate the Party Level sum needed in order to pass through. If your Party Level is equal to or greater than the Enemy Encounter, you are able to move through the Encounter uncovering the following card. Once completed, place off to the side out-of-play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Minotaur:Beginning face up in the first pile of the Dungeon, the Minotaur will be this game&rsquo;s Boss Enemy Encounter. The Minotaur has a unique mechanic whereby every time an Adventurer is leveled up, the Minotaur moves one pile over &mdash; blocking whatever space they occupy&shy; &mdash; until they reach the farthest corridor in the Dungeon.&#10;&#10;When the Minotaur reaches the seventh corridor, it will flip over. On its next move, it will continue in the opposite direction until it reaches the other end. When your Party Level is equal to or greater than the Minotaur&rsquo;s power of 30, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to buy the goods on your shopping list before your guests arrive.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the goods in stores are rationed, and the number and kind of ration cards distributed rarely corresponds with what you need. Instead those cards might land in the hands of other players.
