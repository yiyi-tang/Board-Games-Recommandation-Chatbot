    "Description": "In Wolf in Disguise, players seek to wreak havoc at the peaceful ranch. Each player is a Shepherd who tries to gain the most profit on the ranch. Player can hire wolf to attack other player's sheep or raise shepherd dog to protect his own sheep. However, to make the game interesting, all the wolves are disguised as sheep.&#10;&#10;Wolf in disguise is a game derived from the famous book, The Art of War - Thirty-Six Stratagems thought by some to be written by Sun Tzu. The idea came from the twentieth Stratagem in the book, &quot;Fish in troubled water.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The set &quot;&Ouml;sterreich&quot; contains historical events which are related to Austria. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Austria edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Do traditional institutions and values constitute restraints on freedom and individual dignity or are they its essential bulwarks?&#10;&#10;&#10;Are slaves, women, and Jews entitled to the &ldquo;rights of man&rdquo;?  Is violence a legitimate means of changing society or of purging it of dangerous enemies?  In wrestling with these issues, students consult Jean-Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s Social Contract and Edmund Burke&rsquo;s Reflections on the Revolution in France, among other texts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spitting Fire is a pseudo-historical game of aerial combat, set during the turbulent years of World War II.&#10;&#10;Between 1939 and 1945, nearly the entire globe became entangled in the most expansive and destructive conflict ever seen. Although responsible for unimaginable terror and tragedy, the war also gave birth to innovation and invention on an unprecedented scale.&#10;&#10;With Spitting Fire, players can take control of the aircraft forged in this crucible of conflict, and battle each other in skies the world over! We should state at the outset that those who are aching for a historically-accurate, painstakingly-researched, richly-detailed simulation of World War II dogfights should probably look elsewhere. While such games can be exciting, they aren&rsquo;t what we had in mind. However, if you want a fast-playing, fun game that gives a nod to history without getting bogged down in historical minutiae, then Spitting Fire is for you.&#10;&#10;Spitting Fire is designed to be used with any scale from 1:700 to 1:72 (although larger scales will require a substantial playing area). The rulebook includes data cards for 25 of the most famous fighters from World War II, with others to be released soon!&#10;&#10;",

Will the British transfer power to the Indian National Congress, which claims to speak for all Indians?  Or will a separate Muslim state&mdash;Pakistan&mdash;be carved out of India to be ruled by Muslims, as the Muslim League proposes?  And what will happen to the vulnerable minorities&mdash;such as the Sikhs and untouchables&mdash;or the hundreds of princely states?  As British authority wanes, smoldering tensions among Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs increasingly flare into violent riots that threaten to ignite all India.  Towering above it all is the frail but formidable figure of Gandhi, whom some revere as an apostle of non-violence and others regard as a conniving Hindu politician.  Students struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building&mdash;perhaps the most intractable and important issue of the modern world.  Texts include the literature of Hindu revival (Chatterjee, Tagore and Tilak); the Koran and the literature of Islamic nationalism (Iqbal); and the writings of Ambedkar, Nehru, Jinnah, and Gandhi.&#10;&#10;As in other Reacting to the Past games, participants are given secret role sheets with victory objectives.  Debate and negotiation are the major mechanics used in this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Description: Henry VIII and the Reformation Parliament transforms students into lords and commoners and members of the English parliament during the tumultuous years of 1529-1536.  Cardinal Wolsey has just been dismissed as lord chancellor for failing to obtain from the pope the divorce king Henry is seeking from Catherine of Aragon, his wife of twenty years.  Thomas More is named as Wolsey&rsquo;s replacement.  More presides over a newly summoned parliament, which the king hopes will somehow find the legal means to annul his marriage to Catherine, thus allowing him to proceed with his plans to marry Anne Boleyn and have by her a male heir.  But will parliament find the means, and will it be satisfied with solving the king&rsquo;s marital and dynastic problems?  There are some in parliament who wish to use the royal divorce, as well as the rising anti-clericalism in the land, to effect a split from Rome and a conversion of England from Catholicism to Protestantism.  Other members oppose the divorce, oppose making the king head of the English church, and, most of all, oppose this new, heretical creed filtering in from the continent.  More is their leader, for as long as he can survive.  Thomas Cromwell leads the king&rsquo;s party.  One problem is that the king is ambivalent about the reform effort unleashed by his so called &ldquo;great matter,&rdquo; and so the conservatives are free to prosecute reformers as heretics, while the reformers are free to prosecute conservatives as traitors.  Conservatives are liable to this charge because their frustration at home tempts them to consider petitioning the king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor to invade England on behalf of Catholic Europe.  The game reaches its dramatic climax around the trial of Anne Boleyn, staged as a grand contest between opposing parties, which parties actually are multiple and fluid.  All roles are individualized and most are historically based.  At issue is the clash of four contending ideas:  medieval Catholicism, Lutheranism, Renaissance humanism, and Machiavellian statecraft.  Students read works representative of all traditions.&#10;&#10;",

The background of the game is as follows:&#10;&#10;The planet Xioc has endured major wars throughout decades of time. The life sustainable resources of the planet have returned to their raw element forms. Air, food, water and plant life is scarce, and only a few humans have survived this mass devastation. Nano-technologies, more specifically molecular sized robots called nanots, were invented prior to the apocalyptic destruction. These self replicating machines along with a special material called nanite is the only way that humans have been able to synthesize small life sustainable ecosystems across the planet. Nanite is found in only trace amounts on the planet and is considered extremely valuable.&#10;&#10;Factions and tribes of people living in anarchy, fight for what meager nanite remains. War is no longer waged in taking the life of another human directly, but is decided through nano-engineered war battle arenas. A small amount of battle nanite is used with nanots and pattern cards to create virtual creatures that fight for their tribe. The prize is to win the precious collection nanite that will allow the tribe to continue living.&#10;&#10;You are the leaders of your respective clans and are battling to keep your family alive!

Dice on the Inside track move the number of spaces rolled and try to get back to the Outside track.  Dice on the Outside track have more interesting movement options -- (a) move the number rolled, (b) roll 2,3,4,5 and move to that space on the Outside track if it is empty, (c) match a number showing on an opponents dice and take it's place while moving it to the Inside track, (d) roll one less than a number showing on another dice and move to the space just in front of that dice, (e) roll one more than a a number showing on another dice and move to the space just behind that dice.  Any move that causes one to land on an opponent's dice, moves that dice to the Inside track. &#10;The game goal is to land one's dice on one's GOAL space on the Oustside track. Each time a player scores a goal, he moves the scoring cube one stage on the scoring track towards his High Stage.  The scoring track is in the shape of an X.  The four tips of the X are the High Stage for each player.  The center of the X is the Zero Stage.  If another player scores first, a second scoring player would move the scoring cube back to the Zero Stage.  From the Zero Stage, a player would win by scoring 3 consecutive goals.&#10;There is also a short version of the game where the scoring cube is not used and the first player to 3 goals wins.&#10;&#10;",

The city sites are placed at the intersection of hexagonal pieces which have numbers on them, and each turn dice are rolled and cities adjacent to pieces with the rolled numbers produce resources, just as in CATAN. Also as in Settlers, players trade resources with each other and then use them to build roads and bridges. Unlike Settlers, Twin Cities uses three dice with 1-5 and a question mark on the faces; rolling question marks gives you action cards, and rolling certain combinations has special effects.&#10;&#10;Game contents include:&#10;12 city pieces&#10;66 interlocking plastic board pieces&#10;8 board frame pieces&#10;360 resource cards&#10;85 action cards&#10;72 road pieces&#10;24 bridge pieces&#10;3 dice&#10;1 board piece bag&#10;&#10;",

As it is conceived as a free give away (on occasion of the 2006 Worldcup in Germany) it consists only of those 54 cards (no rules, only cards in shrinkwrap). These are to few for a regular game, but can be added to any other games of the series.&#10;&#10;In 2008, this expansion was included in &quot;Anno Domini - Jubil&auml;ums Metallbox&quot;, a metal box designed to hold 8 regular Anno Domini games. It has no own entry on BGG.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Avoiding the usual omnipresent control that players are so often allowed over the minutiae of battle, Le Feu Sacr&eacute; concentrates on encouraging historically correct grand tactics. Also included are historical orders of battle for 8 example Corps d'Armee.&#10;&#10;The rules use the familiar TooFatLardies card driven system. The Lardies' emphasis on battlefield &quot;friction&quot; allows the better, bolder generals to take the initiative, and recover from unexpected reverses, whilst less competent, cautious commanders need to stick to predictable battle plans, or risk coming unstuck. We present to you a set of rules where Austrian troops can be the equal of the French, but the Empire can still repeat history! Vive l'Empereur!&#10;&#10;",

The system allows a player to assume the role of Prussia, Sardinia, France, or Austria  to see if they can successfully blend war and peace to attain their national objectives &mdash; objectives which can and will conflict with those of the other nation-states involved.  The system also allows two and three player games, which challenges the player through the shifting of national alliances and the blending of nationalistic objectives.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Contents&#10;&#10;&#10;    22x34&quot; full-color map&#10;    280 1/2&quot; die-cut counters&#10;    176 5/8&quot; die-cut counters&#10;    110 Action cards&#10;    Rules Booklet&#10;    Two Player Aid Cards&#10;    Four Power Display Cards&#10;    Four 6-sided Dice&#10;    Bookcase Box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Urmel&quot; is a dinosaur-character from a favored movie series for children. In this game &quot;Urmel&quot; is hunted by evil character  &quot;King Pumponell&quot;. Hexagon tiles are laid out and the King starts at one end, Urmel &amp; his friends on the other. It's a racing game, where either Urmel &amp; his friends win by reaching their lair or by the Pumponell-team by catching Urmel. Movement is controlled by dice. The interesting mechanic is, that once one of the friends-characters is caught by Pumponell, the player now joins Pumponells team (in the form of a second &quot;servant&quot;-figure).&#10;&#10;",
