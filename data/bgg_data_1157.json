Mostly, that&rsquo;s true &ndash; but still, there is a wise core in the events around token matches, something interesting to think about.&#10;&#10;Powerful creatures, gods from various real-world mythologies feel a lack of humans&rsquo; faith. There are not so many people around the globe, who still believe in personalities from ancient legends. That faith is a kind of energy that keeps all those gods alive and supports their might. Getting more faith is the reason for the War of Gods to happen, so it takes place on the game board.&#10;Matches of this game happen on a hexagon board with many small internal hexagons to place playing pieces on.&#10;&#10;Three players participate in one battle. The initial step for each of them is a potential sacrifice &ndash; players put a token to the central area, an altar. A winner of this match will be able to take all the tokens from the altar or to craft with them a new one.&#10;&#10;To play the match, players get from their collections three tokens each. One by one, participants make their turns, placing a token to the entry point. These tokens are various creatures with three different battle actions. Each token can make a specific number of steps on the game board.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win a match in the Altar game:&#10;&#10;by clearing the game board from all the other tokens &ndash; through battles with them.&#10;by surrounding the central hexagon (the altar) with a specific number of your tokens.&#10;&#10;",

It is a fun take-that game where you get to use a bit of strategy and have to submit to a bit of chance as well. Everyone gets two moves per turn, and you can pick up or play cards on each turn. There are also drop cards which act as curve balls that you have to deal with. You can't keep drop cards in your hand, they have to be played as soon as they are drawn from the deck. The game goes on until the draw pile is empty, and then everyone gets one last move before you count up the territory card points to see who has won.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Anything goes in this game.&#10;&#10;&#10;        HOW TO PLAY&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;A turn consists of players using money they've earned to play 2 cards from their hand of 5 cards. Once the 2 cards are played and replaced from the deck, their turn is over.&#10;&#10;Depending on what two cards were played a variety of things could have  happened. If someone played a criminal activity or trade card, they got money from either the black market or another player. If a defense card was played then it was used to defend the headquarters or a business. If an offense card was played then another player was attacked. If a business card was played then the player gained a new way to generate money each turn. All this while negotiating deals with other players and trading cards and money. And any deals made, can be broken. This is the criminal underworld after all.&#10;&#10;&#10;        HOW TO WIN&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to be the last player standing. Do this by eliminating all other criminal organizations. You eliminate a criminal organization by bringing their power down to zero. Once all other players are eliminated you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;        GAME STORY&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The criminal underworld of Palm City has been operating without interruption since the city was first founded. The criminal way of life is sewn into the fabric of these people&rsquo;s culture. Due to this, both the city and the criminal underworld within it have thrived. Leaving plenty of room for each sector of crime to have its own fully operational organization with its own established leader. All cyber crimes are initiated by the Shadow Crew. Weapons coming into the city go through Hell&rsquo;s Angels. Drugs are manufactured and distributed by Los Zetas. Protection is given to businesses from the Buscetta Family. The art of assassinations are strictly Yamiguchi-Gumi. And lastly prostitution is an option in this city. The girls are protected and managed by The Richardson Gang. That was before, this is now. Business can only get so good without expansion, and with the city&rsquo;s potential capped out, there is only one option for bringing in more money. Start dipping into the other sectors of crime. With the Buscetta Family selling drugs and Shadow Crew dealing weapons it is only a matter of time until someone feels like they&rsquo;ve been wronged. A matter of time until they feel their piece of the pie is getting smaller. That&rsquo;s when war begins. And when the dust settles, only one organization will be left standing. Times are changing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Criminal Underworld.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two players will barricade their king, using colored pieces and blocks. Then, the players will take turns flicking their pieces to change position, eliminate enemy pieces, and destroy the enemy base. The first player to eliminate the opposing king wins. The game can be played on a table, the floor, or really any flat, solid surface. A perfect Battler ranges from those who enjoy building cool structures, creating offensive and defensive strategy and extreme competition.&#10;&#10;Barrier Battles is fun for all ages (with younger ages, sometimes the game gets a little destructive). A single set of Barrier Battles is good for a 1v1 match, but with the accumulation of multiple sets, players can play larger solo matches, and even team matches.&#10;&#10;In the box, players will receive: 15 red blocks, 15 blue blocks, 5 red pieces, 5 blue pieces, 1 orange piece, 1 purple piece, and a cloth travel bag. A brief set of rules (with pictures) are included on the back of the box, and for a full set of rules and regulations, players can check the official website (displayed on the box).&#10;&#10;With the addition of more sets of Barrier Battles, players can play with more players in one game. While we recommend maximum of 6 players, with appropriate room to play, there is no limit to the number of players in a single game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fundamentally the result of the game depends on your choices, as a good choice can result in a win or otherwise. This is why you have to foresee your opponent&rsquo;s moves and always chose the move that can best counteract your opponent&rsquo;s possible moves or chose moves that can most easily take you to victory.&#10;&#10;The game has numerous possibilities in terms of the order of Turns and many combinations of Game Tiles to create boards that are always different, so that each game can be a totally different experience from previous ones.&#10;&#10;The game can also be varied in scale, due to the adaptiveness of the board to different numbers of players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But now, the story diverges, with a focus on Jack's twin, Simon Sly, who has been recruited to protect the Queen of an African nation from her enemies. In the meantime, can Simon subtly help his brother pull off the most incredible jewel heist in history? With his own life and his duty to protect the queen tugging him every which way at once, can he rise to the challenge?&#10;&#10;Special Operative Simon is a card game akin to traditional Cribbage. In gameplay, there are a series of Target cards valued 9-15, featuring various spies Simon encounters, some more dangerous than others. As you combine a limited supply of 14 cards (valued 2-7 with a variable Ace) against these targets, you will only have the opportunity to retrieve these cards when meeting targets precisely. Therefore, the challenge is to complete all of Simon's missions with a dwindling supply of Combiner cards, and not let the Combiner cards run out too soon.&#10;&#10;While its roots are traditional, the game features character artwork designed to bring players into this world of spies in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are six male characters and six female characters that players will potentially role-play.&#10;&#10;Second, secretly draw one of twelve Hidden Trait cards. These cards give your character more depth. Some are harmless, while some are just plain shitty. The trait card may define your sexuality, religious or political background, or define your awful prejudice. These traits will mold how you subtly discuss random topics throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Next, you will randomly draw a Shitty Habit card that remains public to all other players. These habits can be added to your role-play throughout the game to increase your chance of winning. Examples of habits are mouth breathing, always checking your phone, annoying laugh, etc.&#10;&#10;From this point on all players will discuss ten random Shitty Topics from their perceived character's personality. &#10; To win, engage in lively discussions, complete various tasks, and figure out what personality types the other players are portraying. Who&rsquo;s the shittiest? That&rsquo;s up to you to find out!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For a long time King Gorgasali was nowhere to be seen, therefore people started to believe that he abandoned his throne. As the time went by, tensions between the kingdoms increased and with the absence of a single ruler, dynasties regained their old influences and the world begun to change. Kingdoms fell into a complete chaos, they started to fight for individual gains through immoral acts of violence. Anarchy spread through the veins of ten kingdoms and the world as it was known before - ended. No place was safe in Elbrus and civilization was on the verge of extinction. Few of the distinguished members of all kingdoms created a council of elders to find a solution and bring back the long forgotten peaceful times. The decision was made to find a sole ruler with undeniable virtue to replace the king of the kings and restore the balance. The battle royal was announced and ten kingdoms sent their best warriors, who would fight on the neutral battlefield to become the lone survivor and earn the crown of the King Gorgasali.&#10;&#10;Gorgasali Battle Royale is RPG Battle Royale board game, where you play as a chosen warrior of your kingdom. You start game in random places and collect cards from the chests to fill your inventory. With the better cards you have greater chances to eliminate your opponents. As the game advances you have less place to move without being hurt. The game is full of strategic decisions and variety of possible actions. To win the game you must be the only survivor on the map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Pharmers  gang is offended by your abuse of medicine. You cannot win them.&#10;    &#10;Gambler --&gt; When activated, first discard one of your cards which is in play, Then draw the top card from your deck to replace it. You may then rearrange cards to make optimal use of tools and other modifiers which are in play.&#10;&#10;Merchant --&gt; Exchange can be performed multiple times per round. The dig penalty is permanent and applies to every round.&#10;&#10;Poacher --&gt; Additional food requirements applies even on rounds in which your Refugees don't hunt. Merchants hired without food (such as Hunter) do not add food to the cost if it wasn't there to begin with.&#10;&#10;Crate of Pears (x5) --&gt; This is a timer based tool which starts at zero. Once drawn from your deck, play it from your hand and deployed in your base much as you would a building. At the start of each turn, rotate the card clockwise to represent food thawing (it starts frozen). At any time, trash the card to trade the crate of partially thawed food [0-3] during a hire action.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The end times have arrived, and the dead walk the Earth. As day breaks upon the city streets, brave teams of survivors scrounge for supplies at the edge of the urban sprawl. The disease is virulent, however, and every cache of food and supplies discovered carries the risk of being overtaken by the undead.&#10;&#10;In ZERO SIGNAL Supply Run, you lead a camp of survivors striving to locate supplies in the city and bring them back safely. The zombie threat continues to grow, however, and every discovery carries with it the risk of being attacked and eaten. The object of the game is to collect the most food and supplies before the city streets are overrun completely.&#10;&#10;Supply Run is a fun and simple card game. Cards are laid out face down in a 4x4 grid, and players take turns drawing cards to find food, supplies, weapons, or zombies. Food and supplies are point cards that are added to your hoard or your hand respectively, while weapons can be used to control the emerging zombie threat. Once zombie cards claim an entire row or column, the game is over and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Since a player's hoard is face up on the board, and supplies and weapons are kept in a limited hand, strategies involve keeping zombies at bay until you believe you've amassed the most points, then drawing them out to finish the game. Average play time is around 15 to 20 minutes, and the basic game serves 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As a result, his Majesty Henry VIII &mdash; that famous monarch from the English history books &mdash; has disappeared. Gathered are the characters that were present at the time of the nasty deed. The perpetrator of this heinous crime will no doubt be revealed as the party proceeds.&#10;&#10;HOW IT WORKS:&#10;&#10;This is &quot;mystery&quot; not a &quot;murder mystery&quot;. It is suitable for anyone aged 9 years and upwards and is good, clean fun. This deck is for 8 to 30 guests. There are 3 different endings, each with a different person who did it. Most of the cards support Version A, but there are additions to the report and Who Did It cards for Versions B and C.&#10;&#10;8 SUSPECTS:&#10;&#10;Alice (from Alice&rsquo;s Adventures In Wonderland), Huck Finn, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Little Red Riding Hood, Peter Pan, Goldilocks and Aladdin.&#10;&#10;INCLUDED:&#10;&#10;5 Host Guide Cards: Invitations, D&eacute;cor suggestions, Preparing props (optional), Menu suggestions, Preparing prizes (optional), Running the party, &ldquo;The Rules&rdquo; (4 sides).&#10;30 Nametags / Descriptions and Dress Suggestions&#10; 96 Clue Cards: A1, A2, and A3&#10;3 Special Investigator&rsquo;s Report Cards&#10; 7 Who Did It Cards: Don&rsquo;t let anyone read these before the end of the party.&#10;&#10;RUNNING THE PARTY:&#10;&#10;1 Decide if you are using Version A, B or C. &#10;2 Invite your guests and let them know which character you want them to play. Refer them to a special webpage where they can see their character's description and dress suggestions. Tell your guests to read the suspect descriptions before the party as sometimes clues are hidden in them. &#10;3 Put each nametag card (with description on the back) in a lanyard badge holder and give it to each person as they arrive. &#10;4 Read out the Rules Cards (then leave them on the table for late arrivals).&#10;5 Have the 8 suspects read out their descriptions to the group (but not dress suggestions). &#10;6 Hand out the clue cards. Note who it is to be said by (i.e., either a character or &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; except the suspects it mentions).&#10;7 Most clues are statements. They can say their clue in their own words as long as they don&rsquo;t change the meaning. If someone has a question for a suspect, they will have a response on one of their cards. &#10;8 For small parties of 16 or less guests, there are 3 acts and everyone goes around the group and says a clue and repeats that until all the clues have been said for each act. Anyone can go first as long as it isn't a response card. For larger parties, you ignore the &quot;act numbers&quot; and everyone just mingles and talks about their clue cards.&#10;9 Later a report is read out to the whole group. &#10;10 Everyone should write down who they think did it and how and why they did it. &#10;11 The suspects read out the Who Did It? cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players use both defensive and offensive moves to tilt and roll their own balls into the center goal while keeping their opponent's balls out. The first player to sink all five of their balls wins.&#10;&#10;Alternate play includes adding up to eight pegs to the board for an added obstacle challenge. Players navigate their balls through these obstacles and into the goal. For an additional challenge, the board may also be configured with &quot;bumpers&quot; by adding a rubber band to any pair of obstacle pegs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": " Welcome to Rapture!&#10;&#10;The universe of Rapture offers a profund, intricate and coherent story, which is transmitted thorugh a skirmish tabletop game. The complexity of this universe allows a wide range in difference when it comes to the looks, gameplay and stories of the individual factions which clash against each another due to the most different backgrounds, motivations and origins.&#10;The battles will be carried out by specialized characters of different kinds with various skills. The initiation into the game is very beginner friendly, and with more experience more strategic depth becomes available. The game has proven itself to be thrilling and consequential from the first round to the last.&#10;&#10;This is guaranteed by balanced factions and a wide range of possibilities when it comes to winning the game. Quick interactions between the players that occur in the own or the opponents turn, in form of flexible and influencable actions, result in a very dynamic game. The gameplay can be expanded and heightened with many optional rules and add-ons.&#10;&#10;The universe is in constant expansion and allows for new stories, protagonists and occurrences to appear.&#10;&#10; Why Rapture?&#10;&#10;Rapture is an action-packed, beginner-friendly skirmish wargame for 2-4 players. Choose between entirely different fractions and play asymmetrical missions.&#10;&#10;Exciting, fast-paced games with great tactical depth and an ever-suspenseful outcome await you! Play quick, intensive rounds without having to dedicate an entire day to just one game.&#10;&#10;Rapture takes little time to set up and is no more complicated than a board game! Choose between unique fractions, each with their own characteristics and style of play. Assemble your battlegroups from different units such as heroes, squads, and bands. Activate your units in alternating order. Stay alert when your opponent activates their units and react swiftly with our innovative reaction system. Accomplish your own individual mission or keep your opponent from accomplishing theirs. Win by victory points &ndash; even if your battlegroup has been entirely eliminated.&#10;&#10; Gameplay Highlights&#10;&#10;- Quick and Intense&#10;- Unique factions, individual playing style&#10;- Heroes, Bands and Squads&#10;- Immersive reaction system&#10;- Asymetrical missions&#10;- Engaging addons&#10;- 60-120 Minutes&#10;- 2-4 Players&#10;&#10; Gameplay Description&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds on a 90x90 cm game board. The average game session takes between 60-120 minutes, depending on player experience and add-ons used.&#10;&#10;Each player leads a battlegroup into the battlefield, usually consisting of 3-5 units carrying a total points score of 100.&#10;&#10;All the units at your disposal for this fall into exactly one of the following three unit types:&#10;&#10;The hero, a single-model character. The band, consisting of a leader and one or more apprentices. The squad, which usually includes three models representing the main fighting forces of the fractions.&#10;&#10;Each hero, band leader, and apprentice has their own individual name, and each name can only appear once in a battlegroup. Squads are an exception and can be represented twice within the same battlegroup.&#10;&#10;Each unit has its own profile card with various attributes such as range, resistance, and number of attacks, as well as its individual skills.&#10;&#10;The first activation of each round is dependent on the total initiatives of all remaining units on the playing field. It is thus always clear which player gets to start each round, which can change multiple times over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Special attributes include health points, moral points, as well as action and reaction points. Just like the classic health points, moral points in the game are also represented by a status bar. Both bars can be attacked individually, which, in cases of advanced damage, can carry various bonuses or penalties for the targeted unit. A unit can thus be eliminated in two ways, the difference being that a unit depleted of health points must leave the playing field, while a unit without moral points makes a run for it and escapes. Since certain actions cost moral points, as well, moral represents an important resource in the game.&#10;&#10;Equally significant is the number of actions and reactions. Our game allows for every player to actively take part in the proceedings, so that waiting times are kept to a minimum and the playing time is maximized. The units are activated in turn, and for each of your opponent&rsquo;s actions, you can carry out a corresponding reaction. The number of actions and reactions are available independent of each other, meaning using all of your action points does not lower your ability to react.&#10;&#10;Complete obliteration of your opponent is obviously an advantage, but it does not automatically lead to victory. Every player has an individual mission to accomplish in order to receive victory points. While eliminating enemy units also brings victory points, the missions are more lucrative in this regard, which means that a completely eliminated battlegroup can still win by victory points.&#10;&#10;You can complement the basic rules set with a multitude of additional add-ons to change or amplify the gameplay. Some of these include weather effectsand natural events, times of day and how they change throughout the game,creatures with which you can interact, loot boxes with useful contents, and many more. These add-ons can be used in any combination.&#10;&#10;On top of the standard game, there are also alternative game modes with their own special rules to make sure you never get bored. There is SPLAT!, for instance, where you have to mark as many terrain pieces with your team color as possible, or Catch the Shard, where you must catch an abandoned Angel shard on the playing field and try to hold on to it.&#10;&#10;Rapture can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players with absolutely no problem. You can find all the rules in the rule and story book!&#10;&#10;Story&#10;&#10;Rapture is set in the year 2049 on our Earth, in our timeline of mankind. Two years earlier, in 2047, most of humanity was harvested off the planet by an alien civilization. There is now only a small percentage of humanity left on Earth, the part which was not suitable for this harvest.&#10;&#10;This has created a power vacuum and various secret societies and factions that have been operating in secrecy are taking their chance to step into the light and want to secure their part of this new world. It should be said that our earth has remained largely undamaged, so the angels have not caused a classic apocalypse. Of course, a few things and facilities go down when there are no humans around to take care of them and to maintain them, but the world is still mostly intact - just a lot more deserted.&#10;&#10;With Rapture, we deal with a lot of myths, legends, and also some conspiracy theories, sort of as a &quot;what if.&quot; What if some of them were true or what if some historical event as we know it happened for some unknown and secret reason or cause?&#10;&#10;Through these events, conflicts arise among the factions on Earth and especially with the mysterious angels. These &quot;angels&quot; are namely also responsible for the harvest, among other things, and they want to bring their extraterrestrial mission to an end and clean the remnants of humanity from the planet.&#10;But how could it all come to this? And where do the angels come from anyway?&#10;&#10;In our prologue, which you can also read in its entirety on our website, the two characters Yssantis and Konstantin introduce us to the overall plot.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Othellito strategy card game for two players played on a four by four (4x4) invisible and floating grid. There are eighteen identical cards called captains, which are light on one side and dark on the other.&#10;&#10;The players (starting with the black player) will take turns, placing cards of their assigned colour facing up, to the board. During a play, any cards of the opponent's colour that are in a straight line and bounded by the card just placed and another card of the current player's colour are turned over to the current player's colour.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the majority of cards turned to display your colour when the last playable card is placed.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Deal seven cards to each player. Decide which player will play black and which white. The remaining four cards are placed in a two by two square in the middle of the table in between the players. The cards should alter the white side and black side so that two black card sides and two white card sides are facing upwards. The cards are placed so that the dark is diagonal to the same kind and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The grid&#10;The four by four (4x4) invisible and floating grid is formed by the cards placed and may shift during play. Players must place their card adjacent next to another card on the board. The card could both be placed side to side and corner to corner. As soon as there are four rows of four columns of cards the placement options are limited. You may never place a card so it forms a fifth row or column if you are not able to clear a row or column of cards from the board.&#10;&#10;Clear a column or row&#10;If you place a card in a position so there forms either a fifth row or column, you must remove the opposite row or column. But you could only remove a row or column that consists of as many or fewer cards as you just flipped over. If the row or column on the opposite side is of more cards than you would manage to flip, it could not be removed, and you would not be allowed to place your card in this position. Cards removed from the board is returned to the players' hands. If you are not able to shift the grid, you must place your card within the current.&#10;&#10;Game endings&#10;The game ends when a player cannot place a card so that cards on the table are flipped over OR when the grid is completed and the player can not add a new card. In the latter case, the player would need to be able to shift the grid and remove a column or a row.&#10;&#10;The player with most of its own colour facing up is the winner of the game. If there is a tie of colours facing up, the game ended in a tie.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
