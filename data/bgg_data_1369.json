As a paradise settled by some of Terra's wealthiest citizens, its people wanted for little, and strife was rare for centuries. But like the Hegemony it belonged to, Rocky fell to the darkness of the Amaris years, and saw its killing blows come in the form of a rare battle between Houses Steiner and Davion at the dawn of the Succession Wars. Now little more than another ruined casualty of human avarice, Rocky is little remembered by the Inner Sphere at large&quot;&rdquo;save for the rumors of stolen treasures of the Star League, lost beneath its frozen wastes.&#10;&#10;Touring the Stars volumes consist of a color cover depicting an orbital view of the subject planet, a short history section, a small number of RPG tracks tailored to the planet, a rules annex detailing optional rules for games and scenarios set on the planet, a color world map and a hexed Battleforce 2 map. Each volume averages between 15 and 19 pages in total.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Against the Odds #59&#10;&#10;Blind Faith: The Hussite Wars 1419-1434&#10;&#10;In A.D. 1415, at the Council of Constance, Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague, two church reformers from Bohemia, were burnt at the stake for heresy. In the years that followed, outrage over the execution convulsed civil society in Bohemia, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Now, with Bohemia in rebellion as well as consumed by heresy, the Emperor Sigismund must wage war to both extirpate the heresy and secure his throne.&#10;&#10;The Hussite player's forces are largely Bohemians (i.e. Czech) and others, who, inspired by the teachings of Jan Hus, supported the taking of Communion with both bread and wine, along with other reforms of the Roman Catholic Church. The Hussites are in turn divided into two to three factions: the Calixtenes (Moderates), the Taborites (Radicals), and a later splinter group called Orphans. Moderates preferred to reform the church, while radicals wanted more comprehensive reforms, not only of the church, but of the state and society. Some even rejected church and monarchy. The Imperial player controls those forces under the Emperor and King, Sigismund of Luxembourg. (Note: Sigismund was still only King of the Romans in 1420. Although he was not crowned emperor by the Pope until 1433, he was still the ruler of Germany, in a nominal sense anyway.) They support the execution of Hus and oppose the taking of Communion with both bread and wine. Royal Crusaders, including both the Catholic minority in Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary are also under the direct control of the Imperial player. Papal Crusaders from the Holy Roman Empire (i.e. Germany) are under the indirect control of the Imperial player.&#10;&#10;This bitter and sustained struggle devastated large parts of the empire in a manner not seen again until another religious conflict, the Thirty Years War, took place in roughly the same regions. The Imperial player must destroy the heretics and retake Bohemia before the Pope is forced to make concessions in another church council. The Hussite player, led by the devout, blind and gifted military leader, Jan Zizka, must prevent this and try to begin a Reformation in Europe one hundred years early.&#10;&#10;Designed by Jason Juneau, Blind Faith depicts a classic example of asymmetric warfare, granting both players many options in waging war. The resources and position of the Imperial side are pitted against the skill and morale of the Hussite side. Storming and besieging towns become part of players' strategies for loot and victory. This war was part of a larger sea change in warfare in Europe. Knights and peasants, artillery and threshing flails, clergy and laymen were thrown together in a war the signaled the demise of the feudal system and the universal church.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Throughout what is now known as Arizona, ancient civilizations constructed epic cities, harnessed the powerful and unpredictable rivers to water crops and sustain their communities, and thrived for thousands of years. Eventually, the unpredictability of the seasons, the power of the floods, and the fragility of infrastructure contributed to the abandonment of cities--leaving only ruins to mark these impressive achievements.&#10;&#10;Today, modern technology and sheer hubris have resulted in a new set of settlements that again attempt to thrive in one of the world&rsquo;s harshest and driest climates. With the help of modern engineering marvels like the Hoover Dam and the Central Arizona Project canal, more than 7 million people call Arizona home and over 100,000 more residents move there each year. How long can this continue before, like other civilizations of old, nature asserts its dominance and returns the cities to dust?&#10;&#10;Watershed: Arizona is a turn-based asymmetrical game played in rounds. Each round consists of the following:&#10; 1.    Revealing climate conditions card which modifies the precipitation coming to the watersheds&#10;2.    Revealing and resolving policies that impact watershed conditions, city building and water infrastructure&#10;3.    Simultaneous city building using workers and card playing&#10;4.

    "Description": "New World Order - the game of future - is an fast paced game  with easy set-up and game-play mechanics, but has plenty of strategy and players need to make good choices to win. You take the role of a globalist billionaire and your purpose is to collect different corporations and institutions (society has already collapsed) and by collecting them gain Achievements that are high-tech inventions or some other global development. &#10;When you collect 3 Achievements with the same color you will reach Big Goal which will change our future considerably here on Earth or Space.&#10;&#10;In this boardgame/cardgame hybrid players are collecting Corporation cards from the table and adding them together to maximize their points. For those points they can buy Achievement tiles which are placed on the table like a pyramid. Achievements give Victory points.&#10;&#10;When you collect a three Achievements that match (they have same color on them) then a Great Goal is achieved and player gains extra 500 points Victory Points for it, which is pretty good.&#10;&#10;Every player has 3 actions from which they have to choose 1 on their turn. Game moves clock-wise of course. The first action is to choose same corporation card or cards from the table, second - buy an Achievement for the Corp cards points and third - player can throw away a card or a set to make room for other Corp cards. That is sometimes necessary since the slots for Corp cards are limited (7 slots for 2-3 player game and 5 slots for 4-5 player game).&#10;&#10;These actions go quickly most of the time, but there are moments where player needs to take a look at his cards and tiles he/she has and think what direction he wants go. He could go for high Corp card points (by collecting more cards) to get the expensive Achievement or forgetting about the full set and take a cheaper Achievement tile from the pyramid with a suitable color to get the Bonus points.&#10;&#10;Making things more interesting is that player can&acute;t take any tile you want. He can only take a tile that is free which means it don&acute;t have any other tile on top of it ( not even a on a corner). So there needs to be some tactics how to get to that tile that is unavailable at the moment. It helps if a player got &quot;another action&quot; card, then he can use it to take the two tiles in a row!&#10;&#10;The good thing about the game is players can influence each other games by simple ruining other's plans and taking the cards (or tiles) he/she really needs.&#10;Looking at other players despaired face is always fun! Don&acute;t forget you are a ruthless globalist billionaire :)&#10;&#10;The game ends when all corporation cards are played out and Achievement VP-s ja Great Goals are counted.Who has most VP-s will be the most powerful elite!&#10;&#10;This game is great for people who don&acute;t play games much and are afraid of extensive rules. Gameplay is easily learned in the first 15 minutes. &#10;For experts it could feel a bit of a filler game, but in my opinion it has too many tactical options to be that and the game goes on a bit longer for a filler (60-75 minutes for 3 players).&#10;&#10;Also the game has deep theme and makes you think a bit where are we heading as a society. It is a great conversation starter and very fun to enjoy with a couple of beers! :)&#10;&#10;For more information check out the game site www.newworldordergame.com&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When building traditional jigsaw puzzles, there are several tactics people use. One can look for pieces by their image or their shape.One can build the whole puzzle at the same time or concentrate on building a specific section of it. Organise the pieces before starting to build or dive right into it. Doing the border first, looking for a one of a kind piece and so on.&#10;&#10;In Jigsuw, players need to master not only the different tactics to build a puzzle but also when to change from one to another. They start by setting down the large circular core of the puzzle flat on the table. From there, the players divide the rest of the pieces among themselves, then it&rsquo;s off to the races. They compete to set down the pieces against the starting circle as fast as possible until the puzzle is complete.&#10;&#10;What makes Jigsuw interactive is that players don&rsquo;t just try to build the puzzle faster, but instead they need to try block their opponents. You block their pieces when you set down all surrounding ones before they get the chance to put theirs down. At this moment they cannot play it. The game continues until no one can lay down any pieces. Whoever ends the game with less pieces blocked wins the match.&#10;&#10;",

During the Resolution phase, the table will go down the board, section by section and resolve the effects of each section. The various areas allow players to collect resources, move up an exploration track, deal with effects for each Season, recruit new dwellers to join their village, thus adding them to their deck like a deck builder and finally the last area allows players to grab Flower tiles which provide points in a set-collection style of scoring. The Cleanup phase occurs where the board is cleared of each players dweller cards, each player draws a new hand of dweller cards for the next round, and a new Season card comes in to effect which offers a unique way to score in that round.&#10;&#10;At the end of ten seasons (rounds), the player with the most points will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;It offers a unique blend or modern gamers' favorite mechanics wrapped up with great artwork and a whimsical, fun theme, that is easy to learn and teach.&#10;&#10;",

Knowledge of global maps or experience with puzzles is helpful.&#10;&#10;The winner must get all their tiles onto the map first, and this is best accomplished by retaining tiles for strategic regions, passing or acting on certain opportunities, and, maintaining options to move Ricky the Cat when and where desired.

Can the humans reboot the A.I. or make it to the launch vehicle before the hidden infection achieves Total Contamination.&#10;&#10;In this game all players begin in human form but one of you is secretly an alien infection that has assumed the guise of one of the humans. During play, infected players may infect others. The uninfected humans struggle to expose and defeat the aliens. The aliens attempt to defeat and contaminate the humans. However if too many humans become contaminated, then the aliens will turn on each other.&#10;&#10;The game board represents a small, domed science station on an icy world, with a launch vehicle ready for lift off outside.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game there is only one infected card in play. As play progresses more such cards accumulate and infected characters may end up infecting others by sharing to them. Each turn players choose one or two actions (move, combat or a task). The location on the board will make certain tasks available, such as using the bio analysis drone from the drone hub. Other players whose characters are nearby can help, hinder or watch. Cards are played to show how things turn out. When the dust settles the active player also gets to share cards with someone who helped or hindered.&#10;&#10;If a player is forced to reveal an infection card in their hand face up, then their character changes from human form (blue) to monster form (red). Monster form can perform fewer tasks but can easily attack and infect others.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of these conditions is met:&#10;&#10;     the AI is fully reprogrammed using uninfected cards, or with 2 or 3 infected cards giving an infection win&#10;     the launch vehicle lifts off. If any character on board is infected that becomes an infection win.&#10;     all players are in monster form, which produces an infection win.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a human victory occurs, all uninfected humans win.&#10;&#10;If an infection victory occurs only a limited number of infected players win, as the infection organisms are very competitive.&#10;&#10;",

Inspired by classic war movies as well as historical events, battles are fast paced with roughly 10-20 models on either side.&#10;&#10;Field an elite force of Commandos, SAS, Paratroopers or Rangers to infiltrate the enemy lines under cover of darkness. Recruit SOE spies and local resistance fighters to bolster your chances.&#10;&#10;Launch attacks on radar stations, munition factories, airfields, bridges and rail lines. Sneak past sentries, take them out with silent attacks, or open fire with a devastating ambush. Plant charges to destroy your objective, assassinate a target or grab vital intel, then fight your way to safety before reinforcements arrive.&#10;&#10;Or play as the defenders, carefully setting patrol routes so your sentries can spot raiders in the shadows, utilise guard dogs, officers or even the dreaded Gestapo and make use of informants and intercepted transmissions to thwart the attackers&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;All fighters have a 180 degree field of vision, so cannot see behind without turning. Enemies are not visible in the darkness and must be detected before you can react to them.&#10;&#10;The attackers start each mission creeping forward through the night, aiming to stay covert, timing their movement to sneak behind patrolling sentries. If they are careless, or a sentry turns at the wrong moment, the defenders may detect them and grow suspicious, closing in and eventually raising the alarm.&#10;&#10;At this point the defenders get reinforcements and can open fire on the raiders! But even then, it is vital to locate enemy soldiers - both sides can only attack foes once they've been spotted!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Over three passes through the deck, you will be drafting stacks of cards from a random market, which you&rsquo;ll place into a 3x3 grid. However, each grid cell may only be stacked three cards high - any more and the bottom cards get discarded. Your aim is to create a path of at least 5 increasing cards for each of the four suits.&#10;&#10;Skyway is a solo pattern-building game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. On each turn, the player deals stacks of cards to a market, and then chooses one stack to build inside a 3x3 grid. Over three passes through the deck, the player tries to construct the grid in such a way as to create a five-card sequence in each suit -- a pathway formed by the cards that can snake around or intersect with the other suits' pathways. The catch is that each square on the grid can only hold a stack of cards three high, and placing the one card needed to complete one pathway may very well cause a card crucial to another pathway to be discarded.&#10;&#10;Arranging tiles to create maps is a cornerstone of many great city-building games like Suburbia and Sprawlopolis. However, most games of this genre require more information on each card than a simple rank-and-suit system can provide. Skyway takes its cue from the Decktet game Aucteraden. By allowing a single space to have more than one &ldquo;suit&rdquo; on it, the paths can intersect and weave around each other to create a small, tight puzzle.&#10;&#10;As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.&#10;&#10;",

The act, known as the Defenestration of Prague, marked the beginning of 30 bloody years of warfare&mdash;the Thirty Years War.&#10;&#10;Cuius Regio explores the operational military aspects of this pivotal period in European history and focuses on the maneuvers and battles that shook Europe for three decades.&#10;&#10;The game includes scenarios covering the Bohemian Revolt, the Danish intervention, the Swedish intervention, the French intervention, and a Thirty Years War campaign of 31 turns lasting from 1618 to 1648. Each scenario has a unique character, and the game can be played in as little as an hour and a half (for a short scenario) or can be a multi-session game for the full campaign.&#10;&#10;The turns are divided into two seasons (summer and winter), and each turn has a variable duration that depends on the number of armies activated. In addition, armies can conduct operations several times but become less effective as they accumulate fatigue during each action.&#10;&#10;Combat is an integrated system for field battles and sieges and is resolved by a die roll, modified by each army's leadership, composition, and condition, on a simple Battle Results Table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But beware: Depending on the round, some cards can subtract points!&#10;&#10;The game of Emplumados consists of 3 rounds.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing hands, and whoever played the best card wins the trick. At the end of the round, the points are counted, and there may be more valuable cards, and others that remain, depending on the score that appears on the Habitat Marker.&#10;&#10;After 3 rounds, the total points are tallied and the one with the highest score wins. In case of ties, those players share the victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;Emplumados es un juego de cartas en el que seremos avistadores de aves y es nuestro objetivo conseguir el mejor puntaje. Guard&aacute; tus cartas de diferentes H&aacute;bitats y de m&aacute;s alto valor, esperando el momento oportuno para ganar una mano... &iexcl;Pero cuidado: Dependiendo la ronda, algunas cartas pueden restar puntos!&#10;&#10;La partida de Emplumados consta de 3 rondas.&#10;&#10;Por turnos, los jugadores jugar&aacute;n manos, y quien haya jugado la mejor carta se llevar&aacute; la baza. Al finalizar la ronda, se contabilizan los puntos, pudiendo haber cartas m&aacute;s valiosas, y otras que resten, dependiendo el puntaje que figura en el Marcador de H&aacute;bitat.&#10;&#10;Luego de 3 rondas, se cuentan los puntos totales y aquel con el mayor puntaje gana. En caso de empates, esos jugadores comparten la victoria.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A classic board game playing pantomime or answering trivia questions on Greek and International Cinema. In a round metal box (cinematic bobbin), 2 packages of 100 photos, original dashboard, wooden pawns and dice.&#10;&#10;The board has a similar use as with trivia games, there is no start and end, but it's purpose is to stop over different frames (places) to be asked different questions about the movie between: &quot;title&quot; by doing pantomime or verbally by looking at the picture, &quot;director&quot;, and &quot;actors/actresses&quot;. For that, a pawn and a dice are used giving you the option to select the type of questions that you are most familiar with. One side of the card is showing a scene from the movie, while the other has the title, director and actors/actresses involved.&#10;&#10;When a movie card is played, the player/team has to answer the question to win it. If he/she/they can't reply then the next player has the opportunity to do so, etc. A movie card never returns to the pile.&#10;&#10;The goal is to collect as many movie cards as possible throughout the game. The game ends if all the cards from the deck are finished of when the predefined time has passed. The player with the most cards on hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player has his own track to move on. Movement is determined by two dice. The players decide to use the sum or difference of both dice to move their meeple forward or backward.&#10;&#10;The players have 20 tokens each. If a meeple gets on a space with a &quot;S&quot; the player gets to place 1 or 2 tokens beside that space. On the spaces with a dot he has to place 1 or 2 tokens upside down beside the space.&#10;&#10;Instead of rolling the dice a player may turn one arrow token on the track of another player to cause him to have to use the cedit track. Each player can be caused to use each of his two credit tracks only one time. On the credit track only forward movement is possible and the probability of having to place upside-down tokens is higher.&#10;&#10;If a player has at least placed 12 tokens front-up, he may go to the &quot;Ziel&quot;-space. When all but one players have reached the &quot;Ziel&quot;, the game ends. The player with the most front-up tokens after substracting the number of upside-down tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game was published between 1970 to 1983 based on text on the game board.&#10;&#10;",

Bring back your best childhood memories and watch your kids fall in love with this classic adventure movie.&#10;&#10;The Goonies Game is here to bring you into the thrilling world of the Fratellis, the Bone Piano, the Goon Docks, and more. Work together to discover the rich stuff at the end of the journey! One-Eyed Willy has his hands on the treasure you are searching for. Solve the challenges with the silver doubloon and the copper bones key to unlock the secrets and find the treasure.&#10;&#10;In this game, you work together with the other players to run away from the Fratellis and clear challenges (dice rolls and blind guessing) before they reach you. All 4 groups of Goonies are always in play so these will need to be divided over the number of players. Players play cards on their turn to move (mandatory) and can optionally try challenges (if they're on a challenge space), try to break free from the clutches of the Fratellis (die roll) and play a quote (a one time effect played, unique per card).&#10;&#10;The Goonies need to reach the end of the board to win the game, they will also need to have at least 25 'rich stuff' which are found at the end of the board and mostly comes down to blindly taking the correct ones.&#10;&#10;",
