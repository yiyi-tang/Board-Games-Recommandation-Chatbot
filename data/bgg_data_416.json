    "Description": "This game was published in Finland at the dawn of information technology to show people what it was all about. The game board shows what would have then been a state-of-the art computer room; an input to the left, ie. card readers where the players start from, with lines running via disk storage to the central processor, from which data is sent to the matrix printers at the output on the right. In the middle, as flavour graphic, the operator is inserting a reel of magnetic tape into a magnetic tape data storage unit. The idea is to get your 'program' (set of pawns of the same colour) from your punch card reader through the CPU and into the printers, preferably your own as it nets more points - but pawns may end up in other people's printers too, giving them points, and being the one who ends the game by getting all of their pawns into the printers gives a good bonus too. A 'random colour generator' (turning disc built into the game board) at the CPU tends to mess things up however, as it may send the player on a loop (which the second part of the name of the game, 'luuppi', refers to) within the CPU, or to an opponent's printer. Winner is the player with most points from all parts of their program at game end.&#10;&#10;(The 'Mini' in the name of the game presumably refers to a minicomputer, which was the next step up from the single-user microcomputer just becoming available to the public; large operators such as banks and government agencies would own their own mini-computer to which various users would connect via terminals, using 'computing time' allocated to them.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gone Birding! Video Adventure in Bird Identification is a niche boardgame directed at the birdwatching/birding community that combines board game action with real-world bird identification skills.  It includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;      A two-hour video containing 10 separate games&#10;      18&quot; x 24&quot; fold-out gameboard map of North America with 100 different renowned locations for birdwatching marked on it (National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, etc.)&#10;      51 &quot;Hotspot&quot; cards that match up with the map and describe the location along with a list of several different bird species that can be found there&#10;     48 &quot;Surprise&quot; cards that describe a variety of seasonal events such as a cold front pushing migrating birds in great numbers to a location or other unpredictable events that effect how many birds you might spy, like winning an expensive new spotting telescope.  &#10;     18 &quot;Rare Bird Alert&quot; cards that send you off to a different corner of the map chasing after an especially unusual sighting of a bird species&#10;     1 Novice Helper Card&#10;     40-page Identification Guide -- instructions and answers to each of the 10 different games on the VHS tape&#10;     Trip List Pad  &#10;     Video Trip Field Notes Pad&#10;     6 glass playing pieces&#10;&#10;&#10;There are three different skill levels accommodated by the game: &quot;novice&quot; where, for example, just identifying a bird as a &quot;hawk&quot; is an acceptable answer, &quot;birder&quot; where you must get the exact species named like &quot;Red-tailed Hawk&quot; and &quot;Expert&quot; who must provide not only the species name but also the Latin scientific genera &quot;Red-tailed Hawk, Buteo.&quot;  This lets people of all ages and bird identification abilities play together.&#10;&#10;To play the game, 6 Hotspot cards and 1 Rare-Bird Alert cards are dealt to each player.  The group must decide which season in which to play the game as different seasons produce different numbers of birds at the various Hotspots.    Then each player must plan out her route on the gameboard to visit the 6 Hotspots in their hand.  Players start at the Hotspot closest to their actual real-world location.  Then players watch the first Video Trip.  The video is paused between trips while the players write down their identifications of the 10-12 different species shown on their Video Trip Field Notes pad, in order of the bird's appearance.  Video &quot;hosts&quot; tell you where in the country you are and what season it is before the trips begin, which helps skilled players pare down the possible choices of species.  The video can be replayed if players need more time to work on their IDs.  After everyone is satisfied with their identifications, they read them aloud and one player checks the IDs with the answer section of the instruction booklet.  Players get a point for each correct ID they make.    Then, taking turns clockwise, players move their tokens around the board one Hotspot space at a time and announce the number of species they can add to their Trip List as determined by the card's &quot;species table,&quot; which varies according to season.  If you end up having to visit the same Hotspot more than once in order to get to another Hotspot card, you'll receive a smaller number of points for each successive trip.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, a Surprise card is drawn and read aloud.  It may affect all, some or none of the players.  You can also play a Rare-Bird-Alert card against one of your opponents to send them off their planned course chasing after the bird listed on the card.&#10;&#10;The game ends after six Video Trips and six rounds on the gameboard are played.  Points on players Trip Lists are then tallied and the player with the most number of species on their Trip List wins.&#10;&#10;As a final note, bird taxonomy and nomenclature are constantly changing as scientists learn more about avian species.  This game specifies that their answers are based on the 1983 American Ornithologists' Union &quot;Check-List of North American Birds&quot; which is of course now, in the year 2006, significantly out of date.&#10;&#10;",

At the corner of Alt-Mark Strasse and Thorwaldsenstrasse a small group of desperate Germans converted a large building into an urban fortress. Soon the fortress would be put to the test as an assault detachment from the 220th Guards Rifle Regiment reached the intersection. Finding the building defended with artillery and machine guns 1st Lieutenant Vasili Chernyayev ordered the two 45mm antitank guns supporting his force to fire at the upper level windows to suppress the machine guns while his guardsmen stormed the building. Storm troops, leading the attack with hand grenades, broke into the main level of the house and killed a German crew manning a small artillery piece. Another detachment, with the help of direct mortar fire, captured a nearby building that was supporting the main position. As vicious hand-to-hand fighting broke out in the fortress the Germans launched several counter-attacks supported by tanks and self propelled guns. Intense fighting for this position raged on for the rest of the 25th before the Germans withdrew.&#10;&#10;THE FUHRERS BUNKER is an expansion for Berlin: Red Victory that provides an additional map and 15 more scenarios to expand your Battle of Berlin action to the maximum level of immersion!&#10;&#10;ATS F&Uuml;HRER&rsquo;S BUNKER is a detailed new ATS game that tells the story of the Battle of Berlin with incredible detail.

Each player in his turn has to play up to two cards in front of him or in front of the opponent in order to create problems that must be resolved in five different &quot;areas&quot; (house, Uncle Scrooge's money bin, 313 car, love, daily life).&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into:&#10;- event cards: played by the player in front of himself, used to increase the players score in the related area;&#10;- problem cards: played in front of the opponent, in order to create  a problem for that opponent in the related area;&#10;- solution cards: played in front of the player, used to resolve problems in the related area;&#10;- jella (unlucky) cards (broken mirror): played in front of the opponent, used to create a problem in a chosen area;&#10;- jolly cards (Huey, Dewey and Louie): played in front of the player, used to resolve a problem in a chosen area.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has an event card in the top of each area, or when a player's deck is empty. Each player adds the score of the card on the top of each area; the one who has the greatest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each version is miniature version of each publisher&rsquo;s version of the game. The Pressman Toys version has one player acts as quizmaster while the other players play like the game show. The Tyco edition divides the categories among the players and each will act as contestant and quizmaster for each other during the game (although players could agree to play the game show way). The Outset Media version introduces a third format: Categories for the Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Final Jeopardy  rounds are on separate playing cards. The gamemaster can mix and match them as one sees fit.&#10;&#10;In all versions of the game, a player chooses a category and a dollar amount. The first to give the correct response in the form of a question is credited with the value of the response. However, the jeopardy is that an incorrect response has the values deducted from one&rsquo;s score. Random Daily Doubles during a round allow one player make a wager based on one&rsquo;s own knowledge. Players may wager any or all of their money on one final response in Final Jeopardy! The player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Whenever a players jumps over an opponent's satellite and lands on an unoccupied space, the player captures the satellite. After completing movement of the satellite, the player then adds the same amount of comet pieces (as pips on the die) onto the gameboard following the designated comet path. Players start with 10 satellites, and lose them either to opponents or to the comet if a comet piece is laid on top of it. The game ends when only player has satellites left on the board. Players score their captured satellites and all satellites left on the board, and the player with the most is the winner. The comet wins in the event of a tie.&#10;&#10;From the bottom of the box:&#10;&#10;Halley's Revenge is a light strategy game with the excitement of a high speed chase. The game is for two to four players, ages 8 to adult. The object of the game is to capture as many of your opponent's satellites as possible before the comet takes over the board. Halley's Revenge has no limit to its wrath, it moves at an incredible rate, gobbling up everything in its path. As Halley's comet occupies more and more spaces, satellite movement becomes more and more difficult. Run if you can, but Halley's comet is out for revenge.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to win gourmet awards by composing meals from a variety of mouth-watering dishes.&#10;Each player has his own board, which is in the form of a menu. Dishes include classic haute cuisine and are name in English and French (you'll soon learn the French words and their correct pronunciation). Six cards are dealt to each player, and as a player takes new cards from the deck or does discarded by his opponents he gradually puts together a gourmet meal. To win, however, he must order the right dishes and beverages, and must prevent other players from ordering. Both skill and luck are required. A budget of $100 and other restrictions make the game all the more exciting. Two to six may play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The cardgame your mother should have warned you about!&quot;&#10;&#10;Tank Vixens is a collectible card game based on the comic book of the same name.   This is not your typical CCG, it is definitely adults only.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 106 cards which you use to assemble a play deck with a minimum of 40 cards.  Each player requires their own set of cards.  There are 6 types of cards: Characters, Minions, Tops, Tails, Props and Events.&#10;&#10;Your Characters &quot;attack&quot; by posing, and each Character's posing value can be boosted by equipping them with clothing (Tops, such as &quot;Wet T-Shirt&quot;, Tails, such as &quot;PVC Stockings&quot;, and Props, such as &quot;Cucumbers&quot;).  The sexier the outfit, the more impressive (and thus powerful) their pose.  Event cards (such as &quot;Mom Finds Your Diary&quot;) can be used to boost your own stats or penalize your opponents, and Minion cards (such as &quot;FanBoy&quot;) can be sacrificed to prevent damage or gain bonuses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;300&quot; is game of chance, for ages 9 and up, consisting of four dice: two red &amp; white dice, one blue &amp; white die, and one green &amp; white die. Score sheets, fashioned exactly like bowling scorecards, are used to calculate scores, and series cards are used to record and maintain averages.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a solo affair, or by any number of players. But six is a recommended maximum, to expedite play.&#10;&#10;Just like bowling in a league, the contestants compete for best average between three complete, 10 frame lines of dice bowling.&#10;&#10;The Dice:&#10;&#10;The Red &amp; White dice are to be rolled together first in each frame. If a STRIKE is rolled, regardless of what is on the other die, this is entered on the scoresheet, and the next player proceeds with their turn.&#10;&#10;A STRIKE is rolled when one of the two dice shows the word, or when the two dice show ten total pins (5 each).&#10;&#10;The Green &amp; White die is rolled when any combination of pins showing on the dice, other than a STRIKE or SPLIT are shown. This die is rolled after the initial roll of the Red &amp; White dice in an attempt to pick up the spare. Also, if SPLIT is showing with 3, 4, or 5 pins on the other die (Red &amp; White Dice) then the player enters the number of pins on the other die as an initial score and rolls the Green &amp; White die to pick up the spare.&#10;&#10;The Blue &amp; White die is rolled when SPLIT appears on the initial Red &amp; White dice roll with 1 or 2 pins showing on the other die. The scorekeeper will enter this as 7 or 8 pins for the first roll. (The SPLIT is counted as six pins plus the 1 or 2 other pins). When either of these combinations occur the player must use the Blue &amp; White die in an effort to pick up the spare.&#10;&#10;One Red &amp; White dice is marked SPLIT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The other is marked STRIKE, 1, 2,3, 4, 5. The Green &amp; White die is marked SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, OPEN, OPEN. The Blue &amp; White die is marked OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, SPARE, SPARE.&#10;&#10;About the Publisher/Designer. The game is copyrighted 1979, to J. Messina, and his address of 5310 Otsego St. Duluth, MN 55804 is listed on the outside narrow edge of the box. His phone number was also listed as 1-218-525-6298.&#10;&#10;",

Otila especially, an economist and Member of European Parliament, was known as a kind of &quot;Mr. Trivia&quot; of Finland in the 1980's-1990's when he produced and hosted several popular TV trivia shows and participated as a competitor himself in trivia events held by others.&#10;&#10;This is a trivia game for single players or teams. There are 5 categories of questions, 2500 questions in total. The game enjoys a reputation of being overly difficult as far as trivia games go; something that the designers would probably have enjoyed playing among themselves, but frustratingly challenging to the average trivia player.&#10;&#10;The game was published in two versions; the initial version came in a beige box, but later a revised edition in a red box, based on player feedback, was published; it introduced a d6 and some rules addenda. A companion game, Viisasten kivi was published probably around the same time, aimed at a younger audience and therefore being a bit more casual, and having a difficulty level more in line with trivia games in general.&#10;&#10;",
